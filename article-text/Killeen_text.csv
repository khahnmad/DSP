288716894,2009-11-06 12:00:00,"A media orgy of rumors, speculation and falsehoods",http://www.salon.com/2009/11/06/reporting/,en,True,"language and languages,news and news media,english language",1757,Salon,http://www.salon.com/,"UPDATE -- RESPONSE TO RIGHT-WING BLOG HYSTERIA:  Some borderline-illiteracy and extreme amounts of narcissism made this post last night the focus of the right-wing-blogosphere's screeching-outrage scandal du jour.  All sorts of them are claiming that I unfairly ""smeared"" ""Allahpundit"" and Patterico by using ellipses in this post to make it appear that their commentary on the unfolding Fort Hood shooting was less skeptical than it really was. As I made as clear as the English language permits, my post had nothing to do with criticizing Allahpundit's commentary on the shooting, because -- as I said -- that's a topic too inconsequential to warrant taking my readers' time with.  Instead, I simply used what I said was his ""very thorough"" compilation of major media reports in order to examine and critique media coverage of that event, not Allahpundit's reaction to those reports, and -- in the first paragraph -- I explained how and why I came across his post.  That's why I wrote this: Upon reading that, I went to Hot Air to read what [Allahpundit] had written, and it's actually quite revealing -- not in terms of what it reveals about Hot Air (that topic wouldn't warrant a post) but, rather, what it reveals about major media coverage of these sorts of events.  Allahpundit's post consists of a very thorough, contemporaneous, and -- at times -- appropriately skeptical chronicling of what major media outlets were reporting about the Fort Hood attack, combined with his passing along of much unverified gossip and chatter from Twitter, most of which turned out to be false.  It's worth focusing on what the major media did last night, and one can use the Hot Air compilation to examine that. . . . Here are excerpts from Allahpundit's compilation, virtually all of which -- except where indicated -- came from large news outlets: Is there any way to make that clearer within the confines of the English language?  My topic was what and how the major media was reporting on this event, not what Allahpundit was or wasn't saying about those reports.  I didn't write a critical word about Allahpundit -- let alone about Patterico -- both of whom are now screaming that I ""smeared"" them.  In fact, to the extent I commented on Allahpundit's commentary at all, it was to state that ""at times"" he was ""appropriately skeptical.""  The idea that I would explicitly praise him at the start of the post for being ""appropriately skeptical"" while simultaneously using ellipses with the intent to conceal his skepticism is so self-evidently dumb that it's hard to believe anyone who can turn on a computer would express that thought. There were times Allahpundit made clear that one should take certain reports he passing along with a grain of salt -- just as I explicitly said he did -- but there were other times when he passed on inaccurate media claims without any such provisos (""Whether there are two shooters or three seems to be in dispute at the moment, but there’s certainly more than one"").  But the level of Allahpundit's skepticism while he watches TV isn't of the slightest interest to me nor, I presume, to my readers, which is why that wasn't what I was writing about.  I made clear that he was sometimes skeptical, but used ellispses to eliminate most of his reactions and commentary because his reactions were irrelevant to my post.  Eliminating quotations that are extraneous and irrelevant to the topic at hand is why ellipses exist. The entire post was a discussion of the journalistic responsibility of major media outlets reporting on events like this -- not about what right-wing bloggers who copy down what they are hearing on TV should or shouldn't do (the post's title:  ""A media orgy of rumors, speculation and falsehoods"").  I simply used Allahpundit's thorough stenographic recording of what he was hearing as a means of examining and critiquing what major media outlets reported.  I made explicitly clear that I wasn't writing about right-wing bloggers -- both because I presume my readers at this point don't care nearly enough about them to justify taking their time with posts about them and because writing about right-wing bloggers inevitably leads to these sorts of petty and worthless outbursts of accusatory, self-absorbed petulance (""he's smearing us!!!!"") that then force one to waste more reader time by responding. That said, passing on unfounded and baseless rumors can be damaging, irresponsible and misleading -- even if one points out that such rumors should be taken with ""a grain of salt.""  That Allahpundit at times (though not always) included such caveats doesn't negate the fact that the media's initial reporting of this event -- as reflected by Hot Air's dutiful passing on of their reports -- would have left one more uninformed and misled than informed.  That -- and not the behavior of right-wing blogs -- was the topic of the post.  It takes some toxic combination of reading comprehension failures combined with an ""everything-is-about-me"" narcissistic complex to read my analysis of media reporting on Fort Hood and conclude:  ""Oh my God, he's smearing us right-wing bloggers by telling his readers that we didn't provide enough caution when passing on what we heard from the media.""  That's particularly true when, to the extent I mentioned right-wing blogger reaction at all, it was to state explicitly that they were ""appropriately skeptical"" at times of what they were hearing -- the very point they're now screeching I ""dishonestly"" tried to hide. * * * * * Last night, right-wing blogger (and law professor) Glenn Reynolds promoted this media analysis from right-wing blogger (and Los Angeles Assistant District Attorney) Patterico regarding coverage of the Fort Hood shootings.  Patterico wrote:  ""Whenever there is breaking news, it’s good to keep a few things in mind: . . . Always follow Allahpundit"" -- referring to one of the two bloggers at Michelle Malkin's Hot Air site. Upon reading that, I went to Hot Air to read what he had written, and it's actually quite revealing -- not in terms of what it reveals about Hot Air (that topic wouldn't warrant a post) but, rather, what it reveals about major media coverage of these sorts of events.  Allahpundit's post consists of a very thorough, contemporaneous, and -- at times -- appropriately skeptical chronicling of what major media outlets were reporting about the Fort Hood attack, combined with his passing along of much unverified gossip and chatter from Twitter, most of which turned out to be false. It's worth focusing on what the major media did last night, and one can use the Hot Air compilation to examine that.  I understand that in the early stages of significant and complex news stories, it's to be expected that journalists will have incomplete and even inaccurate information.  It's unreasonable to expect them to avoid errors entirely.  The inherently confusing nature of a mass shooting like this, combined with the need to rely on second-hand or otherwise unreliable sources (including, sometimes, official ones), will mean that even conscientious reporters end up with inaccurate information in cases like this.  That's all understandable and inevitable. But shouldn't there be some standards governing what gets reported and what is held back?  Particularly in a case like this -- which, for obvious reasons, has the potential to be quite inflammatory on a number of levels -- having the major media ""report"" completely false assertions as fact can be quite harmful.  It's often the case that perceptions and judgments about stories like this solidify in the first few hours after one hears about it.  The impact of subsequent corrections and clarifications pale in comparison to the impressions that are first formed.  Despite that, one false and contradictory claim after the next was disseminated last night by the establishment media with regard to the core facts of the attack.  Here are excerpts from Allahpundit's compilation, virtually all of which -- except where indicated -- came from large news outlets: Number of shooters The fact that at least three gunmen are involved already has Shuster and Miklaszewski mentioning similarities to the Fort Dix Six plot on MSNBC . . . two of the gunmen are still at large and one has fired shots at the SWAT team on the scene . . . . New details from CNN: One gunman ""neutralized,"" one ""cornered,"" no word on the third. . . . Whether there are two shooters or three seems to be in dispute at the moment, but there’s certainly more than one:  The second shooting on the base evidently occurred at a theater. . . . Fox News says there are reports that the men were dressed in fatigues. . . . MSNBC TV says two shooters are in custody now. . . . it sounds like both shooters are military . . . According to MSNBC, there were three shooters. . . In case you're wondering whether the other two soldiers in custody were actual accomplices or just being questioned because they knew Hasan, Rick Perry just said at the presser he’s holding that all three were shooters. . . . Hearing rumblings on Twitter right now that Perry was wrong and that the two other ""suspects"" have now been released. Was Hasan, in fact, a lone gunman? . . . . According to the general conducting the briefing going on right now, he appears to be a lone gunman. The fate of the shooter One of the shooters is dead. . . One is dead, two more are in custody. Has there ever been a case of ""battle stress"" that involved a conspiracy by multiple people? . . . So poor and fragmented have the early media reports about this been that only now, after 9 p.m. ET, do we learn that … Hasan’s still alive. He’s in stable condition. The weapons used M-16s involved: . . . From the local Fox affiliate, how it all went down. Evidently McClatchy’s report of M-16s was wrong: The shooter's background According to Brian Ross at ABC, Hasan was a convert to Islam. . . . Contra Brian Ross, the AP says it’s unclear what Hasan’s religion was or whether he was a convert. . . . Apparently, one of Hasan’s cousins just told Shep that he’s always been Muslim, not a recent convert. . . . I’m hearing on Twitter that Fox interviewed one of his neighbors within the last half-hour or so and that the neighbor claims Hasan was handing out Korans just this morning. Does anyone have video? . . . . ""Brenda Price of KUSJ reported to Greta at 10:33: 'also, the latest I am hearing, this morning, apparently according to his neighbors, he was walking around kind of giving out his possessions, giving away his furniture, handing out the Koran…'"" . . .: Evidently CNN is airing surveillance footage from a convenience store camera taken this just morning showing Hasan in a traditional Muslim cap and robe. . . ""A former neighbor of Hasan’s in Silver Spring, Md. told Fox News he lived there for two years with his brother and had the word ‘Allah’ on the door."" Miscellaneous claims Good lord — there’s a report from BNO News on Twitter that new shooting is being heard on the base. . . . For what it’s worth, an eyewitness report of Arabic being shouted during the attack: . . .Federal law enforcement officials say the suspected Fort Hood, Texas, shooter had come to their attention at least six months ago because of Internet postings that discussed suicide bombings and other threats. . . . The $64,000 questions: What was he doing at Fort Hood among the population if he thought suicide bombers were heroes? Isn't it clear that anyone following all of that as it unfolded would have been more misinformed than informed? The New York Times' Robert Mackey did an equally comprehensive job of live-blogging the media reports, and his contemporaneous compilation reflects many of these same glaring errors in the coverage:  ""CNN reports that two military sources say that the second gunman at Fort Hood is 'cornered' . . . Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison told Fox 4 News in Texas that one shooter was in custody and 'another is still at large' . . . CNN’s Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr reports that 12 people have been killed and up to 30 wounded. One of the dead is said to have been one of the gunmen. . . . Lt. Gen. Robert Cone, just revealed that earlier reports that the suspected gunman, Major Nidal Hasan, had been killed were incorrect. Major Hasan was wounded but remains alive."" Perhaps most irresponsible of all is the unverified claim that Hasan had written on the Internet in defense of suicide attacks by Muslims, even though the origins of those writings are entirely unverified.  Similarly, certain news organizations -- like NPR -- used anonymous sources to disseminate inflammatory claims about Hasan's prior troubles allegedly grounded in activism on behalf of Islam.  Much of this may turn out to be true once verified, or it may not be, but all of the conflicting, unverified claims flying around last night enabled many people to exploit the ""facts"" they selected in order to create whatever storyline that suited them and their political preconceptions -- and many, of course, took vigorous advantage of that opportunity. I'm obviously ambivalent about the issues of media responsibility raised by all of this.  It's difficult to know exactly how the competing interests should be balanced -- between disclosing what one has heard in an evolving news story and ensuring some minimal level of reliability and accuracy.  But whatever else is true, news outlets -- driven by competitive pressures in the age of instant ""reporting"" -- don't really seem to recognize the need for this balance at all.  They're willing to pass on anything they hear without regard to reliability -- to the point where I automatically and studiously ignore the first day or so of news coverage on these events because, given how these things are ""reported,"" it's simply impossible to know what is true and what isn't.  In fact, following initial media coverage on these stories is more likely to leave one misled and confused than informed.  Conversely, the best way to stay informed is to ignore it all -- or at least treat it all with extreme skepticism -- for at least a day. The problem, though, is that huge numbers of people aren't ignoring it.  They're paying close attention -- and they're paying the closest attention, and forming their long-term views, in the initial stages of the reporting.  Many people will lose their interest once the drama dissolves -- i.e., once the actual facts emerge.  Put another way, a large segment of conventional wisdom solidifies based on misleading and patently false claims coming from major media outlets.  I don't know exactly how to define what the balance should be, but particularly for politically explosive stories like this one, it seems clear that media outlets ought to exercise far more restraint and fact-checking rigor than they do.  As it is, it's an orgy of rumor-mongering, speculation and falsehoods that play a very significant role in shaping public perceptions and enabling all sorts of ill-intentioned exploitation.

          / CBS Updated at 12:12 p.m. Eastern time Responding to a report that the Army psychiatrist suspected in last week's Fort Hood shootings had tried to contact people within al Qaeda - and that government intelligence agencies knew about it and are refusing to brief Congress on it - a U.S. intelligence official told CBS News that the CIA isn't withholding information from Congress. ""There's no sign at this point that the CIA had collected information relevant to this case and then simply sat on it,"" the official told CBS News Justice and Homeland Security correspondent Bob Orr. ABC News published the report Monday morning with details that the CIA was refusing to brief the congressional committees charged with overseeing the intelligence agencies, a senior lawmaker told ABC. Orr reports that the CIA denies any allegation that the agency is keeping Congress in the dark. ""This is a law enforcement investigation, in which other agencies - not the CIA - have the lead,"" CIA spokesman George Little told Orr. ""Any suggestion that the CIA refused to brief Congress is flat wrong."" The report comes a day after lawmakers discussed the possibility of launching a congressional investigation into the worst mass shooting at a military facility in the United States last week that left 13 dead and 29 wounded. Special Section: Tragedy at Fort Hood In its report, ABC said it was unclear whether the American intelligence community alerted the Army about suspected shooter Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, who attended the same mosque as two of the 9/11 hijackers. Hasan is in critical condition at an Army hospital and breathing on his own. More Coverage of the Tragedy at Fort Hood: Hasan Liked Strippers, Club Manager Says  Did Army Miss Signs of Hasan's Extremism? Fort Hood Reflects, but Work Carries OnHasan Computer Shows No Terror TiesList of Fort Hood Dead, Wounded Previous reports  allegedly posted by Hasan six months ago. Congress has asked CIA Director Leon Panetta and National Intelligence Director Dennis Blair ""to preserve"" all documents and intelligence files related to Hasan, the senior lawmaker told ABC. The Army and the FBI are conducting their own investigations into the Fort Hood shootings. Congressional Democrats on the House and Senate Armed Services Committees said on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" Sunday that they  before considering launching their own investigation.

Gen. Robert Cone spoke of soldiers who were present and confirmed that some had ripped their uniforms off to staunch the bleeding of the wounded. The alleged shooter is in military custody tonight.  We know almost nothing about him, save his name and rank.  Other details are trickling out. President Obama has addressed the nation about this shocking event, which appears to be the largest mass-shooting at an American military base in history.  And some of our fellow kossacks, who have family members or friends at Fort Hood have contributed sad diaries. I am, as I know this community is, both sickened and disheartened by the horrible news today from Fort Hood.  Though we do not know why the alleged shooter did what he did, we have, here, read other diaries about the horrors of PTSD ~ including this heartbreaking diary from last night by BentLiberal,  which should have been on the Recommended List. We know that the alleged shooter was a psychiatrist.  We can assume that he has treated soldiers who had psychiactric problems resulting from their deployments.  We know he was scheduled to be deployed to Iraq later this month.  Other than that, we do not know much of anything at all. Despite this thin knowledge, members of our community (this community) took it upon themselves to post irresponsible (and, in some cases, hateful and bigoted) comments about the shooter and his supposed motives.  I’ll not link to these.  You can view them in the putrid swamp of Hidden Comments.  I will not link to stupidity or bigotry. There was, of course, the usual hate-mongering at Free Republic today.  One post there even incited a bunch of Freepers to post a link (with photos) of a Facebook member who had a name similar to that of the alleged shooter.   A Facebook member who also lived in Texas.  The thing was, this Facebook member lived in Lubbock, which is 350 miles from Killeen, where the shootings took place.  Anyone with a brain (or access to Mapquest, or a basic knowledge of Texas geography) would have been able to figure out that this person could not possibly have been the person who opened his gun today at Fort Hood.  But that didn’t stop the Freepers from posting hateful messages about him or speculating about whether his Facebook page would be ""scrubbed"" to protect the President.  And though I will not link to this despicable piece of irresponsible trash either, I did print it all out, in case these lunatics inspire some other lunatic to do something even more irresponsible. We are better than this.  We are a reality-based community.  We believe in facts and evidence and the rule of law. We do not (or should not) post irresponsible ""speculations"" about who the shooter was or why he did what he did or what is happening tonight at Fort Hood.  We certainly do not leap to conclusions about the motivations of someone who may have an ethnicity or religion different from many (though certainly not all) of us who write here. Those comments I referred to should never have been posted in the first place.  We are better than this.  And amidst all the horrors of today, we should have been."

Logan Burnette arrived at Fort Hood, Texas, a week ago Wednesday to prepare for an upcoming tour of Iraq. The following day, he, like all deploying soldiers, reported to the ""ready room"" on post to fill out final paperwork. However, what was to be another day of the mundane erupted into hell on Earth. Burnette heard shots, though that's a sound to which soldiers grow accustomed. He had been hearing blanks for many months of training. But on November 5 at Fort Hood, he quickly understood that something was terribly wrong when he saw the blood -- crimson everywhere. ""Seeing bullet wounds in the back of a friend's head, seeing friends grabbing their arms, and blood just everywhere. It's a pretty hard thing to see,"" Burnette recalled. ""And not having any way to defend yourself."" The gunman had been in the room for a while and had perfectly blended in with his Army combat uniform, his gold major rank emblazoned on his chest. No one had reason to pay him heed, Burnette said. When the madness began, the gunman popped up like a target at a shooting range. He just stood up and started firing methodically and with precision. He reloaded. And fired. Reloaded. And fired again. ""He was very swift, very tactical,"" said Burnette, sitting in a wheelchair at the Metroplex Adventist Hospital near Fort Hood, his left arm and hand bandaged. The mass shooting last week was the deadliest ever on a U.S. military base. Twelve soldiers and one civilian were killed; more than 40 others were wounded. Fifteen soldiers remained hospitalized on Wednesday, four in intensive care, according to Fort Hood spokesman Col. James Rossi. They were victims of a soldier who turned on his own, authorities say. Burnette saw the laser sights on the gunman's weapon. The shooter looked serious, intent. He screamed at the top of his lungs, ""Allahu akbar,"" which means 'God is great' in Arabic. Burnette dropped to the floor, hugging the ground for dear life. His mind was spinning. What insanity was this? ""Once I saw the blood, I realized I had to move,"" he said. ""I had to get out of there."" Burnette began to stand up and noticed the gunman was pointing in his direction. He picked up a folding table next to him -- it was the heaviest object he could see -- and hurled it toward the shooter. He knew it would draw the gunman's attention and divert his line of sight from others. Burnette said he wasn't trying to play a hero. ""There are guys overseas doing more than what I did,"" he said. ""I just happened to be at a certain place at a certain time in the world and hopefully I made a difference."" But that's when he got hit. He took a round that pierced his hip on the left side and tore through his abdomen. ""After the hit, I fell down, not even realizing I had been hit,"" he said. ""As I tried to get back up, I was shot in the elbow on the left arm and ... the knuckle on the left pinky finger."" He was like a wounded animal desperate to escape the hunter's aim. ""He wanted to kill all of us,"" Burnette said. ""We were all unarmed."" Burnette's gut felt like a knife slicing through it. He couldn't feel his leg. His left arm was numb, too. He stared at it and thought of those dummy arms that people buy at Halloween. ""Oh my God,"" he thought. ""This guy shot me."" Burnette began moving with every ounce of strength he could muster and hid in a nearby cubicle. The gunman had started moving to the other side of the building, reloading and shooting. Reloading and shooting. Burnette knew he had to get out of that building. ""As I started to run, I fell again, not realizing I couldn't use my left leg."" After falling, Burnette said, he ""threw all of my body weight ... towards that door as hard and as fast as possible."" ""Once I hit that front door, I began to low crawl, about five meters up a hill just, you know, pushing my body forward with everything I had,"" he said. A staff sergeant grabbed him by his uniform collar and dragged him into an office and locked the door. ""Everything is going to be all right,"" the sergeant told him, as he began administering first aid. Burnette said he doesn't know the sergeant's name, but he will recognize him instantly if their paths ever cross again. ""Our Father who art in heaven ... hallowed be thy name."" Burnette, a practicing Catholic, lie on the ground, repeating the prayer over and over again. He didn't know whether he would see his wife again. A week later, Burnette has undergone two operations and still has a bullet lodged in his right hip. On Wednesday, he was making his way to the Army's Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, for further treatment. He knows that's where Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, the accused shooter, is also being treated. ""I can't really think about it,"" Burnette said. ""I have a lot of faith in our military, our judicial system -- and God."" Soldiers are taught from day one that you help the wounded, even when they are enemies in combat, even the guy who shot you. ""Don't get me wrong,"" he said, ""Everything in your heart wants to [unleash] anger at this person, but we have to trust that our system works somehow. ""By no means am I happy that he is in better shape than a lot of my comrades,"" Burnette said about the suspect. ""But I'm not here to play God, either."" Ultimately, Burnette said, he is sorry for a man who feels the need to execute unarmed personnel, his comrades, in the name of God. Does he pity the Fort Hood shooter? ""Yeah,"" he said, pausing. ""To an extent."" CNN's Sanjay Gupta and Danielle Dellorto contributed to this report."
951676826,2009-11-08 04:18:56,All Afghan War Options by Obama Aides Said to Call for More Troops,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/world/asia/08troops.html?_r=2&ref=world,en,False,"politics and government,united states politics and government,armament, defense and military forces,terrorism,united states armament and defense,united states international relations,international relations",1,New York Times,http://nytimes.com,"Advertisement Supported by By Peter Baker and Helene Cooper WASHINGTON  Advisers to President Obama are preparing three options for escalating the war effort in Afghanistan, all of them calling for more American troops, as he moves closer to a decision on the way forward in the eight-year-old war, officials said Saturday. The options include Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal’s request for roughly another 40,000 troops; a middle scenario sending about 30,000 more troops; and a lower alternative involving 20,000 to 25,000 reinforcements, according to the officials, who insisted on anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Officials hope to present the options to Mr. Obama this week before he leaves on a trip to Asia. While some civilian and military officials believe Mr. Obama is seeking a middle ground in the debate over Afghanistan, aides denied he has made any decision or is leaning toward any of the options. Still, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates appears to be supportive of the middle option, some officials said, and his view is thought to be pivotal because of Mr. Obama’s respect for him and his status as a holdover from a Republican administration. The three options define the contours of a debate that has played out in public for more than two months. General McChrystal, the top American and allied commander in Afghanistan, and his advocates argue the war cannot be won without a major infusion of forces to protect the population and ultimately turn it against the Taliban. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and others oppose a buildup in a war they believe cannot be won through conventional means and that diverts attention from Pakistan, where Al Qaeda is primarily located. There are currently 68,000 American troops in Afghanistan. The range of alternatives under discussion suggests that the president has rejected the extremes on either end. He appears inclined to send more troops  with the only question being how many  and seems not to be seriously considering General McChrystal’s highest proposal of 80,000 more troops. Still, any of the options on the table would generate opposition on either the political left or right. If he approves anything less than General McChrystal’s 40,000-troop option, Mr. Obama could face criticism from Republicans and some moderate Democrats, while any troop increase would provoke anger among liberals and others who have increasingly soured on the war. McClatchy Newspapers reported Saturday that Mr. Obama is nearing a decision to approve the middle option being drawn up by advisers, citing unnamed administration and military officials. White House officials denied Mr. Obama has made a decision or favors any of the options at this point, noting that they have not been formally presented to him. But administration officials confirmed that the 30,000-troop plan is under consideration. If he were to go with that, Mr. Obama could try to make up the difference in what General McChrystal wants by pressing NATO allies to do more. Britain has already agreed to send another 500 troops, and four senior American officials flew to Brussels last week to brief representatives of other nations that have forces in Afghanistan, to solicit their views and build support for more help. There could be variations within each of the three options as well that could increase or decrease the number of troops needed, officials said. Troop levels would hinge, for instance, on the administration’s assessment of how many former Taliban fighters can be peacefully reintegrated into Afghan society and to what extent improved governance at various levels could prevent disaffected Afghans from siding with insurgents. Officials are focusing on an approach predicated on the belief that the Taliban cannot be entirely eradicated in Afghanistan and that Al Qaeda is the real threat to American interests. The main goal for American forces, then, would be to protect the 10 most important population centers in Afghanistan and keep the Taliban isolated long enough to train Afghan security forces to take over the fight.

The Army, in turn, put him through college and then medical school, where he trained to be a psychiatrist. But Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, the 39-year-old man accused of Thursday’s mass shooting at Fort Hood, Tex., began having second thoughts about a military career a few years ago after other soldiers harassed him for being a Muslim, he told relatives in Virginia. He had also more recently expressed deep concerns about being sent to Iraq or Afghanistan. Having counseled scores of returning soldiers with post-traumatic stress disorder, first at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington and more recently at Fort Hood, he knew all too well the terrifying realities of war, said a cousin, Nader Hasan. “He was mortified by the idea of having to deploy,” Mr. Hasan said. “He had people telling him on a daily basis the horrors they saw over there.” The Federal Bureau of Investigation earlier became aware of Internet postings by a man calling himself Nidal Hasan, a law enforcement official said. The postings discussed suicide bombings favorably, but the investigators were not clear whether the writer was Major Hasan. In one posting on the Web site Scribd, a man named Nidal Hasan compared the heroism of a soldier who throws himself on a grenade to protect fellow soldiers to suicide bombers who sacrifice themselves to protect Muslims. “If one suicide bomber can kill 100 enemy soldiers because they were caught off guard that would be considered a strategic victory,” the man wrote. It could not be confirmed, however, that the writer was Major Hasan. Major Hasan was wounded and taken into custody by the Fort Hood police after the shooting rampage, in which 12 people were killed and at least 31 others were wounded. Though Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas reported that Major Hasan was to be deployed this month, that could not be confirmed with the Army on Thursday night. Nader Hasan said his cousin never mentioned in recent phone calls to Virginia that he was going to be deployed, and he said the family was shocked when it heard the news on television on Thursday afternoon. “He was doing everything he could to avoid that,” Mr. Hasan said. “He wanted to do whatever he could within the rules to make sure he wouldn’t go over.” Some years ago, that included retaining a lawyer and asking if he could get out of the Army before his contract was up, because of the harassment he had received as a Muslim. But Nader Hasan said the lawyer had told his cousin that even if he paid the Army back for his education, it would not allow him to leave before his commitment was up. “I think he gave up that fight and was just doing his time,” Mr. Hasan said. Nader Hasan said his cousin’s parents had both been American citizens who owned businesses, including restaurants and a store, in Roanoke, Va. He declined to confirm reports that they were Jordanian but said the parents, who are both dead, had immigrated from a small town near Jerusalem many years ago. His mother’s obituary, in The Roanoke Times in 2001, said she was born in Palestine in 1952. It described her as a restaurant owner “known for her ability to keep sometimes rowdy customers out of trouble and always had a warm meal for someone who otherwise would not have anything to eat that evening.” Records show that Major Hasan received an undergraduate degree at Virginia Tech and a medical degree at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md. He did a residency at Walter Reed Medical Center and worked there for years before a transfer to the Darnall Army Medical Center at Fort Hood this year. Major Hasan had two brothers, one in Virginia and another in Jerusalem, his cousin said. The family, by and large, prospered in the United States, Mr. Hasan said. The former imam at a Silver Spring, Md., mosque where Major Hasan worshiped for about 10 years described him as proud of his work in the Army and “very serious about his religion.” The former imam, Faizul Khan, said that Major Hasan had wanted to marry an equally religious woman but that his efforts to find one had failed. “He wanted a woman who prayed five times a day and wears a hijab, and maybe the women he met were not complying with those things,” the former imam said. Mr. Hasan, 40, a lawyer in Virginia, described his cousin as a respectful, hard-working man who had devoted himself to his parents and his career. Mr. Hasan said his cousin became more devout after his parents died in 1998 and 2001. “His parents didn’t want him to go into the military,” Mr. Hasan said. “He said, ‘No, I was born and raised here, I’m going to do my duty to the country.’ ” Advertisement"

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. An Army psychiatrist who reportedly feared an impending war deployment is in custody as the sole suspect in a shooting rampage at Fort Hood in Texas that left 12 dead and 31 wounded, an Army official said Thursday night. The gunman, Major Nidal Malik Hasan, first said to have been killed, was wounded but alive in a hospital under military guard, said Lt. Gen. Bob Cone at Fort Hood. He was shot four times, and was on a ventilator and unconscious, according to military officials. ""I would say his death is not imminent,"" Cone said. Two other soldiers who were taken into custody for questioning were later released, Cone said. A female first responder who shot at Hasan also survived, contrary to earlier reports that she had died. The rampage was believed to be the deadliest at a U.S. military base in history. Soldiers rushed to treat their injured colleagues by ripping their uniforms into makeshift bandages. Officials have not ruled out the possibility that some casualties may have been victims of ""friendly fire,"" shot by authorities amid the mayhem and confusion at the scene, said a senior U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss matters that were under investigation. Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison said generals at Fort Hood told her that Hasan, a Virginia native and a Muslim, was about to deploy overseas. Retired Col. Terry Lee, who said he had worked with Hasan, told Fox News he was being sent to Afghanistan. SLIDESHOW: Deadly rampage at Fort Hood Army Base Lee said Hasan had hoped Obama would pull troops out of Afghanistan and Iraq and got into frequent arguments with others in the military who supported the wars. Before Thursday's shooting, Hasan reportedly gave away all of his furniture along with copies of the Koran to neighbors, KXXV-TV reported. Video from the scene showed police patrolling the area with handguns and rifles, ducking behind buildings for cover. Sirens could be heard wailing while a woman's voice on a public-address system urged people to take cover. ""I was confused and just shocked,"" said Spc. Jerry Richard, 27, who works at the center but was not on duty during the shooting. ""Overseas you are ready for it. But here you can't even defend yourself."" Soldiers at Fort Hood don't carry weapons unless they are doing training exercises. Federal law enforcement officials told the Associated Press that Hasan had come to their attention at least six months ago because of Internet postings that discussed homicide bombings and other threats. The officials said they are still trying to confirm that he was the author. One of the Web postings that authorities reviewed is a blog that equates homicide bombers with a soldier throwing himself on a grenade to save the lives of his comrades. ""To say that this soldier committed suicide is inappropriate. Its more appropriate to say he is a brave hero that sacrificed his life for a more noble cause,"" said the Internet posting. ""Scholars have paralled (sic) this to suicide bombers whose intention, by sacrificing their lives, is to help save Muslims by killing enemy soldiers."" They say an official investigation was not opened. Hasan was working with soldiers at Darnall Army Medical Center on Fort Hood after being transferred in July from Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where he had worked for six years before recently receiving a poor review. Cone said the shooter used two guns, including a semi-automatic weapon. He added there was no indication they were military weapons. The shooting took place 1:30 p.m. Thursday at the post's Soldier Readiness Center, where soldiers undergo medical screening before being deployed or after returning from overseas. ""We have a terrible, tragic situation here,"" said Cone. ""Soldiers, family members and the civilians that work here are absolutely devastated."" Cone said the injuries ""vary significantly"" among the victims wounded in the shooting. The shooter's cousin, Nader Hasan, told Fox News that their family is in shock. ""We are trying to make sense of all this,"" Nader Hasan said. ""He wasn't even someone who enjoyed going to the firing range."" He said his cousin, who was born and raised in Virginia and graduated from Virginia Tech University, turned against the wars after hearing the stories of those who came back from Afghanistan and Iraq. Nader Hasan said his cousin, who was raised a Muslim, wanted to go into the military against his parent's wishes — but was taunted by others after the terror attacks of Sept. 11. A former neighbor of Hasan's in Silver Spring, Md., told Fox News he lived there for two years with his brother and had the word ""Allah"" on the door. She said the FBI interviewed her Thursday afternoon, adding she used to see a woman and a 3-year-old girl coming and going. Authorities provided little information Thursday about the victims of the rampage at Fort Hood. George Stratton's son, George Stratton III, was five feet away from the shooter at the Soldier Readiness Center and suffered a gunshot wound to his left shoulder. ""He said he was there doing medical stuff and all of a sudden someone came through the door, walked behind the desk and just started shooting,"" Stratton told FoxNews.com. He said about 15 rounds went off and people started dropping to the floor. ""He peaked up over the desk and that's when he was shot in the shoulder, and he just went down again. He said he saw one of his NCOs get badly shot,"" Stratton told FoxNews.com after talking to his son in the hospital. ""After he got shot he told me, 'Dad, I got up, held my arm and took off running.'"" Stratton said his son was expected to be deployed to Afghanistan in January after going to basic training exactly a year ago. ""It's pretty hard to believe something like this happened,"" Stratton told FoxNews.com. ""I think he's probably had his fill of war already."" President Obama called the shooting a ""horrific outburst of violence"" on members of the nation's armed forces. ""It is horrifying that they should come under fire at an army base on American soil,"" he said Obama said his thoughts and prayers are with the wounded and families of the fallen. A spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations said they don't know anything about Hasan, and condemned the shooting at Fort Hood. The group issued a statement calling the shooting as a ""cowardly attack."" They say no political or religious ideology could ever justify or excuse such violence. The base and area schools were on lockdown after the mass shooting, and all those on the Army post were asked to gather for a head count, thought the lockdown was lifted Thursday night. Covering 339 square miles, Fort Hood is the largest active duty armored post in the United States. Home to about 52,000 troops as of earlier this year, the sprawling base is located halfway between Austin and Waco. FoxNews.com's Michelle Maskaly and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

603482615,2009-11-09 14:08:00,Fort Hood soldier: I 'started doing what I was trained to do' - CNN.com,http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/11/09/fort.hood.foster/,en,False,"politics and government,united states politics and government,armament, defense and military forces,terrorism,crime and criminals,united states armament and defense,united states international relations,international relations",1095,CNN,http://www.cnn.com/,"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- Pvt. Joseph Foster was filling out routine paperwork for his upcoming deployment to Afghanistan on Thursday when he heard a shout quickly followed by a burst of gunfire from just a few feet away. ""I was sitting in about the second row back when the assailant stood up and yelled 'Allahu akbar' in Arabic and he opened fire,"" Foster said Monday on CNN's ""American Morning."" Foster, 21, did not forget his basic training, which may have saved his life and the lives of others. ""[I] got down on the floor, moved to cover. One soldier had peeked his head around the cubicle I was hiding in ... and I pulled him in,"" Foster said. Foster realized he had been shot in the hip but was too consumed by adrenaline to think about his injury. ""Another soldier had come in as soon as the assailant had moved away from us,"" he said. ""Those two got up and got out, and I got out shortly behind him."" Once outside, Foster said, he hid behind a military shipping container ""and started doing what I was trained to do."" ""[I] started helping get people into the next building and get them under cover,"" he said. Despite his injury, Foster, who has a wife and two young children, said he still plans to deploy to Afghanistan in January. ""I'm still a soldier day in and day out,"" he said. ""I'll do my job."" Authorities are trying to figure out what prompted the gunman to begin shooting at Fort Hood Army Post, killing 13 people and wounding 42. Fifteen soldiers are still hospitalized, including eight patients in intensive care, Fort Hood commander Lt. Gen. Robert Cone said Monday. Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, a 39-year-old licensed Army psychiatrist who worked at a hospital on the post, is the suspected shooter. He was shot several times, ending the attack, and is now conscious and talking, a spokesman at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio said Monday. It is unclear if Army investigators have spoken to Hasan. The intense investigation into the mass shooting remains largely shrouded in silence. Army officials have voiced concern about jumping to any conclusions about the motive, warning about a possible backlash against Muslim soldiers. Several bystanders, like Foster, reported Hasan shouted ""Allahu akbar,"" Arabic for ""God is great,"" which terrorists have used as a battle cry. The Army leadership at Fort Hood will ""take a very hard look at ourselves and look at anything that might have been done to have prevented this,"" Cone said Monday. ""Hasan was a soldier, and we have other soldiers ... that might have some of the same stress and indicators that he has,"" Cone said. ""We have to look across our entire formation, not just in a medical community, but really look hard to our right and left. That's the responsibility for everybody, from the top to the bottom, to make sure we're taking care of our own."" Cone said Monday that he has instructed commanders at Fort Hood to ""immediately take a hard look and make sure if there's anybody out there struggling [that] we're going to address their issues."" Sen. Joe Lieberman said he plans a Senate committee hearing into whether the shootings were a terrorist act and whether the Army should responded to reported signs of Islamic extremism by the suspected gunman. If Hasan was showing signs of being an Islamic extremist, the Army should have acted on that earlier, and ""he should have been gone,"" said Lieberman, a Connecticut independent and chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. He spoke on ""Fox News Sunday."" The shooting, on the nation's largest military base, sparked outrage. In his Saturday radio address, President Obama said it was ""an act of violence that would have been heartbreaking had it occurred any place in America."" But, he said, ""it's all the more heartbreaking and all the more despicable because of the place where it occurred and the patriots who were its victims."" All but one of those who were killed were soldiers. Obama and first lady Michelle Obama will attend a Tuesday memorial service for the victims. Defense Secretary Robert Gates will also participate in the memorial service, but he will not speak, Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said. Gates on Monday night will go to Fort Hood, where he will meet with the victims' families as well as Fort Hood Police Sgt. Kimberly Munley, the civilian officer who confronted and disabled Hasan as they shot at each other. Gates will also meet with military officials at the Army base, including Fort Hood's commanding general, Lt. Gen. Robert Cone, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen, according to Morrell. CNN's David Mattingly and Victor Hernandez contributed to this report."

Lee Siegel on America’s shameful epidemic. No other prosperous country not torn by civil conflict has anything like our volume of mass killings—Fort Hood and the shooting in Oregon are just the latest examples. Lee Siegel on America's shameful epidemic. Nidal Malik Hasan may have shouted “Allahu Akbar” before his murderous onslaught at Fort Hood, but his actions were part of an American phenomenon that is a national emergency. You had barely enough time to grasp what might have happened in the Cleveland home of convicted rapist Anthony Sowell, where police so far have found the remains of 11 women, when news came of Hasan’s massacre. Yet just as that terrible event was starting to sink in, the airwaves were burning up with reports of a shooting rampage in an office building in Orlando, Florida, in which eight people were said to have been shot, one—as of this writing—fatally. It’s time to start asking ourselves whether our famous American freedom—in both its liberal and conservative formulations—is not actually a subtle form of dehumanizing tyranny. More than health care, the economy, jobs, Afghanistan, Iraq, public malfeasance, private dishonesty, civil rights, disease or tainted food, mass murder is American’s primary problem and most fundamental shame. No prosperous country not riven by civil conflict has anything like our volume of mass killings. And yet for all of the fascination with mass murder in the media, in Hollywood—and among us—no politician will do more than pay lip service in condemning it. No journalist will crusade against it. No celebrity will take it up as a cause. Nobody does a damn thing to try to stop it. Conservatives don’t want to make an issue of mass murder because then they would be confronted with the fact that nearly all of the massacres are committed by people using guns. Liberals don’t want to cry out about it because then they would have to address the fact that the violence of our entertainment—TV, movies, videogames, our proliferating apps—makes killing seem like just another strategy for coping with reality. If the utterly immoral legality of handguns and assault weapons puts killing within reach, then vicarious violence, sanctified by every corner of the entertainment culture, makes murder ethically and conceptually possible. To be sure, mass murder happens all over the world. But it occurs at nothing close to the frequency with which it erupts in the U.S. And when massacres do take place in other countries, they are often the result of political conflict, grinding poverty, a culture of vendetta, or the deforming forces of an authoritarian regime—as in China, which seems to have more than its share of mass killings. Here, however, in the world’s sanctuary of freedom and prosperity, Americans are murdering each other, and their families, in groups. • Jeff Stein: Military Bases are ‘Wide Open to Attack’Indeed, it's time to start asking ourselves whether our famous American freedom—in both its liberal and conservative formulations—is not actually a subtle form of dehumanizing tyranny. There is the economic anguish, of course, and the inability of our mad capitalism to slow down and care for its casualties. But neither Columbine nor the murders at Virginia Tech took place during an economic crisis.  We have to start examining whether the general free-for-all of our economic system, and the pleasure-seeking ethos of our commercialism, and the ideology of immediate gratification that is corroding any type of respect for authority—we have to determine whether these ""freedoms"" are actually a tightening dog collar turning us all into rabid animals. The news reports about Hasan’s massacre remind us that it was one in a stream of such events: 13 people gunned down at an immigration center in Albany last April; 10 killed in Alabama last March; 32 shot dead at Virginia Tech—eerily, Hasan’s alma mater—in 2007. Some reports recall the 1991 mass shooting in Killeen, Texas—right outside Fort Hood—in which 24 people were killed. The university in nearby Austin was once the site of the infamous Texas tower sniper, who in 1966 slaughtered 14 people on the campus after murdering his wife and mother at home. But you don’t have to go back that far to get a sense of how shockingly common mass killings are in America. You don’t have to go back much further than the beginning of this year: In January, Ervin Lupoe shot to death his wife and five children and then himself in Los Angeles. That same month, Keith Luke was accused of murdering three people in Brockton, Massachusetts. In March, Robert Stewart was charged with the murder of eight people in a North Carolina nursing home. In Santa Clara, California, Devan Kalathat killed his two children, three other relatives and himself. Last April, D’Andre Howard was accused of killing his father, grandfather and girlfriend’s sister. Christopher Wood murdered his wife and three children and then took his own life in Middletown, Maryland. A New York tax attorney named William Parente beat to death and asphyxiated his wife and two daughters and then committed suicide in a Maryland hotel room. Kerby Revelus killed two of his sisters in Milton, Massachusetts, cutting off the head of his younger sister as she sat in front of her birthday cake as police helplessly watched before shooting Revelus dead. In Orting, Washington, James Harrison murdered his five children and then killed himself. In August, George Sodini killed three women and wounded nine in a gym just outside Pittsburgh, then took his own life. Richard Ringold was accused of shooting and killing four people in Lawrenceville, Georgia. One month later, a cabinetmaker named Charles L. Dalton Sr. killed his wife and two children in Mt. Airy, Maryland, then apparently killed himself. Just this past week, William Maxwell killed his wife and two children and himself in Fayetteville, North Carolina. This is only a partial list of the mass murders that have taken place so far this year. The slaughter of strangers is bad enough. But the rising frequency of people murdering their families—and then themselves—is beyond chilling. We get all bent out of shape over the debates about various issues, each political side hurls escalating slurs at the other, pundits routinely cry that this or that event means the sky is falling. And yet the routine— routine—murder of groups of people and of families by family members doesn’t seem to ruffle anyone’s feathers. Amid all this killing, it’s almost comical that there are people who blame our country’s mess on either Rush Limbaugh or Barack Obama. In my current dark mood, I’m tired of hearing about both our domestic bugbears and our foreign adversaries. The true enemy is the American genocide of mass murder and all its many causes. When a woman at Fort Hood who had been near the shootings told reporters, with strange evocativeness, that “you could smell the gunfire,” I thought of D.H. Lawrence. “The sympathetic bond is broken,” Lawrence once wrote. “We stink in each other’s nostrils.” America is beginning to stink.

Army Chief of Staff General George Casey addresses the media at the Fort Hood Army Post in Fort Hood, Texas November 6, 2009. REUTERS/Jessica Rinaldi General George Casey, U.S. Army chief of staff, cautioned against jumping to conclusions about whether religious beliefs motivated the accused gunman, Major Nidal Malik Hasan, a Muslim born in the United States of immigrant parents. “I’m concerned that this increased speculation could cause a backlash against some of our Muslim soldiers. And I’ve asked our Army leaders to be on the lookout for that,” Casey told CNN’s “State of the Union.” There are about 3,000 Muslims on active duty military service or in the National Guard or reserve forces, Casey said. They remain a small minority within the U.S. military. A Fort Hood official has said Hasan yelled “Allahu Akbar” -- Arabic for “God is Greatest” -- just before the shooting in which 13 people were killed and 30 wounded. The 39-year-old U.S. Army psychiatrist was shot four times by police. He was hospitalized but no longer needed a ventilator to breathe. Relatives have said Hasan wanted to leave the Army to avoid being deployed to Afghanistan and that he had faced harassment by fellow soldiers because of his religion. Casey was not specific about the type of backlash he feared against Muslims in the military, or who might lead a backlash. The shootings at the sprawling Army base marked the latest blow to the U.S. military, which has been under enormous strain this decade as troops served repeated long combat deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. Those wars also have raised hostility toward the United States among many Muslims worldwide. “Our diversity, not only in our Army, but in our country, is a strength. And as horrific as this tragedy was, if our diversity becomes a casualty, I think that’s worse,” Casey added on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Asked whether Muslims in the U.S. Army are more conflicted than other soldiers in fighting wars in Muslim countries like Afghanistan and Iraq, Casey said: “I think that’s something that we have to look at on an individual basis.” “But,” he added, “I think we as an Army have to be broad enough to bring in people from all walks of life.” Casey declined to say what the Army knew about Hasan’s behavior before Thursday’s rampage, saying those questions will be addressed by investigators looking into the crime.

Neither Smith nor the other victims of Hasan's assault had guns because soldiers on military bases within the United States generally are not allowed to carry them. Last week's shootings, which killed 13 people and wounded more than 30, demonstrated once again the folly of ""gun-free zones,"" which attract and assist people bent on mass murder instead of deterring them.

Judging from the comments of those who support this policy of victim disarmament, Smith's desire for a gun was irrational. According to Paul Helmke, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, ""This latest tragedy, at a heavily fortified Army base, ought to convince more Americans to reject the argument that the solution to gun violence is to arm more people with more guns in more places.""
Note how the reference to ""a heavily fortified Army base"" obscures the crucial point that the people attacked by Hasan were unarmed as a matter of policy. Also note the breathtaking inanity of Helmke's assurance that ""more guns"" are not ""the solution to gun violence."" In this case, they assuredly were.

The first people with guns to confront Hasan, two local police officers, were the ones who put a stop to his rampage. And while Sgt. Kim Munley and Sgt. Mark Todd acted heroically, they did not arrive on the scene until a crucial 10 minutes or so had elapsed and Hasan had fired more than 100 rounds.
If someone else at the processing center had a gun when Hasan started shooting, it seems likely that fewer people would have been killed or injured. Furthermore, the knowledge that some of his victims would be armed might have led him to choose a different, softer target in order to maximize the impact of his attack.
There would have been plenty of targets to choose from: any of the locations in Texas, including public schools, universities and shopping malls, that advertise their prohibition of gun possession. The problem is that crazed killers tend not to follow such rules.
That problem was vividly illustrated by the second deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, which occurred in Killeen, Texas, a stone's throw from Fort Hood. In 1991, George Jo Hennard drove his pickup truck through the window of a Luby's cafeteria in Killeen, jumped out and began firing two pistols at the defenseless customers and employees inside, killing 23 of them.
One customer, Suzanna Hupp, saw Hennard gun down her parents. Hupp later testified that she had brought a handgun with her that day but, to her bitter regret, left it in her car, as required by state law. The massacre led the Texas legislature to approve a ""shall issue"" law that allows any resident who meets certain objective criteria to obtain a concealed carry permit.




But people with such permits are still barred from bringing their weapons into areas designated as gun-free zones. And when a killer fires on people he knows will be unarmed, it matters little whether he has 20-round or 10-round magazines, a detail emphasized in press coverage of the Fort Hood massacre. The second or two it takes to switch magazines is a minor nuisance when the people you are shooting at cannot shoot back.
Even less relevant is the allegation that Hasan used illegal armor-piercing ammunition. The Brady Campaign bizarrely chose to highlight that claim even though there was no indication that any of Hasan's victims were wearing bulletproof vests, let alone that his bullets penetrated them. Perhaps the group hoped that such puzzling illogic would distract people from the plain fact that having a gun is better than not having one when you are confronted by a homicidal maniac.

The suspected gunman, Major Nidal Malik Hasan, a Muslim born in the United States of immigrant parents, was shot four times by police, a base spokesman said. He was unconscious but in stable condition. A woman died overnight from her wounds, raising the toll from Thursday’s shootings to 13 dead and 30 wounded, said Colonel John Rossi, a spokesman at Fort Hood, the biggest military facility in the world. Hasan was transferred on Friday afternoon by helicopter to the Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, Rossi said. He had been on a ventilator in a civilian hospital. The Army declined to discuss possible motives while the investigation was under way. “We have to understand what caused the suspect to act in the way that he did,” Army Secretary John McHugh said after observing a moment of silence at the base. Army Chief of Staff George Casey said: “This was a kick in the gut.” The gunman, with two guns including a semi-automatic weapon, opened fire apparently without warning at the crowded Soldiers Readiness Processing Center, where troops were getting medical checkups before leaving for foreign deployments. Related Coverage  Hasan, 39, had spent years counseling severely wounded soldiers at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, many of whom had lost limbs fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was transferred to Fort Hood in April and was to have been deployed to Afghanistan, where the U.S. military is engaged in an increasingly bloody war against Taliban and al Qaeda fighters. The Army Criminal Investigation Command and the FBI are investigating the shootings and no charges have been brought against Hasan, McHugh said. DEPLOYMENT ‘NIGHTMARE’ In Washington, President Barack Obama met with FBI officials, including agency director Robert Mueller, to discuss the incident. “We don’t know all the answers yet and I would caution against jumping to conclusions until we have all the facts,” Obama said. Hasan’s cousin, Nader Hasan, said in interviews that he had agitated not to be sent overseas. “We’ve known over the last five years that was probably his worst nightmare,” he said. Nader Hasan also said his cousin had complained, as a Muslim, of harassment by fellow soldiers. Hasan yelled “Allahu Akbar” -- Arabic for “God is Greatest” -- just before the shooting, Chuck Medley, Fort Hood’s director of Emergency Services, told Reuters. But the Fort Hood commander, Lieutenant-General Robert Cone, said there was no evidence this was a terrorist attack. American Muslim groups expressed regret and stressed that the incident appeared to have been carried out by a single disturbed individual. “Thousands of Arab Americans and American Muslims serve honorably every day in all four branches of the U.S. military and in the National Guard,” the Arab American Institute said. Rossi said Thursday’s shooting lasted 10 minutes. He said a female civilian police officer was the first to wound the gunman, who was wearing military garb. Sergeant Andrew Hagerman, a military police officer, said Hasan was unconscious when he arrived. “You’re always surprised at how much carnage there is,” said Hagerman, who returned in July 2008 from a tour of duty in Iraq. Soldiers ripped apart their uniforms to make bandages to care for the wounded, Hagerman said. The United States has been engaged in six years of fighting in Iraq and nearly eight years of war in Afghanistan, which has put extra stress on the military and on individual soldiers. In May, a U.S. soldier at a base in Baghdad shot and killed five fellow soldiers. Multiple shooting incidents are not uncommon in the United States, where there are relatively lax gun controls. Fort Hood personnel have accounted for more suicides than any other Army post since the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, with 75 tallied through July of this year. Fort Hood, about 60 miles from the state capital Austin, is home to about 50,000 troops.

Soldiers ripped apart their uniforms to make bandages to care for the wounded, Hagerman said. The United States has been engaged in six years of fighting in Iraq and nearly eight years of war in Afghanistan, which has put extra stress on the military and on individual soldiers. In May, a U.S. soldier at a base in Baghdad shot and killed five fellow soldiers. Multiple shooting incidents are not uncommon in the United States, where there are relatively lax gun controls. Fort Hood personnel have accounted for more suicides than any other Army post since the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, with 75 tallied through July of this year. Fort Hood, about 60 miles from the state capital Austin, is home to about 50,000 troops.

Fort Hood, the Texas military base that was the scene of a mass shooting Thursday, has been hard hit by the growing strain on the Army from multiple combat deployments -- with its personnel suffering the highest number of suicides among Army installations since the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, according to official data.


After many years of lengthy war zone rotations in Iraq and Afghanistan, Army personnel are experiencing record rates of suicide, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and other mental health problems, as well as worsening alcohol and drug abuse.


The psychological toll on the all-volunteer force today is unprecedented, Army officials say, acknowledging that they do not know how much the Army can sustain before it breaks -- making the health of the force a major consideration in President Obama's current deliberations over sending more U.S. troops to Afghanistan.


It's unclear what motivated the Army psychiatrist who is thought to have opened fire on fellow soldiers Thursday, although it's clear he had worked in settings where the effects of combat stress were pervasive.


A small but increasing number of soldiers undergoing the mental strain of repeated combat deployments are taking lives -- often their own.


This year, 117 active-duty Army soldiers were reported to have committed suicide, with 81 of those cases confirmed -- up from 103 suicides during the same period last year. Ten suicides have been reported at Fort Hood this year; more than 75 of its personnel have committed suicide since 2003. Fort Hood's high number of suicides is also linked to the fact that it is the Army's largest base, with more than 53,000 soldiers.


An estimated 30 percent of those returning from combat suffer mental health symptoms such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress. Such problems grow worse with repeated deployments and the constant exposure to danger and the sights, smells and emotions of seeing others killed or wounded, according to Army mental health surveys.


Those who treat the mentally wounded, including doctors such as Hasan, are not immune from the symptoms. It is not uncommon for therapists who treat patients for post-traumatic stress disorder to experience some symptoms vicariously after hearing account after account of the horrors of the battlefield.


Hasan was a psychiatry intern at Walter Reed Army Medical Center from June 2003 to July 2009, Army officials said. In that position, he probably treated soldiers with post-traumatic stress disorder.


Violent outbursts such as shootings by soldiers at Army bases have occurred in recent years, including at Fort Hood, where several killings were reported over the past two years.


Historically, one of the worst shooting incidents involving soldiers took place Oct. 27, 1995, at Towle Stadium at Fort Bragg, N.C., when a soldier opened fire on paratroopers in a formation, killing one Army officer and wounding 18 others.

As a poster on Free Republic remarked, ""Look shortly for the leftist media to push the 'Gay, Hispanic-American Intern saving the Liberal Congresswoman's life from the Tea Party' angle."" Well, Freepers, here it is! It's not quite that simple, of course. However we try to understand the causes of the tragedy in Arizona and the political rhetoric of violence, it seems clear that there's considerably more to the disturbing story of shooting suspect Jared Lee Loughner than can be explained by pointing to a few wry Sarah Palin quips. And if simply being gay and Latino were grounds for heroism, Ricky Martin's face would be on the $10 bill. Daniel Hernandez is, by any measure, an extraordinary young man. He had been interning in Gabrielle Giffords' office only five days when an event at a local Safeway thrust him into the international spotlight for his quick thinking, bravery and competence in the wake of unimaginable violence. On the ""Today"" show Monday, Matt Lauer explained how Hernandez drew upon his high school training as a certified nursing assistant to check on the pulses of other shooting victims before noticing the severity of Giffords' wounds and, as he puts it, prioritizing her. He put her upright and held her in his lap as he applied pressure to staunch the blood. ""I could tell she had a severe gunshot,"" he said. ""I just tried to do my best until emergency medical services could arrive. My focus was on making sure I was doing everything I could to take care of her."" Even when the ambulance arrived, he stayed with her, because ""I saw my job then as not taking care of her medical needs but taking care of her emotional needs. I tried to comfort her and make sure she knew she wasn't alone. I let her know I was going to try to contact her parents and her husband."" In the two days since the shooting, Hernandez has emerged in interviews as a graceful presence with a no doubt promising future, with considerably much more going for him than his status as a minority. So why should the sexual orientation of this eminently competent, compassionate person keep coming up in this tale? Why is his ethnicity, and the fact that he grew up speaking Spanish and attending dual language schools, of any consequence?  Hernandez never asked to be the face of a movement. He doesn't represent any one group any more than Jared Lee Loughner is your typical white guy. And that's exactly why it matters. It matters because guys like Arizona Sen. John McCain, who described the repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell"" as ""a very sad day,"" still think that orientation has an effect on whether or not a person can ably serve in the military. It matters because the notion that two people of the same sex can love each other and build a life together is still considered in many parts of the country, including Arizona, a threat to what is laughably referred to as ""traditional marriage"" -- as if heterosexuals have really mopped up the floor with this whole commitment thing. It matters because last week, when Arizona banned a Tucson district's Mexican-American studies program,  state's Attorney General Tom Horne referred to it as ""propagandizing and brainwashing."" It matters because just last year Arizona enacted a law that would not merely allow but require immigration officials to determine the immigration status of anyone ""where reasonable suspicion exists"" that the person might be in the country illegally. And ""reasonable suspicion,"" as many civil libertarians pointed out, might just boil down to having a darker shade of skin or speaking Spanish. That's just Hernandez's home of Arizona. And though Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik scathingly referred to his state as ""a mecca for racism and bigotry,"" violence, racism and bigotry aren't confined to any one ZIP code -- they exist all over this great land of ours.  They exist just as surely as Hernandez shows that kindness and bravery are alive and well in Arizona. It's still far too easy for a small-minded yahoo to champion discrimination based on orientation and race, and it's just as easy for another small-minded yahoo somewhere else to believe the red states are indeed ""meccas of racism and bigotry."" If any good can come out of something as unfathomably horrible as Saturday's mass shooting, let it be that it shakes up a few preconceptions. That it shows the world that a hero can be gay or straight, can speak English or Spanish or both, and that stupid laws can exist in places full of good people. And anyone who has any doubt of what kind of person deserves to serve next to him in battle, or stand before their community and declare their love, or go to school, or walk down the street without being asked for paperwork needs to hear that and remember that, again and again until it sinks in. Yes, the ""gay Hispanic American"" saved a life on Saturday, and yes, it does matter. Mary Elizabeth Williams is a senior writer for Salon and author of ""A Series of Catastrophes & Miracles.""

1484843535,2009-12-31 22:48:26,Charges Against Blackwater Guards Dismissed in Iraq Killings,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/01/us/01blackwater.html,en,False,,1,New York Times,http://nytimes.com,"Advertisement Supported by By Charlie Savage WASHINGTON  In a significant blow to the Justice Department, a federal judge on Thursday threw out the indictment of five former Blackwater security guards over a shooting in Baghdad in 2007 that left 17 Iraqis dead and about 20 wounded. The judge cited misuse of statements made by the guards in his decision, which brought to a sudden halt one of the highest-profile prosecutions to arise from the Iraq war. The shooting at Nisour Square frayed relations between the Iraqi government and the Bush administration and put a spotlight on the United States’ growing reliance on private security contractors in war zones. Investigators concluded that the guards had indiscriminately fired on unarmed civilians in an unprovoked and unjustified assault near the crowded traffic circle on Sept. 16, 2007. The guards contended that they had been ambushed by insurgents and fired in self-defense. A trial on manslaughter and firearm offenses was planned for February, and the preliminary proceedings had been closely watched in the United States and Iraq. But in a 90-page opinion, Judge Ricardo M. Urbina of Federal District Court in Washington wrote that the government’s mishandling of the case “requires dismissal of the indictment against all the defendants.” In a “reckless violation of the defendants’ constitutional rights,” the judge wrote, investigators, prosecutors and government witnesses had inappropriately relied on statements that the guards had been compelled to make in debriefings by the State Department shortly after the shootings. The State Department had hired the guards to protect its officials. News of the judgment came out late Thursday afternoon, when it was the middle of the night in Iraq. Mark J. Hulkower, the defense lawyer for the lead defendant in the case, Paul A. Slough, who was manning a turret machine gun during the episode, said that his client and his family had gathered in Texas for New Year’s Eve when he called them to convey the news. They were “overjoyed,” he said. “We are obviously pleased at the decision dismissing the entire indictment and are thrilled that these courageous young men can start the new year without this unfair cloud hanging over their heads,” Mr. Hulkower said. The other defendants were Evan S. Liberty, Dustin L. Heard, Donald W. Ball and Nicholas A. Slatten. The Justice Department had earlier said it intended to drop manslaughter and weapons charges against Mr. Slatten. Another Blackwater employee involved in the case, Jeremy P. Ridgeway, previously pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the shootings and was cooperating with prosecutors. A Justice Department spokesman, Dean Boyd, said no decision had been made about whether to appeal the judge’s ruling. “We’re still in the process of reviewing the opinion and considering our options,” Mr. Boyd said. But Judge Urbina’s scathing and detailed review of the ways that crucial evidence and witnesses had been tainted by exposure to the defendants’ early statements  or to news media accounts based on them  appears likely to complicate any effort to ask an appeals court to overturn his opinion or to bring a new prosecution by a different legal team using any untainted evidence. Daniel C. Richman, a former federal prosecutor who teaches criminal law at Columbia University, said that it was rare to have a judge issue a lengthy opinion at a pretrial stage. While cautioning that he had not read the opinion, he said that rulings like this one, consisting heavily of factual findings rather than merely legal interpretation, were “hard to challenge on appeal.” The guards could not be prosecuted under Iraqi law because of an immunity agreement that had been signed by the Coalition Provisional Authority, the governing authority installed by the United States after the invasion of Iraq. But American prosecutors knew from the beginning that they were facing a difficult task in bringing the case. Complications included the applicability of federal statutes to the guards because they were working overseas at the time for the State Department, and the significant problem stemming from statements the guards gave shortly after the shootings. The guards had been told by State Department investigators that they could be fired if they did not talk about the case, but that whatever they said would not be used against them in any criminal proceeding. Nevertheless, Judge Urbina found that “in their zeal to bring charges,” investigators and prosecutors had extensively used those statements, disregarding “the warning of experienced, senior prosecutors” that “the course of action threatened the viability of prosecution.” “The explanations offered by the prosecutors and investigators in an attempt to justify their actions and persuade the court that they did not use the defendants’ compelled testimony were all too often contradictory, unbelievable and lacking in credibility,” Judge Urbina wrote. The judge also criticized prosecutors for withholding “substantial exculpatory evidence” from the grand jury that indicted the defendants, as well as for presenting “distorted versions” of witnesses’ testimony and improperly telling the grand jury that some incriminating statements had been made by the defendants but were being withheld. The prosecutorial team was led by Kenneth C. Kohl, an assistant United States attorney. The Justice Department declined to make him available for comment. The judge’s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct were the latest in several blows to federal prosecutors in 2009 in which judges dismissed high-profile cases. Early in the year, for example, at the request of Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., a federal judge threw out the conviction of former Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, for having failed to report gifts on his disclosure forms. Justice Department officials had uncovered evidence that prosecutors in that case had failed to turn over potentially exculpatory evidence to the defense, as required by law. And last month, a federal judge threw out a major stock option back-dating case against top executives of the chip maker Broadcom Corporation after finding that a prosecutor in that case had inappropriately pressured witnesses to testify in a manner favorable to prosecutors. In the Nisour Square shooting case, prosecutors did not charge Blackwater itself, but the families of several of the Iraqis who were killed have filed a civil lawsuit against the company, which has changed its name to Xe Services. In addition, a grand jury in North Carolina, where Xe is based, is conducting a broad investigation into the company, which includes accusations of weapons smuggling and bribery of Iraqi officials in an attempt to ensure it would get approvals to continue operating in Iraq. On Thursday, the president and chief executive officer of Xe, Joseph Yorio, praised Judge Urbina’s ruling in a statement. “The company supports the judge’s decision to dismiss the charges,” he said. “From the beginning, Xe has stood behind the hundreds of brave men who put themselves in harm’s way to protect American diplomats working in Baghdad and other combat zones in Iraq. Like the people they were protecting, our Xe professionals were working for a free, safe and democratic Iraq for the Iraqi people.” The mass shooting eventually led Iraq to insist, during negotiations on a new status of forces agreement in 2008, on a provision that eliminated immunity from Iraqi law for American contractors.
