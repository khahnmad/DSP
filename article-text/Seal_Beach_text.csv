Reporter Amy Powell and Photographer Edgar Alcala get ready for their 11 a.m. KABC live shot outside Scott Dekraai's Huntington Beach home, Thursday morning, Oct. 13, 2011.  HUNTINGTON BEACH – Neighbors of a house searched late Wednesday in connection with the deadliest shooting in Orange County history said one thing stood out about the man who lives there: His total devotion to his son. Police identified Scott Dekraai as their suspect in the midday shooting at a Seal Beach beauty salon that left eight people dead; he was being held on suspicion of murder. Court records show he has been fighting his ex-wife – who colleagues said worked at the salon – for custody of their son since 2007. They were in court together Tuesday, the day before the shooting, for a routine hearing, records show. His ex-wife’s attorney said Dekraai had been seeking full custody of their son, but a court-ordered report issued last week had recommended against that. “His demeanor was always very controlled, almost serene,” attorney John Cate Jr. said. “In my dealings with him, I never saw him get upset, get agitated.” He described Dekraai as “monotone.” Cate said he believes his client was one of the first killed in the mass shooting at Salon Meritage on a busy Wednesday afternoon. Police have not released a list of the victims, and the Register is not naming the ex-wife without official confirmation. Dekraai, who turns 42 next week, had worked for some time as a tugboat operator. He badly injured his leg in 2007 when he rushed to help another crew member after a tow line snapped, according to a Register report at the time. His next-door neighbor, Stephanie Machow, 29, said he sometimes grumbled about his ex-wife, saying their divorce case began shortly after his leg injury. Machow waved to him Wednesday morning as she left for work, and assumed he was returning home after dropping off his son at school. “Never could I imagine him doing this,” she said. “I thought he was the nicest guy ever. … The only reason I could imagine him flipping out is because of some kind of argument over his son. He was everything to Scott.” Several neighbors identified a photo of the suspect as the man they knew as Scott. Dekraai lived in a single-story gray house on Melody Lane in Huntington Beach, which police blocked off with yellow tape Wednesday evening. Neighbors said they often saw Scott walking his white Lab or playing baseball with his son. Jake Rennison, 17, said Scott once asked him to teach his son to skateboard. Jake said he taught the boy how to kick flip. “He was totally devoted to his son. Totally,” Jake said. “I can’t believe this happened. The only thing I can imagine is with the custody battle. His son was his life.” Dekraai married the woman who is now his ex-wife in Clark County, Nev., in early 2003, records show. He filed for divorce in Los Angeles County in 2007, a month after his tugboat accident, court records show. His attorney at the time, Don Eisenberg, said Dekraai gave him “no reason to suspect a thing.” Another attorney has since taken the case, and Eisenberg said he hasn’t heard from Dekraai since 2009. “I know they had a difficult relationship,” he said of Dekraai and his ex-wife. “But that’s nothing that would foreshadow a tragedy life this.” &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt;Your browser does not support iframes.&amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;gt; –Register staff writer Ron Campbell contributed to this report.

42988876,2011-10-13 10:29:30,Seal Beach shooting: Custody dispute seen as motive,http://feeds.latimes.com/~r/TheHomicideReport/~3/zvglXohr_-g/seal-beach-shooting-custody-dispute-seen-as-motive.html,en,False,"suits and litigation,murders and attempted murders",6,LA Times,http://www.latimes.com/," A custody dispute may have been at the center of a mass shooting that left eight people dead at a Seal Beach, Calif., hair salon. Police on Wednesday night had not released the alleged gunman's name or  the identities of the victims, nor had they established a motive. But  friends and witnesses who knew the salon employees said the alleged  gunman was Scott Dekraai and he appeared to be targeting his former  wife, who was a stylist at Salon Meritage. They said the couple had been  involved in a bitter custody dispute involving their son. Full coverage: Deadly shooting at Seal Beach hair salon Dekraai, 41, allegedly stormed into the salon about 1:30 p.m. and  appeared to be looking for his former wife, Michelle Fournier, according  to friends and witnesses. Dekraai is a resident of Huntington Beach. It  was unclear whether Fournier was among those killed.  According to Los Angeles County Superior Court documents, Dekraai  initiated a divorce case in 2007 against Fournier, whose last name was  then Dekraai, court spokeswoman Mary Hearn said. A judge ruled that all  contact between the couple had to be via text or email, except for a  10-minute phone call once a week to discuss their child's education and  well-being.  At the time of the court dispute, Hearn said, it appeared that Dekraai  was awarded custody and Fournier had to comply with several conditions  to see the child, such as to not consume alcohol 24 hours before  visiting. In August 2010, the case was transferred to Orange County Superior Court at Dekraai's request, according to Hearn.  Fournier always seemed to be in a great mood and enjoyed her children,  said Judy Rodriguez Watson, co-owner of the Bay City Center where the  salon is located. ""She was a sweet, sweet, loving happy mama,"" Watson  said. ""She was always showing off photos of her kids.""  She said she believes Fournier has three sons.

On Wednesday evening, however, the Huntington Beach house was roped off by police tape, and homicide detectives stood on the front lawn as the father became the only suspect in the Seal Beach salon shooting that left eight dead and a ninth victim in critical condition. Christa Andrews, who lives down the street, said Scott Dekraai, the alleged gunman, moved in about two years ago. He told her he had been honorably discharged from the military and had a work-related leg injury that caused him to walk with a limp. She said Dekraai would play baseball and soccer with his son, who looked to be the age of Andrews’ 7-year-old. The family had a white Labrador named Conway that they taught how to play catch. Full coverage: Deadly shooting at Seal Beach beauty salon Patty Roach, a hairstylist who lived two streets over, would pass by the house a few times each day on her usual dog-walking route. Roach has lived in the neighborhood for 25 years, and she said it has always been an unassuming place with mostly middle-class families raising children. The street is lined with modest homes with well-kept lawns. Skeletons and cobwebs hang from doorways for Halloween. Roach said it was hard to believe that the man they know from the neighborhood could be behind the shootings. She said that after her husband found out, he said again and again, “There’s no way it could have been him.” Stephanie Malchow, who lives next door to Dekraai, described the family as a loving one. ""They’re always outside playing with dog,"" she said, referring to DeKraai, his current wife Mindy and a son from Dekraai's previous marriage. Malchow also remembers attending Dekraai's wedding. ""It was really nice,"" she said of Dekraai and his current wife. ""He was very happy. He was one of the nicest neighbors I’ve ever known. He was definitely involved with his son.""

A ninth person remained in critical condition, Sgt. Steve Bowles said late Wednesday afternoon. Six people were found dead inside the Salon Meritage after police responded to a call about shots being fired inside the business shortly after 1 p.m. Wednesday, police said. Three more were found critically injured, Bowles said. A suspect, described as a white male, is in custody, he added. ""He was cooperative. He did not provide any resistance to the officers and he was taken into custody,"" Bowles said. In addition to the people who were killed and injured, he said, ""there were people in the salon who were not shot."" Authorities are investigating what relationship the gunman had with anyone inside the Salon Meritage. ""We don't know if he's related or what his involvement is with the salon,"" Bowles said. ""It appears that the salon was busy at the time, and it appears as if almost every hair station was occupied,"" he added. The people shot appeared to be seeking shelter or cover during the shooting, Bowles said. Victims were scattered throughout the salon, and one of the injured was a man who was found outside the salon -- the only victim found outdoors -- Bowles said. Authorities don't know if that man was shot inside or outside the salon, he added. That man is in critical condition, police said. The suspect was arrested by police a half mile from the salon as he was driving a vehicle, Bowles said. ""We don't have the make and the model of the weapon"" used in the shooting, he said. ""There was a weapon recovered at the scene of the apprehension of the suspect. ""He advised there were weapons in the vehicle, but we don't have information at this point,"" Bowles continued. Police don't know whether the gunman made any utterances during the mass shooting. ""We do not know at this point if the shots were fired only inside -- or outside as well,"" Bowles said. Gunshot wounds were ""at all different locations on the bodies,"" he said. The Salon Meritage, in the 500 block of Pacific Coast Highway, is within blocks of the Pacific Ocean. The salon features a receptionist and a waiting area. Seal Beach is a ""small"" and ""fairly intimate"" coastal town where ""we have multiple years with zero homicides, so this obviously is an unusual and tragic circumstance,"" Bowles said."

(AP Photo/Chris Carlson)  SEAL BEACH– Ron Sesler was working the lunch rush at his steakhouse just blocks from the beach in this seaside town when he heard a rapid ‘pop, pop, pop’ sound that he at first thought was construction noise. But when a frantic woman burst through the restaurant and into the kitchen, screaming ‘”They’re shooting people, they’re shooting people!” he knew it wasn’t jackhammers. Over the next nightmarish minutes, Sesler watched as hairstylists and customers from the next-door Salon Meritage streamed into his restaurant seeking refuge from the largest mass shooting in Orange County history. Hysterical stylists still wearing their smocks with hair clips in the pockets and customers halfway through dye jobs and permanents piled inside Patty’s Place as Sesler locked the door and his wife frantically dialed 911. Police soon showed up and used the restaurant as a temporary base to interview witnesses. “The whole place was filled, it was whoever survived,” said Sesler, 68, still noticeably shaken on Thursday as he tried to resume business as usual. “We just locked the doors and waited for police. It seemed like a long time — minutes — but it was probably seconds.” Minutes after the shooting Wednesday, police stopped 41-year-old Scott Dekraai a half-mile from the scene and arrested him without incident. Sesler said the witnesses who came to his restaurant believed that Dekraai’s ex-wife, Michelle Fournier, was the second person shot in a spree that claimed the lives of eight people and left one woman in critical condition. The only victim not shot inside the salon was a regular at Patty’s Place and a good friend of Sesler. He happened to park directly next to the gunman and was shot while sitting in his car talking on his cell phone, Sesler said. “He just happened to park right beside the shooter. I saw him sitting there bleeding before they took him away,” he said. “He randomly missed it by three or four minutes either way. If he was late, the guy would have driven away. If he was early, he would have been in here” eating lunch. The witnesses who gathered in Sesler’s restaurant, many of them longtime friends, said Dekraai first took aim at the salon owner, Randy Fannin, and shot him once in the head and then turned to his own ex-wife, shooting her three times. Fannin’s wife, Sandy, escaped only because she was in the back, possibly mixing hair dye, Sesler said. A masseuse hid in the massage room with two others and locked the door. Two more hid in the bathroom, Sesler said, according to accounts from people who were interviewed by police inside his restaurant in the immediate aftermath. “They were hiding and calling 911 while the shooting was going on. They all came in here,” he said. “If you were there, you were either shot or hiding.” An elderly woman fled the salon after the shots broke out and seemed frozen on the sidewalk. Sesler’s wife, Patty, grabbed her through the restaurant’s side door and pulled her into the kitchen, Sesler said. The shooter had been staring directly at the woman but didn’t fire, he said, adding that he offered her a glass of wine and peanuts to calm her after her police interview was done. As things calmed down, police swarmed Sesler’s restaurant to interview survivors. Every table was filled, with four or five cops attending to each survivor, and some hairstylists took customers with half-finished dye jobs and perms to a salon next door to rinse their hair, he said. “There were more cops than there was tables,” he said. “They were breaking people down on what happened, doing interviews.” Another woman who witnessed part of the shooting, Kimberly Criswell, said she heard two short “pops.” Criswell, who owns another salon near Salon Meritage, said her receptionist then screamed out, “He just shot that man!” She gathered her employees and clients and locked them in the handicapped bathroom while calling 911. “I’m sure I’ve lost some friends,” she said as she waited for news outside a spiritual center and library where victims’ family members were taken. Sesler said Dekraai, the suspect, was well known in the community and grew up in Seal Beach. His grandparents’ names are inscribed on gold plates the size of playing cards a weathered memorial bench that sits in the shopping complex between the salon and the restaurant where the victims took refuge. The couple had lived in Seal Beach for decades and he lived in an apartment above their house in his early 20s, said Tim Terbush, who was close friends with Dekraai’s ex-wife. Dekraai and Michelle Fournier had been going through a bitter custody battle over their young son, according to court records, and had a court hearing in the matter earlier in the week. Just hours before the shooting, Sesler said, Michelle Fournier had stopped by the restaurant to ask about the lunch special and promised to come back. “She never made it,” he said.

She didn’t know it, but she was getting news – again and again – about a mass shooting that took eight people, including her friend and hairstylist, Laura Webb. “I’m so sad. I’m probably in shock more than anything, said Eskenazi, 74, president of the Los Alamitos Seal Beach Rotary Club. “I know it has happened, but I still don’t believe it.” Webb, who turned 46 this month, was Eskenazi’s hairstylist for the past 12 years. Police identified her as Laura Lee Elody, but Webb was married about nine months ago and used her married name. Webb was with family when she was shot. Her mother, Hattie Stretz, was in the salon, getting her hair done by her daughter, when the shooting took place, Eskenazi said. Stretz, 73, also was shot during the attack. Authorities said Thursday that Stretz’s condition is improving and she is expected to survive. Eskenazi remembers Webb being a big movie buff, a motorcycle rider and a “nice young lady.” “She was one of those happy people … never got angry and was a very nice person.” Eskenazi added that Webb was creative and seemed to enjoy her work. “Whenever you wanted to do something different, she would help you achieve that. “She had quite a following.” The hairdressers at Salon Meritage were a close-knit group who spent time together outside of work. Eskenazi said the salon owner, Randy Fannin, would throw Christmas parties for his staff. “He (Scott Dekraai) took all these innocent lives … It’s terrible that he killed his ex-wife, then he took all these people with him,” Eskenazi said. Eskenazi remembers seeing Stretz, who has two other daughters and a son, at a recent Casino Night event at the Los Alamitos Youth Center. “She was pretty involved,” Eskenazi said. “Hattie liked to travel to different places and was involved with schools.” Contact the writer: amolina@ocregister.com or 714-704-3794 Get the latest news delivered daily!

Friends and family members gather outside the Seal Beach Public Library after the shooting.  Friends and family members gather outside the Seal Beach Public Library after the shooting.  0utside the Seal Beach Public Library on Wednesday.  A man who declined to give his name wipes away tears in front of the memorial at Salon Meritage. He said he was deeply saddened and talked of the kindness he had experience from the people who worked in the salon.  Friday morning a note of love and devotion was left for shooting victim Michele Fast. The memorial for the victims of Wednesday's mass shooting expanded greatly and wrapped around the building at Salon Meritage.  SEAL BEACH – The young boy at the center of a bitter custody battle that prosecutors say led to Orange County’s deadliest mass shooting last week spent the minutes of the massacre sitting in his principal’s office. He was waiting, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said, for his mom or dad to pick him up. Rackauckas appeared to tear up during a Friday news conference and took several moments before adding: “That little boy is a victim.” Police have released few details about the 8-year-old boy who was caught in an ugly custody dispute between suspect Scott Dekraai and one of the victims of the massacre, Michelle Fournier. Seal Beach police Chief Tim Olson said the boy is staying with family. Confidentiality rules prevent Orange County Child Protective Services from saying whether the agency was involved in the boy’s placement. But spokeswoman TerryLynn Fisher said it’s entirely possible the boy went to stay with family members without ever entering the county’s system. Child Protective Services would only take the child if there were a report of child abuse or if police needed a place for him to stay, Fisher said. In such cases, social workers immediately start looking for relatives or close family friends who can care for the child. There’s no set order for who they call first, Fisher said. They’re looking for “somebody that the child knows, so that the child’s life is not disrupted any more than it needs to be,” she said. But it’s “completely possible” that the boy never entered protective custody, Fisher said. Schools often require parents to list “alternate pickups” – people authorized to pick up their child if they can’t make it. The school or police could release the boy to the alternate pickup without ever calling the county, Fisher said. The boy’s parents could also have named a backup guardian in a will or other legal document to take the boy if they could no longer care for him. His caretakers could seek to adopt him. Other relatives or friends also could go to court to seek custody. Fournier had two other children from a previous marriage. In cases when a child is left without parents, the goal would be to place him with siblings, Fisher said. “Ideally, in cases where there is no will or the parents haven’t made their wishes known, the relatives and friends who are close to the child would meet with the children to determine what would be in the best interests of this child and his siblings,” Fisher said. She added that it’s important for the child to have as much privacy as possible and to receive counseling from a specialist in children and grief. Rackauckas said Friday that it was the question of who should have custody of the boy that exploded into a shooting rampage that left eight dead in a Seal Beach beauty salon on Oct. 12. The boy’s mother was dead, Rackauckas said, and his father was charged as a mass murderer. “What kind of sick, twisted fatherly love might that be?” Rackauckas said.

The body of an unidentified person appears at upper center on sidewalk.  SEAL BEACH – Patricia Almazan watched her father die in the hospital. Mortally wounded by three gunshots that struck his back and his head, Frank Teplansky was 51 when he died in a mass shooting at Cal State Fullerton on July 12, 1976. That rampage, which killed seven and wounded two, was Orange County’s worst single episode of violence until two weeks ago, when a two-minute spree of gunfire inside Salon Meritage in Seal Beach killed eight people and wounded one. One of the last things Teplansky did before dying was squeeze the hand of his only daughter. Almazan, now 66, says the psychological wounds persist more than 35 years after the slaying. “One never recovers from such a heinous event,” Almazan says. “It becomes part and parcel of your DNA, and then on to the next generation.” Relatives, friends and witnesses connected to the Seal Beach mass killing on Oct. 12 are in a fog of shock and disbelief — on top of their suffocating grief, say experts in trauma who have lost loved ones to mass killings and other violence. These survivors face a long, difficult road in regaining a sense of normalcy and achieving a measure of recovery that, at this stage, may seem impossible, experts say. But it is possible. Jeffrey Dion is deputy executive director of the National Center for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C. In 1982, Dion’s sister, Paulette, 23, was strangled to death in Atlanta by serial killer Ottis Toole, whose other victims included Adam Walsh, the boy whose death led to the national TV show “America’s Most Wanted,” hosted by his father, John Walsh. “Grief is a path you walk,” said Dion, also director of the National Crime Victim Bar Association. “You can walk now, or walk later, but you’re not going to get to the end of your journey unless you walk down that path.” It’s a sentiment familiar to those affected by other mass killings, from Columbine High School in 1999 (13 dead, 24 wounded) to Virginia Tech in 2007 (32 dead, 25 wounded). *** Randy Fannin, Michelle Fournier, Michele Fast, Lucia Kondas, Dave Caouette, Christy Wilson, Victoria Buzzo, Laura Webb Elody. The names of the eight people who lost their lives in the Seal Beach shootings are becoming etched in Orange County’s public conscience. Behind each name are hundreds of people devastated by those violent deaths, and thousands more who may not have known the victims but who still have been stained by a trauma prosecutors say was inflicted by a disgruntled ex-husband enraged by a custody battle. The slayings sentenced countless people to forever altered lives. Some of those people, say other survivors, are destined to struggle. “You know that old theory about ‘closure’?” says Carla Jacobs, whose mother-in-law, Roma Jacobs, was killed by her own daughter in 1990. “Well, there’s no such thing as closure. It’s been more than 20 years, and it’s not over. It’s not over emotionally. The best way I can describe it is that it’s become muted.” *** Roma Jacobs’ daughter had a history of schizophrenia when she burst into Roma’s home with guns and knives on Oct. 14, 1990. Victoria Jacobs “Betty” Madeira, 43, stabbed Roma, 78, of La Canada Flintridge, several times in a patio area, and then followed her into a kitchen. While Roma Jacobs was begging a 911 operator for help, Madeira shot her dead – the blasts recorded over the phone. Carla Jacobs, 62, of Orange recalls having to clean up after the murder of her future mother-in-law when police and paramedics left the house that night. “To this day, I can still see the kitchen splattered with blood and brains,” Jacobs says. “It was horrible. Most of the blood on the phone was on the number 9, since Roma died making a 911 call.” Madeira was found not guilty by reason of insanity and was committed to a psychiatric hospital. The killing transformed Jacobs into a mental health activist. She serves on the board of the Treatment Advocacy Center and works to reform mental health treatment laws. Jacobs says that as relatives, friends and witnesses connected to the Seal Beach tragedy work through their grief, many – like her – eventually may find a new calling as advocates for causes connected to violent crime. First, though, they have to get through today. And the next. And next. *** Post-traumatic stress disorder, popularly associated with war veterans and sometimes with first responders such as police or firefighters, is “very common” for survivors of one-time violent events like the Seal Beach mass shooting, says Dion. He’s worked with thousands of victims and has helped spearhead the establishment of several victims’ rights bills. It’s crucial, he says, for people to recognize symptoms of PTSD – among them, nightmares, difficulty sleeping, depression, anxiety. Treatment is helpful and effective, he says, comparing it to having windows broken in a smoke-filled house. “Treatment helps ‘ventilate’ the traumatic images,” Dion says. Whatever stage a person is at in the grief process, it’s vital that he or she get support, he says. “I don’t think it’s ever too soon,” says Dion, adding that it’s important for survivors not to be isolated – and to spend time with others who’ve experienced the same trauma. “Just knowing that you’re not the only one going through this can make a huge difference in breaking down the walls of isolation,” Dion says. In the days after her mother-in-law was slain, Jacobs felt helpless – a feeling she believes the loved ones of the Seal Beach victims are experiencing. “You’re trying to figure out, ‘What can I do?'” Jacobs says. “But you can’t do anything.” The process of working through such feelings, along with grief and anger, is “messy,” Jacobs says. It’s not, she says, as clean as grief manuals make it seem. *** Many Seal Beach survivors will be looking at the prosecution of Scott Evans Dekraai, 42 – he faces the death penalty, if convicted – as a milestone in their healing process. “People oftentimes look at a criminal prosecution as a goal; they think, ‘If I can just get beyond that, everything’s going to be OK,” Dion says. He and others say, however, that a conviction provides only partial comfort. “In working with other victims, a lot of outsiders think that what we want is vindication or punishment,” Jacobs says. “But I haven’t really found that to be true. “You can’t punish away the pain of what you’ve gone through. You carry it with you the rest of your life.” *** Murder trials such as Dekraai’s can drag on for years – disrupting the lives of the victims’ loved ones. “You become cynical,” Almazan says. “This happens, particularly, when there’s a long, drawn-out court case. “And every time (the killer or accused killer’s) name is brought up in the media, the victims suffer.” Whenever Allaway’s name in mentioned – as well as Dekraai’s – Almazan’s anger is palpable. “I don’t care if this (accused) killer is nuttier than a fruitcake or an evil coward,” she says. “He should be taken down like a mad pit bull. If you kill a bunch of people, you should get nothing. You should be taken out immediately – just like the victims were.” *** It’s difficult for people to know what to say to loved ones of a homicide victim. What can one possibly say, for example, to Sandy Fannin, who held her mortally wounded husband in her arms until help arrived at the Salon Meritage? Or what can one say to relatives of the other victims, including the lone survivor, Hattie Stretz, 73, who is Laura Webb Elody’s mother? “Only your closest family and close friends get it,” Almazan says. “Others want it forgotten as soon as possible to ease their own minds.” Loved ones of the Seal Beach victims need to brace themselves for a reality, Dion says. “People should not expect to reach a point where everything is going to be back the way it was.” He warns of triggers – a sad movie, a TV commercial, almost anything – that, years later, can take a person back to the day of the killings. Be aware of these triggers, he says. That can ease the traumatic memories. “Something like this shapes you,” Dion says. “The most important thing a survivor can do is focus on themselves and their own recovery.” Jacobs says fighting for treatment for the mentally ill has helped her cope. She advises loved ones of the Seal Beach victims to, eventually, embrace a purpose. “If there’s a way to help prevent the next episode like this from occurring,” Jacobs says, “well, that’s the only good that can come out of this.” Victims, witnesses and impacted community members who would like to speak to a crisis counselor and/or receive victim services should contact CSP Victim Assistance Programs – Crisis Response Team at 949-975-0244.

(AP) The congressional intern credited with helping save the life of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords will soon be an elected official himself. Daniel Hernandez Jr. was elected Tuesday to a seat on the school board for the Sunnyside Unified School District in Arizona. Hernandez gained national recognition after the January shooting of the Arizona congresswoman and 18 others outside a Tucscon grocery store. Hernandez kept pressure on Giffords' head and held her upright after the severe injury until she could receive medical attention. Hernandez later attended the State of the Union address as a guest of first lady Michelle Obama. He also sat next to the Obamas during the January memorial service in Arizona for the victims of the mass shooting. His campaign site mentioned his work with Giffords only briefly. Hernandez also worked on Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in 2007. Hernandez won with 62 percent of the vote in Tuesday's election. His campaign site also stressed the importance of initiatives like ""all day kindergarten and making sure our graduates are workforce and college ready."" The 21-year-old told the Los Angeles Times that despite his many public appearances and interviews since the shooting, he didn't feel like he ""was doing anything concrete.""

The attack occurred Nov. 1 when a transient, 47-year-old Richard Lawrence Kalfin, approached David Oakleaf in the store's sporting goods department and began beating him. Sheriff's officials said it did not appear Oakleaf had any warning of the attack. ""It’s one of the most brutal attacks I have ever seen,"" Sheriff's Lt. Ed Hernandez said at the time. In interviews with The Times, his friends said he was known as ""Daytona Dave""  and dedicated his time and  energies to the American Motorcyclist Assn., advocating for  off-road motorcycling interests as well. He was also an ambassador for  the sport in California, working out of the group's district office in  Glendale. ""Dave was a very active contributor and well-liked by his fellow    delegates. He was very   involved in local and state issues regarding  motorcycling,"" said AMA spokesman Pete Terhorst. ""His loss is a    terrible tragedy for the motorcycling community."" Clifford Cross, who co-owned a desert property and ran a business with Oakleaf, said he was stunned to learn of Oakleaf's death. ""I’m still in shock over it,"" Cross said of the friend with whom he enjoyed  a variety of outdoor pursuits, including off-road motorcycling,  fishing and hunting. ""Everybody liked him. He had so many friends."" In a statement posted on the AMA's website, Jim Geddes praised  Oakleaf as a mentor and tireless advocate who worked ""to protect  competitive and leisure trail riding throughout California."" ""Without the efforts of Dave, competitive dirtbike racing in Southern  California would surely be a thing of the past,"" Geddes wrote. ""For  that matter, every off roader who enjoys recreating on two stroke bikes  owes Dave a great debt of gratitude.""  Oakleaf gained a  reputation for being an aggressive advocate for the cause. ""The off roading community was faced with very strict emission  requirements that would banish all two stroke bikes manufactured after  1997 off of public lands,"" Geddes wrote. ""Working with other  stakeholders and agency personnel, Dave would not sign off the plan  until they worked out what is currently referred to as the 'red sticker'  program. Thanks to his efforts, bikes with red stickers can compete in  any sanctioned off road event, and can trail ride during certain times  of the year throughout Southern California."" Oakleaf moved to the Long Beach area 45 years ago from upstate New  York. He took a job with the Los Angeles County's Department of Public  Social Services in El Monte. He retired 20 years ago. One of his former colleagues, Eileen Ritchie, described Oakleaf as a  kind and tenderhearted man. She recalled instances in which he cared for an  Irish setter and her pup after the adult canine was struck by a car on  the freeway. Another time he found an injured owl in the desert and  wrapped a T-shirt around his motorcycle handlebars so the bird could grip while he  drove to a raptor rescue center. The bird later recovered. Ritchie said his death was especially hard because her other friend  Lucia Kondas, who also worked with Oakleaf, was one of the victims in  last month's mass shooting in Seal Beach. ""It's cruel that two truly kind and nice people have been taken away from us by these violent acts,"" Ritchie said.

Gabrielle Giffords will speak publicly for the first time in months, describing with her husband the grueling 10-month recovery from an assassination attempt in January. ABC News’ Diane Sawyer interviewed Giffords and Mark Kelly for a special to air Monday night. It includes video footage of the Arizona Democrat through various stages of her recovery after being shot in the head from close range at a constituent event in Tucson. The network has released a brief excerpt showing Giffords saying only a few short phrases. “Pretty good,” Giffords says when asked how she feels. “Is it painful?” Sawyer asks. “It’s difficult.” The nation has seen only occasional glimpses of Giffords during the course of her recovery. Most prominently, she came to Washington in August to vote on the deal that resolved the debt ceiling crisis, a visit kept secret until she arrived in Congress for an emotional return. She made a second trip in October for a ceremony marking the official retirement of her husband, a Navy captain and shuttle astronaut. The man accused in the Jan. 8 mass shooting, Jared Loughner, faces 49 felony counts in the rampage that killed six bystanders and wounded 13 at a public event staged by Giffords. Prosecutors are expected to seek the death penalty. Experts have concluded that Loughner suffers from schizophrenia. In May, U.S. District Judge Larry A. Burns sent Loughner to a Missouri hospital after declaring that he was incompetent to stand trial. His attorneys have been battling in federal court over whether Loughner can be forced to take antipsychotic drugs to restore his mental competency to stand trial on capital charges. The Giffords interview is airing on the eve of the release of the couple’s book documenting her recovery. Kelly writes about Giffords’ anguish as she comes to understand what happened to her and other victims, including the six who were killed. The closing chapter was the work of Giffords, who writes: “I will get stronger. I will return.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters"

The two-week trip to Asheville has been in the works for several months, according to her office. Her therapy sessions will begin Monday and last until November 4, according to her office. A statement from the office said Giffords will be working with a therapist who treated her previously in Houston. The statement did not identify the therapist or any medical facility in Asheville involved. Giffords has made what doctors call a miraculous recovery since the shooting at an Arizona supermarket, which left six people dead and 12 others wounded. The man charged in the shooting, Jared Loughner, is in mental health treatment and will be re-evaluated early next year to determine his competency to stand trial."

Follow @TIME Updated: 12:25 a.m. Sometimes, rumors of violence beget actual violence. Saturday's mass shooting at a Safeway on North Oracle Road in Tucson, which killed six and left Democratic Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and others gravely wounded, may well be one of those occasions. It's impossible to know this early what the motivations for the attack were. Was the alleged shooter — who has been identified as 22-year-old Tucsonan Jared Loughner — angry about immigration? Or perhaps another hot-button issue? YouTube videos ascribed to him bore the mark of mental illness — they were conspiratorial, unintelligible, espousing no particular cause — but no matter his mental state, his crime took place in an overheated political environment. Last March, at the height of the health care reform battle, Giffords' office was vandalized. She mentioned in an MSNBC interview that a Sarah Palin graphic had depicted her district in the crosshair of a gun sight. ""They've got to realize there are consequences to that,"" she said. ""The rhetoric is incredibly heated."" The corner next to her office had also become, she said, a popular spot for Tea Party protests. (See ""40 Under 40: The Rising Stars of American Politics."") As Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik put it in an extraordinary and melancholic press conference after the shooting, ""we have become the Mecca for prejudice and bigotry."" He added that he's ""not aware of any public officials who are not receiving threats."" Another shooting victim, a federal judge named John Roll, had been placed under 24-hour security in 2009 after ruling in favor of illegal immigrants in a high-profile case. It's unclear why he was at the supermarket event. But for almost a year now, Arizona's leaders have been grappling with anti-immigration sentiments, inflamed by reports of crossborder violence. National media attention, with its attendant voices of hysteria, only added to the churn. Pundits spoke gravely about a wave of violence, born in Mexico and now flooding Arizona. Arizona's two most famous politicians fueled the fury. Republican Senator John McCain, facing an unexpected reelection challenge from the right, ran a campaign obsessed with crossborder crime. And GOP Governor Jan Brewer, who invited the national spotlight by championing strict anti-illegal immigrant legislation, talked of beheadings in the desert. The only problem with all this talk about a massive crossborder crime wave is that it wasn't true. Phoenix had not become one of the world's kidnapping capitals. Crime rates in Arizona had been steady or even fallen in some areas. There had been no beheadings in the desert. There were plenty of deaths there, but they were pathetic and meek tragedies: impoverished border-crossers, abandoned by their heartless guides, dying of exposure and dehydration. (See the top 10 American political prodigies.) But the idea of a state under siege took hold. When I was on the border last year reporting on the murder of rancher Rob Krentz, I talked to many who sincerely believed that they were under attack. Krentz's murder was a terrible event, but it was an isolated event. The relatively small number of home invasions, holdups and other crimes deeply disturbed border communities, but only because they had been living in such calm for so long. Their crime rates still don't match most cities in the states. The supermarket meet-and-greet where Giffords was shot was actually a testimony to just how safe southern Arizona is. As a press release from her office last week put it, ""'Congress on Your Corner' allows residents of Arizona's 8th Congressional District to meet their congresswoman one-on-one and discuss with her any issue, concern or problem involving the federal government."" Not exactly the kind of event a politician would hold in a war zone. (See TIME's complete coverage of the Tucson shooting.) It's true that Giffords was not a fan of the state's anti-immigration bill SB1070, but there were higher-profile opponents, such as her fellow Congressional Representative in Tuscon, Raul Grijalva. Yet the idea that Arizona is under attack has been pushed hard enough that it's very possible that the coward who shot her (in the head, according to a Tucson paper) believed that the 40-year-old Democrat, who had been tarred by some as soft on immigration because she didn't support SB1070, was contributing to larger-scale violence against Arizonans. If that is the case, it would only add to the tragedy. The fact is, that among all the overwrought promises and all the panic I heard last summer in Arizona, I found that Giffords was one of the few politicians offering concrete law enforcement steps that would actually work against the drug cartels and other smugglers. It's not just that she fought for more money and police for border protection, although she did that. She co-sponsored legislation last year with a California Republican that aimed to give law enforcement important new tools in cracking down on the cash cards that were a favored methods of money-laundering. It was one of the many sensible, pragmatic ideas she had for cracking down on crime. Whatever dark fantasies drove someone to try to take her life, Giffords is a sensible politician who was likely shot because she dealt with Arizona's reality, not its rumors.

          / AP WASHINGTON - Eighty-three victims and family members in the worst-ever mass shooting at a U.S. military installation are seeking $750 million in compensation from the Army, alleging that willful negligence enabled psychiatrist Maj. Nidal Hasan to carry out a terrorist attack at Fort Hood, Texas. The administrative claims filed last week said the government had clear warnings that Hasan, who is scheduled to go on trial in March, posed a grave danger to the lives of soldiers and civilians. The government bowed to political correctness and not only ignored the threat Hasan presented but actually promoted him to the rank of major five months before the massacre, according to the administrative claims against the Defense Department, the Justice Department and the FBI. Thirteen soldiers and civilians were killed and more than two dozen soldiers and civilians were injured in the Nov. 5, 2009, shooting spree. Fifty-four relatives of eight of the murdered soldiers have filed claims. One civilian police officer and nine of the injured soldiers have filed claims along with 19 family members of those 10. ""It was unconscionable that Hasan was allowed to continue in the military and ultimately be in the position to perpetrate the only terror attack committed on U.S. soil since 9/11,"" attorney Neal Sher, who represents the claimants, told The Associated Press. Fort Hood victims' kin holding private memorials ""We're aware claims have been filed, but we're not going to comment on it,"" Christopher Haug, chief of media relations for the public affairs office at Fort Hood, said Thursday. ""They'll be taken seriously and they'll go through the legal process."" Among the claimants is a civilian police officer who shot Hasan, Sgt. Kimberly Munley, who was hit in the leg and hand in an exchange of gunfire that has cut short her law enforcement career. She underwent a series of surgeries for her wounds and is on unpaid leave from her post as a civilian police officer with the Army. ""I brought this claim because I strongly believe this tragedy was totally preventable and that the Army swept under the rug what they knew about Hasan,"" Munley said in a statement. Munley and her partner, Sgt. Mark Todd, another civilian officer in Fort Hood's police force, are credited with shooting Hasan, ending the violence. Hasan, an American-born Muslim, faces the death penalty or life in prison without parole if convicted of 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder. U.S. officials have said they believe Hasan's attack was inspired by the radical U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki and that the two men exchanged as many as 20 emails. Al-Awlaki was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in late September. His name has not yet been mentioned in any hearings in the criminal case against Hasan. ""It is a tragic irony that our government sought out and killed al-Awlaki, while Hasan was promoted in the Army which enabled him to carry out his murderous terror attack,"" said Sher, who for many years ran the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations that hunted Nazi criminals living illegally in the United States. He also is a former executive director of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying group. Evidence of Hasan's radicalization to violent Islamist extremism was on full display to his superiors and colleagues during military medical training, according to a Senate report issued in February and included as an exhibit accompanying the claims. In the events leading up to the shooting, an instructor and a colleague each referred to Hasan as a ""ticking time bomb,"" according to the report by Sens. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., and Susan Collins of Maine, the chairman and ranking Republican, respectively, on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. In classroom presentations, Hasan repeatedly spoke of violent Islamist extremism instead of medical subjects and justified suicide bombings, said the report, which concluded that Hasan's superiors failed to discipline him, refer him to counterintelligence officials or seek to discharge him.

For several tense hours, police searched for the gunman. The university announced about 4:30 p.m. that there was “no longer an active threat” on campus. Earlier in the day, witnesses reported seeing the gunman running toward a different parking lot, called the Cage, near Duck Pond Drive.

                                        trucks and other false alarms, he decided to come to school for an appointment. “I figured this would be the same thing, and came to campus anyway,” he said. “I’m fine, but along with
                                        everyone else, this brings back very bad memories and bad associations. That this is actually happening is unbelievable.” Mr. Falco said there was a state trooper parked outside the building and that the police made sure that everyone inside was fine. A bulletin described the gunman, traveling on foot in the direction of a recreational sports building, as a white male, wearing gray sweatpants, gray hat with a neon-green brim, a maroon hoodie and a backpack. Earlier in the day, a student publication, The Collegiate Times, reported that witnesses saw a man matching the suspect’s description. The Virginia State Police have been asked to take the lead in the case, Mr. Owczarski said. On April 16, 2007, a student, Seung-Hui Cho, shot and killed 32 people before killing himself on Virginia Tech’s quiet campus, five hours south
                                        of Washington in the western mountains of Virginia. It was the country’s deadliest shooting, prompting a national outcry and eventually
                                        leading to changes in legislation that closed loopholes that had allowed Mr. Cho to buy guns even though he had been committed to a mental hospital. A university spokesman described the warning system that was activated on campus during and after the shooting in a video interview by WDBJ television in Roanoke, Va..
                                        The university was fined by the Department of Education earlier this year for waiting too long to notify students after the 2007 attack. According to reports, the campus police chief and other university officials
                                        were in Washington on Thursday to appeal a $55,000 fine related to this delay. Students in Torgersen Hall, a classroom building with large study areas, posted images and video said to depict heavily armed police officers secured
                                        the building and briefed those assembled. Thursday was the last day of a reading period before finals at Virginia Tech and there were no classes scheduled. The university said exams would be postponed.   Exams scheduled for tomorrow have been postponed, according to Virginia TechThu Dec 08 20:01:11  via TweetDeck

CollegiateTimes   Hayley Bance, a freshman animal science student from Richmond, Va., said she was sitting with some friends in a dining area of Squires Student Center when the building suddenly became a flurry of police activity. “It was unreal. It just didn’t feel like it was happening on this campus,” Ms. Bance said. “Then we were told to move away from the windows and were taken upstairs. We saw these two police
                                        officers with huge guns.

Emmanuel Costas (myFOXorlando) ORLANDO, Fla. – An 18-year-old student has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after he allegedly threatened to carry out a ""Columbine"" type massacre at his Orlando high school next year. Lake Brantley High School student Emmanuel Costas was arrested Tuesday after posting multiple threats on Facebook and in text messages that he was going to carry out violence against other students. ""It was clear he planned on carrying out this attack in the school lunch room,"" Altamonte Springs police chief Michael Deal said. ""He admitted to sending these texts and he admitted to posting similar [messages on his] Facebook page. During his interview, he also made disturbing comments that he respected individuals that carried out the Columbine massacre."" Investigators released transcripts of the text messages on Wednesday afternoon. One message read, ""Everybody prepare yourselfs 4/17 let the carnage begin,"" while another read, ""A day of terror will strike upon everyone's soul."" Two days after these texts were received, a third message was sent which read, ""Damn 4/17/12 is going to be a day to remember dat day will bring joy to me and sadness to OTHERS."" Police say they also recovered papers from Costas' backpack and his home, which also documented his threats to carrying out a mass shooting at the school. Costas was charged with attempted felony murder and written threats to kill or do bodily harm. He is being held without bond at the John E. Polk Correctional Facility, about 25 miles northeast of Orlando. Costas' older sister told myFOXorlando that she did not believe her brother was capable of carrying out a Columbine-style act. ""No not at all. He's not that type of person,"" she said. ""He just thought it was funny and stuff like that."" Twelve students and one teacher were shot dead by senior students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999. The pair, who had earlier made threats online about their violent plans, shot themselves before being caught by police.

Michael Warzybok, victim Michelle Fournier's boyfriend, spoke to the media following the arraignment of Scott Dekraai, the man suspected of killing eight people in a shooting rampage at a Seal Beach salon, Tuesday morning at Orange County Superior Court in Santa Ana. Dekraai plead not guilty.  SANTA ANA – The disgruntled ex-husband charged with killing his ex-wife and seven others in a Seal Beach beauty salon in Orange County’s deadliest mass shooting pleaded not guilty Tuesday morning at his continued arraignment. Scott Evans Dekraai, 42, stood in a mustard-colored jail uniform in a courtroom holding cell as his lawyer – Deputy Public Defender Scott Sanders – denied all charges and allegations and asked for a preliminary hearing for April 24. Dekraai, who is being held without bail in the case that could lead to a death sentence, was emotionless throughout the one-minute hearing before Superior Court Judge Erick Larsh, speaking only when asked if he agreed to postpone his preliminary hearing for five months. Nearly 30 friends and relatives of the slaying victims sat teary-eyed in the first four rows of Larsh’s courtroom. Several hugged each other afterwards with tears streaming down their faces. Later, several supporters talked with reporters. Paul Wilson, the husband of victim Christy Wilson, said the attention should be focused on the families and friends of the victims who continue to suffer in the aftermath of the killing spree, and not on Dekraai. “He is a coward whose soul has been in hell for a very, very long time,” Wilson said. Dekraai, who has grown a full beard since his initial court appearance, is charged with the special circumstances murders of eight people during a two-minute bloodbath at the Salon Meritage on Pacific Coast Highway shortly after 1 p.m. Oct. 12. Seal Beach police say he entered the salon armed with three guns after arguing with his ex-wife, Michelle Fournier – a stylist at the salon – over the custody of their 8-year-old son. Fournier, 48, was the first to die, shot at close range, according to authorities, as she attended to a longtime customer and friend. Dekraai then shot her customer – Christy Wilson, who also worked at the salon – and then Randy Fannin, the shop’s owner, according to police who said he confessed after his arrest. Dekraai then turned his guns on other employees and customers before he walked out of the salon and got into his pickup, according to police. He also shot and killed a man sitting in his parked Land Rover in the parking lot before driving away, police said. He was arrested about a half-mile from the crime scene after several witnesses pointed out his pickup to Seal Beach police, who were summoned by several 911 calls. Dekraai, a former tugboat crewman, surrendered without resistance to the patrolman who pulled him over, and quickly said, “I know what I did,” according to court documents. Before the day was over, Dekraai told Seal Beach police detectives that he had argued that morning with Fournier on the phone over their custody arrangement for their son, and then armed himself with three guns and drove to the beach to ponder killing his ex-wife. Dekraai confessed to driving to Salon Meritage, and launching the shooting spree, according to a detective’s affidavit in support of a search warrant. He told detectives that several of the victims were “collateral damage” after he killed his wife, according to the search warrant. He also admitted shooting Dave Caouette in his parked Land Rover because he thought he was a plainclothes or undercover police office, according to the search warrant. Several witnesses also indentified Dekraai – who is 6 feet, 3 inches tall and weighs more than 250 pounds – as the hulking gunman who systematically shot employees and customers. Sanders, whose office was appointed to represent Dekraai at the previous court hearing, agreed with Deputy District Attorney Scott Simmons to the April 24 preliminary hearing, which will test the evidence to determine of Dekraai should stand trial. But Sanders also told Larsh that he felt it was unlikely that he would be ready to proceed on that day Simmons said that the preliminary hearing was set five months off because of the complexities of the case, which have generated thousands of pages of documents and hundreds of interviews of potential witnesses. The prosecutor said his office is developing information in anticipation of an insanity defense, although Sanders has not mentioned that as a possibility yet. Several relatives and friends of Michelle Fournier told reporters in the impromptu news conference that they were angered over early media reports that appeared to criticize her parenting of Dominic, her 8-year-old son, with Dekraai. They said they were particularly upset over reports from the search warrant where detectives quoted Dekraai as claiming the boy would be covered in bruises after being with his mom. “That’s bull,” said Butch Fournier, one of Michelle’s brothers. “She was a terrific mom.” &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Your browser does not support iframes.&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; Contact the writer: lwelborn@ocregister.com or 714-834-3784 Get the latest news delivered daily!

In another photo, Santa cradles a toddler dressed in camouflage, while a man and woman stand close by with rifles with foldable stocks. In another image, five young women pose with AR-15 and other rifles. Ron Kennedy, general manager of the Scottsdale gun club, said the business got the idea for the photographs last year when a club member happened to come in dressed as Santa Claus and other members wanted their picture taken with him while they were holding their guns. ""Our customers have been looking for a fun and safe way to express their holiday spirit and passion for firearms,"" said Kennedy, noting people have used the photos for Christmas cards and Facebook posts. About 500 people showed up to the first of two sittings on Saturday. Kennedy, whose facility offers guns for sale and to rent and has a 32-lane indoor shooting range, said the event was not aimed at children, but the club supports the right of parents to include children in the photos. The guns used in the photos are not loaded and have had their firing pins removed, and their chambers are regularly cleared to ensure safety, Kennedy said. To buy a semi-automatic rifle in the US, a buyer must be at least 18 years old and cannot be a convicted felon. The requirements for prospective buyers of fully automatic machine guns include being at least 21 years old, not being a convicted felon and getting a special license from federal firearms agents. Democratic state Representative Steve Farley, who proposed an unsuccessful ban on large-capacity gun magazines like the one used in the 8 January mass shooting in Tucson, Arizona, that killed six people and wounded congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and 12 others, said the gun club's photo event was inappropriate. ""To involve machine guns and Santa in a celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ is the worst kind of heresy I can imagine,"" said Farley. ""I would suggest that the people who created this read some of the New Testament."" Kennedy said the club is simply trying to provide a safe holiday event that's an expression of their passions. ""It's more of a celebration of their Second Amendment rights,"" Kennedy said. He said the club will continue holding the events in future years if there's a demand from customers for it."

The shooting occurred at a mobile home in Bay City, about 65 miles southwest of downtown Houston. Police responded at 3:18 p.m. (4:18 p.m. ET) Wednesday to a call that a woman had been shot.

",http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2011/dec/08/virginia-tech-says-shots-fired-campus/,en,True,"education and schools,colleges and universities,police,murders and attempted murders",56,Arkansas Democrat-Gazette ,http://www2.arkansasonline.com/,"RICHMOND, Va. — A man killed a police officer and another person after a traffic stop Thursday at Virginia Tech, sending a shudder through campus as students and faculty were told to stay inside and police searched for the gunman, school officials said. It was the first gunfire on campus since 33 people were killed in 2007 in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The deaths came on the same day university officials were in Washington appealing a fine that federal officials gave them over the school’s response five years ago. The campus was swarming Thursday with heavily armed officers walking around campus. Caravans of SWAT vehicles and other police cars with emergency lights flashing patrolled nearby. Students hunkered down in buildings. “A lot of people, especially toward the beginning were scared,” said Jared Brumfield, a 19-year-old freshman from Culpeper, Va., who was locked in the Squires Student Center since around 1:30 p.m. “A lot of people are loosening up now. I guess we’re just waiting it out, waiting for it to be over.” The school said a police officer pulled someone over for a traffic stop and was shot and killed. The shooter ran toward a nearby parking lot, where a second person was found dead. Various alerts were sent out to students and the university is sending updates about every 30 minutes, regardless of whether they have any new information, school spokesman Mark Owczarski said. “We deployed them all, and we deployed them immediately to get the word out,” he said. The shooter was described as a white man wearing gray sweat pants, a gray hat with neon green brim, a maroon hoodie and backpack. “It’s crazy that someone would go and do something like that with all the stuff that happened in 2007,” said Corey Smith, a 19-year-old sophomore from Mechanicsville, Va., who was headed to a dining hall near the site of one of the shootings. He told The Associated Press that he stayed inside after seeing the alerts from the school. “It’s just weird to think about why someone would do something like this when the school’s had so many problems,” Smith said. Harry White, 20, a junior physics major, said he was in line for a sandwich at a restaurant in a campus building when he received the text message alert. White said he didn’t panic, thinking instead about a false alarm about a possible gunman that locked down the campus in August. White used an indoor walkway to go to a computer lab in an adjacent building, where he checked news reports. “I decided to just check to see how serious it was. I saw it’s actually someone shooting someone, not something false, something that looks like a gun,” White said. Campus was quieter than usual because classes ended Wednesday and students were preparing for exams, which were to begin Friday. The school said those tests would be postponed. The shooting came soon after the conclusion of a hearing where Virginia Tech was appealing a $55,000 fine by the U.S. Education Department in connection with the university’s response to the 2007 rampage. The department said the school violated the law by waiting more than two hours after two students were shot to death in their dorm before sending an email warning. By then, student gunman Seung-Hui Cho was chaining the doors to a classroom building where he killed 30 more people and then himself. The department said the email was too vague because it mentioned only a “shooting incident,” not the deaths. The university’s police chief, Wendell Flinchum, testified Thursday there were no immediate signs in the dorm to indicate a threat to the campus. He said the shootings were believed to be an isolated domestic incident and that the shooter had fled. Since the massacre, the school expanded its emergency notification systems. Alerts now go out by electronic message boards in classrooms, by text messages and other methods. Other colleges and universities have put in place similar systems. Universities are required under the Clery Act to provide warnings in a timely manner and to report the number of crimes on campus. On Thursday, during about a one-hour period, the university issued four separate alerts. In August, a report of a possible gunman at Virginia Tech set off the longest, most extensive lockdown and search on campus since 2007. No gunman was found, and the school gave the all-clear about five hours after sirens began wailing and students and staff members started receiving warnings. The system was also put to the test in 2008, when an exploding nail gun cartridge was mistaken for gunfire. Only one dorm was locked down during that emergency, and it reopened two hours later.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. BLACKSBURG, Va. – The Virginia Tech police officer who was shot dead in his parked cruiser was a trained firearms and defense instructor with a specialty in crisis intervention. His death leaves investigators puzzling over how and why a gunman walked up to the patrol car during a traffic stop, killed the officer and wound up dead himself in a nearby parking lot. The campus shooting prompted officials to lock down the university for hours Thursday while police and SWAT teams searched the school, the scene in 2007 of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Authorities have in-car video from officer Deriek W. Crouse's cruiser that shows a male suspect with a handgun at the officer's car at the time of the shooting. But they have not identified the gunman and say they don't know what motivated the killing or whether there was any link between the shooter and Crouse. The shooter was not a student, university spokesman Larry Hincker said Friday. He declined to identify the suspect any more closely and said the information would come from state police, who scheduled a news conference for 10 a.m. Crouse, an Army veteran and married father of five, was killed after pulling a driver over in a school parking lot. Police said the gunman was not involved in the traffic stop. Instead, he approached, shot the officer and then fled on foot before apparently killing himself in another lot. ""At this point, we haven't been able to establish any kind of immediate connection between the officer and the shooter,"" State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller told The Associated Press late Thursday. ""That's obviously something that's being looked into."" State police said in a news release early Friday that ballistics tests confirmed Crouse and the deceased suspect had been shot by the same handgun. The tests have ""officially linked the two fatal shootings,"" the release said. The news release said clothing found inside a discarded backpack recovered by Blacksburg police seemed to match that of the male subject in the officer's video. Police said they were awaiting confirmation of the deceased suspect's identity as well as autopsy results from the medical examiner in Roanoke. The events unfolded on the same day Virginia Tech officials were in Washington, fighting a federal government fine over their handling of the 2007 massacre where 33 people were killed. The shooting brought back painful memories. About 150 students gathered silently for a candlelight vigil on a field facing the stone plaza memorial for the 2007 victims. An official vigil is planned for Friday night. Police would not rule out a connection between the shootings and an armed robbery Wednesday in Radford, about 10 miles from Blacksburg. According to media reports, Radford police were looking for a man they considered armed and dangerous after an armed robbery at a local real estate office. Police said Crouse called in the traffic stop at 12:15 p.m. After a few minutes passed without hearing from the officer, dispatch tried to get in touch with him, but didn't get a response. About 15 minutes later, police received the first call from a witness who said an officer had been shot at the Cassell Coliseum parking lot and the gunman had fled on foot. Authorities refused to say whether Crouse was able to defend himself or fire back at his assailant. Local, state and federal officials responded immediately. At 1 p.m., an officer saw a suspicious man in a parking lot. He had a gunshot wound and a gun nearby. This time, though, the school applied the lessons learned during the last tragedy, locking down the campus and using a high-tech alert system to warn students and faculty members to stay indoors. Heavily armed officers swarmed the campus and caravans of SWAT vehicles and other police cars with emergency lights flashing patrolled nearby. Crouse was an Army veteran and married father of five children and stepchildren who joined the campus police force in October 2007. He previously worked at a jail and for the Montgomery County sheriff's department. He was a jokester who enjoyed riding his motorcycle and rock music, his friend Aaron Proden told the AP. The two recently saw Metallica in concert in Charlotte, N.C. Crouse recently invited Proden to go on a ride-along ""just to see what he does, his job, his lifestyle,"" the friend said. ""He was a standup guy,"" said Rusty Zarger, a former neighbor whose two young daughters used to play with Crouse's sons at the townhouse complex where they lived. ""He was very mild-mannered, very confident. You could tell he was strong in believing in himself, but very comfortable."" Zarger said that after the Fourth of July, Crouse had leftover fireworks and went around the complex knocking on doors to get neighbors — especially the children — to watch him set them off. ""He came over and got all the kids to come outside and watch it — made it a very community thing when he didn't have to,"" Zarger said. A woman who answered the door at the Crouse home at the end of a three-unit townhouse building Thursday night said it wasn't a good time to talk, and they were trying to get the children to bed. A group of people were sitting around a table inside. Crouse was one of about 50 officers on the campus force, which also has 20 full- and part-time security guards. Crouse received an award in 2008 for his commitment to the department's drunken driving efforts. He was trained as a crisis intervention officer and as a general, firearms and defensive tactics instructor. ""In light of the turmoil and trauma and the tragedy suffered by this campus by guns, I can only say words don't describe our feelings and they're elusive at this point in time,"" university president Charles Steger said. ""Our hearts are broken again for the family of our police officer."" The school was a bit quieter than usual because classes ended Wednesday. About 20,000 of the university's 30,000 students were on campus when the officer was shot. Exams, set to begin Friday, were postponed until Saturday. The university also said its counseling center would be open all day Friday for students. ""A lot of people, especially toward the beginning, were scared,"" said Jared Brumfield, a 19-year-old freshman from Culpeper, Va., who was locked in the Squires Student Center. Harry White, 20, a junior physics major, said he was in line for a sandwich at a restaurant in a campus building when he received the text message alert. White said he didn't panic, thinking instead about a false alarm involving a possible gunman that locked down the campus in August. White used an indoor walkway to go to a computer lab in an adjacent building, where he checked news reports. ""I decided to just check to see how serious it was.

Alerts now go out by electronic message boards in classrooms, by text messages and other methods. Other colleges and universities have put in place similar systems. Andrew Goddard, who has crusaded for stiffer gun control laws since his son Colin was wounded in the 2007 shootings, said Virginia Tech's response seemed substantially better this time. ""It sounds like things moved very, very fast this time as opposed to the time before,"" said Goddard, whose daughter and nephew go to the school. ""That doesn't surprise me. Virginia Tech really did get the message in the sense that when bad things are happening, you have to ask quickly."" During about a one-hour period on Thursday, the university issued four separate alerts. Derek O'Dell, a third-year veterinary student at Virginia Tech who was wounded in the 2007 shooting, was shaken. ""It just brings up a lot of bad feelings, bad memories,"" said O'Dell, who was at his home a couple of miles from campus at the time of the shootings. ""At first I was just hoping it was a false alarm,"" he said. ""Then there were reports of two people dead, and the second person shot was in the parking lot where I usually park to go to school, so it was kind of surreal."" ___ Associated Press writers Eric Tucker, Kimberly Hefling and Ben Nuckols in Washington; Michael Felberbaum, Larry O'Dell, Steve Szkotak, Bob Lewis and Dena Potter in Richmond, Va.; and Brock Vergakis in Norfolk, Va., contributed to this report.

Virginia State Police on Friday identified Ross Truett Ashley, 22, as the man who killed Virginia Tech Police Officer Deriek Crouse and then himself about 30 minutes later. A part-time student at Radford University, 15 miles southwest of Blacksburg, Ashley had no connection to or contact with Crouse before Thursday's shooting, according to a news release from state police. ""State police investigators are continuing their work to establish a motive in the killing and to re-create Ashley's movements in the days and hours leading up to the murder-suicide,"" police said. Ashley entered a real estate office in Radford with a handgun Wednesday and demanded the keys to a white 2011 Mercedes SUV, according to police. He drove off in the car, which was found the next day on the Virginia Tech campus. That's where and when Ashley and Crouse were found dead, about a quarter mile away from each other. Ballistics evidence shows that both were fatally shot with the same gun, state police said Friday. Police have said they believe Ashley matches the description of the man who shot the officer. Thursday's double shooting conjured memories from April 16, 2007, when student Seung-Hui Cho killed 33 people at Virginia Tech in a mass shooting. ""Once again, the campus and the community that we love so well have been visited by senseless violence and tragic loss,"" Virginia Tech President Charles W. Steger said in a statement. ""Tragedy again struck Virginia Tech in a wanton act of violence where our police officer, Deriek Crouse, was murdered during a routine traffic stop."" The scale and facts of Thursday's shooting differ significantly from the incident four years ago. Still, it served as a test of the policies the school has implemented since that tragedy. The latest incident began about 12:15 p.m. Thursday, when Crouse, who had been a Virginia Tech officer for four years, pulled over someone during a routine traffic stop in the Cassell Coliseum parking lot near McComas Hall. Cassell Coliseum houses athletic facilities. McComas Hall houses exercise facilities. Shortly before 12:30 p.m., police received their first call from a person who said he'd seen the suspect -- not the driver of the car that had been pulled over -- approach the officer's vehicle and open fire. The shooter ran from the area. Police said Ashley changed out of his wool cap and pullover at the Virginia Tech greenhouses and put them in a backpack. A Montgomery County deputy sheriff who was on-site because of the first shooting eventually spotted a man who was walking toward the on-campus ""Cage"" parking lot. The deputy sheriff temporarily lost sight of this man as he drove toward him, according to the state police chronicle of events released Friday. ""When the deputy finally reached the subject, the man was on the ground and deceased from a self-inflicted gunshot wound,"" police said. This person didn't have any identification on him and was wearing clothing different from that worn by the person who had shot Crouse, police added. But that clothing was recovered later Thursday in the backpack Ashley had left behind. Maj. Rick Jenkins of the Virginia State Police said a video camera mounted inside the slain officer's car captured footage of a man with a weapon who matched the description of the man they'd found dead. In addition to the law enforcement activity, Virginia Tech's updated communications efforts -- which received criticism in 2007, for not letting students know quickly or extensively enough what was happening then -- were also put in focus during Thursday's incident. Campus officials put out six alerts to students and faculty about the shooting. On Thursday, law enforcement and school officials said the alert system put in place in recent years worked well, from technological and communications standpoints. Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, whose daughter attends Virginia Tech, lauded the communications effort. McDonnell said his daughter was confined to a basement classroom during the four-hour episode. ""Like so many parents who had children on the Virginia Tech campus, I felt a lot of that angst and uncertainty,"" he said. ""Again, I want to express my gratitude to law enforcement for making sure that they kept the faculty (and) parents regularly informed."" Crouse, 39, joined the Virginia Tech police force six months after the 2007 mass shooting, according to a release on the school's website. A U.S. Army veteran who had worked at the New River Valley jail and with the Montgomery County Sheriff's Department, the Christiansburg resident is survived by his wife, as well as five children and stepchildren. The man who killed Crouse is from Partlow, a town about 45 miles north of Richmond in Virginia's Spotsylvania County. Radford University said Friday in a statement that Ashley was a business management major at the school. Citing the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, the university said ""no additional information on Mr. Ashley can be provided."" Radford President Penny Kyle said counseling would be made available to that university's students, akin to services offered at Virginia Tech. Already, members of the Virginia Tech community have come together since the shootings. For instance, scores of people came together on the Blacksburg campus for a candlelight vigil on Thursday night, one day after a similar, smaller event was held. A student-organized group that calls itself Hokies for Crouse said at 9:40 p.m. Friday on its website that it had raised more than $31,734 for the slain officer's family."

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Dec. 8: Authorities respond to reports of shots fired in the parking lot of Virginia Tech's Cassell Coliseum. (WDBJ-TV) BLACKSBURG, Va. -- The man who authorities say killed a Virginia Tech police officer was described as a typical college student in many ways, making it difficult to understand why he would commit an armed robbery and then, apparently at random, target the patrolman before killing himself. The gunman was identified Friday as Ross Truett Ashley, a 22-year-old part-time business student at Radford University, about 10 miles from the Virginia Tech campus in Blacksburg. He first drew authorities' attention Wednesday when, they say, he walked into his landlord's office with a handgun and demanded the keys to a Mercedes-Benz SUV. As investigators worked to unravel a motive, thousands of people gathered for a candlelight vigil Friday night on a campus all too familiar with tragedy. Those who knew Ashley said he could be standoffish. He liked to run down the hallways and recently shaved his head, a neighbor said. Virginia State Police said he walked up to officer Deriek W. Crouse after noon on Thursday and shot him to death as the patrolman sat in his unmarked cruiser during a traffic stop. Ashley was not involved in the stop and did not know the driver, who is cooperating with police, they said. Authorities said Ashley then took off for the campus greenhouses, ditching his pullover, wool cap and backpack as police quickly sent out a campus-wide alert that a gunman was on the loose. Officials said the alert system put in place after the nation's worst mass slaying in recent memory worked well, but it nevertheless rattled a community still coping with the day a student gunman killed 32 people and then himself. A deputy sheriff on patrol noticed a man acting suspiciously in a parking lot about a half-mile from the shooting. The deputy drove up and down the rows of the sprawling Cage parking lot and lost sight of the man for a moment, then found Ashley shot to death on the pavement, a handgun nearby. No one saw him take his life and he wasn't carrying any ID. State police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said Ashley appears to have acted alone and didn't know the slain officer: ""At this time we have no connection between the two of them, that they knew one another or had encountered one another prior to the shooting,"" she said. Ashley lived in an apartment on the top floor of a worn, gray three-story brick building in the small city of Radford, a college town. He lived above a yogurt shop, consignment store, barber shop and a tattoo parlor. On Friday night, students popped in and out of the building visiting friends. Mandy Adams, a Radford grad student, said Ashley had recently shaved his head. Other than running down the hallways, he was quiet, she said. ""He would just run down the hallway -- never walk, always run,"" said Adams, who was out on a rear fire escape with a glass of white wine and a cigarette to calm her nerves. ""It's going to be really creepy when they come to take his stuff out of here."" Neighbor Nan Forbes, a Radford senior, said Ashley was rarely seen or heard from. She said she knew he was in trouble when she saw two police officers guarding the door to his apartment ""It does freak us out because we live in this building, but there was not one peep of trouble, nothing unusual,"" she said. Ashley made the dean's list in 2008 at the University of Virginia-Wise, which is located in southwest Virginia. He took classes at Radford, a former state teachers college in the Blue Ridge Mountains that now has more than 9,000 students. Officials at Radford or UVA-Wise were not immediately able to talk in detail about Ashley. At the Virginia Tech campus, thousands of people silently filled the Drillfield for a candlelight vigil Friday night to remember Crouse, a firearms and defense instructor with a specialty in crisis intervention. He had been on the campus force for four years, joining it about six months after the April 16, 2007 massacre. Crouse was a member of the Army Reserves who served a year in Iraq beginning in March 2004, according to the U.S. Army Human Resources Command. He was assigned to active duty service at Fort Hood, Texas from October 1993 until July 1996, where he was listed as an M1 armor crewman, or tank operator. From July 1996 to May 2001, Crouse was listed as a motor transport operator with the 316th Sustainment Command in Galax, Va. Crouse's last rank was staff sergeant. For about nine months in 2007, Crouse worked as an officer with the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office at the county's jail before leaving for the Virginia Tech police, said Capt. Brian Wright, a spokesman with the department. Those who worked with Crouse remembered him as a ""great employee"" and a ""hard worker,"" said Wright, who had worked security with Crouse at Virginia Tech football games. ""He was just very personable, easy to talk to,"" Wright said. ""Everybody liked him."" The Friday night vigil included a moment of silence and closed with two trumpeters stationed across the field from each other playing ""Echo Taps"" as students raised their candles. ""Let's go!"" one student then shouted. ""Hokies!"" everyone else responded. Kathleen O'Dwyer, a fifth-year engineering major at Tech, said it was important to come for Crouse's family. Crouse was married and had five children and stepchildren. ""Also it's for the community, to see the violence that happens isn't what we're about,"" said O'Dwyer, who will be graduating next week. Her plans when she leaves school? ""First, go home and hug my mom,"" O'Dwyer said. Nobody answered the door Friday evening at Ashley's parents' home in Spotsylvania County, along the Interstate 95 corridor between Richmond and Washington. The house was dark and no vehicles were in the driveway. The two-story, log cabin-style home in a semi-rural area sits about 200 yards off the road up a narrow gravel drive. Billie Jo Phillippe, who lives three houses down, said she didn't really associate with the family. ""They stay off to themselves a lot,"" she said. ""He was a clean-cut young guy but standoffish.""Authorities declined to answer some questions about Ashley, including whether he had any mental health issues or was licensed to carry a handgun. But Gov. Bob McDonnell commented briefly on the shooting while helping load presents into a van for the Marine Corps Reserves' Toys for Tots program. ""Some crimes, there's a relationship between a perpetrator and a victim, and some there aren't,"" said McDonnell, a former prosecutor and attorney general. ""There are random acts of violence, they involve either mental health issues, or robbery, or other motivations....Unfortunately in our society random acts of violence do occur, we unfortunately see it every day somewhere in this country."" He said there's an ""extra degree of scrutiny"" of incidents at Virginia Tech because of the 2007 mass shooting. ""It's just unfortunate and almost inexplicable that you could have a series of these events happen in a short four-year period,"" the governor said.

        Evan McMorris-Santoro Posted on December 5, 2015, at 7:37 p.m. ET KEENE, New Hampshire — Bernie Sanders vowed once again not to change his campaign focus Saturday after a week that saw the political conversation shift to ISIS after the mass shooting in San Bernardino and weeks after the attack in Paris. Sticking once again to his populist economic message in two speeches at New Hampshire universities, Sanders warned that the all-powerful ""they"" are using ISIS to distract voters away from America's systemic problems. ""As a nation and as a people, we have got to understand that our country faces a myriad of very serious problems... if you turn on the TV, what they now say is, 'Well we've got one problem, it's ISIS,"" Sanders said, launching into a sarcastic impression of the ""they"" on television this week. ""'We don't have to worry about old people not having enough to eat. We don't have to worry about having more people in jail than any other country. We don't have to worry about the disappearing middle class. We don't have to worry about economic and wealth inequality...we don't have to worry about institutional racism, or a broken criminal justice. We don't have to worry about that. All we should focus on now, 24/7, is ISIS,'"" Sanders said. ""Here's what I say,"" he went on, ""I say that ISIS must be destroyed and I say that we have got to build a coalition which destroys ISIS. But I say that we are a great enough country and a smart enough country that we can destroy ISIS at the same time as rebuild a disappearing middle class. We can do both."" The line was almost word-for-word what Sanders told voters in Cleveland last month after the attacks in Paris once again led to talk of ISIS on the presidential campaign trail. His campaign schedule Saturday made good on the promise. In Keene he talked about ISIS for a few minutes at the end of his standard long stump speech about income equality, election spending, climate change, immigration, universal health care, criminal justice, marijuana decriminalization and the nation's ""drift toward oligarchy."" Gun control, a major focus of Sanders' activities in the Senate last week, didn't get a mention in Keene. At Plymouth State University — the second stop of the two-stop day — Sanders did push for his standard gun control agenda, tying mention of San Bernardino into the larger conversation about gun violence. He also did the ISIS bit during the speech. The section includes shaming Middle Eastern nations like Qatar and Saudi Arabia for not doing more to fight ISIS and vowing not to send large numbers of American troops into the conflict. Sanders has repeatedly warned against a quagmire in the Middle East and citied his own vote against the war in Iraq. But it was clear ISIS — or gun control — is not going to be Sanders' rhetorical priorities after San Bernardino. The big news from Sanders' campaign Saturday was the opening rounds of a full-scale carbon emissions reduction policy plan rollout that will continue in the coming days. Sanders vowed to impose a carbon tax, reduce carbon emissions across the board by 40% by 2030 and 80% by 2050. Evan McMorris-Santoro is the White House correspondent for BuzzFeed News.

240399676,2011-12-08 12:00:00,"Virginia Tech police officer, one other killed on campus",http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/crime-scene/post/shots-fired-at-virginia-tech-campus/2011/12/08/gIQApjNafO_blog.html?hpid=z1,en,False,"education and schools,colleges and universities,police,murders and attempted murders",2,Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,"A Virginia Tech police officer was fatally shot Thursday during a routine traffic stop on the Blacksburg campus and a second person was found slain in a nearby parking lot after the gunman fled, the university reports. Law enforcement and government officials said that the person found dead in the parking lot is the gunman who killed the officer. At a news conference late this afternoon, neither state police nor university officials would confirm that the dead man was the suspect. But the authorities said there no longer was a threat on campus and they lifted an afternoon-long lockdown. Earlier, a campus-wide message warned students, “Stay indoors. Secure in place.” There are no classes today at the university, as students have a reading day to prepare for finals, which were to begin Friday. University officials postponed Friday’s exams.  The university said on its Web site that a routine traffic stop prompted the shootings. The gunman was not the person who was pulled over, state police said at a news conference. Authorities did not identify the officer, but said he was a four-year veteran of the department. Virginia Tech said in a statement that a weapon had been found by the second person found dead. Officials said at an afternoon news conference that a police officer first saw that person in the parking lot, and the person was still alive. They said the officer did not shoot him. Virginia State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said police were trying to identify the person and that no determination of suicide had been made. Geller said police believe only one suspect was involved in the shooting of the officer, and that the possibility that the suspect then killed himself is also being investigated. Jermaine Holmes, director of academic support services for student athletes, said the shooting appeared to be a traffic stop gone awry. “It’s right across from our building in the parking lot,” he said. “It didn’t appear to be just a kind of random shooting.” “The facilities folks locked down the building immediately,” he said. ”We’re not allowing any students or staff to leave.” The second body was found in a parking lot a short distance away from the original shooting, in the direction the gunman fled. Virginia Tech, a public campus of about 30,000 students, has one of the nation’s most advanced security alert systems, installed after the nation’s worst campus shooting, a 2007 rampage by student Seung Hui Cho that left 33 dead, including the shooter. University officials were criticized for taking too long to lock down the campus that day and have dramatically overhauled their alert system. The entire campus was on lockdown Thursday. In 2007, though, there was a two-hour delay from the discovery of Cho’s first two victims to the first e-mail alert to campus. Thirty others were killed in between, in an academic building. But on Thursday, alerts went out by e-mail, text-message, electronic message boards in classrooms and audible alarms on campus within minutes of the gunshots. Virginia Tech’s emergency response protocols are considered a model for other schools. “We deployed them all, and we deployed them immediately,” said Mark Owczarski, university spokesman, at a news conference. The shooting happened, by chance, on a day when Virginia Tech officials were in Washington to appeal a $55,000 federal penalty from the U.S. Department of Education over the university’s response to the 2007 massacre. Virginia Tech Police Chief Wendell Flinchum was among the scheduled witnesses, according to a report in the Roanoke Times newspaper. Today’s report of shots fired came in the noon hour. The first alert advised of gunshots reported at the school’s Coliseum parking lot, off Washington Street and Spring Road, in a southern section of campus devoted to athletics. It told the community to stay inside and secure doors. A second alert described a suspect as “white male, gray sweat pants, gray hat w/neon green brim, maroon hoodie and backpack,” and said he was “on foot towards McComas,” a facility housing health and counseling services. Matt Banfield, a senior from Williamsburg who is a representative on the board of visitors, said shortly after 3 p.m. that hundreds of students were still waiting in the Squires Student Center on lockdown. People were calm, he said, watching the news and checking their phones, or listening for updates from staff members. “The way the university staff is handling this … has been very comforting.” They’re handing out bottles of water and giving constant updates, he said. Students were alerted by the university in many ways, he said, including e-mails, phone calls, texts, Web site updates, and scrolling messages on the clocks in all the buildings. He feels safe, he said. “It is unfortunate that because of our past, I think people think that stuff like this happens here all the time. This could happen any place. I feel no less safe now than I have at any other point here.” Ankit Ahuja said he was among several dozen students studying at Newman Library when the campus was locked down. Told to stay away from the windows, students were staying calm and watching television for news updates, he said. “I’m just thinking about the repercussions of this,” he said. “I think for the next few weeks they’ll have stricter security on campus.” A 23-year-old graduate student from New Delhi, Ahuja said he chose Virginia Tech because of its reputation for high-quality research in his field, computer science. He knew about the 2007 shooting, but it didn’t concern him. “That was a one-off incident,” he said. “It could happen anyplace.” Shawn Ghuman, a sophomore at Virginia Tech from McLean, said that he got the first alert about the gunshots when he was in the dining hall next to his dormitory, Harper Hall, on the west side of campus near where the first shots were fired. And by the time he went outside to go back to his room, he said the campus already looked empty. “They did a really good job keeping us alerted and telling everyone to stay indoors,” he said The alerts go out via e-mail, text and robocall, he said. Students are in the middle of finals this week, and he has been going to study sessions. From the third floor window of his dorm, he can see police cars and TV trucks. I’m nervous about our reputation,” he said. “Tech’s a great school.” Freshman Miles Curley, 19, of Rock Hill, S.C., said he was leaving his dorm, Cochrane Hall, when he received a text message alert about the shooting. He had been headed for his car parked nearby in the Coliseum lot, where shots were fired. Curley said he immediately returned to his room, where he could hear sirens. He’s been checking Twitter and television news since then, he said, and fielding phone calls and texts from worried friends and family. “It’s what happened in ’07 — it’s kind of crazy to think that something even close to that would ever happen again,” Curley said. “I’m praying for anyone who’s affected.” Freshman Matthew Spencer was walking to a bus stop about 12:30 or 12:45 p.m. when he saw police running and driving by and paramedics running to an area near the bus stop. There’s a large parking lot between the stadium and McComas Hall, where students work out, he said. At least 10 police cars were in the area around Washington Street and the basketball arena, he said. That’s when he got the alert from the university to get inside. About 1:45 p.m., he saw officers racing to another part of campus. “At least 15 police and undercover cars took off on Washington Street and headed towards the town and or that side of campus where Torgenson Bridge is,” he said. “Everyone in the hallway is freaked out and stuff,” he said. He was in eighth grade when the mass shooting happened. “I lived in Christiansburg during the massacres, so it’s kind of scary.”  Staff writers Emma Brown, Michael Alison Chandler, Tom Jackman, Susan Svrluga and Clarence Williams contributed to this report.

Officials have not released the total amount that was raised. The Seal Beach Chamber of Commerce teamed up with the city and the owners of the salon’s building, Watson & Associates, to coordinate the donations and their distribution. In mid-October, a man walked into some of the Main Street stores and asked for donations. That prompted the chamber to issue an immediate flier alerting local merchants of potential ‘scam artists’ invading Seal Beach who were “posing as an ‘official source’ to donate funds to the victims of this tragedy.” City and chamber officials urged anyone who wanted to help financially to donate to the trust via the Seal Beach Victims’ Fund. Salon owner Randy Fannin was killed. His wife, Sandy, survived and was in the back of the salon when the shootings occurred. The others killed were salon employees Victoria Buzzo, Michelle Fournier, Laura Webb Elody and Christy Wilson, clients Michele Fast and Lucia Kondas and finally, David Caouette, who was shot while sitting outside the salon in his car. The ninth victim, who survived, was Hattie Stretz. She was in the salon to get her hair done by her daughter, Laura Webb Elody. Police arrested Scott Dekraai, Fournier’s ex-husband. The two were engaged in a bitter custody battle over their young son. The Orange County District Attorney’s Office said it will pursue the death penalty against Dekraai.

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: TUCSON, Ariz. – The sun had fallen and a crowd had gathered on a chilly Sunday night at the University of Arizona mall. It was the last event of a weekend commemorating the first anniversary of the mass shooting in Tucson one year ago. The vigil began with the Pledge of the Allegiance.  
Led by Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.
The crowd responded with gasps and a roar as Giffords, wearing a vibrant red scarf, walked unaided slowly to the center of the stage. Most had expected her to be there – that is why many had come – but few thought she would be able to play such a central role.
“I pledge of allegiance,” Giffords began, speaking slowly – almost defiantly – as the crowd of several thousand, some in tears, joined in. Giffords, holding her stiff right arm with her left hand, finished with a bright grin at the crowd. She was led slowly and unsteadily to the side of the stage by Ron Barber, her chief of staff who also was shot in the attack and led the ceremony.
“It gives you goose bumps,” said Michael Wood, 52, a construction worker in the crowd, his gaze fixed on the congresswoman, who was shot in the head just one year ago. “It’s good to see her. She looked really good.”
It was a stirring ending to a two-day commemoration that was in many ways remarkable for how understated it was.
A year ago, after the shootings that left six people dead and 13 wounded, including Giffords, this city gathered in an expression of grief and shock that lasted weeks. There was a blur of funerals, a crush of flowers, candles and well-wishers on the expanse of lawn at the hospital where victims were taken, and a visit by President Barack Obama that drew thousands.
On this anniversary, there was the candlelight vigil, an interdenominational prayer service, a ringing of bells at 10:11 a.m. marking the moment of the shootings and the reading of the names of the victims. There was Giffords herself visiting places that have become landmarks of the attack: the Safeway supermarket parking lot where the shootings took place and the Intensive Care Unit at the University of Arizona Medical Center where those injured in the shootings were treated.
But there also were anniversary events more in keeping with the character of this community, where people have struggled to comprehend how such brutal violence could unfold in such a serene place.
There were campaigns promoting civility and community – people gathered Saturday at a park to sign a “Tucsonans Commit to Kindness” contract – that were notable in how they avoided any explicit mention of the events a year ago
“You have to understand: This has always been a very civil community, a community that has always been tied together,” said the mayor, Jonathan Rothschild. “We are a different place. We are a city of 1 million people, and sometimes we acted, to our benefit and detraction, as a community of 50,000 people. For something like this to happen was such a shock.”
“Tucson is a changed community,” he said.
This is a turning point as the city searches for a way to mark the tragedy without the images from the Safeway parking lot becoming the first thing people think of.
“We refuse to let this tragic day define us,” Patricia Maisch, one of the women who wrested the gun from the shooter, said at a memorial service at the University of Arizona.
Sunday’s events included two church services, a memorial service and a candlelight vigil. Hundreds gathered for an interfaith service at the St. Augustine Cathedral, the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tucson. A shofar was sounded by a rabbi, a prayer was read from the Quran, and there was a welcome from a Lutheran pastor and the vicar general of the Diocese of Tucson.
Nearly every pew of the soaring church was filled. People sat quietly, some holding back tears, as a bell was rung as the name of each of the six people who died was called out.
“Because it’s a small community, everybody seemed to know somebody, and we took it very personally,” Cheryl Lillie, 57, a preschool aide, said at the church service. She said Giffords’ recovery had helped the city’s recovery. “It’s given everybody a lift to see how she progressed.”
The man accused in the shootings, Jared Loughner, is in a Missouri prison undergoing psychiatric treatment intended to make him fit to stand trial; there was no sign of occupants at his family’s home in Tucson.
Giffords’ recovery has, by any measure, been remarkable given the extent of injuries she suffered when she was shot in the head. Her future remains an open question. She is up for re-election in November. Democrats in Washington fear she will not seek re-election and say they are worried about whether they would be able to hold on to the seat should she step aside. Her chief of staff, Pia Carusone, said Giffords had given no indication of what she might do.
“We’re going to have to wait and hear from her,” Carusone said. “I think getting through one year is important, and giving her the time she needs is important.”
On Sunday, Giffords stood at the side of the stage, holding on to the arm of her husband, Mark Kelly, who seemed to be fighting tears through the night. She laughed, bounced and appeared bubbly through the night and rose with him at one point to dance along as Joey Burns, the lead singer of Calexico, probably the most famous band to come out of Tucson, performed.
She lighted the first of 19 candles to mark the people who were killed and injured.
Carusone said that this weekend had been intensely poignant for Giffords, almost a visit of rediscovery, as she saw the extent to which the episode had traumatized her community. “It moves her,” she said. “She sees how tough this is, and was, for a lot of people.” TUCSON, Ariz. – The sun had fallen and a crowd had gathered on a chilly Sunday night at the University of Arizona mall.

The crowd responded with gasps and a roar as Giffords, wearing a vibrant red scarf, walked unaided slowly to the center of the stage. Most had expected her to be there – that is why many had come – but few thought she would be able to play such a central role. “I pledge of allegiance,” Giffords began, speaking slowly – almost defiantly – as the crowd of several thousand, some in tears, joined in. Giffords, holding her stiff right arm with her left hand, finished with a bright grin at the crowd. She was led slowly and unsteadily to the side of the stage by Ron Barber, her chief of staff who also was shot in the attack and led the ceremony. “It gives you goose bumps,” said Michael Wood, 52, a construction worker in the crowd, his gaze fixed on the congresswoman, who was shot in the head just one year ago. “It’s good to see her. She looked really good.” It was a stirring ending to a two-day commemoration that was in many ways remarkable for how understated it was. A year ago, after the shootings that left six people dead and 13 wounded, including Giffords, this city gathered in an expression of grief and shock that lasted weeks. There was a blur of funerals, a crush of flowers, candles and well-wishers on the expanse of lawn at the hospital where victims were taken, and a visit by President Barack Obama that drew thousands. On this anniversary, there was the candlelight vigil, an interdenominational prayer service, a ringing of bells at 10:11 a.m. marking the moment of the shootings and the reading of the names of the victims. There was Giffords herself visiting places that have become landmarks of the attack: the Safeway supermarket parking lot where the shootings took place and the Intensive Care Unit at the University of Arizona Medical Center where those injured in the shootings were treated. But there also were anniversary events more in keeping with the character of this community, where people have struggled to comprehend how such brutal violence could unfold in such a serene place. There were campaigns promoting civility and community – people gathered Saturday at a park to sign a “Tucsonans Commit to Kindness” contract – that were notable in how they avoided any explicit mention of the events a year ago “You have to understand: This has always been a very civil community, a community that has always been tied together,” said the mayor, Jonathan Rothschild. “We are a different place. We are a city of 1 million people, and sometimes we acted, to our benefit and detraction, as a community of 50,000 people. For something like this to happen was such a shock.” “Tucson is a changed community,” he said. This is a turning point as the city searches for a way to mark the tragedy without the images from the Safeway parking lot becoming the first thing people think of. “We refuse to let this tragic day define us,” Patricia Maisch, one of the women who wrested the gun from the shooter, said at a memorial service at the University of Arizona. Sunday’s events included two church services, a memorial service and a candlelight vigil. Hundreds gathered for an interfaith service at the St. Augustine Cathedral, the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tucson. A shofar was sounded by a rabbi, a prayer was read from the Quran, and there was a welcome from a Lutheran pastor and the vicar general of the Diocese of Tucson. Nearly every pew of the soaring church was filled. People sat quietly, some holding back tears, as a bell was rung as the name of each of the six people who died was called out. “Because it’s a small community, everybody seemed to know somebody, and we took it very personally,” Cheryl Lillie, 57, a preschool aide, said at the church service. She said Giffords’ recovery had helped the city’s recovery. “It’s given everybody a lift to see how she progressed.” The man accused in the shootings, Jared Loughner, is in a Missouri prison undergoing psychiatric treatment intended to make him fit to stand trial; there was no sign of occupants at his family’s home in Tucson. Giffords’ recovery has, by any measure, been remarkable given the extent of injuries she suffered when she was shot in the head. Her future remains an open question. She is up for re-election in November. Democrats in Washington fear she will not seek re-election and say they are worried about whether they would be able to hold on to the seat should she step aside. Her chief of staff, Pia Carusone, said Giffords had given no indication of what she might do. “We’re going to have to wait and hear from her,” Carusone said. “I think getting through one year is important, and giving her the time she needs is important.” On Sunday, Giffords stood at the side of the stage, holding on to the arm of her husband, Mark Kelly, who seemed to be fighting tears through the night. She laughed, bounced and appeared bubbly through the night and rose with him at one point to dance along as Joey Burns, the lead singer of Calexico, probably the most famous band to come out of Tucson, performed. She lighted the first of 19 candles to mark the people who were killed and injured. Carusone said that this weekend had been intensely poignant for Giffords, almost a visit of rediscovery, as she saw the extent to which the episode had traumatized her community. “It moves her,” she said. “She sees how tough this is, and was, for a lot of people.” Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts As you comment, please be respectful of other commenters and other viewpoints.

46140612,2011-12-21 21:55:00,"California officers own 7,600 assault guns",http://www.mercurynews.com/crime-courts/ci_19594618?source=rss,en,True,"politics and government,law and legislation,gun control,firearms,sales",35,San Jose Mercury News,http://www.mercurynews.com/,"Trending: SACRAMENTO — Peace officers throughout California have bought more than 7,600 assault weapons that are outlawed for civilians in the decade since state lawmakers allowed the practice, according to data obtained by The Associated Press after it was revealed that federal authorities are investigating illegal gun sales by law enforcement. Investigators have not said what kinds of weapons were involved, but did say they were ones that officers can buy but civilians cannot. That category also can include certain types of handguns and high-capacity ammunition magazines. The AP’s findings and the federal probe have prompted one state lawmaker to revisit the law to ensure that the guns can be bought only for police purposes. “I think it’s much more questionable whether we should allow peace officers to have access to weapons or firearms that a private citizen wouldn’t have access to if the use is strictly personal,” said Assemblyman Roger Dickinson, a Democrat who represents the Sacramento region. The information was obtained through a California Public Records Act request filed after federal authorities served search warrants in November as part of ongoing investigation into allegations of illegal weapons sales by several Sacramento-area law enforcement officers. The investigation has raised questions about the kinds of restricted weapons that the more than 87,000 peace officers in the state are entitled to purchase and about a 2001 law that allows them to buy assault weapons “for law enforcement purposes, whether on or off duty.” The AP found that some departments allow officers to use the weapons in their off time while others require that the weapons be used only on-duty, although an opinion by the state attorney general issued last year says officers can acquire the guns for any purpose but must relinquish them when they retire. A department-by-department breakdown of purchases made this year, released as part of the AP’s records request, shows that Los Angeles Police Department officers bought 146 guns, the most in the state. The department’s policy says the guns are to be used only for police purposes. Today, about 1,300 of the nearly 10,000 LAPD officers have assault rifles, more than 500 of them purchased by the officers themselves. “We’re not interested in loading up people’s gun closets with assault weapons,” said Cmdr. Andrew Smith, who spent $1,200 on his gun. “The idea is that these guys would be able to have these in the trunks of their police cars if they’re needed.” Officers in the San Diego Police Department, Riverside County Sheriff’s Department and Long Beach Police Department also registered large numbers of assault weapons so far this year. Police sought the 2001 exemption from the state’s assault weapons ban in part because of a 1997 North Hollywood shootout, in which LAPD officers were outgunned by two bank robbers clad in body armor and firing high-powered assault weapons. Officers fought back with assault rifles they had to take from a gun shop. The law allows any law enforcement officer, including prison guards, game wardens and school police, to use their own money to buy the weapons, provided they get permission from their departments. It was revised with the goal of helping police departments that could not afford to buy powerful firearms, said Dickinson, the chairman of the Assembly’s Committee on Accountability and Administrative Review. Just six other states and the District of Columbia restrict ownership of assault weapons, all with exemptions for law enforcement officers. Connecticut, Maryland and Massachusetts require that officers possess the weapons only while performing official duties. The other 43 states permit civilian ownership of assault weapons, although Minnesota and Virginia ban them for those under age 18. Assault weapons include semi-automatic military-style rifles typically used by law enforcement, as well as some pistols and shotguns. The semi-automatic variety fire one bullet with each pull of the trigger. No charges have been filed in the Sacramento-area investigation, which is being led by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The departments named in the probe — the Sacramento and Roseville police departments and the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department — allow officers to purchase the assault guns for personal use. Agencies that allow their officers to buy assault weapons for off-duty purposes face potential legal liability if the gun is misused, said Steve Lindley, chief of the state Department of Justice Bureau of Firearms. The Oakland Police Department is among those that do not require officers to limit use of the weapons to their job. Officer Chris Saunders, with the department’s firearms training unit, said 80 weapons are issued by the agency, but he and some other officers bought their own to use for target practice while off duty. Oakland City Councilwoman Jane Brunner questioned the policy, particularly for a department that has a reputation for excessive force, most recently against Occupy protesters. “I do not believe the police officers should be able to buy them personally anymore,” she said. “Particularly after everything that has happened in Oakland, we need to make sure our officers are following protocol.” The 2001 update to state law required law enforcement officers to register the weapons with the Justice Department. About 7,625 assault weapons have been registered with the DOJ over the last decade, with some officers buying more than one weapon. For the first 11 months of 2011, 844 officers bought 861 weapons, according to the DOJ figures. Justice Department officials said it would be too burdensome to break down by department the purchases in prior years, especially since the records are not kept electronically. The registrations are kept in paper files as they come in. The 2011 data showed that officers working in eight police departments on college campuses are among those who have legally obtained assault weapons. Some campus officers said they want the firepower to respond to attacks, such as the 2007 killing spree at Virginia Tech, where 33 people died in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. This month, a gunman killed a university police officer at the campus. “We want to definitely match the suspects,” said Los Angeles School Police Department Lt. Chris Stevens, whose officers bought four assault rifles this year. They are supposed to only use them if needed on the job. The state Department of Fish and Game is among several state agencies that allow officers to buy assault weapons and use them while off-duty. “I don’t know exactly what they’re using them for,” department spokesman Patrick Foy said. “What they’re not using them for is patrol, I can tell you that.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters"

We've received your submission. Gas up the bus or get those boarding passes ready. Most teams in the CHSAA are on the road this week for holiday tournaments ranging from Binghamton to Phoenix. The city has done well out of state thus far this season. Cardinal Hayes made the Kreul Classic Sweet Sixteen Championship final and St. Raymond was competitive at the City of Palms Classic, the country’s premier tourney. The rest of the league will get a chance to continue that trend. Here’s how the rankings look: (next rankings will be Jan. 9 after a one-week break for the holdays) 1. St. Raymond (5-3) (Last week: 1) St. Ray’s couldn’t build on its momentum after a stirring comeback in the first round of the City of Palms Classic. The Ravens did play well and Kerwin Okoro scored his 1,000th career point, but they dropped three of four games at the prestigious tournament. Now it’s on to Raleigh, N.C., and the HighSchoolOT.com Holiday Invitational. Next: Middle Creek (N.C.), HighSchoolOT.com Holiday Invitational (Dec. 27, 9 p.m. @ Raleigh) 2. Christ the King (2-1) (2) The Royals have been relatively Idle this season so far. They can help erase a disappointing loss at home to Boys & Girls with a big few days this week at the STOP-DWI Holiday Classic. Christ the King could be on a collision course with Mount Vernon in what would be a rematch of last year’s New York State Federation Class AA title game. Next: St. Rita (Ill.), STOP-DWI Holiday Classic (Dec. 28, 5:45 p.m. @ Binghamton) 3. Cardinal Hayes (8-1) (3) Amadou Sidibe had 12 points and Naasir Williams added 10 for Hayes in a 50-45 loss to Coral Springs (Fla.) Academy in the Kreul Classic Sweet Sixteen Championship final Tuesday night in Coral Springs, Fla. Jalen Jenkins, Tyler Wilson and Chris Robinson also had big tournaments. Hayes has established itself as a legitimate CHSAA Class AA title contender. Next: Bishop Ford, New Heights Holiday Hoop Festival (Jan. 2, TBA @ Harlem PAL) 4. Holy Cross (7-1) (4) A 58-38 rout of Campus Magnet on Thursday gave Holy Cross its seventh straight win after a season-opening loss to Cardinal Hayes. Will Davis and 20 points and Mairega Clarke had 19 points for the Knights against the overmatched Bulldogs. Now it’s on to New Orleans and brother school Holy Cross (La.) for the Tony Rodi Basketball Classic tournament. Next: East St. John (La.), Tony Rodi Basketball Classic (Dec. 27, TBA @ New Orleans) 5. Xaverian (4-0) (5) Dillon Burns had 20 points and Brian Bernardi and George Lambert each had 12 in a solid, 66-65 win at Archbishop Stepinac on Friday night. Burns’ evolution as a player continues. No longer can the C.W. Post-bound senior be looked at solely as a point guard or shooter – he does a little of everything now for Xaverian. Next: Estrella Foothills (Ariz.), Cactus Jam Hoop Classic (Dec. 27, 3:15 p.m. @ Phoenix) 6. Iona Prep (7-0) (6) Luke Wooters made a clutch free throw and Iona was able to hold on for a 53-52 win over Cardinal Spellman on Tuesday. It was really the Gaels’ first challenging league game of the season and a good sign that they were able to pull it out. The CHSAA Class A favorite has games upcoming against ‘AA’ squads Fordham Prep and All Hallows. Next: @ Fordham Prep (Dec. 30, 12 p.m.) 7. Bishop Loughlin (3-3) (7) Khadeen Carrington has emerged as one of the city’s best young players as a sophomore and Loughlin, a scrappy, hard-working bunch, is going to be a tough matchup for any team in the CHSAA. Loughlin is one of the youngest teams in the city, but coach Ed Gonzalez and assistant Bob Leckie are adept at getting their kids to mature quickly. The Lions head to Boston this week. Next: East Boston (Mass.), Shooting Touch Shootout (Dec. 28, 2 p.m. @ Boston) 8. Mount St. Michael (6-1) (8) Malik Gill put in the go-ahead jumper and Ed Correa had 17 points in a 48-47 win Tuesday against All Hallows. Mount coach Tom Fraher joked the formula at the small South Bronx gym was to get a good parking, win by one point and get out. The Mountaineers have won six of their first seven games and were happy to escape with a league victory. Next: Concord (Mass.), Josh Palmer Coaches vs. Cancer Tournament (Dec. 27, 4 p.m. @ Elmira) 9. Archbishop Molloy (7-2) (9) Marko Kozul had 19 points and Gabe Kilpatrick had 17 points off the bench in a 71-46 win over St. John the Baptist (L.I.) on Thursday. After a trip to Bridgeport, Conn., for the Northeast Christmas Classic, Molloy’s league schedule kicks off after the break with Christ the King on Jan. 3.That’ll be a measuring stick to see how much the Stanners have improved since last year. Next: St. Joseph (Conn.), Northeast Christmas Classic (Dec. 27, 8 p.m. @ Bridgeport) 10. All Hallows (4-4) (10) If All Hallows has done anything this season, it has proved it will not be an easy out against any team in CHSAA Class AA. The Gaels didn’t fold against St. Raymond or Cardinal Hayes and lost to Holy Cross and Mount St. Michael by a combined three points. Look for John Carey’s small, disciplined group to get better as the season goes on. Next: @ Salesian (Dec. 30, 12:30 p.m.) New: None Dropped out: None On the bubble: Archbishop Stepinac (3-4), Moore Catholic (11-0), St. Francis Prep (4-4), St. Peter’s (3-3) and St. Edmund Prep (7-1) mraimondi@nypost.com  Share Selection"

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. TUCSON, Ariz – For the first time since she was shot there a year ago, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) on Saturday returned to site of the Tucson, Ariz., mass shooting where six people died and another 13 were wounded. ""Gabby just visited the Safeway for the 1st time since 1/8/11. It's been a tough year, but we're lucky to have so many people standing w/us,"" her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, posted on Twitter on Saturday afternoon. Giffords arrived back in Tucson on Friday two days before a ceremony to mark the one-year anniversary of the shooting, in which a gunman opened fire at a public meeting she was holding with constituents outside the Safeway on Jan. 8, 2011. Six people were killed and thirteen people, including Giffords, were wounded. On Friday, Giffords dedicated a permanent memorial in her Tucson office to her former staff member Gabe Zimmerman, who died in the shooting. The Congresswoman is also expected to attend a candlelight vigil to be held at the University of Arizona at 6:30pm local time Sunday.

Gabrielle Giffords joined thousands for a vigil Sunday night in Tucson, Arizona, one of several emotional events over the weekend to mark one year since a shooting rampage left her and 12 others wounded and six people dead. Soon after the event began, the Arizona Democrat took the stage to lead the crowd in the Pledge of Allegiance. After receiving help from her husband, Mark Kelly, to put her right hand above her heart, Giffords enthusiastically recited the pledge, her voice strong and her demeanor positive, before leaving to applause. She later reappeared to light a memorial candle, then flashed a wide smile after Dr. Peter Rhees -- a University of Arizona Medical Center doctor who treated her -- said she was loved ""nowhere near as much as (in) Tucson"" and that the community ""was looking forward to having you back"" in Washington. And as the event came to an end, she happily played along with the crowd as it shouted, ""Gabby! Gabby!,"" pumping her hand to the rhythm of the chant. Kelly himself addressed the audience, highlighting the ""strength that ordinary people showed under terrible pressure"" in the attack's aftermath. The retired Navy captain and astronaut also acknowledged that ""we all suffered a terrible loss"" over those horrific 16 seconds on January 8, 2011, when shots rang out in the parking lot outside a Tucson supermarket. ""Those of us who survived were forever changed by that moment,"" he said. ""For the past year, we've had new realities to live with. ... There are dreams for our family's future that we will just have to let go."" ""Even with those painful realities, there is this: The sun still rises over the Rincon Mountains each and every morning,"" said Kelly, referring to the mountain range around Tucson. Earlier in the day, the congresswoman's chief of staff, Pia Carusone, admitted that the attack's anniversary has been ""difficult emotionally for everybody."" Prosecutors accuse Jared Lee Loughner, 23, of carrying out the attack, which purportedly targeted Giffords during a constituent meet-and-greet event. On Saturday, Giffords made her first visit back to the parking lot of the supermarket where the mass shooting occurred, Kelly posted on Twitter and Facebook. Carusone said it was Giffords who ""wanted to stop by the Safeway."" ""It's a very intense feeling to stand in the space where six people lost their lives ... and her life changed,"" Carusone, who was there with the congresswoman, told CNN on Sunday. ""Some memories started to come back."" They also had their ""first night out in Tucson"" since the shooting and went to personally thank doctors and nurses at the University of Arizona Medical Center on Saturday, Kelly wrote on Facebook. Giffords then began Sunday by taking a phone call from President Barack Obama to ""offer his support."" ""The president expressed amazement at the courage and determination Rep. Giffords has shown along her incredible road to recovery, calling her an inspiration to his family and Americans across the country,"" the White House added in a statement. Bells rang out around Tucson at 10:11 a.m., the precise moment one year earlier that the shooting occurred, CNN affiliate KMSB reported. The vigil on the University of Arizona campus capped the emotional day. Emceed by Ron Barber, Giffords' district director who was shot and wounded in last year's incident, the event included tributes to the deceased, a lively musical performance and a request by Tucson Rabbi Stephanie Aaron for everyone to stop and say a prayer every time an emergency response vehicle passes by. Tucson Mayor Jonathan Rothschild praised how the community has come together since the shooting, helping to ""create a more civil ... and a stronger city"" that wouldn't be defined by the brazen attack. ""Let us continue to know who we are as a people in Tucson ... united, compassionate, 1 million strong,"" Rothschild said. That sentiment was echoed by Ross Zimmerman, whose son Gabe was a staffer for Giffords and among those killed. He told CNN on Sunday that horrible things are a fact of life, adding that what people do going forward in response is what's most important now. ""People can lose their faculties and do terrible things any place in the world,"" he said. ""I would do anything to have Gabe back, but I can't. So what do we do going forward? How do we go forward in ways that help us remember (the victims) and try and do the most positive things we can in response to that?"" Arizona Democratic Party chairman Andrei Cherny released a statement Sunday recalling lessons he said had been learned over ""one gut-wrenching, unforgettable year,"" including that ""pure determination combined with love and support can work miracles."" The state's Republican Party issued its own statement, offering its members thoughts and prayers and referring to some post-shooting reactions blaming extreme right-wing thinking and a charged political environment for the attack. ""While our political process was profoundly shaken by this dreadful incident, we have made incredible progress in recovering our hope and faith in (the political) system,"" the party said. Sen. Mark Udall, a Colorado Democrat, spoke on his friend Giffords' behalf at a memorial event Sunday. In that speech, he called for more political civility and crossing party lines in Washington and beyond -- a view that Giffords, whom Udall called a ""bridge builder,"" often voiced prior to the shooting. ""The goal isn't bipartisanship, it's results,"" Udall said. ""But bipartisanship is the only way to get results. ... In the end, we're not enemies, we are fellow Americans."" Giffords herself is still recovering from her injuries. Her right side remains weak, and Kelly was at her side Sunday to assist her, as she walked on stage at the memorial event. She has made few public appearances since the incident with some rare exceptions, such as casting a vote raising the federal debt ceiling and an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer. She has been undergoing intensive rehabilitation in Houston but has returned to Tucson four times since the shooting, according to her office. Carusone, the congresswoman's chief of staff, said that Giffords has steadily increased her workload, as her condition has improved. ""As the year wore on, we were able to plug the congresswoman in more,"" she said. ""Now we talk regularly over video chats and telephone. She's gotten more and more involved the better she gets."" Giffords still has not definitively settled on whether she will seek re-election this year, with Carusone predicting that decision will come in the coming months. ""I think, for her, it's a personal decision (and) whether she thinks she can do the job up to the standards she holds for herself,"" Carusone said. As to Loughner, he potentially faces the death penalty if convicted on charges of murdering six people -- including the chief federal judge of Arizona, John Roll. He has been diagnosed as schizophrenic and has spent time on suicide watch while in custody and is undergoing treatment in Springfield, Missouri. A federal appeals court in May cleared the way for him to be forcibly medicated over the objections of Loughner and his attorney."
