According to reports, Santiago left Anchorage, Alaska on a Delta flight Thursday night (Jan 5), changed planes in Minneapolis early this morning and caught an 8:25 a.m. ET flight to Fort Lauderdale. He allegedly used a 9 mm handgun retrieved from his checked bag at baggage claim. He loaded the gun in the rest room before emerging and opening fire. He reportedly used three magazines while aiming at passengers who were waiting for their bags. Many of the wounded were shot in the head. Witnesses said he remained quiet as he fired. After his third and final clip was used, witnesses said he dropped onto his stomach on the floor, spread out his arms and legs and waited to be arrested. Santiago lived in Anchorage from 2014 to 2016 and was a member of the National Guard. He has a record of petty crimes, including non-payment of rent, domestic violence and property damage. Witnesses have said that Santiago got into an altercation on the plane that could have led to the shooting. Authorities have found no sign of terrorism. Relatives of Santiago are telling NBC News that he had some mental health problems. His aunt and uncle in NJ say he served in the U.S. Army Reserves in Iraq and was “seeking mental health” treatment in Alaska. Family members confirm that the below photo is of Esteban Santiago.

(Reuters) – A gunman wearing a “Star Wars” T-shirt opened fire at a baggage carousel at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on Friday, killing at least five people before being taken into custody, officials and witnesses said. Five people died and eight were wounded in the incident, the local sheriff’s office said. Police shot the shooter as he attempted to reload, MSNBC reported, citing witnesses. It said the man, who said nothing, appeared to be in his 20s and was wearing a “Star Wars” T-shirt. He carried a U.S. military identification, U.S. Senator Bill Nelson of Florida told MSNBC. The Florida attack was the latest in a series of mass shootings that have plagued the United States in recent years, some inspired by militants with an extreme view of Islam, others carried out by loners or the mentally disturbed who have easy access to weapons under U.S. gun laws. About 90 minutes after the attack, panic broke out anew with passengers and police running frantically about the airport. Dozens of police sprinted back and forth with automatic weapons drawn, directing a large group of travelers. A police officer screamed “Get down, get down!” from a parking garage across the street from the airport terminal, a Reuters reporter witnessed. John Schlicher, who told MSNBC he saw the attack, described the shooter as a “slender man” who was “directly firing at us” while passengers waited for their bags to come off the carousel. “I put my head down and prayed,” Schlicher said, adding that his wife gave first aid to someone who had been shot in the head. His mother-in-law used her sweater to tend to another victim but it turned out that person was already dead, he said. The shooter reloaded for a second burst of shooting, Schlicher said, but could not say how many bullets were fired. Mark Lea, another eyewitness, told MSNBC “there was no rhyme or reason to it.” “He didn’t say anything, he was quiet the whole time, he didn’t yell anything,” Lea said. Security officials corralled passengers underneath jetways and on the runway apron, according to images on television. A woman tended to a bleeding, seated man outside an airport building, according to a photo posted on Twitter by a Michigan information technology company. Air traffic was temporarily suspended. Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport is the second largest in South Florida, serving as an intercontinental gateway, with Miami International Airport known as the primary airport for international flights in the area. HISTORY OF SHOOTINGS Friday’s attack comes nearly two months after a former Southwest Airlines worker killed an employee of the company at Oklahoma City’s airport in what police called a premeditated act. The deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history took place in June, when a gunman apparently inspired by Islamic State killed 53 people and wounded 49 others at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. One of the most shocking took place in 2012, when a man entered an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, and shot dead 20 first-graders and six adults. Attackers from Fort Lauderdale to Brussels have exploited security officials’ focus on preventing attacks on airplanes rather than inside airports. In Western Europe and the United States, terminals are easily accessible public spaces. But at Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport, widely seen as a model for security, private companies trained by the national security agency use bomb-detectors, profile passengers and question travelers under the watch of police at the airport’s entrance. That approach has its limitations and may just shift the target to another location at the airport, experts have said.

The shooting, presumably by a lone gunman who has since been taken into custody, took place at the baggage claim area at Terminal 2 near the Delta Airlines area. The degree of the victims' injuries were not immediately known. Details of their identities were not expected to be released until the victims have been identified and authorities were able to ""respectfully identify the next of kin first,"" Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said. Graphiq The gunman was identified as 26-year old Esteban Santiago by senior Florida Sen. Bill Nelson. He was carrying a military ID and was suspected of being a former U.S. Army soldier, media outlets reported. Santiago, whose flight took him from Anchorage, Alaska, to Minneapolis, Minnesota, and finally to Ft. Lauderdale, was on an Air Canada flight. He reportedly checked a gun in his baggage, pulled that gun out in an airport bathroom and started shooting, according to Broward County commissioner Chip LaMarca. However, that narrative was not confirmed by Air Canada.  Witnesses said the gunman ran out of ammunition then laid on the ground ""spread eagles"" and waited for law enforcement to come, Florida media outlets reported on Twitter. The investigation was ongoing and the suspect was in custody. He was being interrogated by a team of FBI agents and the Broward County police, said Israel. Law enforcement fired no shots at the suspect. President-elect Donald Trump tweeted this afternoon that he was ""monitoring the situation in Florida"" and had also spoken to Gov. Rick Scott.  The shooting was first reported around 1 p.m. by former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer through Twitter.

Gabrielle Giffords could become part of the National Park System. U.S. Rep. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., introduced legislation Friday to make the January 8th Memorial in Tucson a permanent national memorial. The memorial would be an affiliated area of the National Park Service. The January 8th Memorial is expected to be completed in 2018. Shooter Jared Loughner killed six and injured 13, including Giffords, who was shot in the head, on Jan. 8, 2011. He was sentenced to life in prison. January 8th Memorial Foundation Board President Dorothy Kret said the national designation would recognize that the shooting affected people outside of the Tucson community. “This is national recognition that what happened here in Tucson didn’t only impact just Tucson. There were a lot of people all around the country, all around the world who were really impacted by this, by the fact that we lost six lives, by the fact that 19 people were injured, by the fact that an attack took place on our right as individuals to speak with our congresspeople and to have civil discourse,” Kret said. Ross Zimmerman, whose son, Gabe Zimmerman, was killed in the shooting, said he hopes the proposed national memorial will allow people to reflect. “It certainly seems appropriate that it be recognized as a memorial,” Zimmerman said.

Authorities said they had taken decorated Iraq war veteran Esteban Santiago into custody following the shooting and questioned him at length. He was expected to face federal charges, said George Piro, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s office in Miami. Piro said FBI investigators had not ruled out terrorism as a reason for the attack and were reviewing the suspect’s recent movements. “We will be pursuing every angle to try to determine the motive behind this attack,” he said. Authorities said the attacker retrieved a 9mm semiautomatic handgun from his checked luggage and began firing indiscriminately. In addition to the five killed, eight people were wounded by gunfire and some three dozen were taken to hospital with bruises or broken bones. Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport is the second largest in South Florida, serving as an intercontinental gateway. It resumed cargo flights and general aviation for private small planes at midnight local time. Commercial flights were to resume on Saturday, the airport said on Twitter. Authorities said Santiago, 26, arrived in Fort Lauderdale shortly before 1 p.m. local time (1800 GMT) on Friday on a connecting flight from Alaska. Piro said Santiago had turned up at an FBI office in Anchorage in November of last year behaving erratically and was turned over to local police, who took him to a medical facility for a mental health evaluation. Santiago served from 2007 to 2016 in the Puerto Rico National Guard and Alaska National Guard including a deployment to Iraq from 2010 to 2011, according to the Pentagon. A private first class and combat engineer, he received half a dozen medals before being transferred to the inactive ready reserve in August last year. An aunt said he came back from his deployment “a different person”, MSNBC reported. The attack was the latest in a series of mass shootings that have plagued the United States in recent years, some inspired by Islamist militants, others carried out by loners or the mentally disturbed. Nearly two months ago a former Southwest Airlines worker killed an employee of the company at Oklahoma City’s airport in what police called a premeditated act.

It must be placed in checked baggage - not carry-on - and the gun must be locked and unloaded, and in a hard-sided container.   After claiming his baggage, investigators say, Santiago went to a bathroom and loaded his gun. When he emerged, he started shooting. Witness Mark Lea said that, as terrified passengers dropped to the floor, Santaigo went looking for people who were hiding.  Santiago's mother said that Esteban had been ""tremendously affected"" by seeing a bomb in Iraq kill two of his friends when he was about 18 or 19 years old. After returning from Iraq, Santiago was later demoted for poor performance. According to his brother, Bryan Santiago, Esteban had told him in August that he was hearing voices. In November, Esteban Santiago went to an FBI office in Alaska and announced that the government was controlling his mind and forcing him to watch ISIS videos. There, agents questioned the ""agitated and disjointed"" man and then turned him over to the local cops, who took him to a local hospital for a mental health evaluation. He was not placed on a no-fly list. Bryan Santiago questions how a man who admitted to being mentally ill was not given satisfactory treatment and, even moreso, allowed to keep his gun.

But as the plane -- one of several flying the Charlotte, N.C., to Fort Lauderdale leg that day -- reached the eastern coast of the Florida Peninsula, emergency crews on the ground were responding to America's latest mass shooting. Flight 1961 landed far from its assigned terminal. Passengers' phones buzzed with news of the mayhem they had just landed in, and for the next seven hours they waited on the airplane, not allowed to leave. [INTERACTIVE: Airport map, traffic details, history of attacks] From the passenger window, Elaine Wade from Arkansas could see only emergency lights and other stranded planes scattered on the tarmac. The Fayetteville resident, along with her husband and several friends, had tickets on the Coral Princess cruise ship for a 10-day excursion in the Caribbean Sea. As they waited, a Fort Lauderdale airport terminal was in chaos. A male passenger from a different flight had taken a gun out of his checked luggage and opened fire in the baggage claim area, killing five people and wounding several others. Encapsulated on the plane, Wade and her fellow travelers were distanced from the unfolding attack and its immediate aftermath. Police SWAT teams swarmed the airport, and paramedics rushed to aid victims. Finally, the passengers on Flight 1961 were allowed to leave the plane and were led through the airport. Wade said that's when the news reports she had been reading about on her phone became real. ""Outside the airport was the worst. It was much worse than being stranded on the plane,"" Wade said in a phone interview Saturday, still rattled from the previous day's events. Amid the smell of antiseptic used to clean up the gore, the passengers filed past camouflaged armed guards and crowds of people, all with ""the look of trauma and fear and shock,"" silently huddled with their phones around electrical outlets, she said. Luggage lay strewn about the terminal, abandoned in the moments of panic. A child's suitcase lay beside a dropped cupcake -- just one memorable detail among so many. ""It's just beyond horrific and surreal,"" Wade said through tears Saturday. ""I can't believe this is what America has come to. I just can't. ""Just seeing thousands and thousands upon thousands of people -- no one has any idea of the next step to take,"" she said. ""Probably no one [there] has ever been through anything like this before. And everybody needs transportation, and there's none available. Yet, we've been told that buses will pick us up and transport us to this pier where we can hail a cab. And getting to that next step was just unbelievable frustration. It took hours."" Buses eventually arrived to shuttle people into Fort Lauderdale. They had to weave through a maze of cars abandoned along the interstate and its entrance ramps near the airport. Fort Lauderdale was oddly calm, Wade said. It was as if news of the killings hadn't yet made it to the city. At her hotel, a wedding was taking place, the hotel staff was as typically professional as ever, and the atmosphere was palpably serene, she said. ""That kind of contrast was so confusing. How does [an airport shooting] happen, when just a few miles down the road, in this hotel, people are celebrating marriage and life,"" she said. ""The contrast was overwhelming."" On Saturday, Wade spoke from aboard the Coral Princess. Its departure had been pushed back because of delays related to the shooting. She was still shaken, she said. She described feeling guilt when her thoughts turned to the shooting victims. ""I woke up this morning thinking how different I would feel if I just said 'I'm not going,' and stayed [in Florida] and tried to help someone. I don't know what form that help would have been in, but it really doesn't feel right,"" she said of continuing her trip. ""My thoughts are still with those people.""

564222429,2017-01-08 16:04:19,Fort Lauderdale Shooting Prompts Extreme Reaction,http://www.inquisitr.com/3865773/fort-lauderdale-shooting-prompts-extreme-reaction/,en,False,,26924,Inquisitr,http://www.inquisitr.com,"A group called FlyersRights.org, a consumer rights organization for airline passengers, has made a press release in reaction to the airport shooting which happened in Fort Lauderdale on Friday. The events that unfolded in Fort Lauderdale are fairly simple to lay out. According to the Washington Post, Esteban Santiago, an Iraq War veteran who has a history of domestic violence and a recent mental hospitalization after going into a FBI field office complaining that his mind was being controlled, and the government was forcing him to watch videos made by DAESH, flew 4,000 miles from Anchorage to Fort Lauderdale. Once he landed, he pulled his checked luggage from the carousel, pulled out a gun and ammunition, then began shooting nearby people randomly until he was out of ammunition. Five people died in Fort Lauderdale that day.   Our first reactions to Fort Lauderdale appear to be flowing out and FlyersRights.org, mistaking the results of a man who has received insufficient medical assistance for terrorism, has called for five emergency actions to be taken.  Banning the carrying of live ammunition is not a problematic proposal. However, how much it would do to prevent such an event from happening is questionable. Certainly, we would not see the shooting happen in an airport, but what would have prevented Santiago from going to another gathering spot in Fort Lauderdale and commit similar chaos? Santiago could have easily walked into any store selling ammunition, picked up a clip, perhaps more than he had with him, and headed to a crowded beach or mall and done exactly the same. Yet, such a response would be of minimal inconvenience to passengers. If that change took place, it would not be any huge problem. The other four suggestions are of a much more of a problematic reaction. A reaction of having the National Guard called for temporary airport security only invites the normalization of military forces policing the public. The entire shooting event took only 80 seconds to unfold, in a crowded area. Would armed police of any sort have been able to mobilize to that area in time to identify the shooter and take them out? Besides, military training is completely out of line with what you want from armed security in a domestic airport. Members of the military being trained are taught to see everyone as a potential threat, even children. How long would it take before a National Guard member mistakenly harmed an innocent member of the public looking for assistance? Besides, a simpler answer is readily available for any such event. FOX News reported in March 2015 that The American Federation of Government Employees has been asking for certain TSA agents to be armed in order to handle airport attacks, a move that Congress has disapproved of, citing privacy violations. However, the TSA is not trained to consider everyone an immediate threat and would be better suited than the National Guard to prevent another Fort Lauderdale. It still isn't the simplest answer, but simpler.   Increasing security to detect weapons and explosives, through security perimeters or canine units is not at all a reaction to the issue at hand. The weapon and ammunition being carried into Fort Lauderdale by Santiago were both detected, declared even, and were perfectly legal to be there. There is no indication that weapons and explosives are being snuck into airports at all; current measures are seemingly sufficient. Continued elevation of these precautions only increases public fear, which, in turn, makes for emotional reactions and will likely lead to increased arming and edginess by passengers fueling future tragedies. Fort Lauderdale would have been no safer with these measures in place. While I am glad that in their reaction they have called for due process being involved in the No Fly List, and TSA Watch List, these lists have not been shown to be effective or even logical. In fact, these lists have been shown in the wake of the September 11 attacks to have been used to engage in political profiling with members of left-wing causes being singled out -- the terrorist groups responsible for the attacks we are trying to prevent have all been right-wing groups. Salon reported back in 2002 about how those lists have been used against peaceful left wing activists. The simplest manner to address the specific issue that happened would be to have TSA-issued containers hold all guns and ammunition and make it so that they can only be unlocked by keys or machines held in the front of the airport. If you wish to have armed guards, that would be the place to place them. Had Santiago not have been able to retrieve his gun at the carousel in Fort Lauderdale, the shooting would not have happened there. However, this is not a story about terrorism. It's a story about a shooting in Fort Lauderdale. We have to look at restricting access to firearms for people who have psychological disorders which significantly increase the likelihood of unreasoned violence, as well as due process procedures to ensure that it is not used in a repressive manner. It is a rocky road to walk down as we have seen many a mass shooting come from people who clearly had such issues documented, but it is clear -- especially with the No Fly List -- that the government can and at times will abuse such power. We need a national debate not on whether, but how to successfully institute such limitations. We also must work hard to ensure that those who need psychological assistance are able to get sufficient help; every person. We need to also rethink our culture of war that leaves veterans coming back psychologically scarred from the experience. There is much work to do to make this country better, but it does not come from a police state reaction, it comes from creating a society that cares. Another Fort Lauderdale shooting can only be stopped through a reaction which takes the real causes into account. [Featured Image by an unspecified photographer/Shutterstock]"

The FBI faced off with Apple last year about accessing an iPhone linked to a mass shooting. When the FBI revealed it was able to hack into an iPhone used by one of the terrorists involved in the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, people wanted to know just how the agency did it. In fact, three news organizations sued the FBI in September for just this information. And because of that lawsuit, the agency released 100 pages of documents Friday. The problem is they're heavily censored, according to the Associated Press. The documents don't reveal who the FBI hired to hack into the phone or how much it paid that vendor. The FBI labeled those files ""secret"" before they were released. The iPhone was at the center of a legal back-and-forth between the government and Apple last year after the December 2015 attack that left 14 people dead. The government wanted Apple to write new software that would unlock the phone and make its data readable. Apple refused, saying that weakening the encryption would potentially leave other iPhone users at risk. In a surprise revelation in March, the Department of Justice said an unnamed outside party helped agents break into an iPhone 5C that was used by shooter Syed Farook. However, the agency wouldn't disclose how the hacker got into the phone. The lawsuit against the FBI was filed by the Associated Press, Vice and Gannett, the parent of national newspaper USA Today. The three news organizations sought details about the hacker the FBI used and associated costs. The FBI reportedly refused to provide that information to the organizations under the Freedom of Information Act. In the lawsuit complaint, the news organizations argued the public has a right to know how the government spent taxpayer funds to obtain the hacking technique. They also argued the existence of a secret flaw in the iPhone could leave the public in danger. While the most critical information remains unknown, the FBI's released documents do reveal that the agency received three submissions from companies to hack into the phone and that it signed a nondisclosure agreement with the vendor it chose, according to the Associated Press. An FBI spokeswoman said the agency is not commenting beyond what was released to the three news organizations.

Supporters of these bills explain that these expansions of gun rights will be limited to individuals trained and licensed to carry firearms, and that the measures will enhance public safety. We should not be reassured. The evidence is growing that expanding the right to carry will compromise rather than enhance public safety. Stanford University researchers have found that right-to-carry laws ""are associated with substantially higher rates of aggravated assault, rape, robbery and murder."" An FBI study of active shooter incidents found that just 1 of 160 incidents was stopped by an armed civilian. In addition to research, recent experience tells us that right-to-carry laws can be perilous. Last summer, when five law enforcement officers were shot and killed in Dallas, police Chief David Brown said that policing where open carry is legal is ""difficult at best."" When multiple people are walking the streets exhibiting their guns during an active shooting, confusion as to who the perpetrator is may impede the response of officers and may endanger them and the armed civilians who happen to be in the area. Still, the gun lobby continues to promote its agenda of permitting guns on campuses and at government meetings, disregarding the risks of verbal conflicts escalating into lethal ones. The risks don't end there: Guns on campus may increase the number of suicides, injuries due to accidental discharges and the theft of firearms. The gun lobby argues that the training received by Florida licensees justifies the expansion of concealed and open carry into places like airports. In reality, the training required of authorized permit holders in Florida is seriously inadequate. Let's examine what the National Rifle Association refers to as training. Permit holders in Florida typically take a onetime three-hour course with no written test regarding the state's gun laws and the appropriate use of lethal force. There are no performance-based tests of marksmanship or the handling of firearms. There is no training as to judgment in making critical shoot/don't shoot decisions. Joseph Vince, formerly an ATF agent and an international firearms and law enforcement expert, has written extensively on weapons training and self-defense. Vince argues that permitting standards are grossly inadequate. He recommends that license holders be required to undergo recertification every six months, with training that would involve decisionmaking during real-life scenarios, shooting accuracy in stressful situations and firing range practice. Florida requires none of these elements to qualify for a permit to carry a gun. As for renewal of a license, it can be done online. The training recommended by experts is critical as even police officers, who receive comprehensive, ongoing training can display errors in judgment and miss the mark 80 percent of the time in combat situations. Contributing to the inadequacy of training is the fact that various businesses, rather than police, administer the courses, creating a lack of uniformity and conflicts of interest. Gun stores offering these courses are incentivized to pass everyone seeking a permit in order to sell their products and services. One would think the permitting process would be managed by a law enforcement authority, not by the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Affairs, as is the case in Florida. Floridians should be concerned about the vetting and training of the 1.7 million concealed weapons permitholders in the state. The notion that the current licensing method prepares them to protect our campuses and airports is unreasonable and dangerous.

The product was swiftly removed from the site on Wednesday after India's external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj took to Twitter to make her country's displeasure clear.

Chances to get accused shooter Esteban Santiago off the streets, or at least away from his gun, were squandered. Ill-conceived laws got in the way. And once again, innocent people died. It's not as though there were no red flags. Two months before the airport rampage, Santiago, agitated and incoherent, walked into the FBI office in Anchorage and told agents his mind had been taken over by a U.S. intelligence agency. He said he was having terrorist thoughts and believed he was being influenced by the Islamic State terrorist group. He had a loaded magazine on him and a gun in his car. The FBI called local police, who confiscated the gun for safekeeping and took Santiago to a mental health facility where, police said, he was admitted. Yet Santiago was out of the hospital before the end of the month. Exactly when and why have not been revealed. But if Santiago's delusions didn't qualify for longer-term treatment, it's hard to imagine what would. Even more alarming, not only was he able to retrieve his gun, but Anchorage police sent him a letter inviting him to come and get it. USA TODAY Forced treatment is not the way: Opposing view That he did, and last Friday, Santiago flew to Fort Lauderdale with the Walther 9mm semiautomatic handgun in a checked bag, which is legal, and went on a rampage. The episode is all the more shocking because of its familiar ring — another young man with untreated mental illness and a mass killing. Virginia Tech’s Seung Hui Cho, who killed 32, was delusional. Jared Loughner, killer of six at a Tucson strip mall, had scared classmates at his community college, which banned him from campus. Aaron Alexis, who fatally shot 12 at the Washington Navy Yard, had long exhibited symptoms of mental illness. Changing this horrific pattern involves tackling a complex web of problems. In many states, it is almost impossible to involuntarily commit someone even if he is — as Santiago surely seemed — delusional. Many states, which understandably set high standards to prevent individuals from being railroaded into institutions, have set them so high that almost no one qualifies. The laws focus too much on an individual's dangerousness, rather on other indicators of illness such as the inability to determine that they need help. Alaska sets not only a high bar, but according to a recent study, the danger must also be ""imminent."" Such strictures and the lack of mental health beds in many states combine to dissuade commitments. As for federal gun laws, mental illness disqualifies people from buying or possessing a gun only after they've been involuntarily committed by a court. Even when people fall into this category — or other prohibited categories — few states bother to take guns away. Most rely on the honor system. Alaska, for instance, has no law requiring relinquishment. Compare that with the Anchorage police diligence in notifying Santiago to come get his weapon. The mental health laws might be as tough to change as gun laws, leaving a difficult path forward. A few states have found a promising solution. A handful allow police or family members to seek a ""gun restraining order"" in court against a person who presents a credible risk for violence. If a judge agrees, the person is barred from buying a gun or keeping ones he owns. In Connecticut, the law is credited with preventing as many as 100 suicides from 1999 through 2013. New laws in California and Washington were approved in ballot measures, despite vehement opposition from the gun lobby. The key to preventing future Fort Lauderdales is to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill, not to return firearms to them on a silver platter.

Gun TV was the brainchild of Valerie Castle and Doug Bornstein of Rancho Mirage, Calif., veterans of the home shopping industry. The channel, billed as an iTunes for guns, also sold ammo, holsters and firearm accessories on Verizon Fios and dozens of other smaller cable television operators. Castle said in e-mail that Gun TV was ""pulling back on operations"" while it looks at distribution options. Television broadcasts stopped earlier this week; all of the website's pages go to this message: “Gun TV is presently off the air and is not currently accepting new orders.” ""This is a simple business decision. We are confident we will be broadcasting again soon,"" she said. USA TODAY Want to buy a gun on your couch at 3 a.m.? Now you can Despite the shutdown, Castle said Gun TV is not leaving its studio in Thousand Palms, about 10 miles east of Palm Springs. Even so, film officials in the area already have begun looking to re-purpose the studio under expectations that the failed shopping network will move out eventually. The channel broadcast from a 7,500-square-foot studio formerly known as the Palm Springs Film Factory, said Levi Vincent, executive director of the Greater Palm Springs Film Alliance Office that assists film production companies in the desert. The studio has the potential to be used for television and movie production, and local film students could use it, too. ""My ultimate goal is to save the studio, to keep the studio intact and an operating facility,"" Vincent said. USA TODAY GunTV shopping channel to start its shows in January The closure of Gun TV is not surprising, considering the fledgling home shopping network had been troubled since before aired. Gun TV was envisioned as a 24-hour channel but launched with six hours of programming from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. PT. The channel also faced a lukewarm welcome in a nation where gun-law reform advocates argue people already have too many guns, not too few. One late-night talk-show host, Samantha Bee, teased the channel for being ""dedicated to gun fondling."" In response, Gun TV promised to focus on safety. First, the channel dubbed itself a production of The Social Responsibility Network, which calls itself the social messaging arm of Gun TV on LinkedIn and has a one-page website with a 70-word mission statement. It has no Facebook or Twitter presence though Gun TV does have a Facebook page, last updated Jan. 1 with a new year's message. USA TODAY 'Shark Tank's' Greiner: How to get on QVC Secondly, Gun TV pledged that 3 minutes of every hour would be dedicated to firearm education and safety training. In November 2015, The Desert Sun reported that Gun TV was locating in the Coachella Valley and planned to start broadcasting the following January. However, about two weeks later, 14 people were killed in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, about 60 miles away. After the massacre, many criticized the channel as tone deaf and ill timed.

All rights reserved. BILLBOARD is a registered trademark of Billboard IP Holdings, LLC Mexican police agents patrol near a nightclub in Playa del Carmen, Quintana Roo state, Mexico where 5 people were killed, three of them foreigners, during a music festival on Jan. 16, 2017. Update: On Monday (Jan. 16), officials released a list of the dead, who included one Canadian, one American, two Mexicans and one Italian. Three were identified as part of the festival's security team. Fifteen people suffered injuries, including at least two Canadians and two Americans. A mass shooting has rocked the Mexican resort town of Playa Del Carmen where The BPM Festival was wrapping up. According to Quintana Roo district attorney Miguel Angel Pech Sen, five people were killed and 15 injured when shots were fired at Blue Parrot during Elrow's closing party at about 2:30 a.m. on Monday (Jan. 16). In a press conference today, Pech Sen said two Canadians, one Italian and one Colombian citizen are among the dead. He said uniforms indicate the dead include three members of security staff, and that one woman was killed in the stampede following the shooting. Pech said a lone gunman apparently tried to enter the nightclub, but was denied access because he had a gun. The gunman began to exchange fire with another person inside, he said, and festival security personnel tried to stop the shooting and came under fire. Pech said it was not a terrorist attack, and said three people had been detained nearby, but it was unclear if they had been involved in the shooting. ""We know of another shooting incident that occurred near the nightclub, but we are investigating whether that is related"" to the nightclub shootings,"" Pech said. He said 20 bullet casings from three different pistols had been found at the scene, and said it was unclear if the security detail had been armed or fired any of the weapons. The shooting apparently caused a rush of people heading for the exits at the beach-side club, and the lone female victim was apparently killed during the stampede. Pech said 15 people were injured, included one Mexican woman who was seriously injured. He said eight of the injured —including two U.S. citizens and one Canadian —had been treated for less serious injuries at local hospitals and released. [readmore:7655327] The BPM Festival released the following statement on Facebook today: ""It is with great sadness to share that police have confirmed reports of a lone shooter outside the Blue Parrot nightclub in Playa Del Carmen earlier today, which resulted in four fatalities and twelve injured. The violence began on 12th street in front of the club and three members of the BPM security team were among those whose lives were lost while trying to protect patrons inside the venue. The BPM Festival has been working closely with the local authorities (Seguridad Publica / Policia Turistica) throughout the festival to ensure public safety and security for all visitors. We are overcome with grief over this senseless act of violence and we are cooperating fully with local law enforcement and government officials as they continue their investigation. Our thoughts and prayers are with all the victims and their families and all those affected by these tragic events.""

567789801,2017-01-16 05:30:12,Former Tampa high school swimmer recounts experience of Fort Lauderdale airport shooting,http://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/former-tampa-high-school-swimmer-recounts-experience-of-ft-lauderdale/2309607,en,False,,22,Tampa Bay Times,http://www.tampabay.com/,"The news came to Maddie Strasen through a tweet. ""I'm at the Fort Lauderdale Airport,"" it read. ""Shots have been fired. Everyone is running."" Strasen was at the same airport Jan. 6 when she read that danger lurked nearby. A gunman had opened fire in the baggage claim area of Terminal 2 at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. ""I was like 'Whoa, we're here. That's weird,'"" said Strasen, 19, a former swimming standout of Tampa's Robinson High School. Strasen said she remained calm — at first. But the afternoon's events would leave her shaken and contemplating what's important in life. Now a freshman on the swim team at the University of Vermont, she and her teammates were in a nearby terminal waiting for a 2:30 p.m. flight to Baltimore. Outside Gate B-2, she read the tweet from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, who was passing through the airport. While chaos ensued in Terminal 2, Strasen described a more peaceful scene in Terminal 1, where she was located. She remembers the airport undergoing a lockdown. Through the windows at her gate, Strasen and her teammates could see people scrambling out of the airport looking for safety. She doesn't recall any announcements that there was a gunman — probably to keep those still inside from panicking, she thought. Instead, the team and other travelers at surrounding gates watched the scene unfold on cable news networks. She said everyone settled down after reports that the gunman was in custody. Teammates began to call relatives to let them know they were safe. ""Pretty much everything was calm because people thought the situation was under control,"" she said. ""We just assumed that at some point later, within the hour, we'd get on a plane."" But the drama wasn't over. Just as the team thought it might be allowed to board its flight, Strasen said three to four people donning orange vests came running toward their gates, screaming. ""Get on the ground! Get on the ground!"" Strasen recalled them yelling. Some witnesses said they heard three pops sounding like fireworks, though Strasen said she never heard a noise. Regardless, she and her teammates dove to the ground. Strasen grabbed one of her bags and attempted to use it as cover for her and a few others. They were under the impression another shooter was in the terminal. ""That's a very terrifying situation to be in,"" she said. ""Having to think how I was going to save my life."" Crews opened the gates and her team crawled to them Army Ranger-style, before running to the end of the jetway. They hurried down stairs to the tarmac, still confused about what had just transpired. For Strasen, the experience was a blur. The team eventually made its way away from the tarmac, sprinting toward another airport building after hearing another loud sound. The university's athletic department booked a hotel for the team that night. The swimmers returned to the airport the next morning to retrieve checked luggage. The carry-on bags remained at the gate where they had evacuated. By then, they had learned the details: Five people were killed and eight wounded before authorities apprehended the shooting suspect, identified as Esteban Santiago, 26. Strasen said going through the experience with her team and the help first responders provided along the way has eased some of her fears. Still, she is anxious about the next time she has to fly. She never imagined being that close to a mass shooting but said it brought her closer to her team and family. It also brought her some perspective. ""All we have is now,"" she said. ""Don't take anything for granted."" Contact LaVendrick Smith at lsmith@tampabay.com. Follow @LaVendrickS."

Noor Salman was taken into custody by the FBI at her Northern California home. Salman will make an initial appearance on Tuesday morning at the federal courthouse in Oakland, Calif., the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Florida said via Twitter. The charges could indicate that authorities believe she knew more about the assault — the most deadly mass shooting in U.S. history — than she has previously admitted. Orlando Police Chief John Mina said he welcomed the arrest. ""Nothing can erase the pain we all feel about the senseless and brutal murders of 49 of our neighbors, friends, family members and loved ones,"" Mina said in a statement. ""But today, there is some relief in knowing that someone will be held accountable for that horrific crime."" USA TODAY Orlando nightclub shooting: Who is Noor Salman? USA TODAY Survivors, city remember Orlando nightclub victims Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer echoed those thoughts, issuing a statement thanking law enforcement agencies for ""bringing some justice to this terrible tragedy."" ""Our community continues to heal and we remain focused on taking care of the needs of their victims and their families,"" Dyer said. Salman, in interviews with federal investigators after the shooting, allegedly acknowledged driving Mateen to the Pulse nightclub at least once before her husband launched the assault. But she told The New York Times in November she was unaware of his intentions until he sent her a 4 a.m. text message the night of the shooting, asking whether she had seen what happened on the news. The last message from her husband was a text saying, “I love you babe.” Scores of people were wounded in Mateen's assault. During the siege, Mateen called a local TV station and 911 to ""pledge allegiance"" to the Islamic State and its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. After hours of negotiations failed, authorities became concerned that Mateen would blow up the club. Officers finally smashed through a wall and engaged in another firefight with Mateen, who died at the scene. Salman, who has Palestinian roots, grew up in the small suburb of Rodeo, Calif., about 25 miles northeast of San Francisco. Salman met Mateen online and they married in 2011. Last month, Salman petitioned a California court to change the name of the couple's 4-year-old son, who is partly named for his father. A hearing was set for next month."

If you choose to enact diplomacy, it's game over because ""you made America look weak."" If you don't bomb anyone, same deal. But when tasked with  actuallybombing someone—like, say, Kabul—players are presented with a largely unlabeled map and a cursor. If you bomb the wrong country, you still win. ""I think the got they still got the message,"" the game reads, and asks you to try again.  
Bomb the Right Place is part of a larger series of pointed games in the GOP Arcade, which spent the better part of 2016 skewering the political rhetoric of the Grand Old Party and, quite often, Donald Trump. Some of their games, like  Bomb the Right Place, manage to relay an uncomfortable, powerful message through game design, regardless of political persuasion. (Though I'm a progressive who often disagrees with American foreign policy in the Middle East, I couldn't find Kabul on a map, and I shut the game off with a sense of shame. It worked.)  
Thoughts & Prayers, made in response to last year's hate-driven mass shooting in a gay nightclub in Orlando that took the lives of 49 people and wounded 53 others, is similarly agonizing. ""America faces an epidemic of mass shootings,"" reads the game's opening text, as Contra-style 16-bit music blares loudly. ""It's up to you to stop them."" Your only options, though, are to ""think"" and ""pray,"" riffing on the Republican Party's penchant for empty messages on social media after outbreaks of violence, rather than working towards gun control legislation.

Noor Salman, 30, did not enter a plea when she stood before a federal judge. ""She knew he was going to conduct the attack,"" federal prosecutor Roger Handberg told the judge. Handberg did not disclose any more details and would not comment after the 15-minute hearing, held in a courtroom packed with security officers. Outside court, Salman's uncle Al Salman said his niece was innocent and did nothing to help her husband, Omar Mateen, plan the June 12 attack on Pulse, a gay nightclub in Florida. ""She's a very soft and sweet girl,"" Salman said. ""She would not hurt a fly."" In an indictment unsealed Monday, she was accused of aiding and abetting Mateen in providing material support and resources to the Islamic State extremist group between April and June of last year. She also was charged with obstruction, accused of misleading and lying to police and the FBI during their investigation. The charges carry a sentence of up to life in prison. The indictment gave no additional details on Salman's actions. Mateen, 29, was killed by police in the June attack that also left 53 people injured inside the nightclub. Officials have said he appeared to have been radicalized online and professed allegiance to the Islamic State during the massacre. Since the attack, FBI agents have been exploring his wife's level of knowledge and involvement and had interviewed her at length. The couple lived in Fort Pierce, Fla., at the time of the mass shooting. After repeated interrogation by the FBI, Salman was arrested Monday at a house she shared with her mother in Rodeo, a San Francisco suburb. Al Salman said Noor Salman was physically and mentally abused by Mateen and that she stayed with him for fear of losing custody of their son. ""I understand this is a big crime that's happening, but don't sacrifice an innocent person,"" Al Salman told reporters outside the hearing. ""She would not hurt anybody. She don't like to see anybody get hurt. I know that the justice will prevail and is going to show that she is innocent."" A judge scheduled another hearing for today to discuss her possible release ahead of trial, her transfer to Florida to face the charges, and the appointment of a lawyer. Charles Swift, director of the Richardson, Texas-based Constitutional Law Center for Muslims in America, planned to represent her at that hearing, said public defender John Paul Reichmuth, who served as her attorney during Tuesday's proceedings. Linda Moreno, a Florida attorney who also represents Salman, said after Salman's arrest that the widow ""had no foreknowledge nor could she predict what Omar Mateen intended to do that tragic night."" Salman told The New York Times in an interview published in November that she knew her husband had watched jihadi videos but that she was ""unaware of everything"" regarding his intent to shoot up the club. Salman also said he had physically abused her. Information for this article was contributed by Sarah Tan of The Washington Post.

Beneath the taxidermied deer and bighorn sheep heads, some of the display racks at San Diego's SoCal Gun sit bare. ""There are no AR-15s for sale anymore,"" manager Greg Kerrebrock said. An end-of-year crush cleaned out the shop's inventory as customers gobbled up models affected by a new law that kicked in on January 1. Part of a sweeping package of reforms pushed by Democrats in 2016, the regulations clamped down on a gun industry innovation, known as the bullet button, that flouted an earlier statute meant to regulate rifles with detachable, quickly reloadable ammunition magazines. Under the revised rules, Californians in possession of assault weapons that incorporate a bullet button and certain other features have until the end of this year to register them with the state, a step that some gun owners are loathe to take. Stores like SoCal can't sell new bullet button-equipped guns, and don't yet have an alternative that they can be sure will comply with the enhanced restrictions. But all that could soon change. Just as they did the last time California updated its longstanding assault weapons law, enterprising gunsmiths are ready with new products that could render the tighter restrictions largely moot. On the same day that Governor Jerry Brown signed the new law, Darin Prince, the inventor of the original bullet button, announced the release of a gun add-on called the Patriot Mag Release, or, as he dubbed it, the ""Bullet Button Reloaded."" Other companies offer similar products, such as the AR Maglock, developed in response to an assault weapons law passed in 2013 in New York State. The mechanisms, which can be purchased online, are designed to meet legislators' rules for detachable ammunition magazines, while still allowing shooters to blast away with minimal interruptions. As such, the products ""undermine the spirit and effectiveness of California's gun safety reforms,"" said Ari Freilich, an attorney with the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Standing between the workarounds and California gun buyers is state Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a former congressman appointed to the post in December by Brown following ex-Attorney General Kamala Harris's election to the US Senate. Though the Department of Justice has issued preliminary guidance on the refined assault weapons ban, Becerra has not yet handed down a formal ruling on rifles modified with the devices produced by Prince and his counterparts. A spokeswoman for the office would not provide a timeline for when that decision might come. Until Becerra weighs in, it won't be clear what gun designs will remain on the right side of the law—setting up a decision that will reverberate through one of America's largest firearms markets. Dispatcher Michelle Rodriguez of the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, becomes emotional as she recounts the events of the deadly San Bernardino terrorist attack during a press conference with first responders worked during that day, in San Bernardino, Calif., on Dec. 8, 2015. (Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) The expanded assault weapons ban now in place in California came as a response to the horrors of the December 2015 San Bernardino massacre. The perpetrators of that mass shooting used AR-15s outfitted with bullet buttons to kill 14 and wound 22 in a matter of minutes and fire dozens of rounds at police officers during the subsequent standoff. Twenty-six years earlier, another mass shooting prompted politicians in Sacramento to passed the country's first law banning the sale and controlling the possession of certain military-style semiautomatic rifles. In that 1989 incident, a drifter armed with an AK-47 killed 5 children and injured 30 others at an elementary school in the city of Stockton. The 1989 law made it illegal for California gun dealers to sell firearms designated as ""assault weapons"" by the statute. Owners who already had those firearms had to register them with the state and have not been allowed to resell, trade, or give them away to other California residents. But the 1989 statute contained a loophole: It applied only to individual makes and models spelled out in the text of the legislation. Functionally identical guns, made by different companies or under different names, could still be sold—and soon were, by the thousands. The lookalikes also eluded the registration requirement. In 2000, the state expanded the list of banned assault weapons to include whole classes of AR-15 and AK-47 style weapons, along with any center-fire semiautomatic rifle with a detachable ammunition magazine and (the ""and"" is crucial) any of six features: A pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon.
A thumbhole stock.
A folding or telescoping stock.
A grenade launcher or flare launcher.
A flash suppressor.
A forward pistol grip. The gun world responded to the updated regulation with fresh workarounds. Many companies introduced so-called featureless rifles that have a detachable magazine, but none of the other attributes that would qualify a firearm as an assault weapon under California's rules. Taking the opposite route was the mechanism that would come to be known as the bullet button. In singling out detachable magazines, California lawmakers were attempting to curb a design feature that makes it possible for a shooter to eject a spent magazine with the flick of a finger, then quickly reload a new one. Still allowed, according to the 2000 regulation, were magazines that required a tool to remove. Introduced by Prince in 2006, the bullet button is just what it sounds like—a button that can be activated by the tip of a bullet or other simple implement—and it makes reloading as simple and fast as possible, within the confines of the law. Because a rifle with a bullet button did not technically have a detachable magazine, it could be customized with all the other features that for assault weapons fans are key to their appeal. Soon, big manufacturers like Smith & Wesson, Ruger, and Stag Arms were incorporating the bullet button into their products. Under the 2016 law, the bullet button is no longer acceptable, as the new regulations regard weapons with the mechanism as having a detachable magazine. Guns with bullet buttons and at least one of the other banned features can no longer be sold. Californians who own such guns have until January 1, 2018, to register them with the state. California's assault weapons laws are controversial with gun owners because they heavily restrict firearms that are wildly popular, readily available in most other states, and rarely used in crimes, compared to handguns. Many gun-rights advocates say the features that qualify a rifle as an assault weapon are arbitrary and do not meaningfully affect its lethality. They chafe at the rules against reselling or giving away the guns, noting that if an assault weapons owner wants to get rid of his or her guns, or dies, the rifle must be surrendered to police, transferred out of state, or sold only to select dealers. ""When I die, my guns die—if it were registered, I couldn't leave it to my kids,"" explained Sam Paredes, the executive director of Gun Owners of California. The biggest bugbear, however, is the registration requirement itself, which is viewed conspiratorially by ideologically committed gun owners who disdain government involvement in their affairs. As Joel Persinger, a California gun writer and YouTuber puts it, ""There is no compelling reason for a government to register firearms except as a necessary step toward confiscating them."" The rush by California assault rifle fans to stock up ahead of the new regulations was stunning. In December alone, the FBI processed more than 93,000 checks on long gun sales in the state, nearly double the 48,000 processed in December 2015. In the category of products that includes receivers (the part of a semiautomatic rifle that receives ammunition and is often the base for customized AR-15s), the FBI saw background checks in California jump from just shy of 10,000 in December 2015 to almost 78,000 in the last month of 2016. Californians who didn't pick up an assault rifle before the tougher ban kicked in are out of luck. Those who did are still supposed to register the weapons. And that, at last, is why so much rides on the latest workarounds. Check out the Motherboard documentary about 3D-printed guns. Central to California's expanded assault weapons ban is its revised definition of a detachable magazine. Now, if you have a semiautomatic rifle that comes with any of the other banned features and can be reloaded ""without disassembly of the firearm action""—the part of the gun that moves ammunition into the firing position—you have a gun that can't be sold and must be registered. Neither Prince's Patriot Mag Release nor the AR Maglock is quite as efficient as the bullet button when it comes to contravening the law that inspired it. Whereas it takes two motions to reload a rifle with a bullet button—press the release node, slide in a new magazine—with the new products, it takes all of four. On many AR-style rifles, disassembling the action is a simple as popping the hood of a car. The shooter pulls a pin, and the two halves of the rifle—its upper and lower receivers—swing apart on a hinge. Ordinarily, one would do this to clean the gun, replace a part, or add lubricant. The Patriot Mag Release and AR Maglock alter the gun so that it only releases an empty magazine when the action is open—which the products' proponents interpret as complying with the disassembly mandate. The shooter then slaps in a fresh magazine and closes the action. After a momentary interruption, the rifle is ready to resume firing. In the wake of the San Bernardino attack, Marc Levine, the Democratic state assemblyman who sponsored the law revising California's assault weapon statute, got firsthand experience with rifles altered to skirt California's rules. During a visit to the California Highway Patrol's shooting range, Levine squared a rifle equipped with a bullet button against his shoulder, took aim at the bullseye, and started pulling the trigger. ""I could empty ten rounds into a target and reload a magazine in a couple seconds,"" he said. ""And I have almost no training."" Levine was not surprised to see products like the Patriot Mag Release appear after his bill passed. ""There's always a hardware race,"" he said. ""We will continue to struggle with this."" In the meantime, he said he hopes that the new rules will yield at least incremental progress toward reducing the death toll of mass shootings in the state. ""My goal is to at least slow down the carnage."" Check out this VICE News visit to Moscow, where the CEO of Kalashnikov Group and its PR agency explain efforts to rebrand their firearms. As at SoCal Guns, the Fowler Gun Room in Orange isn't offering workaround products before the state Department of Justice makes its move. A representative of Greta's Guns in Simi Valley said that store is taking a similar approach. Meanwhile, gun owners modifying their weapons with the Patriot Mag Release of AR Maglock are doing so in a legal gray area. Walter Ponce, a 28-year-old EMT from Azusa, northeast of Los Angeles, installed the latter device on his rifle in November. He could have instead opted for a ""featureless"" rifle, but that would have meant giving up the pistol grip that he finds makes a semiautomatic long gun easier to hold when shooting. There were also appearances to consider: Ponce believes featureless rifles look ungainly compared to kitted-out AR-15s. ""I'm going for looks,"" he said. If the AR Maglock is deemed to violate the new assault weapons ban, however, Ponce says he will register his weapon with the state. Sam Paredes, the executive director of Gun Owners of California, opted to make at least one of his rifles featureless because of the law change. He's planning to experiment with the Patriot Mag Release or AR Maglock on the rest of his rifles to see which configuration he likes best, so he'll be ready to retool his assault weapons collection when the attorney general's decision arrives. He said many of his peers are similarly biding their time: ""We're all keeping our powder dry, so to speak."" Prince, the designer of the Patriot Mag Release, declined to comment for this article, citing the pending DOJ decision. (The maker of the AR Maglock also declined an interview request.) In a statement he issued while revealing his latest invention, he signaled a willingness to wait out new business opportunities. ""We have had the Patriot Mag Release in the wings for many years,"" he wrote. ""Together, we will weather this storm and come out shining."" Records show that Prince filed a patent for the device in 2013. A version of this article was originally published by the Trace, a nonprofit news organization covering guns in America.

In a statement to media, Bee announced plans for what many are predicting will essentially be a roast of Donald Trump.     The first annual ""Not the White House Correspondents' Dinner"" is set to take place on April 29, the same night as the WHCA dinner, at Washington's Willard Hotel. In a statement, Bee explained that ""journalists and non-irritating celebrities from around the world"" would be invited to attend. She added, ""We are really doing this. This is not a joke."" Speculating on the current state of relations between team Trump and the media, Bee continued, ""We suspect some members of the press may find themselves unexpectedly free that night, and we want to feed them and give them hugs."" The WHCA Dinner provides an opportunity for the press to mingle with key members of the current administration. Considering Trump's treatment of the press has led some to speculate that current White House relations with the media are at an all-time low, some have begun to wonder whether the dinner will take place at all this year. During Trump's first week in power, he and members of his administration have repeatedly labeled the media as ""dishonest"" while referring to them as the ""opposition party."" While past years have seen the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner criticized for blurring the boundaries between the media and the politicians they report on, the risk of that with the Trump administration seems low.      Bee's willingness to tackle big issues has seen her labeled as ""the best political voice on late-night television."" Following last year's mass shooting in Orlando, Bee rallied for change to gun control laws. Reacting to statements from several Florida politicians, the actress attacked their acceptance of the inevitability of such attacks.   While it hasn't yet been announced whether the satirical event will be televised, it is understood that talks are continuing with network TBS. All proceeds from the event will be donated to the Committee to Protect Journalists, an American organization dedicated to the promotion of free press. [Featured image by Evan Agostini/AP Images]"

In response, Donald Trump, then preparing for the Iowa caucuses, fulminated about the radical measures he would impose on Muslims seeking to enter the United States, if he were elected President. Trump was hardly alone in announcing rash proposals; on the subject of counterterrorism, it was a time of competitive opportunism among Republican Presidential candidates. Yet, in his nativism and bellicosity, Trump was already separating from his opponents. He began by making a series of loose comments during television interviews, including a suggestion that he might force American Muslims to register in a database. The following month, after a mass shooting in San Bernardino, he issued a formal statement promising “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on.”"

After each mass shooting, legislators would file solemnly onto the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, proclaim their immense sadness and frustration over the latest tragedy, and bow their heads—then do nothing. That “grisly routine,” as the congresswoman calls it, repeated yet again after the massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in June, the deadliest in American history. Republicans refused to allow a vote on legislation with overwhelming public support: a bill to close a loophole on background checks, and another forbidding people on the FBI’s terrorism watch list from buying guns. “That’s all we have are these moments of silence,” Clark, a Democrat who represents Massachusetts’s 5th congressional district, told the New Republic. “The absolute refusal to bring forth two commonsense bills that are pro–Second Amendment and can help stem the incredible wave of gun violence we’re seeing in this country; they’re bipartisan, and commonsense, and we couldn’t even get them up for a vote.” Clark took her frustration to Representative John Lewis, the civil rights icon from Georgia. He suggested they “try something dramatic,” and together they led a sit-in on the House floor. Republicans ignored the action and shut off C-SPAN’s live feed, which the Democrats worked around by broadcasting live to social media. The sit-in lasted more than 24 hours, drawing 170 legislators in the House chamber and a large crowd of supporters outside the Capitol Building. “This was something that had really captured the attention not only of the American people, but across the globe,” said Clark, calling it “an incredible moment of pride” for the Democrats. “It was an extraordinary moment.” It was—albeit an unsuccessful one, if the goal was to force a vote on the two gun bills. But compared to the usual milquetoast behavior of Congress, the spectacle was almost revolutionary. And it wasn’t the first time Clark had taken such a bold stand. A former prosecutor, she made national news during the Gamergate controversy in 2015, when she launched a crusade against internet trolls—calling on the FBI and Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute online harassment, and sponsoring several bills to address the problem. More recently, she was just the second of more than 60 members to announce she would boycott Donald Trump’s inauguration. Instead, she spent the day meeting with the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts. The next day she was back in the capitol for the Women’s March on Washington. Democrats, now fully in the minority in Washington, will need this kind of political punch in opposing the Trump administration, but they will also need legislative savvy. Clark is not a bomb-throwing ideologue who’s more interested in getting media attention than in getting things done on the Hill. In the 114th Congress, she was the lead sponsor of eight bills that were signed into law. More recently, she’s sponsored legislation in the House—The Presidential Conflicts of Interest Act—that would attempt to rein in the Trump administration’s myriad violations of the Emoluments Clause; the bill has around 80 co-sponsors for so far. At a time when the Democratic Party is bitterly divided between the emboldened progressives and reeling centrists, Clark has carved out a space that fluctuates between the party’s poles. She’s willing to be a progressive pugilist when necessary, but has also demonstrated the savvy to reach across the aisle in the service of her ideals. That political flexibility—or cunning, depending on your perspective—may prove invaluable to the Democratic opposition to Trump, which suggests Clark’s star may rise further yet. Katherine Clark was born in 1963 in New Haven, Connecticut. Her mother was a librarian, her father an attorney. After getting her law degree from Cornell, she joined a large firm in Chicago. She later clerked for a federal judge in Colorado, followed by stints with the state’s attorney general and the Colorado District Attorneys’ Council. In 1995, Clark moved to Massachusetts, where she studied at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and worked as general counsel for the state Office of Child Care Services. That latter role has shaped much of her family-based approach when it comes to legislation. “I became a prosecutor and did a lot of crimes against children, and that’s really where I became interested in the intersection of how families fall into our criminal system,” she said. “That brought me to issues around housing, educational opportunities, how we deal with income inequality and job opportunities. All those policies, I hoped, if I could work on those, it could prevent these children from moving into the criminal justice system.” Though Clark volunteered on Bill Clinton’s campaign in 1992, it wasn’t until 2001 that she entered politics herself, running for the Melrose School Committee. She was among eight candidates for nine open spots—hardly a brave gamble, she jokes. Once she tasted public service, she was hooked. In 2002, she ran unsuccessfully for the Massachusetts Senate before eventually winning a seat in the state House in 2007. Even then, she never imagined serving in the U.S. House of Representatives. “People often ask me if being in Congress is a lifelong dream. But as early as a few weeks before I announced for Congress I still thought it was not a place where I wanted to put my energy,” she said. “In some ways this is an unlikely journey for me.” Clark has Barack Obama to thank for it—indirectly. After the president tapped John Kerry for secretary of state, Representative Ed Markey won a special election for Kerry’s vacated seat. A second special election was then held for Markey’s congressional seat. Clark dispatched six Democratic rivals before trouncing the Republican choice with 66 percent of the vote. In her short time on the Hill, Clark has won the admiration of her colleagues and constituents. She’s a compelling speaker, as comfortable delivering an emotional plea or self-deprecating wisecrack as she is explaining wonky legislation. Her successful bills include federal funding for the study of and treatment of postpartum depression, and measures to address the opioid epidemic that has hit much of the country, including her own district. The latter law, she says, is an example of how the two parties can find common ground: Mitch McConnell is the lead sponsor. “This epidemic doesn’t care if you’re a red state or blue state, what level of income you have, how much education, it is an equal opportunity killer,” she said. Clark also penned a domestic violence bill with Republican Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, with whom she played on the women’s congressional softball team. “I observed the same phenomena when she was in the legislature,” said Massachusetts Representative Alice Peisch, who served with Clark in the state legislature. Peisch credits Clark with pushing through one of the most significant pieces of legislation she worked on, a 2010 achievement gap bill that then-Governor Deval Patrick called the “the biggest step forward we’ve made in nearly two decades in public schools.” Clark earned a coveted spot on the U.S. House Committee on Appropriations this year, and has even had her name floated as a potential challenger next year to Massachusetts’ popular Republican governor, Charlie Baker. Steven Ultrino, another state representative who worked with Clark, isn’t surprised to see her national profile growing. “She’s not one of those average politicians when she sees a camera she runs to it,” he said. “A lot of what she does is behind the scenes.” Despite her time in Washington, Clark is still a regular presence in the community, he said. For instance, a constituent in Malden recently got very sick, and wasn’t able to leave her home. “Katherine says, ‘I’ll come over next week and I’ll do your hair for you,’” Ultrino said. “You don’t see a city councilman do that never mind a congresswoman. I know it sounds touchy-feely but I think that’s what’s missing, from municipal up to Washington—the humanistic approach.” One Sunday night last January, while Clark and her husband watched TV at their home in Melrose, she noticed a large police presence forming outside. She went to the door to check it out and saw a swarm of officers on her lawn with their rifles drawn. Clark, whose two teenage sons were home at the time, asked what was going on—though she had a good idea. She’d be “swatted.” Melrose police later confirmed they’d received a computer-generated voice messages about “shots fired and an active shooter” at her address. Under normal circumstances, it would have been a terrifying thing to hear, but Clark, having recently introduced the Interstate Swatting Hoax Act, quickly pieced things together. “Your mind races through lots of scenarios,” she told me back in April. “I can only imagine if you were not familiar with swatting, and if the police hadn’t known they were responding to my house. It certainly has given me a new perspective on just how serious and dangerous this is.” Clark had introduced the anti-swatting bill after it happened to one of her constituents: video game developer Brianna Wu, who was targeted for harassment amid the Gamergate controversy in 2014. Wu had spoken out about sexism in the gaming industry, and eventually was forced to flee her home. Now Clark was the target of a similar harassment campaign. “Rather than backing down, [Clark] doubled down on changing this culture,” Wu, who recently announced she’s running for Congress, said earlier this year. “I think when we’re dealing with so much distrust of the political system, it seems broken, hopeless, and corrupt in some ways. But when you have someone like Clark who is putting it all on the line for the women in her district like me, it’s amazing. You don’t see that today.” This is where Clark seems to have found her niche: standing up to bullies, whether they’re internet trolls, the gun lobby, or President Trump. It’s something that Democrats will need more of in opposing the administration and a Republican Congress. “I think we’re at an extraordinary crossroads as a democracy, and that this extraordinary time calls for me to not just be standing there in support of the new president, but to instead say there are great dangers indicated here and we have to pay attention to them,” Clark said. “I think we’re going to have a lot of examples in this incoming administration where we need to come together to make sure the American people know they do have voices, they do have representatives that are working hard, and are going to be disruptive if that’s their only avenue.”"

The murmur around Tampa Bay has become that the Rays lost their ALDS playoff series with Boston due to a young pitching staff that was talented but not experienced. The Rays were the best team in the AL. They could have been the best team in the majors with just a little bit of money. A division series loss shouldn’t be used as a referendum on the Rays Way. The Tampa Bay Rays won 100 games in the regular season and claimed the AL East crown, but the team saw its 2021 campaign come to an end on Monday night in the ALDS. The Rays postseason came to an abrupt end last night, as the American League’s top seeded team fell to the Red Sox in back-to-back walk off losses. It hurts, and it’s going to for a while. There is much consolation when looking at the Tamp Bay Rays‘ ouster from the American League playoffs. Sure, they were beaten three games to one by the Baseball's former top prospect more than lived up to the hype in his first season, including in the ALDS Rays backstop Mike Zunino had the best season of his career in 2021. How did the team’s top prospects perform in 2021? Last week, Durham wrapped up the Rays’ minor league season, and it was a successful one: In the minors, individual performance is more important than team performance, and the season was also a success on that front. Kiké Hernandez was the biggest bat for the Boston Red Sox in their ALDS with the Tampa Bay Rays that ended on Monday night. So it was fitting to see him be the one to end the series with a walk-off RBI. Team eliminated from ALDS Many of us had cleared our October calendars for a long playoff run. We had our Game 5 tickets. We had our ALCS tickets. But it’s over tonight, and somehow the Rays — a 100 win team that dominated baseball’s strongest division, couldn’t make it out of the first round of the playoffs. The Tampa Bay Rays will face elimination on Monday night. The Boston Red Sox took a 2-1 series lead over the Rays in Game 3 of the ALDS, and as a result, Tampa Bay will have to fight for its life in Game 4. In a game that lasted 13 innings and five hours and fourteen minutes, the comeback kids had a short-lived lead, an epic game-tying eighth, and a game-changing ruling. A controversial ground-rule double by Tampa Bay's Kevin Kiermaier in the 13th inning of Sunday's pivotal ALDS Game 3 denied the Rays the go-ahead run and set the stage for Red Sox catcher Christian Vazquez's walk-off homer in the bottom of the inning. The Rays outfielder was disappointed that the rule hurt his team. He also was bummed that he narrowly missed a two-run home run. Drew Rasmussen started Game 3 of the ALDS for the Rays, which they lost in 13 innings. Tampa Bay seemed destined to take the lead in the 13th inning of Game 3 against the Red Sox, but a bad bounce and a short wall had other ideas. View the original article to see embedded media. What an awful break for the Rays. Not only were they robbed of the run, but they would have had a chance to add to their lead too with Kevin Kiermaier in scoring position and momentum on their side. The Tampa Bay Rays don't yet know who they'll be facing in the upcoming American League Division Series, but they've confirmed who will get the ball for the opener on Thursday. The Tampa Bay Rays are the first team from the American League that have qualified for the 2021 Major League Baseball playoffs. On Wednesday, the Rays defeated the Toronto Blue Jays 7-1.

All over Europe, it’s happening,” he said to the assembled military leaders. “It’s gotten to a point where it’s not even being reported. And in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that.” The comment immediately harked back to comments from senior adviser Kellyanne Conway on MSNBC last week. “I bet it’s brand-new information to people that President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized and were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre,” she said. “Most people don’t know that because it didn’t get covered.” It was brand-new information to people because there was no “Bowling Green massacre.” Conway had referred to the supposed terrorist attack previously, including in response to a question posed by TMZ. But the two Iraqis arrested in Bowling Green, Ky., in 2011 never committed an attack in the United States. She later admitted that she’d misspoken. Trump’s comment goes far further than Conway’s, though. Her statement that “it didn’t get covered” probably referred to the alleged “six-month ban” from the Obama administration. (That this, too, didn’t happen has been somewhat swept under the rug.) Trump is positing that the media actively suppresses news of terrorist attacks to fulfill a political agenda. It’s certainly true that not every terrorist attack receives broad coverage in the national media. FiveThirtyEight looked at the likelihood that a terrorist attack in a foreign country would be covered by the New York Times, looking at coverage of 40,129 attacks from 1968 to 2009. Not every attack received coverage over that period. Last spring, the Los Angeles Times set out to log every single terrorist attack in the month of April, counting 180 attacks that killed 858 people. Not every one of those attacks made your local nightly newscast. The White House released a list of ‘under covered’ terror attacks it would like you to look at But filtering what to cover is very different than suppressing information. On any given day, local newspapers and news broadcasts decide what to spend resources on. If your home is burglarized, it may not make the cut. This probably isn’t because the Channel 5 news director has a vendetta against you; it’s that there are limited resources. Trump’s comment is very much in line with comments he made last June about President Barack Obama. “Look guys, we’re led by a man that either is not tough, not smart or has something else in mind,” Trump said about Obama’s response to the attack at a gay nightclub in Orlando. “And the something else in mind — people can’t believe it. People cannot believe that President Obama is acting the way he acts and can’t even mention the words radical Islamic terrorism. There’s something going on.” The clear implication: Obama is on the side of the terrorists. Trump didn’t quite say that the media was siding with the terrorists, just that the media would happily ignore terrorism if it made Trump look bad. Interestingly, Trump himself ignored the mass shooting that occurred at a mosque in Quebec last week, killing six people. White House press secretary Sean Spicer told the media that the president and the Canadian prime minister had spoken, but Trump himself declined to weigh in. (Spicer cited the attack mostly as somehow validating Trump’s immigration policies.) Trump did tweet about another attack. In that one, no one was killed. Trump has consistently seen attacks like that in Quebec — committed by a young man who espoused anti-Muslim politics and defended Trump online — as isolated incidents from mentally disturbed individuals, while attacks by Muslims are part of a broader pattern spurred by radical Islamism. He sees an institution behind attacks by Muslims that he doesn’t see behind attacks like that in Quebec or in Charleston in 2015. That helps explain why he is willing to focus the country’s anti-terrorism efforts solely on terrorism committed in the name of Islam: He doesn’t see how other threats are systemic. With his comments on Monday, Trump implied that the media is complicit in making terrorists successful. It’s part of a recent pattern of suggesting that others are standing in the way of his terrorism-fighting efforts, which includes disparaging a federal judge who halted his immigration executive order. Conway’s comments about Bowling Green earned her an enormous amount of public mockery — an undue amount, given the likelihood that her comments were a mistake rather than an intentional lie. Trump’s comments are of an entirely different order and magnitude. Trump’s relationship with the media has never been strong during his time in politics. But he’s never before tried to push the media into the “against us” circle alongside those who commit acts of terrorism — at least, not so explicitly. We don’t anticipate that, like Conway, he’ll admit to having misspoken. Update: In a press availability on Air Force One, Spicer tried to soften Trump’s comment. Terror attacks had been “under reported,” not “unreported.” He continued, according to the pool report: Spicer said the White House would at some point release examples of this “under reporting.” Update: The list is out, according to CNN.

Decisions about firearms in schools should be left to local and state officials, DeVos said in response to a question from Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). DeVos pointed to a rural Wyoming school that is surrounded by a fence to keep bears out. “I would imagine there’s probably a gun in the school to protect from potential grizzlies,” she said. Betsy DeVos, Trump’s education pick, lauded as bold reformer, called unfit for job Murphy — an advocate for gun control whose constituents include parents who lost children in a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn., in 2012 — asked whether DeVos would support Trump if he moves forward with his proposal, which he first made a year ago, to ban gun-free school zones.

602475441,2017-02-06 07:00:00,Here are the 78 terrorist attacks the White House says were largely underreported,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/02/06/here-are-the-78-terrorist-attacks-the-white-house-says-were-largely-under-reported/?utm_term=.b44fe72ddcfb,en,False,,2,Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,"This article is more than 1 year old The White House on Monday night released a list of 78 terrorist attacks in response to an assertion earlier in the day by President Trump that the “very dishonest press” often doesn’t report on them. The list, which includes domestic and overseas incidents, starts in September 2014. It includes some very heavily covered news events, including last year’s attack at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando and the mass shooting and attempted bombing in San Bernardino, Calif., in 2015. But the White House asserted that most of incidents on the list were under-covered by Western media sources. ‘If something happens’: Trump points his finger in case of a terrorist attack During an appearance at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Trump sought to make the case for the need to be vigilant at a time when legal action looms over his now-frozen ban on travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Trump cited attacks in the United States and in Europe as he spoke of the dangers of “radical Islamic terrorists.” “In many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report it,” Trump said. “They have their reasons, and you understand that.” White House spokesman Sean Spicer later told reporters that Trump believes attacks are not “unreported” but “underreported.” “He felt members of the media don’t always cover some of those events to the extent that other events might get covered,” Spicer told reporters traveling on Air Force One. Later Monday, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said that “the real point here is that these terrorists attacks are so pervasive at this point that they do not spark the wall-to-wall coverage they once did.” “If you look back just a few years ago, any one of these attacks would have been ubiquitous in every news outlet, and now they’re happening so often — at a rate of more than once every two weeks, according to the list we sent around — that networks are not devoting to each of them the same level of coverage they once did,” she said.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy","This article is more than 1 year old The White House on Monday night released a list of 78 terrorist attacks in response to an assertion earlier in the day by President Trump that the “very dishonest press” often doesn’t report on them. The list, which includes domestic and overseas incidents, starts in September 2014. It includes some very heavily covered news events, including last year’s attack at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando and the mass shooting and attempted bombing in San Bernardino, Calif., in 2015. But the White House asserted that most of incidents on the list were under-covered by Western media sources. ‘If something happens’: Trump points his finger in case of a terrorist attack During an appearance at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Trump sought to make the case for the need to be vigilant at a time when legal action looms over his now-frozen ban on travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Trump cited attacks in the United States and in Europe as he spoke of the dangers of “radical Islamic terrorists.” “In many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report it,” Trump said. “They have their reasons, and you understand that.” White House spokesman Sean Spicer later told reporters that Trump believes attacks are not “unreported” but “underreported.” “He felt members of the media don’t always cover some of those events to the extent that other events might get covered,” Spicer told reporters traveling on Air Force One. Later Monday, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said that “the real point here is that these terrorists attacks are so pervasive at this point that they do not spark the wall-to-wall coverage they once did.” “If you look back just a few years ago, any one of these attacks would have been ubiquitous in every news outlet, and now they’re happening so often — at a rate of more than once every two weeks, according to the list we sent around — that networks are not devoting to each of them the same level of coverage they once did,” she said.

571747878,2017-01-24 22:38:17,"Trump Prepares To Halt Syrian Refugee Admissions, Limit Muslim Entry",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2017/01/24/trump-muslim-ban-refugees_n_14378704.html,en,False,,27502,HuffPost,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/#,"Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Producer, The Huffington Post UPDATE 1/25/17: HuffPost obtained a draft of the executive order. Read it below. WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump is preparing to issue an executive order dramatically restricting refugee admissions to the U.S. and denying visas to individuals from countries his administration deems high-risk, according to congressional and advocacy organization sources briefed on a draft. The executive order could still change before Trump signs it, which could happen this week. According to sources, administration officials are considering: Sources briefed on the draft executive order said the list of countries targeted is not yet finalized, but those under consideration ― Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen ― are all Muslim-majority nations. Trump vowed last year to suspend immigration from “terror-prone regions” as one of his first moves. In its current form, the executive order would allow Trump to claim victory on one of his main campaign promises ― a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” But because it would allow some Muslims from countries other than the list of “high-risk” nations to enter the U.S., it falls short of that vow. The White House and the Department of Homeland Security declined to comment. Trump hinted at an announcement in a Tweet on Tuesday night. Big day planned on NATIONAL SECURITY tomorrow. Among many other things, we will build the wall! Although it reflects anti-refugee sentiment spreading worldwide, the draft of Trump’s order represents a dramatic upending of current U.S. policy toward some of the globe’s most unstable regions. It will inevitably face opposition from human rights groups, civil liberties organizations, Democrats and even members of the Christian right, who have encouraged a sympathetic approach to the refugee crisis. The civil war in Syria, now in its sixth year, has left 4.8 million Syrians as refugees, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Since the war began in 2011, the U.S. has admitted only about 18,000 refugees from Syria, due in part to a lengthy vetting process that typically takes from 18 to 24 months. But as the humanitarian crisis in Syria worsened, former President Barack Obama pushed for an increase in admissions. During the last fiscal year, the U.S. accepted over 10,000 Syrian refugees. Despite the low number of admissions and the intensive, multi-agency screening process, resettling Syrian refugees in the U.S. has become a controversial issue. In response to Obama’s push to welcome more people from the country, more than half of U.S. governors ― all but one of them Republicans ― attempted to block Syrian refugees from resettling in their states. Throughout the presidential race, Trump seized on the growing national opposition to refugee resettlement. He first proposed banning Muslims from entering the U.S. in December 2015, following the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. Though his specifics varied over the year that followed, Trump continued to promise to heavily restrict immigration from countries with Muslim-majority populations. The draft executive order gives religious minorities priority in refugee admissions ― which may mean that Christians in most countries in the Middle East will be favored over Muslims. The executive order is expected to include a list of acts that would disqualify an individual from entering the U.S., two sources briefed on the language said. People who commit honor killings, bigotry, violence against women, or who persecute against people on the basis of religion, race, gender, or sexual orientation, would not be admitted, they said. The U.S. already denies admission to persecutors, criminals and human rights abusers. At least one refugee resettlement organization has already been briefed on an expected decline of refugee admissions to 50,000. That number is significantly lower than ceilings proposed before the Syrian civil war began. Former intelligence analysts have pointed out that a policy that specifically discriminates against Muslims perpetuates the narrative that the U.S. is at war with Islam, which serves as a powerful recruiting tool for jihadist groups like the so-called Islamic State and al Qaeda. “I ask Allah to deliver America to Trump,” one ISIS spokesman wrote in August.

567915116,2017-01-16 11:28:07,F.B.I. Arrests Wife of Killer in Orlando Mass Shooting,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/16/us/politics/noor-salman-arrested-orlando-shooting-omar-mateen.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,en,False,,1,New York Times,http://nytimes.com,"Advertisement Supported by By Adam Goldman and Alan Blinder WASHINGTON — The F.B.I. arrested the wife of the man who carried out a deadly terrorist attack in Orlando, Fla., and charged her with obstructing the investigation of the mass shooting, law enforcement officials said on Monday. Noor Salman, whose husband, Omar Mateen, killed 49 people and wounded dozens in an Orlando nightclub that was popular with gays, was also charged with aiding and abetting by providing material support, the officials said. She was taken into custody by F.B.I. agents at her home outside San Francisco, where she had been living with her young son. Prosecutors had been weighing charges against her for months in the aftermath of the attack by her husband on June 12, 2016. Investigators interviewed Ms. Salman for hours after the attack and came to believe she was not telling the truth about her husband’s plans to carry out the rampage. A Justice Department spokesman said Ms. Salman would make her initial appearance on Tuesday morning in federal court in Oakland, Calif. The Justice Department’s decision to prosecute Ms. Salman, 30, ends part of the mystery that has surrounded her since the first days after the attack, when she became a central subject of the wide-ranging investigation into her husband. “Noor Salman had no foreknowledge nor could she predict what Omar Mateen intended to do that tragic night,” said her lawyer, Linda Moreno. “Noor has told her story of abuse at his hands. We believe it is misguided and wrong to prosecute her and that it dishonors the memories of the victims to punish an innocent person.” Accounts of what happened from officials and witnesses. The aiding and abetting, a terrorism charge, suggests that prosecutors believe that Ms. Salman helped him in some way — either before or after the terrorist attack. The decision to charge her is not without risks for prosecutors. If the case goes to trial, prosecutors will have to contend with a jury that could be sympathetic to Ms. Salman, who said she was in an abusive relationship and living in fear. In an interview last year with The New York Times, Ms. Salman said she was “unaware of everything” in connection with the attack. Ms. Salman said she had accompanied her husband to Orlando with their child once when he scouted the club but did not know the purpose of the trip. On the day her husband drove to Orlando, she claimed he said he was going to visit a friend, named Nemo, who lived in Florida. But Nemo was not living in Florida at the time, a fact Ms. Salman said she did not know. She also said she had no reason to suspect that ammunition he bought in the days leading up to the attack was to be used in the shooting, given that her husband was a security guard who frequently purchased ammunition. On the day of the shooting, she bought her husband a Father’s Day card, expecting him to return that evening. Her lawyers believe that supports her story that she did not know about the attack. During his rampage, Mr. Mateen used Facebook to pledge his allegiance to the Islamic State. President Obama has said that Mr. Mateen “took in extremist information and propaganda over the internet and became radicalized.” Federal investigators do not believe that Mr. Mateen, who was 29 and who was killed by the police after the shooting, received any specific training or support from the Islamic State. Part of their inquiry has focused on whether anyone in the United States assisted in his plans for the attack. There has perhaps been no figure more central to those questions than Ms. Salman, who grew up in an avocado-colored home in Rodeo, Calif., near San Francisco. In Rodeo, on a diverse block populated by Chinese, Indian, Korean and Mexican families, neighbors recalled a younger Ms. Salman as warm and kind. Ms. Salman married Mr. Mateen in a ceremony near her childhood home in Northern California, a second marriage for both. After the wedding, Ms. Salman moved to Fort Pierce, Fla., where she and Mr. Mateen lived in a condominium complex. Their marriage in 2011 caused consternation among some of Ms. Salman’s relatives, mostly because of her Palestinian heritage and Mr. Mateen’s ancestral ties to Afghanistan. Ms. Salman said in the interview with The Times that her husband beat her repeatedly and verbally abused her. Members of Mr. Mateen’s family, who have tried to shield Ms. Salman from public scrutiny, have said they believe she did nothing improper. “She is shocked, that poor lady,” Seddique Mateen, Mr. Mateen’s father, said in June 2016. “And she doesn’t know anything.” The Orlando police chief, John W. Mina, said in a statement that he was “glad to see” that Ms. Salman had been arrested. “Nothing can erase the pain we all feel about the senseless and brutal murders of 49 of our neighbors, friends, family members and loved ones,” the chief said. “But today, there is some relief in knowing that someone will be held accountable for that horrific crime.” In two recent mass shootings, prosecutors have brought charges against people with ties to the attackers. In South Carolina, a friend of Dylann S. Roof, who was convicted of killing nine people on June 17, 2015, in a Charleston church, pleaded guilty in April to lying to federal investigators and misprision of a felony, or failing to inform authorities that a felony had been committed. The friend did not testify against Mr. Roof, who was sentenced to death last week. In 2015, the federal authorities in California brought charges against a neighbor of the husband and wife who killed 14 people and wounded 22 others in San Bernardino. The man, who bought the rifles used in the attack on Dec. 2, 2015, was accused of lying on forms filled out in connection with the purchase. Although he was also accused of planning a terrorist attack several years ago, the man was not charged with having a direct role in the San Bernardino rampage. However, federal prosecutors in the summer of 2014 declined to prosecute Katherine Russell, the wife of one of the assailants in the Boston Marathon bombing on April 15, 2013. F.B.I. agents believed she had made false statements to investigators and concealed knowledge of a crime. Advertisement"
573875462,2017-01-30 01:29:00,"6 killed, 8 injured by gunmen at Quebec City mosque",http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-mosque-shooting-quebec-city-20170129-story.html,en,False,,9,Chicago Tribune,http://www.chicagotribune.com/,"QUEBEC CITY — Quebec police confirmed in a news briefing that six people had been killed and eight injured, some seriously, in a mass shooting Sunday night at a mosque in suburban Quebec City as worshipers were finishing their prayers. Government officials called the attack an act of terrorism. A spokeswoman for the Sûreté du Québec, the Quebec provincial police, said that two suspects had been arrested. Investigations were continuing but the spokeswoman said the police do not believe at this time that others were directly involved in the attack. One of the suspects was arrested 14 miles east of the mosque along the shore of the St. Lawrence River on the approach to the bridge leading to the Island of Orleans. The bridge was closed by police. The second suspect was arrested close to the mosque. ""The situation is under control, the premises are secure and the occupants were evacuated,"" police said in a tweet. ""The investigation is ongoing."" Witnesses said that two gunmen opened fired at the Quebec Islamic Cultural Center. Local media reported that between 60 and 100 people were inside. ""Why is this happening here? This is barbaric,"" the mosque's president, Mohamed Yangui, told Reuters. Speaking on RDI, Quebec City police spokesman Etienne Doyon said that the shootings took place as prayers were ending Sunday evening. Witnesses reported that at least two hooded shooters entered the mosque and opened fire on congregants who had remained there after the end of prayers. Other said the shooters were wearing ski masks. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the shooting a ""terrorist attack"" and said Canadians grieved for the victims. ""It is heart-wrenching to see such senseless violence,"" he said in a statement. ""Diversity is our strength, and religious tolerance is a value that we, as Canadians, hold dear."" Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard also condemned the shooting as a ""terrorist act"" and called for solidarity with Muslims in Quebec. ""Quebec categorically rejects this barbaric violence,"" he said. The Quebec Islamic Cultural Center is located near Laval University, which has a large community of international students, many from French-speaking Africa and the Maghreb. The mosque, one of several in the area, was the target of a hate crime last June when a pig's head was left at the front door with the message ""Bonne appétit,"" as The Washington Post reported at the time. The consumption of pork is banned by Islam. Concerned about that kind of incident, the mosque installed several closed-circuit cameras around the building. The shooting is a particular shock for Quebec City, a quiet white-collar city with a low crime rate. In 2015, the city reported two murders. The metropolitan area has 800,000 people. According to La Presse, the province's leading newspaper, police were also treating the attack as a terrorist incident and had activated a joint task force involving municipal police, Quebec's provincial police and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Samer Majzoub, the president of the Canadian Muslim Forum, a Muslim advocacy group in Quebec, said he knows people who attend the Quebec City mosque, but that he and other area Muslim leaders were still trying frantically to find out who had been shot. ""People that we know, we are not sure if they're alive right now. They're saying about five confirmed, a dozen injured. And the police are cordoning all the area,"" he told The Post. ""It is shocking. It never came to our mind that we'd have a terrorist act as such, especially in Canada."" Majzoub said Canada has seen increasing anti-Muslim hostility over the past year, but still nowhere near the level witnessed in the United States and Europe. But he said the area where the mosque has appeared to be particularly prone to anti-Muslim sentiments. ""This masjid has witnessed a lot of issues before - threats and vandalism, and some Islamophobic graffiti,"" he said, using the Arabic word for mosque. ""It's not the first time."" Majzoub said the mosque has a small congregation of about a hundred people and attracts a lot of students because it's near a university. He said many of its attendees are of North African descent. ""We never thought it could happen,"" he said. ""It was a slaughter."" --- Abigail Hauslohner contributed to this report. Alan Freeman reported from Ottawa.

571186392,2017-01-23 19:00:37,New York Police Plan $275 Million Update to Training Complex,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/nyregion/nypd-training-facility-rodmans-neck.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,en,False,,1,New York Times,http://nytimes.com,"Advertisement Supported by By Marc Santora For nearly six decades, New York City police officers have trekked to a bog in a far-flung corner of the Bronx for essential weapons training and lifelike practice in situations that might require the use of deadly force. And for nearly as long, a discussion has occurred about whether this site, on the Rodman’s Neck peninsula, is the best place for the Police Department to base its firing range and other critical training operations. While that debate played out, the complex was largely neglected, not even connected to sewage lines and other utilities. “It is an extremely out-of-date, dilapidated facility,” said Vincent Grippo, the deputy commissioner for management and budget for the Police Department. “Nothing’s been done for 40 or 50 years.” On Tuesday, according to police officials, that will change as the city announces a $275 million investment in Rodman’s Neck, which, with the recent completion of a $1 billion police academy in Queens, would represent an ambitious effort to modernize and enhance the training accommodations for the city’s 35,000 police officers. The project is expected to be completed in two to five years. In fact, when the plans for the new academy were conceived about a decade ago, the idea was to consolidate all the training operations there and close Rodman’s Neck. But as William J. Bratton, then the police commissioner, noted at the opening of the academy in 2015, financial reality got in the way. “The recession of 2008 severely impacted city funds, and only half of what was envisioned was built,” he said. “Not built was a nine-story parking garage, a driving range on the roof of that garage; not built was an indoor range to replace our Rodman’s Neck facility; not built was a tactical training village — another $750 million.” Philip Heller, the director of capital construction for the Police Department, said it was determined that revitalizing Rodman’s Neck would cost half as much. The design for the project is not complete, but Mr. Heller said it would feature durability and flexibility in how the structures could be used. Some of the structures at Rodman’s Neck have not been upgraded since the Police Department took over the grounds, including the firing ranges, in 1960. Officials said they planned to build six outdoor ranges, costing $73 million, with sound baffles to reduce noise, which has been a source of complaints from nearby residents on City Island. “While the majority of use of the firing ranges at Rodman’s Neck is for completing semiannual firearm requalification, which requires only static target shooting for accuracy, the envisioned upgrades to the facility will allow for more tactical training,” a Police Department statement said. “Tactical shooting,” the statement added, “involves firing from different positions and locations on the range, offering more realistic shooting scenario training and higher level of intensity.” Officials said they would also build a $51 million tactical village, allowing officers to train for situations that might require the use of deadly force. The current village consists of two hollowed-out three-story buildings. Although the new village will also lack tall buildings, the goal is to make it possible to recreate as many situations as possible — including a mass shooting, the taking of hostages and an armed robbery. Another $54 million will be spent to create a training facility with gun services and ammunition storage. Finally, it will cost an estimated $97 million to upgrade and install basic utilities like gas and water and to do infrastructure work at the site. “Rodman’s Neck requires a complete overhaul, and this capital investment will deliver a state-of-the-art facility that meets the needs of 21st-century police training,” Austin Finan, a spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, said. Raymond Caroli, the commanding officer of firearms and tactical training, said that one of the biggest problems with the current site was that it was primarily geared to shooting at static targets. The new accommodations, especially the tactical village, could be used to test new officers in more situations. “In order to have a more effective police officer, you have to have a better-trained officer,” he said. “In order to have a better-trained officer, you have to have a better facility.” Advertisement"

That question, which feels more pressing by the day, is at the ruefully dark heart of Macon Blair’s “I don’t feel at home in this world anymore.” a hysterical and hyper-violent morality play for our fucked-up times. “Everyone is an asshole!” screams Ruth (the spectacular Melanie Lynskey), and she makes a pretty good point. A voice on the radio barks reports of another mass shooting. A truck in front of her pumps jet black exhaust straight into the air. Some jerk cuts her line at the grocery store. It’s like the rest of society held a secret meeting where they decided to spend the rest of their lives shitting on anyone who wasn’t invited, like every stranger she meets is just trying to screw her over. Ruth works at a hospital as a nursing assistant, and one of her patients — a bedridden old woman — puts its best: “Keep your gigantic monkey dick out of my good pussy.”  And then she immediately dies. No wonder Ruth is on so many anti-depressants. Anti-depressants that are stolen from her house during a daytime robbery that also deprives her of her laptop and her grandmother’s silver. The cop that comes by to check out the scene? All he wants to do is whine about how his wife is leaving him. That’s it. Ruth has had enough. With the help of a find-a-phone app and Tony (Elijah Wood), the rat-tailed, karate-obsessed neighbor whose dog loves to shit in Ruth’s yard, our fed up — but squeamish and unfailingly kind — protagonist decides to take matters into her own hands.  If “I don’t feel at home in this world anymore.” (which takes its title from an old Jim Reeves tune, gives it a colloquial tweak, and adds a period for emphasis), is too sure of itself to feel like a first film, that probably has something to do with the fact that Blair has been making movies with “Green Room” director Jeremy Saulnier for as long as the childhood friends have been alive. Blair would stand in front of the camera, his blank expression a perfect canvas for any number of sins, and Saulnier would sit behind it. But watching Blair’s directorial debut, it’s clear that the actor was so much more than his buddy’s muse. Part “Green Room” and part “Raising Arizona,” the movie takes the visually terse mode of vigilantism that Blair and Saulnier have already perfected and lowers the stakes just enough so that the same notes can be played for occasional belly laughs. Displaying the same command of tone that defined the likes of “Blue Ruin,” Blair is careful not to let the story sink into parody — it barely even registers as satire — but he has a great deal of fun anchoring a story like this to two characters who have absolutely no business being around this much blood. READ MORE: The 2017 IndieWire Sundance Bible: Every Review, Interview, And News Story From The Fest  Given how much she projectile vomits at the sight of blood, Ruth probably isn’t the world’s greatest nursing assistant, but her haplessness makes her a terrific heroine. Lynskey is ideal — as HBO’s short-lived “Togetherness” proved so well, there is no actress alive who’s so good at threading the needle between everyday anxiety and righteous conviction. Wood is a great foil for her — hardly the intense psychopath that he initially appears, Tony is just a friendless kook who wears a ninja star as a belt buckle (and will throw it at every available opportunity). Watching his dweebiness blossom into its full glory is one of the film’s finest pleasures, the process allowing for some delightful carnage and the funniest hacking scene there ever was. While the villains that Blair cooks up for these characters are underwhelming by comparison, the director’s keen eye for casting weirdos and low-rent monsters is on par with the Coen brothers’. “I don’t feel at home in this world anymore.” is at its best when it sticks to the thesis that it lays out in its opening minutes and sporadically revisits throughout. Quoth one particularly unfortunate character: “Anyone can do anything if you let them. Welcome to the world.” When firing on all cylinders during its first half, Blair’s canny script doesn’t just rub our faces in that point, it questions how a decent person can possibly fight back without becoming part of the problem. When the rest of the world goes lower, Ruth goes lower. But instead of following this idea down the rabbit hole, Blair gets sidetracked by all the fun he’s having — instead of building the giddily anarchic third act around the frustrations that got Ruth into this mess in the first place, the film follows a chase scene into the woods and lets her story peter out with a shrugged off suggestion that friendship will see us through. The film never loses its strong sense of character, but those characters deserve a bit more love than they’re afforded. Still, Lynskey and Wood see it through. But one look between these platonic avengers — their friendship forged by frustration — and it’s clear that while the world may be fucked, it’s ours to make of it what we will. “I don’t feel at home in this world anymore.” premiered in the U.S. Dramatic Competition of the 2017 Sundance Film Festival.

665865723,2017-01-10 07:00:00,Publishers Encounter Political Storms in Turn to Right,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/business/media/publishers-encounter-political-storms-in-turn-to-right.html,en,False,,1,New York Times,http://nytimes.com,"Advertisement Supported by By Alexandra Alter Milo Yiannopoulos — the infamous internet troll, Donald J. Trump supporter and editor at Breitbart News — has compared Islam to cancer, mocked transgender people and suggested that women who are harassed online should stay off the web. Last July, he was permanently barred from Twitter for violating the platform’s rules against hate speech and harassment. So when Threshold Editions, a conservative imprint at Simon & Schuster, gave him a six-figure publishing contract, the blowback was swift and furious. There were calls for a boycott of all of the company’s books, a vast catalog of some 2,000 titles from 50 imprints. Some of Simon & Schuster’s authors — including Karen Hunter, Danielle Henderson and Bradley Trevor Greive — denounced the publisher on social media. The Chicago Review of Books said it would not review any of the company’s books this year. The criticism highlights the minefield that publishers face as they try to court an emerging market of young conservatives who identify with extreme right-wing stances on issues like immigration and gender equality — positions embodied with devious, irreverent glee by Mr. Yiannopoulos — that they feel are undermining the nation. Many liberals and moderates say, however, those positions amount to outright racism and misogyny. And the issue has cast an uncomfortable spotlight on a lucrative but often overlooked niche within the largely left-leaning publishing world. Every major publishing house has a conservative imprint — Penguin Random House has two, Sentinel and Crown Forum — and maintains a stable of right-wing authors who may not attend literary festivals or mingle at the National Book Awards but command a sizable audience in red state America. Most mainstream publishers try to claim partisan neutrality and publish books across the political spectrum. (Simon & Schuster, for example, published Hillary Clinton’s memoir and campaign book, as well as Mr. Trump’s “Crippled America.”) But occasionally, publishers get dragged into a political scrum. This past weekend, Broadside Books, a conservative imprint at HarperCollins, became embroiled in a controversy involving a CNN investigation that found that one of Broadside’s authors, the conservative radio host and columnist Monica Crowley, had plagiarized numerous passages in her 2012 best seller, “What the (Bleep) Just Happened.” Ms. Crowley was recently selected by Mr. Trump to serve in a senior communications role at the National Security Council. In defending Ms. Crowley, the Trump transition team called the plagiarism charges “a politically motivated attack,” and described HarperCollins as one of “the largest and most respected publishers in the world,” invoking the company’s stature and reputation as way to lend credibility to the author. But on Tuesday, HarperCollins announced it was withdrawing the digital edition of the book until Ms. Crowley revises it with proper attribution, placing the publishing house in the awkward position of being at odds with the incoming administration. Conservative books have been a blockbuster category for publishers for decades, dating to the rise of right-wing radio and cable in the 1980s. The genre exploded during Bill Clinton’s presidency and has thrived in the last eight years, under President Obama, as right-wing writers forged a united front as ideological underdogs. For publishers, the books have been reliable cash cows. Bill O’Reilly’s historical “Killing” series has more than 17 million copies in print. In the weeks leading up to the election, the best-seller lists were dominated by partisan polemics by Dinesh D’Souza, Michael Savage, Edward Klein and Gary J. Byrne, whose anti-Clinton book “Crisis of Character” sold some 247,000 hardcover copies, according to Nielsen. But now, without conservatives filling the role as the voice of opposition, the urgency and potency of right-wing books will almost certainly be diminished. And with the political principles that conservative writers have advocated — the repeal of Obamacare, a crackdown on immigration and the dismantling of environmental regulations — set to become the policy goals of a Republican-led government, the commercial future of conservative publishing looks far more unsettled. Publishers are proceeding cautiously. After the election, many editors quietly scrapped plans to publish books attacking Mrs. Clinton and canceled other sober reflections on the future of the Republican Party in the wake of a Trump defeat. Some are planning to release fewer titles in 2017. Others are returning to safer topics, like Ronald Reagan or the founding fathers. “Conservative publishing is always a better business when the other side is in power,” said Adam Bellow, the editorial director of a new political imprint at St. Martin’s Press. At the same time, the ideological identity of the right is murkier than it was before Mr. Trump became the nominee and then the president-elect, making it harder for conservatives to reach a broad readership. Will books that hold Mr. Trump accountable to his campaign pledges alienate his supporters, and will mainstream Republican politicians and pundits appeal to or repel his base? Will voices from more extreme wings of the Republican Party find a bigger foothold in publishing, further cementing their place in mainstream political discourse? In a way, it’s not surprising that a major publisher wants to appeal to Mr. Yiannopoulos’s base of young conservative followers. Mr. Bellow, who read Mr. Yiannopoulos’s proposal but did not bid on the book, said he was open to publishing other new voices from the so-called alt-right at St. Martin’s. “Donald Trump has brought into politics a lot of people who were previously excluded, and the boundary of political speech has shifted to the right,” Mr. Bellow said. “This is a new force in American politics, and they deserve to be heard.” Simon & Schuster was far from alone in its willingness to embrace Mr. Yiannopoulos, according to his literary agent, Thomas Flannery Jr., who said “virtually every major conservative imprint expressed interest.” Threshold — which has published books by Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, Dick Cheney and, recently, Mr. Trump — was appealing to Mr. Yiannopoulos because “they don’t shy away from publishing controversial figures,” Mr. Flannery said. But the fury Simon & Schuster has encountered underscores the perils publishers face as they tailor their publishing plans to reflect volatile new political realities. Mr. Yiannopoulos, who is gay and describes himself in interviews as more of a cultural figure than a political one, is unlikely to appeal to older or more religious conservatives. His book “Dangerous” — which will address his relationship to the alt-right, his self-proclaimed role as a free-speech crusader and his banishment from Twitter — is more of a memoir than a new conservative manifesto. Marji Ross, the president and publisher of Regnery, a conservative publishing house, said she considered Mr. Yiannopoulos’s book proposal but did not pursue it because she felt it would be too polarizing among mainstream conservatives. “Some of our market would have loved it, and some of our market would have been very uncomfortable with it,” Ms. Ross said. It is a dilemma many conservative writers and editors are now facing. As the political ideology of the right has been injected with populism and nationalism, conservative writers and publishers are wrestling with how to reach a wide audience now that a block of readers that was once reliably in lock step philosophically has splintered. Once dependable formulas for generating best sellers — write a book attacking the Clintons, plug it on Fox News, repeat — may no longer deliver a hit. “The 2016 election turned the political world upside down, and it also turned the publishing world upside down,” said Matt Latimer, a literary agent at Javelin whose clients include conservative writers. “The audience has fractured. A few years ago, a Paul Ryan book was widely embraced by conservative book buyers. Would Trump voters buy a Paul Ryan book today? I don’t know.” Right-wing authors are also losing a reliable driver of book sales — the Clintons. Last year, Regnery alone had three best-selling books that took aim at Mrs. Clinton, including its first graphic novel, “Clinton Cash,” adapted from the book by Peter Schweizer, and “Hillary’s America,” Mr. D’Souza’s book, which sold more than 200,000 copies. “We had certainly planned to take advantage of those opportunities if Hillary Clinton had won the election, and we looked at several books that we had signed up or considered the day after the election and thought, well, those aren’t going to work,” Ms. Ross said. “Oftentimes, we have said here that what’s bad for America is good for Regnery book sales.” Regnery has instead pivoted to courting Trump voters with forthcoming books like “How Trump Won,” by the Breitbart editor-at-large Joel Pollak and Larry Schweikart, and a series of “Deplorables Guides” to issues like immigration, gun control and climate change, using a moniker Trump’s supporters adopted for themselves. “The mood of our market is far, far different with Trump as president than it would have been with Hillary Clinton as president,” Ms. Ross said. “It’s hopeful, but cautious.” Advertisement"
571463656,2017-01-24 09:23:54,Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Oscar Nomination Puts Him One Step Closer to EGOT,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/67WsuhtYKmY/,en,False,,4419,Time,http://time.com,"Look how far he’s come! Hamilton writer-actor-composer Lin-Manuel Miranda is now only one step away from claiming the coveted EGOT title thanks to his Academy Award nomination for Moana‘s “How Far I’ll Go.” The elite club of performers features people who have won all four major entertainment awards — an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony. The award-winning performer is also on the cusp of history as he would be the youngest person to earn the title if he wins. At just 37-years-old, Miranda is two years younger than the current record held by Robert Lopez, who was 39 when he won the Oscar for his work on Frozen in 2014 and completed his EGOT. But Miranda wouldn’t just claim the record for youngest person to win all four awards — he would also be the fastest person to do so. His EGOT clock started ticking in June 2008 when he won his first Tony for the musical In the Heights. That means that an Oscar win would come less than nine years later — one year earlier than Lopez’s even decade. Lopez also started his decade-long journey by winning a Tony in 2004 for Avenue Q. Only 12 people have joined the EGOT club since it took Richard Rodgers 17 years to claim the title. Since then, Helen Hayes, Rita Moreno, John Gielgud, Audrey Hepburn, Marvin Hamlisch, Jonathan Tunick, Mel Brooks, Mike Nichols, Whoopi Goldberg, Scott Rudin and Robert Lopez. Miranda has one Emmy, two Grammys and three Tonys. His Emmy win came in 2014 in the Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics category for his work on the 2013 Tony Awards. Miranda co-wrote the incredible opening number performed by host Neil Patrick Harris. Miranda has won the Best Musical Theater Album category at the Grammys twice — the first time in 2009 for In the Heights and the second in 2016 for his smash hit Hamilton. His three individual Tony Awards also come from those two musicals in 2008 and 2016, though he also technically notched two more awards as both works won Best Musical in their respective years. When accepting his second Tony win for Best Original Score in 2016, Miranda gave an especially passionate speech about love and acceptance just hours after the deadliest mass shooting on American soil at Pulse Nightclub in Orlando. Forty-nine people were killed by a gunman targeting the gay club, prompting Miranda to read a sonnet he wrote where he affirmed through tears that “love is love is love is love, cannot be killed or swept aside.” Miranda is currently on location in London filming the Mary Poppins sequel with Emily Blunt. The 89th annual Oscars, hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, will air Feb. 26 on ABC at 8:30 p.m. ET. This article originally appeared on People.com Contact us at letters@time.com."

Raffi Freedman-Gurspan was tapped by President Barack Obama to become the White House’s LGBT liaison in March 2016, making her the first-ever openly transgender person to fill the position. It was actually the 29-year-old public policy expert’s second, history-making appointment ― in August 2015, she was hired by Obama to serve as Outreach and Recruitment Director in the Presidential Personnel Office, making her the first openly trans White House staffer ever. (Watch a news report on her initial appointment above.) Freedman-Gurspan turned out to be a pivotal figure early in her tenure, following the June 12, 2016 massacre at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub. In the days following the mass shooting, Freedman-Gurspan connected with victims’ families as well as Florida-based advocacy groups on the ground. Now, though, she told BuzzFeed, she’s concerned her role will essentially be eliminated once Trump is sworn into office Jan. 20, given that she’s had no contact with the president-elect’s transition team. If that happens, the White House stands to “lose touch, ultimately, with what is going on out there. We lose that ability to inform our president about our community and our needs,” she told BuzzFeed’s Dominic Holden. “There is no one inside the hallways to advocate for the community, so we lose an internal advocate.” Given that Trump’s victory cast a shadow on the future of queer rights, the LGBT liaison role could, in theory, be a critical one. If the position is scrapped, Freedman-Gurspan fears that the incoming president’s approach to LGBTQ issues would mirror that of the Reagan administration, whose lack of response to the HIV/AIDS crisis in the mid-1980s has since been deemed catastrophic. “It actually gives me a little bit of chills thinking about not having a potential person here, if, God forbid, we have another outbreak of, say HIV or AIDS or something like that,” she said. “If we don’t have a particular individual here in this building who has an immense amount of influence and power and impact [within the LGBTQ community] — that’s a loss.” Read the full BuzzFeed interview with Freedman-Gurspan here.

The Anadolu Agency said 60 Islamic State suspects, the vast majority of them foreigners, were taken into custody early Sunday in the capital, Ankara. A total of 445 people were detained in simultaneous pre-dawn police operations that spanned several cities, including Istanbul and Gaziantep, near the border with Syria, the news agency said. The largest operation was in the southeast province of Sanliurfa, where police took into custody more than 100 suspects from multiple addresses and found materials relating to the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS. Security forces also apprehended nine suspects who were allegedly preparing an attack in the northwestern city of Izmir. Anadolu did not give the nationalities of all those detained, but 10 minors were among the foreigners detained in Istanbul and the northwestern province of Kocaeli. Turkey, which last year endured a failed coup attempt and dozens of bloody attacks linked to the Islamic State or Kurdish militants, has been stepping up its anti-terrorism efforts. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for a New Year Eve mass shooting at an Istanbul nightclub that killed 39 people. The militant group claims to have multiple cells in Turkey. Turkey is a member of the NATO alliance and the U.S-led coalition against the Islamic State. It shares borders with Syria and Iraq, two war-torn nations at the heart of the fight against the Islamic State. Turkish forces have been deployed in Syria since August with the aim of clearing a border patch of Islamic State militants and Syrian Kurdish fighters that Ankara considers related to its own Kurdish insurgency. Some of those taken into custody Sunday reportedly were active in conflict zones and engaged in recruitment efforts for the Islamic State, relaying its propaganda over social media."

When the singer was only 6 years old, he claimed his father, Calvin Cooksey, directed a homophobic slur at a transgender waitress while the two dined together at a local restaurant. Seven months later, Cooksey has now filed a defamation lawsuit against his son, according to TMZ, seeking $14.5 million in damages. “I was six years old when I heard my dad call our transgender waitress a ‘faggot’ as he dragged me out a neighborhood diner saying we wouldn’t be served because she was dirty,” Ocean wrote. “That was the last afternoon I saw my father and the first time I heard that word, I think, although it wouldn’t shock me if it wasn’t.” Cooksey reportedly claims that Ocean fabricated the incident and that the note cost him business opportunities in film and music. This isn’t the first multi-million lawsuit Cooksey has pursued. In 2014, he filed a $142 million lawsuit against hip-hop entrepreneur Russell Simmons for characterizing him as a “deadbeat dad” on the website Global Grind. Ocean has used his Tumblr account to communicate with his fans for years. Ahead of the release of his breakthrough album, “Channel Orange,” in 2012, he shared a note written in a similar stream-of-consciousness style, revealing that a romantic relationship with another man served as inspiration for the album. The Huffington Post has reached out to Ocean’s representatives and will update the post accordingly. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"

          / CNET When the FBI revealed it was able to hack into an iPhone used by one of the terrorists involved in the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, people wanted to know just how the agency did it. In fact, three news organizations sued the FBI in September for just this information. And because of that lawsuit, the agency released 100 pages of documents Friday. The problem is they’re heavily censored, according to the Associated Press. The documents don’t reveal who the FBI hired to hack into the phone or how much it paid that vendor. The FBI labeled those files “secret” before they were released. The iPhone was at the center of a legal back-and-forth between the government and Apple last year after the December 2015 attack that left 14 people dead. The government wanted Apple to write new software that would unlock the phone and make its data readable. Apple refused, saying that weakening the encryption would potentially leave other iPhone users at risk. In a surprise revelation in March, the Department of Justice said an unnamed outside party helped agents break into an iPhone 5C that was used by shooter Syed Farook. However, the agency wouldn’t disclose how the hacker got into the phone. The lawsuit against the FBI was filed by the Associated Press, Vice and Gannett, the parent of national newspaper USA Today. The three news organizations sought details about the hacker the FBI used and associated costs. The FBI reportedly refused to provide that information to the organizations under the Freedom of Information Act. In the lawsuit complaint, the news organizations argued the public has a right to know how the government spent taxpayer funds to obtain the hacking technique. They also argued the existence of a secret flaw in the iPhone could leave the public in danger. While the most critical information remains unknown, the FBI’s released documents do reveal that the agency received three submissions from companies to hack into the phone and that it signed a nondisclosure agreement with the vendor it chose, according to the Associated Press. An FBI spokeswoman said the agency is not commenting beyond what was released to the three news organizations. This article originally appeared on CNET.com.

Noor Zahi Salman, 30, faces another hearing Wednesday, when a federal judge in Oakland could determine if she will be freed pending trial in Florida. She is accused of providing ""material support or resources"" to a terrorist organization and of misleading police and FBI special agents after the carnage. Salman could face life in prison if convicted of the charges. Mateen called a local TV station and 911 to ""pledge allegiance"" to the Islamic State during the siege at Pulse nightclub on June 12. He died in a confrontation with police. USA TODAY FBI arrests wife of Orlando nightclub shooter Omar Mateen Salman was arrested Monday at her Northern California home on charges of obstruction of justice and aiding and abetting. Her lawyer, Linda Moreno, issued a statement saying Salman had no prior knowledge of the attack. The indictment, filed in Florida, states that beginning on an unknown date, but at least as early as April 2016, Salman helped Mateen's efforts on behalf of the Islamic State. The specific charge is aiding and abetting the attempted provision and provision of material support to a foreign terrorist organization. She is also charged with obstruction of justice for her dealings with authorities after the attack. The indictment specifies that if convicted of the aiding and abetting charge, Salman must forfeit assets related to ""supporting, planning, conducting, and concealing the offense."" The indictment specifically identifies $30,500 in cash. Salman, in interviews with federal investigators after the shooting, allegedly acknowledged driving Mateen to the Pulse nightclub at least once before her husband launched the assault. But she told The New York Times in November that she was unaware of his intentions until he sent her a 4 a.m. text message the night of the shooting, asking whether she had seen what happened on the news. The last message from her husband was a text saying, “I love you babe.” USA TODAY Orlando nightclub shooting: Who is Noor Salman? Salman grew up about 25 miles northeast of San Francisco. She married Mateen in 2011.

""We see once again Florida is ranked 50th in the nation for mental health care funding — 50th,"" he said. Does Florida rank that low? See PolitiFact Florida's rating.  • Senate Republicans will move this week to speed the confirmation of President Donald Trump's Cabinet. Today, the Senate will vote on the confirmation of Rep. Mike Pompeo of Kansas to lead the CIA, and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will vote on Trump's pick for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, whose road to confirmation has been bumpy.  • Samsung Electronics says flaws in the design and production of batteries used in its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone, not its hardware or software, made it prone to catch fire. Samsung said Monday that it was responsible for not ensuring the design specifications given to its suppliers were failsafe but believed its investigation into the problem would help the entire industry counter overheating risks with lithium batteries. Analysts questioned if the world's largest smartphone maker had really gotten to the bottom of the problem.  • President Donald Trump is set to meet with congressional leaders from both parties to discuss his agenda, as he enters his first official week in the White House and works to begin delivering on his ambitious campaign promises. Trump has said that he considers Monday to be his first real day in office. And he's packing it with meetings that suggest he's keeping an open ear.  • Kellyanne Conway, a senior aide to President Donald Trump, said Sunday that he has no plans to release his tax returns, a marked shift from Trump's pledge during the campaign to make them public once an audit was completed.  • Bus ridership saw a sudden drop in Hillsborough and Pinellas counties last year, mirroring a nationwide trend. The Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority saw the steepest decline, dropping 10 percent. The agency provided about 1.5 million fewer passenger trips, falling to 13.4 million trips from fiscal year 2015 to 2016.  • There's a lot coming up this week so we have rounded up the top things to do this week in Tampa Bay, including the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in the area for the last time in its history and Tampa's Gasparilla invasion and Parade of Pirates.  • Broken promises, accusations of cheating and a search for missing money. Times business reporter William R. Levesque shares a tale about romance novelists that turned into a horror story.  • The Florida State Fair begins its third annual  People's Choice Fare Favorite Awards  today. Expanding beyond the burger creations from the first two competitions, this year's contest will involve a variety of new and unusual fair concoctions, including the ""Chili Bacon Mac Grilled Cheese,"" the ""Cheesy Fried Enchilada Funnel Cake"" and a ""White Cheddar and Bacon Pretzel Dog."" The online voting runs through Jan. 30.  • In a quest to cook an authentic pirate meal, the first step would be locating the turtle meat. Sea turtle is well documented as a favorite of pirates who sailed the Caribbean during the so-called ""golden age"" of piracy — the era Tampa conjures during this weekend's annual Gasparilla festival. Christopher Spata tried his hand with a unique recipe; see how it turned out. "

Trump's order on Friday drew thousands of protesters to airports, city halls and town squares across the nation. (Obama chimed in to say he likes that.) Advocacy groups are fighting the travel ban and raising money in record numbers. Starbucks pledged to hire 10,000 refugees in the 75 countries where it operates, and Google created a $4 million crisis fund to fight Trump's immigration order. Meanwhile, the White House said it ain't no thing that Trump gave his chief strategist Steve Bannon a seat on the National Security Council. Spokesman Sean Spicer said the administration is just being super transparent. Critics have called for Bannon's removal. Tuesday promises to be just as eventful when Trump announces his nomination for the Supreme Court. Our earliest known human ancestor lacked something pretty essential A freaky-looking creature that lived about 450 million years ago and now takes the prize as humanity's earliest ancestor had a massive mouth and no detectable anus, according to a study released Monday. Yup, that means it may have eaten and excreted through its mouth. Scientists believe ""Saccorhytus"" was a common ancestor of many species and the earliest step yet found on the evolutionary path that eventually led to humans hundreds of millions of years later. The creature was probably no more than a millimeter in size, and likely lived between grains of sand on the seabed. When it comes to the Pats, haters really hatin’ Any team that wins as much as the New England Patriots is going to draw its share of haters, but controversy and scandal have swelled the ranks of the Pats' detractors. “Deflategate"" and ""Spygate” added to the perception of head coach Bill Belichick as an evil genius and helped make the team second-to-last in USA TODAY's likability ranking. Quarterback Tom Brady's public friendship with President Trump hasn't helped matters. Brady may not see why it's ""such a big deal,"" but USA TODAY's Nancy Armour says that after this weekend, when ""the country boiled over in rage and indignation at Trump’s decision to turn America’s back on refugees"" Brady no longer gets a free pass on the issue. ""Brady inserted himself into the national firestorm,"" she writes, and he should expect plenty of Trump-related questions as the Patriots head into their seventh Super Bowl in 16 seasons. The Internet is feeling things about Ivanka's $5,000 dress Timing is everything. As chaos swirled over President Trump's immigration order, his daughter Ivanka posted pictures of herself and husband Jared Kushner dressed to the nines — she in a $5,000 silvery gown by Carolina Herrera. The photo's timing lit a fuse. Twitter called her tone-deaf. Users compared her gown to trauma blankets worn by refugees. There were also some not-so-subtle references to French Queen Marie Antoinette who supposedly said, ""Let them eat cake."" The latest on the deadly Quebec mosque shooting Authorities have charged Alexandre Bissonnette with six counts of first- degree murder in the attack Sunday at a Quebec City mosque — a rare mass shooting in Canada and the country's first lethal attack on a mosque. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called it an act of terror. Want the Short List delivered straight to your inbox? Sign up!

805672045,2017-01-12 17:40:41,The Best And Worst Sex Stories From The Last Year,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/best-worst-sex-list-for-2_b_14138020.html,en,False,,623375,Huffington Post - United States,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/?country=US,"Contributor Alexandra Katehakis and Center for Healthy Sex (CHS) have released their Annual Best/Worst Sex List for 2016. It was a difficult and challenging year, especially seen through the lens of sexual health. It was a year in which politics came close to displacing sexual politics as the most-talked about topic on therapist couches. Even the positive advances in the field of sexuality seem to have emerged surrounded by an undertow of oppressive conflict threatening to pull them back under in the future. As always, our intention is to bear witness, to be better informed, and to develop our compassion. With this in mind, here is our annual list of the 10 Best & 10 Worst Sex Stories that made headlines this year, as well as 3 additional newsworthy stories that defy category. Best Sex #1: Supreme Court Protects Access to Abortion The Story: On June 27, the Supreme Court ruled 5-3 that Texas cannot place restrictions on the delivery of abortion services that create an undue burden for women seeking an abortion. On June 28, the Court refused similar challenges from Wisconsin and Mississippi. Why this matters: Anti-abortion activists in state government have been enacting harmful regulations for years designed to impede a woman's right to an abortion. Abortion is legal and access is crucial for the sexual health of women and families. Best Sex #2: ICC Makes First Conviction for Sexual Violence The Story: The International Criminal Court (ICC) has jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for the international crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. This year a Congolese politician became the first person to be convicted of crimes of sexual violence in war, as well as the first to be held directly responsible for subordinates' use of rape as a weapon of war. Why this matters: Throughout history, rape has often been considered an inevitable consequence of war. Since 2002, the ICC has made many convictions but never for sexual violence until now. It's high time the historic practice of military rape as a tool of war had its day in global court. Best Sex #3: Oregon Court Rules ""Non-Binary"" a Legal Gender The Story: In April, Jamie Shupe filed a sex change petition with the Multnomah County Court in Oregon to have their sex legally declared as non-binary. In June, a judge granted the petition, making Jamie Shupe the first person to be legally declared as non-binary in the United States. Why this matters: The perception of gender as solely binary might be rooted in tradition, religious dogma, power, or other forms of bias but it is not a perception integrating the reality of chromosomal, physiological and psychological variations. Best Sex #4: Pentagon Ends Transgender Military Ban The Story: Department of Defense regulations that ban transgender persons from US military service were repealed on June 30, 2016. Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced that medical coverage for transgender service members will include doctor-approved hormone therapy and gender reassignment surgery. Why this matters: It's estimated that more than 15,000 transgender people are already serving. It's vital for the policies and laws of America to support and protect transgender individuals in the military for their safety and respect. Best Sex #5: California Revokes Rape Statute of Limitations The Story: Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill revoking California's 10-year statute of limitations on rape cases. However, the new law will only apply to crimes committed after January 1, 2017. Why this matters: It takes years, often decades, to process the immediate trauma of sexual assault. This is especially true for a child. There is no set timeline in psychology for when a rape survivor will become capable of publicly revealing a rape, and there shouldn't be a timeline in the law. Best Sex #6: Africa Combats Female Genital Mutilation The Story: Unicef released 2016 statistics on Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) revealing there are 100 million girls and women alive having undergone the ritual cutting, 70 million more than previous estimates, with females in Egypt, Indonesia and Ethiopia accounting for half of FGM victims worldwide. As a result, Indonesia launched a national campaign this year to end the practice, while Egypt's parliament voted in August to increase penalties for those who perpetrate FGM. Why this matters: At its core, this ritual is based in gender inequality, in age-old attempts to control women's sexuality. FGM is traumatic and can result in lifelong health consequences, with no reported health benefits. Best Sex #7: Celebrity Voyeur Lawsuits Bring Major Damages The Story: Juries awarded $55 million to Erin Andrews and $115 million to Hulk Hogan in separate trials -- both had been filmed in the nude and the recordings were publicly uploaded to the Internet without their consent where they went viral. Why this matters: Voyeurism is not a victimless crime. It is a sexual violation without consent and today's technology makes it more possible than ever. The court has sent a clear message this year -- consequences for voyeurism can be costly. Best Sex #8: Scientists Invent 8-Inch Bionic Penis Implant The Story: Wisconsin scientists have invented a heat-activated metal penis implant made from nitinol, a metal alloy of nickel and titanium, that grows to 8 inches with the help of a remote control. Why this matters: This new device is designed to help men with erectile dysfunction who don't respond to other treatments. Satisfaction rates with currently available pump devices are very high with 80%-90% of men reporting they would choose the surgery again. Best Sex #9: Birth Control Apps Arrange Home Delivery The Story: At least six digital apps, including Planned Parenthood, now provide prescriptions written by clinicians after women answer questions about their health online or by video. Some apps even provide home delivery, no doctor or pharmacy visit needed. Why this matters: There are too many restrictions to birth control, which should be available over the counter. These apps are easily available, easy to use, and they make it easier for women to manage their sexual health, which is a saving grace in these times. Best Sex #10: Obama Defunds 'Abstinence Only' Sex Ed The Story: President Obama removed all funding for abstinence-only education in his proposed federal budget for 2017, cutting a $10 million per year grant from the Department of Health and Human Services that supports such programs, which have never been proven effective. Why this matters: Despite the lack of scientific evidence, over the last 25 years Congress has spent nearly $2 billion on such ""abstinence-until-marriage"" programs. Research has proven that abstinence-only campaigns have been unsuccessful at preventing teen pregnancy or sexual activity. The programs are usually religiously driven and don't feature any actual educational components. Worst Sex #1: Trump Elected Despite Sexism, Sexual Assaults The Story: During the 2016 campaign he took misogyny and casual sexism to unprecedented lows. Video tape showed Donald Trump bragging about forcing himself on women by outright grabbing their vaginas, which is sexual assault. Other women came forward credibly accusing Donald Trump of the very sexual assaults he bragged about. This man was elected President. Why this matters: Forget about eradicating rape culture on college campuses and comprehensive sex education, the President-elect and his policies are a threat to sexual rights we've taken for granted. Worst Sex #2: Closeted Male Attacks LGBT Club in Orlando The Story: Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old security guard, killed 49 people and wounded 53 others inside Pulse, a gay Latino nightclub in Orlando, Florida on June 12, 2016. It was both the deadliest mass shooting by a single shooter and the deadliest incident of violence against LGBT people in United States history. Why this matters: Sexual repression is a form of self-violence that, when projected outward, can be destructive and even deadly. Mateen's ex-wife claimed that his own father called him gay and her current fiancé revealed their family believed he was gay. Officially, the shooting has been classified as an act of terrorism and a hate crime. Worst Sex #3: Roger Ailes Accused of Sexual Harassment The Story: Roger Ailes, founder and former Chairman and CEO of Fox News, was forced to resign this year amidst allegations of sexual harassment. Fox privately reached financial settlements for a number of the cases, and Ailes went on to work as a political consultant for the Trump campaign. Why this matters: The public relies on major media outlets for true and ethical reporting of world events. When a sexual predator presides over such a toxic environment, the quality of the news is suspect. Suppression of sexual misconduct continues to be a major stain on human society worldwide. Worst Sex #4: States Plan Anti-Gay 'Religious Freedom' Laws The Story: A year ago, Indiana enacted the ""Religious Freedom Restoration Act"" into law to protect Christian businesses that did not want to provide services to gays and lesbians, but after massive boycott threats and businesses' concerns the state was later forced to recapitulate, amending the law to ensure civil rights protections. This year similar laws were attempted in Mississippi and Georgia. Why this matters: Within his first 100 days in office, the President-elect has pledged to join Congress and the Senate to pass the ""First Amendment Defense Act,"" an anti-LGBT bill allowing businesses to refuse service to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons based on religious beliefs. Homophobia goes to Washington. Worst Sex #5: Transphobic Bathroom Laws Cause Harm The Story: On May 13, the federal government told public schools they must allow transgender students to use bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity or risk losing federal funding. In August a federal judge in Texas ordered a nationwide injunction blocking the policy. In retaliation, several states attempted to implement so-called ""bathroom bills"" to require transgender persons to use the restroom corresponding to their assigned gender at birth. Only North Carolina signed such a bill, HB2, into law resulting in nationwide outrage, boycotts, and lawsuits. Why this matters: These terrible transphobic bathroom laws have resulted in cases of mistaken identities as cisgender women are mistaken for transgender and humiliated by patrons and police. Transgender individuals have experienced heightened harassment, fear, and trauma around this issue which speaks directly to the right to self-identify. Worst Sex #6: Zika Virus Found to Spread Via Sexual Contact The Story: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced in July that the mosquito-borne Zika virus can be sexually transmitted. Public health experts confirmed that Zika can be passed from a person who has Zika to his or her sex partners through sex that includes vaginal, anal, oral sex, and the sharing of sex toys even if the person does not have symptoms at the time. Why this matters: Zika can be passed from a pregnant woman to her fetus and infection during pregnancy can cause certain birth defects. Eighty percent of people who become infected never have symptoms. Condoms can reduce the chances of infection. Worst Sex #7: Brock Turner Serves 3 Months of Rape Sentence The Story: Brock Turner stood trial in March for sexually penetrating a 22-year-old unconscious woman behind a campus dumpster, in a case known as the ""Stanford Rape."" In June, Turner was convicted on three charges of felony sexual assault, carrying a potential sentence of 14 years in prison. But the judge only sentenced him to six months in prison, and after serving three months, Turner was released -- and the public was outraged. Why this matters: The rape victim submitted to the court a powerful and profound 7,138-word victim impact statement describing in vivid detail her physical, emotional, and spiritual experience. Public outrage railed against the judge and a system of judicial bias in favor of male and class privilege. Worst Sex #8: Pakistani Council Approves Domestic Violence The Story: Pakistan's Islamic Council on Ideology (CII) passed non-binding legislation this year recommending husbands should be allowed to ""lightly beat"" their wives. The CII was created so that democratically-elected legislators can seek clerical advice before implementing legislation that may conflict with Islamic law. Why this matters: Possible infractions include if a woman defies her husband's demands, turns down sexual intercourse, refuses to dress up per his desires, interacts with strangers, or speaks too loudly. Pakistan's Human Rights Commission estimates 70 percent of Pakistani women have suffered domestic violence. Worst Sex #9: Anthony Weiner Caught Sexting Underage Girl The Story: It was the final straw -- a photo of former Congressman Anthony Weiner in his underwear, his toddler child lying next to him on the bed while he sexts with yet another online woman. Huma Abedin, the wife who stood by his side through similar scandals, announced their separation in August. One month later it was reported Weiner knowingly engaged in sexting with a 15-year-old girl, provoking an FBI investigation. Why this matters: What kind of person would endanger the psychological health of his own child with that kind of neglect? Who would repeat the same sexual activity that has led to his public disgrace not once, not twice, but multiple times? This is obviously an unwell individual utterly driven to destruction by compulsive sexual behavior. Worst Sex #10: Rehab Mogul Charged with Sexual Assaults The Story: Christopher Bathum, a self-described ""rehab mogul,"" founded 19 sober-living facilities in Southern California and Colorado where prosecutors allege he sexually assaulted female clients and provided some with drugs. He's been charged with 12 counts of furnishing drugs and 34 counts of sexual assault-related offenses, including rape, as well as money laundering, insurance fraud, grand theft and identify theft. Why this matters: When operated ethically, sober-living homes are a great resource to the recovery community. The blatant abuse of power by criminals like Christopher Bathum defies the very concepts of safety and recovery. The Rest #1: Holland Grants Euthanasia to Sex Abuse Victim The Story: A Dutch woman in her 20s was the victim of child sex abuse from the age of 5 to 15. Her post-traumatic stress disorder included severe anorexia, chronic depression, tendencies to self-harm, hallucinations, obsessions and compulsions. She was almost entirely bedridden. This year it was revealed that doctors in Holland granted her request for euthanasia, the first known case of legally assisted suicide to end trauma resulting from sexual abuse. Why this matters: Euthanasia provides dignity for those who face unimaginable torment due to severe physical or mental dysfunction. The word comes from the Greek language meaning ""good death."" The Rest #2: Rolling Stone Loses U-Va. Rape Defamation Case The Story: In 2014, Rolling Stone published an article by Sarbina Erderly titled ""A Rape on Campus,"" depicting a gang rape at a fraternity at the University of Virginia. Rolling Stone retracted the story after it was revealed to be based on false information. The school's chief administrator for handling sexual assault issues filed a defamation lawsuit and in November 2016, a jury found Rolling Stone and Erderly liable for $3 million in damages. Why this matters: This false story caused a lot of collateral damage. It's not inconceivable that a rape victim might behave erratically, mis-identify people or mis-remember events -- all symptoms of trauma. But it takes unbiased, investigative interviews of all parties involved to uncover the truth. The Rest #3: Urinal Technology Cleans Penis After Urination The Story: There's a new toilet in town -- a team of Spanish inventors debuted a prototype for ""Urinal 2.0,"" which is basically a urinal bidet. After urination, programmed sensors inside the urinal activate an automated cleaning service using a soap-and-water mix to wash the penis and then blow dry it in just three seconds. Why this matters: Will men be seeing urinal bidets in rest stops and mall restrooms? It's confusing enough just to know how to operate the many variations of automated bathroom faucets and paper towel dispensers. At a time when waterless urinals sensibly are becoming the new standard, the Urinal 2.0 seems to require too many resources to operate. This invention fills a need no one seems to be voicing.

808806533,2017-01-11 21:28:52,A look back at the 2016 Public Relations Winners and Losers,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/as-the-dust-settles-on-20_b_13984952.html,en,False,,623375,Huffington Post - United States,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/?country=US,"Bestselling author Colin Kaepernick: The political and social climate and rhetoric in the US has been more divisive this past year than any other in recent memory. Utilizing social media and organizing nation-wide protests, more Americans - particularly minorities and the underserved - are waking up to, exposing, rejecting, and fighting against the structural inequalities and widespread injustices that still plague our country. From actors to athletes, celebrities across the spectrum have leveraged their platform to speak out against these injustices, but perhaps no other has raised more discussion this past year than Colin Kaepernick.  Once the 49ers star quarterback, Colin has become more known for his political activism than his prowess on the field. His national anthem protest, in which he kneels during the national anthem at the start of games to protest police brutality against black Americans and other people of color, has garnered both support and harsh criticism. Other NFL players and professional athletes have joined in Kaepernick's protest, including the Seattle Seahawks and US women's soccer team player Megan Rapinoe.  Verdict: Winner. His public and unbowed commitment to the cause has expanded beyond the protest. Soon after the beginning of his protest, his jerseys became the top sellers in the NFL. He has since promised (and begun) to donate $100K per month for the next ten months to community organizations focused on ending racial inequality and oppression, working towards police reform, and aiding with community engagement and growth. All donated funds can be tracked on Kaepernick's website. He organized and hosted a ""Know Your Rights"" camp to educate underprivileged Bay Area children about their rights as citizens, financial literacy, health and wellness, and higher education.   Samsung: After reclaiming the number one spot as top smartphone maker in 2015, Samsung seemed poised to continue its dominance into 2016 with the new Galaxy Note 7. Water resistant, armed with an iris scanner, and bolstered by successful viral marketing campaigns featuring Oscar winner Christoph Waltz and rapper Lil Wayne, the Galaxy Note 7 looked like the It phone for 2016. Then they started exploding.  Between the unveiling of the phone in August to the suspension of production and subsequent recall in October, Samsung fielded over 90 incidents of catastrophic phone failure as a result of defective batteries overheating, exploding, and causing fires in homes, cars, hotel rooms, and even planes. While the tech giant attempted to rectify the situation through a series of recalls and exchange programs (even offering full refunds and incentives for returns on the $850 device), bans placed on the phones by government regulators and consumer protection groups forced them to recall all 2.5 million phones worldwide to the tune of a loss of $2B USD.  Verdict: Loser. Samsung's inability to effectively fix the problem as soon as it surfaced, including issuing new phones that displayed the same faulty (and explosive) battery issues as those replaced, coupled with unfortunate timing (with the first reports of explosions appearing just days before the unveiling of Apple's competing iPhone 7), ultimately resulted in one of the biggest financial and reputational blows to a tech company in recent memory. Leslie Jones: Being subjected to online hate is an unfortunate side-effect of reaching any kind of celebrity status - especially if you happen to be a woman. The SNL comedian learned just how dark the online world can be when she was subjected to abhorrent abuse and a series of cyber attacks following her turn as Patty Tolan in the 2016 reboot of the Ghostbusters franchise. Unfortunately, it's not surprising that many will stop at nothing to punish someone for having the gaul to be a successful black woman. Lack of shock aside, the level of vitriol faced by Jones reached new heights. The announcement of an all-female reboot of the franchise - starring some of the biggest names in comedy - was quickly met with virulent misogyny and racism masquerading as the mere pushback of concerned ""fans."" Hoards of angry, primarily young white men lashed out against the offense of having women star in a popular franchise reboot (the entitlement was palpable), with the trailer becoming one of the most disliked videos on Youtube (ever). Leslie, as the only black woman in the cast, bore even greater amounts of vitriol, bombarded with taunts, physical threats of violence, and abuse based on both her race and gender. Following this, Jones (understandably needing a reprieve from the abuse) briefly quit Twitter before making an applauded comeback (receiving an outpouring of love and support from celebrity friends and the general public alike) after meeting with Twitter founder Jack Dorsey. Following their meeting, Dorsey took some of Twitter's first ever serious action against the abuse that runs rampant on its platform by banning some of the microblogging site's most notorious and vile trolls. Verdict: Winner. Despite enduring maddening and disgusting levels of abuse and invasion, Leslie Jones managed to not only rise above, but to also utilize her platform to push forward some much-needed change. Moreover, after returning to Twitter, her comedic tweets on the 2016 Olympics were so popular that she was invited to be an NBC special commentator covering swimming, gymnastics, and beach volleyball. Since the hack, she's been featured on each episode of Saturday Night Live, while also landing an advertising campaign with Allstate. Following the hack of her website, she stuck to her guns and addressed the trolls in a hilarious and empowering SNL Weekend Update segment. She stood up for herself, controlled the narrative, and served as an inspiration for countless others while staying funny as hell doing it (and to no surprise, she continues to be a highly successful, absolutely hilarious, and ever popular comedian and actor). Pokemon/Nintendo: Nintendo massively cashed in on the nostalgia trend in the entertainment industry this year with the release of its mobile app, Pokemon Go, in which it brought one of its most popular franchises to phones worldwide.  The augmented reality game uses smartphone's GPS technology to allow players to seek out, collect, and train Pokemon at locations in the real world (with the pocket monsters appearing on their screens). One of the most downloaded (over 500 million worldwide) and most profitable ($600M in revenue as of late 2016) mobile applications ever, Pokemon Go brought the franchise back to heights of ubiquity last seen in the early aughts.  An absolute cultural phenomenon since its release in July 2016, Pokemon Go managed to: catch criminals, support local businesses, bring players closer to God (whoever you praise) and one another, kickstart weight-loss goals, be featured in an MMA bout, and appear on the campaign trail. Of course, as with any craze there were a few negative stories, but certainly not enough to dissuade Nintendo from transforming another one of its legendary titles into a mobile application with the release of its latest record-breaking app.  Verdict: Winner. By capitalizing on our love of nostalgia (the trend of reboots, rehashes and revisits doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon), Pokemon Go was a perfect addition to the Pokemon franchise (and one that has certainly found itself a home in pop-culture history). Seamlessly blending new technology with a beloved franchise, Pokemon Go revitalized the Nintendo brand, bringing in a newer and younger audience while also engaging with longtime fans who had been with the series since its inception. President Obama: With his approval rating at a four-year high, it's fair to say that President Obama will go down as a not just a good, but a truly great president. At the end of his historic presidential run, President Obama has reached his highest approval rating since 2012, with more Americans feeling confident about his job performance as President as well as how his legacy will be remembered by history and perceived by future generations.  He dealt with a tough and tumultuous (but often promising) second term that saw the deadliest mass shooting in US history, the proliferation and spread of the Islamic State, a government shutdown, the passing of the Universal Healthcare Act, and increased diversity in the federal government. Through the highs and lows, Obama has still managed (and deservedly so) to maintain and inspire confidence in the American people as well as the world abroad. With a 57% approval rating at the end of his second term, he's seen a massive upswing from December 2012, when his rating languished at 40% in some national polls. Perhaps it's due to this very emotionally and mentally draining election cycle or the knowledge that the incoming President lost the popular vote by almost 3 million votes, but the American people are really appreciating these last few months of the Obama presidency (and mourning their passing).  Verdict: Winner. Regardless of personal political beliefs, Obama has been a truly great President, and there is no doubt that history will remember him as such. When he took office eight years ago, our nation was in the midst of the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression - there were no jobs, banks were failing after running roughshod over the general population, the auto industry was failing, and the country was in disarray. We needed hope, and Obama brought that and so much more throughout his presidency. Our economy is flourishing, consumer confidence is at it's highest level since 2001, we're no longer at war, and despite all of the negativity and turmoil, we are still optimistic about the future. Donald Trump: Despite winning the electoral vote, President-elect Trump lost the popular vote. The official numbers are in and nearly 3M more Americans voted for Hillary Clinton for President (giving her 48.2% of the popular vote to his 46.1%). Now he has to do one of the most strenuous jobs on Earth, with no experience that the majority didn't actually vote for. Good luck with that. And I do mean, good luck. Politics aside, all of us who didn't vote for Trump have to hope for the well being of the country. I'd love to be wrong. That said, Donald Trump is entering office with a favorability rating of 44% before his first official presidential tweet. Where's that favorability rating going to go next? And I do want to be wrong here. Badly. Since winning the election on November 8th, the President-Elect hasn't slowed down his assault, and it's seems difficult to fathom that it won't fall short of expectations placed upon the Presidency. He shirks intelligence briefings and uses his Twitter as a personal diary/bulletin board to air out his middle of the night grievances, go on wild tirades, and defend his often sensitive ego. And while no one knows exactly what his policy stances are (as they seem to change with the weather), it's probably a good bet that they'll do little to help the poor and middle-class (which unfortunately include many of those who most-vehemently supported him). Verdict: I'm pleading the fifth. I never thought Trump actually wanted this job. Despite winning the election, Trump did in fact lose the actual popular vote. Regardless of how much he tries to deny that, he now has to take on one of the most difficult, strenuous, and thankless jobs there is, all while knowing that the popular vote and majority of Americans didn't actually support him. I'd bet he would have preferred to have won that popular vote but lose the election (à la Hillary) so he could continue to point out how ""rigged' the system is. Instead, he's now facing the reality of being held to a much different standard - the President of the United States simply cannot afford to be anything but poised and adeptly diplomatic. The global-scale embarrassment the country stands to face is, well, ""unpresidented."" Donald Trump is the next President. While I'm going to be an optimist and root for a successful term, I do strongly believe that we should all be more politically vigilant and active. Inform yourself, know his policies and stances, and keep the administration accountable. Call your Senators and other elected representatives, write to Congress, and please do vote in local, state, and midterm elections. #Onward and #Upward Bestselling author"
575725932,2017-02-02 16:52:28,House votes to strike rule banning guns for some deemed mentally impaired,http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/266388356/0/usatodaycomwashington-topstories~House-votes-to-strike-rule-banning-guns-for-some-deemed-mentally-impaired/,en,False,,4,USA Today,http://www.usatoday.com,"WASHINGTON —The House of Representatives approved its first effort of the new Congress to roll back gun regulations, voting to overturn a rule that would bar gun ownership by some who have been deemed mentally impaired by the Social Security Administration. The House voted 235-180 largely along party lines Thursday to repeal an Obama-era rule requiring the Social Security Administration to send records of some beneficiaries to the federal firearms background check system after they’ve been deemed mentally incapable of managing their financial affairs. The rule, when implemented, would affect about 75,000 recipients of disability insurance and supplemental insurance income who require a representative to manage their benefits because of a disabling mental disorder, ranging from anxiety to schizophrenia. It applies to those between age 18 and full retirement age. Republicans argued the rule, which was vigorously opposed by gun-rights and disability groups, would unfairly stigmatize people with disabilities and strip them of their Second Amendment rights without due process. “This is a slap in the face for those in the disabled community because it paints all those who suffer from mental disorders with the same broad brush,” said House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va. “It assumes that simply because an individual suffers from a mental condition, that individual is unfit to exercise his or her Second Amendment rights.” Democrats agreed the government must not stigmatize those with disabilities but said this rule affects a small group with severe, long-term mental disorders preventing them from doing any work. Passage of the resolution puts others at risk, they said. “These are not just people having a bad day,” said Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif. “These are not people simply suffering from depression or anxiety. These are people with a severe mental illness who can’t hold any kind of job or make any decisions about their affairs. So the law says very clearly they shouldn’t have a firearm.” The regulation is among a host that Republicans aim to repeal under the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to dismiss an outgoing administration’s recently enacted regulations. It requires only a simple majority vote in the Senate. Earlier Thursday, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said House efforts to block five Obama regulations by the end of this week are “just the start.” The House has also voted to overturn a rule to protect streams from coal mining debris, a rule requiring federal contractors to disclose labor and worker safety violations, and another rule requiring oil, gas and minerals companies to disclose payments to foreign governments. “In the weeks ahead, we will act on more resolutions to deliver relief from excessive regulations,” Ryan said. “When you think about the fact that the Obama administration was issuing major regulations at a rate of one every three days, this is real sea change.” Read more: USA TODAY Congress to challenge gun ban for some mentally impaired USA TODAY Congress and guns: Key moments in 26 years of death and debate USA TODAY Congress passes first rollback of Obama environmental rule Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, called the Social Security regulation “reckless, overly broad and an affront to the Second Amendment rights of people with disabilities."" He introduced an identical resolution to reverse it in the Senate on Thursday with 25 Republican co-sponsors, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. “Whenever the government acts to limit the fundamental constitutional rights of citizens, it must do so carefully, lawfully and in a way that doesn’t unduly impact law-abiding Americans,” Grassley said in a statement. The rule, which took effect Jan. 18 and sets a December compliance date, requires the agency to notify individuals of their possible prohibition from possessing or receiving firearms and their rights to appeal. The National Rifle Association argues that the Social Security Administration’s process for determining disability payments is a bureaucratic process and not an adjudication that should end in someone losing the right to bear arms. Restoration of those rights requires a person to affirmatively prove that they’re not a danger to public safety. “Under this flawed system, the individual bears the burden against the government,” Goodlatte said. “This is not what due process looks like.” The gun rule was issued in December in response to the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting. It was designed to implement a 2007 law requiring federal agencies to provide records for inclusion in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which prevents gun sales to convicted criminals, people adjudicated with mental health disorders and others prohibited from owning a gun. The 2007 law passed after the Virginia Tech shooting in which a gunman who had been declared mentally ill by a Virginia special judge killed 32 people. Follow @ngaudiano on Twitter."
578142582,2017-02-02 18:46:00," Chasse: Guns at the Super Bowl? Not yet, but HB 560 could change that ",http://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/Chasse-Guns-at-the-Super-Bowl-Not-yet-but-HB-10904572.php,en,False,,10,houstonchronicle,http://www.chron.com/,"Super Bowl LI will be the third Super Bowl held in Houston. The Falcons! The Patriots! The beer! The selfies! The halftime show! The guns! Whoops, not that last one. Not yet, anyhow. But thanks to the Texas gun lobby's latest suggestion for dangerous places to allow guns, Super Bowl LI could be Houston's last. Under current Texas law, carrying handguns into sporting events is generally prohibited. But with House Bill 560, introduced for the 85th Legislature by Rep. Drew Springer, R-Muenster, handguns would be allowed in many sensitive areas where they are not allowed now, including at sporting events and bars -  places where Springer likely presumes no one has ever had his or her judgment short-circuited by one draft too many. There's an obvious reason to keep guns out of bars and sports stadiums. Sound research (and common knowledge) shows that alcohol increases a person's likelihood of violent aggressive behavior and impaired judgment - not a pretty picture when an intoxicated person is deliberating whether to shoot or how to aim. Supporters of this dangerous bill typically trot out the scenario where a ""Good Guy with a Gun"" prevents a mass shooting in a so-called gun-free zone. Yet, no reputable evidence shows that armed citizens in the bleachers, with little training and wearing a giant foam finger, will be effective at drawing a gun in self- or crowd-defense. Super Bowls past and present have featured massive, properly staffed security apparatuses to ensure fan safety and to keep drunken rowdiness at bay. Plus, these are family-friendly events. With open-carry legal in Texas, what family wants to sit their kid next to a stranger openly holstering a handgun? It's no surprise that major and minor sporting events, including those at schools, another area into which HB 560 would force guns, are currently places where civilians cannot carry a handgun. No event promoter wishes to deal with the injury or death that would come when someone negligently or aggressively discharges a firearm at an event crowded with fans and their families. On that note, let's remember that organizers for that other massive event coming up at NRG Stadium, the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, prohibited open and concealed carry from event grounds and concerts last year. That's right: Even the organizers of a huge cowboy event understand that keeping guns away from booze and crowds is a no-brainer. It's unacceptable that lawmakers in Austin are still trying to place points on the gun lobby's scoreboard by introducing ever-more senseless rollbacks of common-sense protections against gun violence. It's also reckless from a business standpoint: If HB 560 passes during the 85th Legislature, it seems likely that the NFL will think twice about holding America's grandest sporting event in a state where alcohol and guns are allowed to mix at such an event. Our lawmakers need to draw a firm line and say no to the gun lobby's insatiable ""guns everywhere, for everyone, no questions asked"" agenda. If they need any more reason than common sense, perhaps the following will prove elucidating: Super Bowl LI will mark the debut of breathalyzing, Uber-hailing chip-bags. The innovation is intended to protect fans and roadways from post-game drunken driving. To quote Roger Baran, creative director of advertising giant Goodby Silverstein & Partners: ""For a football fan, there is a lot of emotion involved with a game. It's easy to drink more than you planned."" Right he is. With just a little common sense, our lawmakers won't use the 85th Legislature to shoot us in the foot and jeopardize Texas cities' future chances at hosting marquee sporting events.

574214540,2017-01-30 16:58:38,Why did Sean Spicer suggest that the Quebec shooting validated Trump's policy initiatives?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/01/30/why-did-sean-spicer-suggest-that-the-quebec-shooting-validated-trumps-policy-initiatives/,en,False,,2,Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,"This article is more than 1 year old White House press secretary Sean Spicer made an odd comment during the daily press briefing on Monday. Spicer said that President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had spoken on the phone about the mass shooting at a mosque in Quebec City on Sunday evening, in which six people were killed as they were praying. “Prime Minister Trudeau was extremely appreciative, and he was also cautious to draw conclusions on the motives at this stage of the investigation, and the president shared those thoughts,” Spicer said. He later continued: “It’s a terrible reminder of why we must remain vigilant and why the president is taking steps to be proactive instead of reactive when it comes to our nation’s safety and security.” The odd comment is that latter one: How does the attack in Quebec bolster Trump’s security platform, which is heavily focused on the threat of terrorism? Details of the shooting are still murky. While Trudeau rightly cautioned against rushing to conclusions in his conversation with Trump, he elsewhere indicated that the incident was a terrorist attack. “This was a group of innocents targeted for practicing their faith,” he said in remarks at the House of Commons. Authorities arrested two men after the shooting, one a French Canadian student at a nearby university and the other a man born in Morocco. Subsequent reports suggest that only the former was involved in the attack; the latter was detained as a witness to the crime. A law enforcement source described the incident to Reuters as a “lone wolf” attack; other reports suggest that the shooter may have been armed with an automatic weapon. If that’s an accurate depiction of what happened, the incident will look rather familiar to American observers. Mass shootings are rare in Canada, but in the United States, we can readily list off a number of incidents — including a number that involved a young man armed with a rifle and multiple victims. We can just as easily list off terrorist attacks that looked like what allegedly happened in Quebec: The Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando or at the Christmas party in San Bernardino, Calif. Or, likely the closest possible analogue, Dylann Roof entering that black church in Charleston and murdering nine people as they prayed. Imagine Spicer responding to the Charleston shooting by saying that it was “a terrible reminder of why we must remain vigilant, and why the president is taking steps to be proactive instead of reactive when it comes to our nation’s safety and security.” After the shooting, there was a robust debate over whether it should be classified as a terrorist attack, but there wasn’t the presumption that it was. After San Bernardino and Orlando, given the killers’ expressed loyalties to terrorist organizations, there wasn’t really any debate — though there was a debate over the proposed solution. Democrats largely focused on gun control, including a new push on banning weapons sales to people on the no-fly list. Republicans focused on the threats of radicalization and terror. Were Trump on record as being in favor of a ban on assault weapons, Spicer’s comment might make some sense. New limits on the sale of rapid-fire rifles could be a “proactive instead of reactive” measure. But while Trump once held that position, he doesn’t any longer. Trump is much more likely to ascribe most mass shootings to mental health problems than terrorist intentions. When there’s any whiff of a possible Islamic angle, though, he has a record of defaulting to radical terrorism as the cause of disasters. He did so after the crash of an EgyptAir flight in May 2016. He did so after a bomb went off in Manhattan last fall. “I should be a newscaster because I called it before the news,” he said at the time. So here’s a theory about Spicer’s comment: With conflicting evidence, Trump’s team once again assumed an Islamic terror motivation that proved his recent immigration actions correct. Early reports about the Quebec shooting in some outlets focused on the second person arrested, the one from Morocco. Fox News tweeted the story emphasizing the second man’s nationality, eventually revising the headline of their article to read “Only 1 man arrested in Quebec mosque terrorist attack is a suspect, police say.” That tweet is still live as of writing, posted an hour before Spicer spoke. The Intercept uncovered other examples of people assuming that the Moroccan man must have been involved. The conservative site Gateway Pundit, meanwhile, laboriously catalogued the media outlets that did and didn’t report that the shooter had shouted “Allahu Akbar” as he fired. It’s hard to imagine another way in which to understand Spicer’s comment. The clear implication was that the incident in Quebec proved that his actions on terrorism and immigration were necessary, though it’s not clear how that is the case. If this is what happened — and I am open to alternate theories — it raises an important question: In what other circumstances will the president’s press secretary suggest to the media that incorrect information proves Trump correct? Either way, it seems very possible that Trump didn’t exactly share Trudeau’s thoughts on not jumping to conclusions. Update: The Globe and Mail reports that the suspect was not Muslim and was in fact sympathetic to far-right ideologies like that of French politician Marine Le Pen.

607235518,2017-01-07 07:00:00,Gun silencers are hard to buy. Donald Trump Jr. and silencer makers want to change that.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/gun-silencers-are-hard-to-buy-donald-trump-jr-and-silencer-makers-want-to-change-that/2017/01/07/0764ab4c-d2d2-11e6-9cb0-54ab630851e8_story.html?utm_term=.80c5e537ed7e,en,False,,2,Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,"The federal government has strictly limited the sale of firearm silencers for as long as James Bond and big-screen gangsters have used them to discreetly shoot enemies between the eyes. Now the gun industry, which for decades has complained about the restrictions, is pursuing new legislation to make silencers easier to buy, and a key backer is Donald Trump Jr., an avid hunter and the oldest son of the ­president-elect, who campaigned as a friend of the gun industry. The legislation stalled in Congress last year. But with Republicans in charge of the House and Senate and the elder Trump moving into the White House, gun rights advocates are excited about its prospects this year. They hope to position the bill the same way this time — not as a Second Amendment issue, but as a public-health effort to safeguard the eardrums of the nation’s 55 million gun owners. They even named it the Hearing Protection Act. It would end treating silencers as the same category as machine guns and grenades, thus eliminating a $200 tax and a nine-month approval process. “It’s about safety,” Trump Jr. explained in a September video interview with the founder of SilencerCo, a Utah silencer manufacturer. “It’s a health issue, frankly.” [Are mass shootings contagious? Some scientists say yes.] Violence prevention advocates are outraged that the industry is trying to ease silencer restrictions by linking the issue to the eardrums of gun owners. They argue the legislation will make it easier for criminals and potential mass shooters to obtain devices to conceal attacks. “They want the general public to think it’s about hearing aids or something,” said Kristen Rand, the legislative director of the Violence Policy Center. “It’s both a silly and smart way to do it, I guess. But when the general public finds out what’s really happening, there will be outrage.” The silencer industry and gun rights groups say critics are vastly overstating the dangers, arguing that Hollywood has created an unrealistic image of silencers, which they prefer to call “suppressors.” They cite studies showing that silencers reduce the decibel level of a gunshot from a dangerous 165 to about 135 — the sound of a jackhammer — and that they are rarely used in crimes. But gun-control activists say silencers are getting quieter, particularly in combination with subsonic ammunition, which is less lethal but still damaging. They point to videos on YouTube in which silencers make high-powered rifles have “no more sound than a pellet gun,” according to  one demonstrator showing off a silenced semiautomatic ­.22LR. [Most gun owners support restrictions. Why aren’t their voices heard?] Proponents say that’s not a good way to judge the sound. “You’re still going to hear the gunfire from far away,” said Knox Williams, president of the American Suppressor Association. “These things are still incredibly loud.” Even with the restrictions, silencers have become one of the fastest-growing segments of the gun industry, which pushed accessories as gun sales level off. In 2010, there were 285,087 registered silencers. Last year: 902,085. Rep. Matt Salmon, an Arizona Republican who regularly shoots with silencers, introduced the Hearing Protection Act in the House in 2015. A companion bill in the Senate was championed by Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho). Though the bill never made it to committee hearings, it generated tremendous interest, becoming the third-most-viewed piece of legislation on Congress’s website last year. (Top was the ­Democrat-led Assault Weapons Ban of 2015.) Salmon is now retired. On Monday, the legislation was reintroduced in the House by Rep. Jeff Duncan, a South Carolina Republican, and Rep. John Carter, a Republican from Texas. “This legislation is about safety – plain and simple,” Duncan said in a statement. “I’m very active in sport shooting and hunting, and I can’t tell you how better off the shooting sports enthusiasts would be if we had easier access to suppressors to help protect our hearing.”   Hunters often shoot without hearing protection so they can hear prey moving. Many recreational shooters don’t like wearing ear covers, which can be heavy and hot and in gun ranges lead to many conversations ending with, “I can’t hear you.” Silencers are also marketed as must-have attachments for high-powered rifles — a tactical necessity that reduces recoil, thus improving aim. “Quiet guns are easier to shoot,” the National Rifle Association says in its American Rifleman magazine. “Try it.” Silencers were invented in 1908 by Hiram Percy Maxim, a graduate of MIT whose father invented the first fully automatic machine gun. The younger Maxim had a knack for reducing loud noises; he also contributed to the development of the automobile muffler. “I have always loved to shoot, but I never thoroughly enjoyed it when I knew that the noise was annoying other people,” he said late in life. “It occurred to me one day that there was no need for the noise. Why not do away with it and shoot quietly?” Maxim solved the problem in the bathtub. He noticed that the water swirled silently down the drain. What if the gases produced from firing a bullet could swirl that way, too? So Maxim put what he called “a whirling tube” on the end of a rifle. It successfully muffled the sound of the gunfire. Soon, the whirling tube was U.S. Patent No. 958,935, titled “Silent Firearm.” In the 1930s, to curtail gang violence, Congress passed the National Firearms Act, putting restrictions and special taxes on machine guns and other high-powered weapons. Though they hadn’t been used frequently in crimes, silencers were included anyway, reportedly out of concern that poachers would use them to steal food during the Great Depression. “It’s a very strange tale,” said Stephen Halbrook, a Virginia gun rights attorney who recently published a law review article about the history of silencers. “If you think about it, if [the Occupational Safety and Health Administration] had been around then, they probably would have required people use these things.” [‘The iPhone of guns’: Will smart guns transform the industry?] Though silencers are now legal in 42 states, industry officials say the onerous and expensive task of buying them keeps gun owners, particularly hunters, from their preferred method of protecting their hearing. They frequently point out that Britain, with some of the strictest gun laws in the world, has no restrictions on silencers for many types of firearms. “There isn’t this negative stigma because of Hollywood that has suppressed — pun intended — the use of suppressors in this country,” said Josh Waldron, the founder of SilencerCo, the Utah manufacturer.  Waldron started his company in 2008 after a career in photography, aiming to educate shooters about the benefits of silencers and to essentially hold buyers’ hands through the purchasing process. He sells about 18,000 silencers a month. “I want to create an environment where people understand the real purpose of these devices and that people aren’t using them for nefarious acts,” he said. Silencer use in crimes is likely to be the focus of the legislative debate later this year. Gun rights proponents and the silencer industry cite a study showing that in California, from 1995 to 2005, silencers appeared to be used for criminal purposes only 153 times in federal cases. “Suppressed firearms are clearly not the choice of criminals,” according to a briefing paper by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which is based in Newtown, Conn., and represents gun manufacturers. “The fears and concerns about suppressor ownership and use are unfounded and have not been seen in the over 100-year history of suppressors.” Gun-control advocates contend that serious crimes are being committed with silencers on guns. Former police officer Christopher Dorner used silencers on an AR-15 and a 9mm handgun during two-day rampage in Los Angeles in 2013. A serial killer in Vermont used a silencer in the killing of at least one of his 11 victims. And the planner of a disrupted mass shooting targeting a Masonic temple in Milwaukee last year was charged with possessing a silencer, in addition to other weapons charges. “They wanted these things so they could kill quietly,” said Rand, of the Violence Policy Center. “The industry wants to make silencers less scary, but they can’t.” Gun owners such as Trump Jr. can’t understand why people like Rand don’t get it. In the video, after he’s shown shooting several guns with silencers, Trump Jr. says they can help with getting “little kids into the game.” “It’s just a great instrument,” he says. “There’s nothing bad about it at all.” Read more:  The loaded legacy of the University of Texas Tower shooting  ‘Damaged masculinity’ may help explain Columbine and other mass shootings  A Marine fights to prove he’s innocent of sexual misconduct.

When the singer was only 6 years old, he claimed his father, Calvin Cooksey, directed a homophobic slur at a transgender waitress while the two dined together at a local restaurant. Seven months later, Cooksey has now filed a defamation lawsuit against his son, according to TMZ, seeking $14.5 million in damages. “I was six years old when I heard my dad call our transgender waitress a ‘faggot’ as he dragged me out a neighborhood diner saying we wouldn’t be served because she was dirty,” Ocean wrote. “That was the last afternoon I saw my father and the first time I heard that word, I think, although it wouldn’t shock me if it wasn’t.” Cooksey reportedly claims that Ocean fabricated the incident and that the note cost him business opportunities in film and music. This isn’t the first multi-million lawsuit Cooksey has pursued. In 2014, he filed a $142 million lawsuit against hip-hop entrepreneur Russell Simmons for characterizing him as a “deadbeat dad” on the website Global Grind. Ocean has used his Tumblr account to communicate with his fans for years. Ahead of the release of his breakthrough album, “Channel Orange,” in 2012, he shared a note written in a similar stream-of-consciousness style, revealing that a romantic relationship with another man served as inspiration for the album. The Huffington Post has reached out to Ocean’s representatives and will update the post accordingly. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"

When Trump read from the sheet of paper in front of him, he did so with the confidence of an unsure student delivering a book report in front of the class. When the president veered off that single-page lifeline, he betrayed stunning ignorance. Frederick Douglass, anyone? Or how about the reference to Thomas Jefferson? A Founding Father and the third president of the United States, he was also the owner of slaves and had six children with one of them, Sally Hemings. At the start of Black History Month, it probably would have been better to just not mention him at all. [What Omarosa gets right about Trump and why that’s horrifying] But what made the car wreck in the Roosevelt Room of the White House all the more rubber-necky was who was in the room. To the president’s left was Ben Carson, a Trump punching bag during the primaries, now his secretary-designate of housing and urban development. And to his right was Omarosa Manigault, “Apprentice” alum, communications director for the White House office of public liaison and the person I’m told who organized the session. During an interview with me on MSNBC in 2015, when I asked Omarosa if she would vote for Trump, she said, “I’m a die-hard Democrat. Come on. I’ve got Hillary Clinton tattooed on my left arm.” So much for that. But it makes what happened at the White House on Wednesday all the more interesting. With the exception of Carson, a sweetheart of movement conservatives, not one person at the table was a black Republican of national stature. It’s not like they don’t exist. The GOP is filled with history-making members, none of whom was mentioned by Trump or even in the room. Where was Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina? He’s the first African American elected from the South since Reconstruction. He’s the only black Republican in the Senate and the first since Edward Brooke of Massachusetts. In 1966, Brooke was the first African American ever popularly elected to the Senate. He served until 1978. Where was Rep. Will Hurd of Texas? He won a surprise victory in his majority Hispanic district in 2014 and won reelection last November. According to the Texas Tribune, Hurd became “the first incumbent to hold onto the Texas 23rd District in eight years.” Where was Rep. Mia Love of Utah? She’s only the first African American Republican woman elected to Congress and the first black person to ever be elected to the body from that overwhelmingly white and conservative state. Where was Michael Steele? The former lieutenant governor of Maryland is the former chairman of the Republican National Committee and was also the first African American to lead the GOP. Or how about former representative J.C. Watts of Oklahoma? The table could have been filled out with others, such as former HUD secretary Alphonso Jackson; Kay Cole James, former director of the federal Office of Personnel Management under President George W. Bush; Alveda King, the niece of Martin Luther King; and Star Parker, the conservative founder of the Center for Urban Renewal and Education. And do I even need to mention former secretary of state, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and general Colin Powell? [Michael Steele: Donald Trump is “the freeest president we’ve had in a generation""] But this is what happens when a lifelong Democrat plans the Republican president’s Black History Month event. One’s display of ignorance about the history of African Americans in the GOP was only outmatched by the other’s stunning ignorance of the history of blacks in the country he leads.

                    Larisa Epatko Leave your feedback Two assailants shot and killed 14 people and wounded 21 others at a holiday party for county employees in San Bernardino, California, on Wednesday. The suspects were identified as Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and his partner Tashfeen Malik, 27. Authorities said they had assault rifles and semi-automatic handguns, and were dressed in “assault-style clothing,” reported the Associated Press. The assailants stormed the Inland Regional Center in the city of about 200,000, directly east of Los Angeles, at about 11 a.m. Pacific Time on Wednesday. The San Bernardino County Department of Public Health had rented the space for a banquet. RELATED RESOURCE: Map of all the mass shootings in 2015 Farook, who was born in Illinois and grew up in Southern California, was an environmental inspector for the county’s health department, where he worked for five years. A witness said Farook attended the banquet with his colleagues, stepped out briefly, and the shooting began. The suspects fired between 65 and 75 rounds at the center, the police said. It was unclear whether they were targeting anyone in particular. Farook and Malik, who relatives said were married, fled the scene in a dark-colored SUV. After a tip led police to an SUV that matched the description, authorities pursued and surrounded the vehicle. The suspects were killed in a confrontation with police on a suburban street. One body lay in the street and another was removed from the backseat of the SUV. Two officers sustained non-life-threatening injuries during the crossfire. Farook and Malik had dropped off their 6-month-old daughter with Farook’s mother earlier Wednesday morning, saying they were going to a doctor’s appointment, according to Hussam Ayloush, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. “Why would he do something like this? I have absolutely no idea,” said Farhan Khan, who identified himself as married to the sister of one of the suspects, at a press conference the next day. Police say the SUV they stopped was the getaway vehicle from a shooting in San Bernardino, California, on Wednesday. Photo by Mario Anzuoni/Reuters The FBI investigated the mass shooting as an “act of terrorism” and determined that the two killers were not part of any terrorist network or cell, said FBI Director James Comey on Friday. He said the investigation so far did not yield any contact between either of the killers and terrorist organizations that would have raised them on the FBI’s radar.  San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said there was “some degree of planning” at a press conference on Thursday. All four guns recovered from the scene were legally purchased, police said, adding that two of the weapons belonged to Farook. Police detonated three explosive devices left at the center. All three bombs were attached to a remote control device that didn’t go off. Police said they also found 12 pipe bombs, more than 4,500 rounds of ammunition and hundreds of bomb-making tools in the garage of a California home that was searched after the shooting. At their home, the shooters appeared to have crushed their cell phones and attempted to destroy their digital fingerprints, said David Bowdich, assistant director of the FBI’s Los Angeles division. Malik reportedly used an alias on Facebook to show support for the Islamic State group’s leader, but deleted the message before Wednesday’s attack. Farook was in contact on social media with possible extremists, a senior U.S. law enforcement official told the AP. An unnamed official, however, told the Washington Post that some of these connections were years old and not substantial. “Those contacts would not have put him on our radar. We certainly saw that contact, but it was insignificant. You’re allowed to like someone’s Facebook page,” the official told the Post. Authorities released the names of the 14 people killed: Thousands gathered Thursday night for a prayer vigil at a minor-league baseball park in the city. Speaking from the Oval Office that day, President Barack Obama said the nation needed to take basic steps to make it harder, not impossible, for people to get access to guns. “We see the prevalence of these kinds of mass shootings in this country,” the president said. “And I think so many Americans sometimes feel as if there’s nothing they can do about it.” Reaction on Twitter included commentary on gun laws and words of comfort for the suffering: “GOP offers prayers, not solutions, on Calif. massacre” https://t.co/ZiIXWCoTYH via @NYDailyNews #SanBernadino pic.twitter.com/WwimJX31uA — Washington Journal (@cspanwj) December 3, 2015  This hate between liberals and conservatives is sickening.

Noor Salman is the widow of Omar Mateen, who died in a shootout with police after the 12 June 2016 terror attack at an LGBT night club in Orlando, Florida, in which 53 people were wounded. “I can confirm she was arrested this morning in the Bay Area,” a local FBI official told the Guardian. The official was unable to confirm the exact charges against Salman, explaining that Florida’s middle district FBI office, which covers Orlando, was handling the case and therefore made the charges. Messages left for the middle district office were not immediately returned. Linda Moreno, Salman’s lawyer, whose website describes her as an expert in the criminal defense of “national security and terrorism cases”, confirmed Salman had been charged with obstruction. In a statement, Moreno said: “Noor Salman had no foreknowledge nor could she predict what Omar Mateen intended to do that tragic night. “Noor has told her story of abuse at his hands. We believe it is misguided and wrong to prosecute her and that it dishonors the memories of the victims to punish an innocent person.” A Twitter post from the US attorney’s office in Orlando said Salman would make her initial appearance on Tuesday morning in Oakland, California on federal charges filed in Florida. Salman was interviewed by FBI officials immediately after the attack and has said she was “unaware” of her husband’s plans to embark on a mass shooting. She described her husband, who she met on a dating website in 2011, as abusive, often choking her or pulling her hair. It was the second marriage for both of them. The shooting took place in the early hours of a summer Sunday, during Latin night at the popular gay nightclub. Many of those killed were young, gay people of color. Mateen described himself as an “Islamic soldier” in 911 calls recorded during the Pulse attack. The CIA said it found no direct link between Mateen and the terror organization. Reports at the time indicated that Mateen may have been motivated by struggles with his own sexuality and that Pulse regulars said they had seen him before. The 29-year-old was a security guard living in Fort Pierce, Florida, with his wife and son, about two hours’ drive from Orlando. He was born in New York City but his family moved to Florida when he was a child. After the Orlando attack, the Senate tried and failed to pass laws regarding background checks and gun control restrictions. The scene of the deadliest mass shooting in US history has been purchased by the City of Orlando and will become a permanent monument to those killed.","First published on Mon 16 Jan 2017 17.21 GMT The wife of the gunman who killed 49 people in the Pulse nightclub shooting was arrested on Monday near the Bay Area, an FBI official said.

Loading... February 5, 2017 Turkey's anti-terrorism police have detained over 440 people for alleged links to the Islamic State group, the state-run news agency reported Sunday. The Anadolu Agency said 60 suspects, the vast majority of them foreigners, were taken into custody early Sunday in the capital, Ankara. It said a total of 445 people were detained in simultaneous pre-dawn police operations that spanned several cities, including Istanbul and Gaziantep, near the border with Syria. The largest operation was in the southeast province of Sanliurfa, where police took into custody more than 100 suspects from multiple addresses and found materials relating to Islamic State militants. Security forces also apprehended nine suspects who were allegedly preparing an attack in the northwestern city of Izmir. Anadolu did not give the nationalities of all those detained but there were 10 minors among the foreigners detained in Istanbul and the northwestern province of Kocaeli. Turkey, which last year endured a failed coup attempt and dozens of bloody attacks linked to IS or Kurdish militants, has been stepping up its anti-terrorism efforts. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for a New Year Eve mass shooting at an Istanbul nightclub that killed 39 people. It claims to have multiple cells in Turkey. Turkey is a member of the NATO alliance and the U.S-led coalition against IS. It shares borders with Syria and Iraq, two war-torn nations at the heart of the fight against IS militants.

Turkish forces have been deployed in Syria since August with the aim of clearing a border patch of IS militants and Syrian Kurdish fighters that Ankara considers related to its own Kurdish insurgency. Some of those taken into custody Sunday allegedly were active in conflict zones and others allegedly engaged in recruitment efforts for IS by relaying its propaganda over social media.

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives.

Two suspects, Omar Asim and Abuliezi Abuduhamiti, who are Chinese citizens, were remanded in custody on charges of being members of an armed terrorist organization, and aiding in 39 counts of murder. Turkish authorities last week said the man who killed 39 people in an attack on an Istanbul nightclub was probably an ethnic Uighur. Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was revenge for Turkish military involvement in Syria. Anadolu news agency also said 35 people had been detained so far in relation to the attack. Uighurs were among those detained, local media reports said. The Uighurs are a largely Muslim, Turkic-speaking minority in far western China with significant diaspora communities across Central Asia and Turkey. The suspect, who authorities have not named, shot his way into exclusive Istanbul nightclub Reina and opened fire with an automatic rifle, throwing stun grenades to allow himself to reload and shooting the wounded on the ground. Among those killed in the attack were Turks and visitors from several Arab nations, India and Canada.

Trump opened his first press conference since the election by denying a report released by BuzzFeed last Tuesday regarding an unverified Russian dossier, calling it a “tremendous blot” on the intelligence community if it had been released as part of an agenda against him. Trump called BuzzFeed a “failing pile of garbage” when asked to comment further on the published documents. The president-elect suggested that the document had been leaked to the press “maybe by the intelligence agencies, who knows, but maybe the intelligence agencies, which would be a tremendous blot if they did that… because it never should have been written and certainly never should have been released.” Also Read: Trump Calls BuzzFeed Report a 'Tremendous Blot' Also Read: Trump Calls BuzzFeed Report a 'Tremendous Blot' BuzzFeed Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith used Twitter to post an internal email that explained his logic for posting the documents, which had been known to several journalists and politicians for some time.

Hopefully we'll look back at 2016 as that weird year when fake news stories oddly garnered influence over the voting population of the country. On the other side of the spectrum, there's also a chance we may look back one day in an effort to decode the origins of a propaganda tactic that's continued to be manipulated by powerful and/or misinformed ne'er do wells. Either way, there's no doubt we can learn from the false stories that started it all.

Turkish authorities — who arrested the suspected gunman on Monday afternoon — were quick to label this as an act of terrorism yet now believe something equally sinister, but much more complex, could also be behind the attacks. Police quickly arrested several people (the number has since grown to 35) who are suspected of orchestrating or assisting the plotted attack. ISIS soon claimed responsibility while labeling the act as revenge for Turkish military intervention in the Syrian civil war. However, Reuters reports a new twist from the Turkish government, which now suspects that the attack was part of a complex intelligence operation: The mass shooting at an Istanbul nightclub on New Year’s Eve was carried out professionally with the involvement of an intelligence organization, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said on Monday. “It appears the Reina attack is not just a terrorist organization’s act, but there was also an intelligence organization involved. It was an extremely planned and organized act,” Kurtulmus said during an interview with broadcaster A Haber. NBC News adds word from Omer Celik, Turkey’s European Union affairs minister, who assessed the attack as an “extremely professional” one “that evaded that avoid all modern intelligence techniques,” so as to facilitate the appearance that the gunman was acting as a lone wolf. Celik also believes the gunman received training “in the Middle East.” The suspected gunman was still at large until Monday afternoon when Turkish authorities took him into custody. Police haven’t released his name, but this chilling selfie footage likely helped lead police to his arrest. (Via Reuters, CNN & New York Times)"

Mateen's wife, Noor Salman, was also charged with aiding and abetting by providing material support, the officials said. According to the New York Times, Salman was taken into custody by F.B.I. agents at her home outside of San Francisco, where she resided with her son. Orlando Police Chief John Mina welcomed Salman's arrest. ""Nothing can erase the pain we all feel about the senseless and brutal murders of 49 of our neighbors, friends, family members and loved ones,"" Mina said in a statement. ""But today, there is some relief in knowing that someone will be held accountable for that horrific crime.""  Salman is expected to make an initial appearance on Tuesday at a federal court in Northern California. In an interview with the New York Times, Ms. Salman claims to have been ""unaware of everything"" in connection with the attack. ""I don't condone what he has done. I am very sorry for what has happened. He has hurt a lot of people,"" she said.  ""I just want people to know that I am a human. I am a mother,"" Salman told the Times. Members of Mateen's family have also tried to shield Ms. Salman from public scrutiny, claiming that she wasn't at fault for her husband's actions. ""She is shocked, that poor lady,"" Seddique Mateen, Mr. Mateen's father, said in June, 2016. ""And she doesn't know anything."" Before the attack, Mateen pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in a 911 call. ""This is Mateen… I wanted to let you know I'm in Orlando, and I did the shooting,"" he told 911 operators at 2:35 a.m. on June 12, 2016. ""My name is, 'I pledge of Allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi of the Islamic state.'"" Mateen also broadcasted his loyalty to ISIS on Facebook, writing, ""I pledge my alliance to (ISIS leader) abu bakr al Baghdadi..may Allah accept me. The real muslims will never accept the filthy ways of the west… You kill innocent women and children by doing us airstrikes…now taste the Islamic state vengeance.""

Prosecutors said in federal court Tuesday that Esteban Santiago, who allegedly flew to Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on Jan. 6 to open fire on a crowded part of the airport, acted after being inspired by the Islamic State and jihad-focused online chat rooms.
Advertisement But prosecutors also suggested to a judge that his motives for the crime remain somewhat unknown, despite previous reporting he had told FBI agents in Alaska he was being forced to fight for the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL and Daesh. The Islamic State claim, however, has been directly contradicted by Santiago himself, who initially told police his mind was being controlled by the government. Even with the conflict, Santiago freely admitted to planning and carrying out the attack, according to investigators and the prosecutor.

Advertisement Santiago flew one way from Anchorage, Alaska to Fort Lauderdale, where he picked up his gun case from baggage claim, walked into a bathroom, loaded the weapon and came out shooting at random people. He shot 11 people, killing five and wounding six, most of whom have since been released from the hospital. The gun Santiago is accused of using in the crime was taken away from him by FBI agents in November. Santiago was hospitalized for six days after he reported the CIA was controlling his brain and forcing him to watch material related to the Islamic State, as well as that he was hearing voices. After the psychiatric hospital stay, Santiago was released and given back his gun.
RELATED Indictment: Wife 'knowingly' aided Orlando nightclub shooter Initially, Santiago claimed the government was controlling his mind after he was arrested, but later said he had been radicalized by the Islamic State online, including conversations he had in jihad-related chat rooms. Santiago's next court date is scheduled for Jan. 30 and he remains in jail without bond because Judge Lorena Snow said he may be a flight risk."

Esteban Santiago, 26, was in custody following the attack, being questioned by local and federal law enforcement. Eyewitnesses described an eerily calm assailant who fired bursts from a semiautomatic handgun at fellow airline passengers as they clustered around a baggage carousel – and then just as calmly tossed his weapon away and positioned himself spread-eagle on the ground, waiting for police to arrest him. The country's largest mass shooting of the new year threw the busy Florida airport into chaos, with thousands of travelers and airport staff fleeing onto walkways and the tarmac as emergency responders and law enforcement officers, many heavily armed and in tactical gear, rushed to the scene. In addition to the eight people hurt in the shooting, 37 others were injured in the chaotic aftermath, authorities said. The Federal Aviation Administration said it had grounded flights around the country destined for Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, but some flights that were landing when the shooting broke out shortly before 1 p.m. were stranded for hours on the tarmac with passengers aboard. Hundreds more people were trapped as security forces swept the airport. As the attack unfolded, the Transportation Safety Administration said on Twitter that there was an active shooter in the airport and urged people inside to shelter in place. Later, television video showed long lines of people trudging with their luggage away from the terminals or milling around outside, with most vehicles still blocked from entering the closed airport. President-elect Donald Trump tweeted that he was following the ""horrific events"" at the airport – briefed by Republican Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who said he had phoned Trump rather than calling President Obama. The White House said Obama was briefed about the attack by staff. The trajectory of Santiago's life had taken him from balmy Puerto Rico to snowy Anchorage. Along the way, many troubling signs emerged. LAX beefs up security in wake of Fort Lauderdale airport mass shooting A federal law enforcement official said Santiago boarded a Delta Air Lines flight in Anchorage and flew to Fort Lauderdale by way of Minneapolis. Authorities are investigating whether he got into a dispute with another passenger on the Anchorage-to-Minneapolis leg of the flight, said the official, who was not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly. After getting off the plane, the gunman retrieved his baggage and went to the bathroom, where he pulled out the gun, the official said. Unloaded firearms can be legally checked in baggage in a secure container if declared, according to TSA regulations. Law enforcement authorities said the suspect was taken into custody without any additional shots being fired, and no other suspects have been identified. Authorities said the motive was unknown. But worrying details of the suspect's life in Alaska were beginning to emerge. George L. Piro, the special agent in charge at the FBI's Miami field office, reported that Santiago had walked into the agency's Anchorage field office in November. ""At that time, he clearly stated that he did not intend to harm anyone,"" Piro told reporters. But the FBI agents who spoke to him were concerned about his ""erratic behavior"" and turned him over to local law enforcement, which in turn took him to a medical facility for evaluation. A federal law enforcement source said Santiago had complained in his visit to the FBI of being forced to fight for the militant group Islamic State. He reported that his mind was being controlled by a U.S. spy agency, the official said. Last January, he was arrested and charged with assault in an incident involving his girlfriend. According to the court complaint, police said he had been yelling at her through a locked bathroom door, then busted through the door, pulling it out of its frame. He then began striking her and strangling her, the woman told police, though they observed no apparent injuries. The prosecutor dismissed the case in March when Santiago entered into a deferred prosecution agreement. Santiago was formerly a member of the Alaska Army National Guard and left the organization for ""unsatisfactory performance"" in August 2016, a National Guard spokeswoman confirmed to the Sun-Sentinel newspaper in Florida. His rank at the time was private first class. ""He is no longer a member of our organization,"" said Lt. Col. Candis A. Olmstead, who added that she could not elaborate on the reason for his discharge. ""Information on disciplinary actions [is] not releasable,'' she said. A combat engineer, Santiago joined the Puerto Rico National Guard in December 2007. He was deployed to Iraq from April 2010 to February 2011, according to the Alaska Army National Guard. In Union City, N.J., an aunt, Maria Luisa Ruiz, told reporters that Santiago had been happy upon the birth of his son, but that she and family members had feared his mental state was deteriorating. She showed reporters a photo of him wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the word ""Disturbed."" ""Like a month ago, it was like he lost his mind,"" she said, according to the website NorthJersey.com. ""He said he saw things."" Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel told reporters the incident appeared to have been limited to the lower-level baggage claim area of Terminal 2, and there was no evidence to support unconfirmed reports of gunshots in another terminal. ""There's no confirmation of any kind of gunshots anywhere at any time other than this horrific, horrific incident,"" Israel said. The FBI has joined the investigation. Santiago will face federal charges and will most likely make his first court appearance in Broward County on Monday, Piro said. He did not specify the charges and declined to speculate about a motive, saying it was too early in the investigation. Agents have not ruled anything out, including the possibility of terrorism, he said. ""It is a long-term, very difficult, complex investigation."" Hours after the shooting, most vehicles were still blocked from entering the closed airport, and authorities said it wasn't scheduled to reopen until 5 a.m. Saturday. For some of those caught up in the attack, Friday was to have been the start of a voyage on one of the many cruises that depart from Fort Lauderdale. Mark Lea, a 53-year-old financial advisor, had just arrived on a flight from Minnesota with his wife to catch a cruise to celebrate their first wedding anniversary. The couple collected their luggage and were about to leave the terminal when they heard three quick bursts of what they thought were firecrackers. They quickly realized, however, that a gunman had opened fire about 100 yards away. ""At that point, people started frantically screaming and yelling and running for the exits,"" Lea said by telephone from the airport. ""People were kind of tripping over each other."" He helped his wife to safety, then went back to aid others. He described the shooter as ""very calm, very quiet, no emotions."" The gunman, who was dressed in jeans and a blue polo shirt, was carrying what appeared to Lea to be a 9-millimeter handgun. He fired off a few dozen rounds near the luggage carousels, then dropped his gun to the ground and lay spread-eagle on the floor, waiting for sheriff's deputies to apprehend him, Lea said. ""This whole thing took place in about 45 seconds and he was done,"" said Lea. Hours later, the couple were still waiting at the airport with other passengers to retrieve their luggage.  Authorities moved passengers upstairs to the ticketing area to wait while they secured the crime scene. Travelers described huddling inside a restaurant in Terminal 2, using tables for cover, after the gunfire erupted or ducking behind parked cars when they saw people running out the doors. Others told of surreal scenes that suddenly punctuated the tedium of a routine wait at the airport. Bruce Wagner, 55, and his husband were on their way to New York after an 11-day Caribbean cruise. They were sitting at their gate when they suddenly saw people running and screaming. The crowd stampeded for the exits, he said – but there was no way out except for the jetways for boarding planes. Alarms blared, and security officials struggled to open emergency exits leading down to the tarmac. ""Everybody just plowed through them, packed like sardines, shoving and pushing and screaming,"" Wagner said by phone, with alarms still screeching in the background. Some of those who ran outside stayed close to the terminals, but others fled as far as the runways. Finally passengers were let back inside, where passengers' bags and outerwear were strewn everywhere, and iPads were left still plugged in for charging in the melee. Only moments later, an apparently false alarm sent people fleeing again. ""It was totally inept as far as security or any kind of safety,"" Wagner said. ""It seems like nobody's had any experience or training."" Josh Marsh, 24, described airline staff just one terminal over from the attack scene as being unaware of the shooting – even after he showed an agent social media reports of the shooting. ""Nothing happened for a good 20 minutes,"" Marsh said. ""No lockdown, no announcements, no nothing."" Former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer was one of those caught up in the incident, tweeting that shots had been fired and ""everyone was running."" The Fort Lauderdale airport, about 25 miles north of Miami, is a major travel hub, with more than 70,000 people passing through daily, according to the airport. Security was stepped up at the larger Miami airport in the wake of the shooting. Panic spread rapidly. A traveler identified only as Ben told CBS' Miami affiliate that he was boarding a shuttle outside the terminal when he saw ""everyone in a big pack just running as far as possible away from the shots."" ""It was a scene of ambulances and police cars, trucks, all kinds of people with automatic weapons blocking all the exits,"" Sisley said. As he headed back from the airport, emergency vehicles roared past him, sirens blaring, he said. That's when the magnitude of the situation hit him. Even though he had received training for these types of incidents, Sisley said, it all seemed unreal. ""I'm shocked,"" he said. ""And I'm worried.""

This development follows months of interviews between Salman and authorities regarding how much she knew about her husband’s plans. Shortly after the massacre, FBI Director James Comey revealed that the agency was aware of Mateen and had even interviewed him twice, and they assessed him as radicalized but while harboring confused motives. Salman’s story has morphed since the shooting, and she recently spoke with the New York Times to deny knowing anything of substance about Mateen’s plans: “I was unaware of everything. I don’t condone what he has done. I am very sorry for what has happened.” At other times, Salman claimed that she tried to stop the attack. She also admitted being in the car while he shopped for ammunition prior to the massacre, and she hinted that Mateen was emotionally and physically abusive to her. Details surrounding Salman’s arrest aren’t plentiful at this time, nor has the FBI revealed the charges against her. However, she is scheduled for an initial court appearance on Tuesday. CNN adds that investigators have been exploring how to pursue charges against her for months. Mateen’s attack killed 49 people (and injured at least 50 more) during what is widely considered to be the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. (Via CNN & New York Times)"

The suspect has reportedly been identifiedÂ and is a 26-year-old male who was born in New Jersey. President Obama has been briefed on the situation, according to the White House. President-elect Donald Trump also addressed the shooting in a tweet. Meanwhile, there are unconfirmed reports of more shots fired at the airport.Â Some seem to believe this means there is possibly aÂ second shooter at the airport, but this is not yet clear. Security is still very tight at the airport, andÂ there is a great deal of law enforcement patrolling the area. The airport remains closed. On Friday, a gunman opened fire at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, leaving multiple people dead, The New York Times reports. The Broward Sheriff's Office tweeted at least five people were killed, eight were sent to a local hospital and one suspect is in custody. The deadly incident reportedly occurred at a baggage claim inside Terminal 2. Flights have been suspended, and the terminal is being treated as a crime scene. This is yet another tragic example of gun violence in America. Last year, gun violence claimed nearly 15,000 lives and there were more mass shootings than days. According to an analysis from Vice News, there were 370 mass shootings in total in 2016. We are less than one week into 2017, and there have already been roughly 200 deaths from gun violence in America, according to Gun Violence Archive. To put this in perspective, jihadists have killed 94 Americans on US soil in the 15 years since the 9/11 terror attacks. In other words, in the first six days of 2017, gun violence has killed more than twice the number of people in the US than jihadism has in roughly a decade and a half. This is food for thought for any Americans who might fear terrorism more than gun violence, which leads to far too many deaths in the US every single year."

Esteban Santiago, 26, was in custody following the attack, being questioned by local and federal law enforcement. Eyewitnesses described an eerily calm assailant who fired bursts from a semiautomatic handgun at fellow airline passengers as they clustered around a baggage carousel – and then just as calmly tossed his weapon away and positioned himself spread-eagle on the ground, waiting for police to arrest him. The country's largest mass shooting of the new year threw the busy Florida airport into chaos, with thousands of travelers and airport staff fleeing onto walkways and the tarmac as emergency responders and law enforcement officers, many heavily armed and in tactical gear, rushed to the scene. In addition to the eight people hurt in the shooting, 37 others were injured in the chaotic aftermath, authorities said. The Federal Aviation Administration said it had grounded flights around the country destined for Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, but some flights that were landing when the shooting broke out shortly before 1 p.m. were stranded for hours on the tarmac with passengers aboard. Hundreds more people were trapped as security forces swept the airport. As the attack unfolded, the Transportation Safety Administration said on Twitter that there was an active shooter in the airport and urged people inside to shelter in place.

A group of Republican representatives have proposed the Safe Students Act in an effort to overturn gun ban policies on school grounds across the country. Kentucky Republican Representative Thomas Massie is the sponsor of the Safe Students Act. He is leading the charge to ban gun-free zone policies at public schools throughout the United States. The Safe Students Act is also known as H.R. 34. ""Gun-free school zones are ineffective. They make people less safe by inviting criminals into target-rich, no-risk environments,"" Representative Massie said. ""Gun-free zones prevent law-abiding citizens from protecting themselves, and create vulnerable populations that are targeted by criminals.""  The Safe Students Act is co-sponsored by Texas Representatives Louie Gohmert and Brian Babin, fellow Kentucky Representative James Comer, and Georgia Representative Jody Hice. If passed, the Safe Students Act will repeal the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, and all amendments related to that piece of legislation. Over the past seven years a total of 92 percent of mass shootings which have taken place in the United States occurred in gun-free zones, the Blaze noted. Some public schools have begun the process to allow armed teachers and staff on their campuses. The staffers who are armed must have passed a firearms background check, possess a concealed carry permit, and store their handguns as mandated by the school district. ""A bigger federal government can't solve this problem. Weapons bans and gun-free zones are unconstitutional. They do not and cannot prevent criminals or the mentally ill from committing acts of violence,"" Representative Massie added. ""But they often prevent victims of such violence from protecting themselves."" The Safe Students Act gun-free zone policy reversal legislation is being heralded by the three largest Second Amendment rights organizations in America. The National Association for Gun Rights, the National Rifle Association (NRA) and Gun Owners of America, all wholeheartedly the bill. Representative Massie is also credited with relaunching the Congressional Second Amendment Caucus, Reason noted. The Safe Students Act is reportedly a revamped version of a gun-free zones in schools opposition bill once sponsored by Ron Paul. Thomas Massie stated in a press release that the 2016 election has presented a ""new opportunity to advance pro-gun legislation and reverse the erosion of the Second Amendment that's occurred over the last few decades,"" according to another a Reason report.    A Crime Prevention Research Center report on mass shootings in the America states from January of 2009 through July of 2014, stated there were 25 mass public shootings in the country. The research center considered every incidence where at least four people were killed with a gun in a public space for the purpose of their report. The crime research report found the average mass shooter was a 36-year-old male. The same report indicates that in half the American mass shootings there was a ""clear indication"" of mental illness in the shooter prior to the attack. The crime prevention report also investigated the type of weapons used by mass shooters in their violent attacks. In mass shootings where semi-automatic rifles were used, often referred to as ""assault weapons"" or ""assault rifles,"" about 10 victims were killed on average during attacks. When handguns were used, which are also semi-automatic unless the shooter is carrying a revolver, about six victims were killed on average during such attacks. With the noted exception of the horrific Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, slightly fewer fatalities occurred when a mass shooter used a semi-automatic rifle, according to the Crime Prevention Research Center report.

	Scott Tobias In the nearly 75 years since the Oscars began awarding a documentary feature, no non-fiction filmmaker has ever been nominated for director, despite being eligible for the prize. The most obvious reason is that “directing” seems antithetical to the spirit of nonfiction, which is about revealing unsullied truths about the world in which we live. Documentary directors have been generally regarded as observers or journalists, rather than as creative artists, and the Oscar process has, until recently, rewarded more conservative approaches to the form. Such prominent documentary figures as Errol Morris and Werner Herzog worked for decades before the Academy honored them. Morris’ “The Fog of War” won the 2004 Oscar and Herzog’s “Encounters at the End of the World” was nominated in 2009. But even those films, as quirky and iconoclastic as they are, operated in the familiar spheres of journalistic interrogation and fact-filled nature docs. It’s always been expected that doc filmmakers give themselves over to the subject matter, rather than make bold artistic choices.  Yet the shortlist for the 2016 documentary Oscar continues a trend toward embracing non-fiction directors as auteurs, opening up the possibility of consideration alongside their fictional counterparts. Among the potential nominees is Kirsten Johnson’s “Cameraperson,” a unique memoir composed of outtakes from Johnson’s career as a cinematographer; Ezra Edelman’s “O.J.: Made in America,” a kaleidoscopic 7½-hour look at American culture through the prism of O.J. Simpson’s rise and fall; Ava DuVernay’s “13th,” which draws a direct line between the amendment that ended slavery and the mass incarceration of black men; Keith Maitland’s “Tower,” an animated account of the 1966 mass shooting at the University of Texas; and Gianfranco Rosi’s “Fire at Sea,” the first documentary to ever win top prize at the Berlin Film Festival. “If you look at the Oscar shortlist this year and compare it to the shortlist and nominations of 2002 or 2003, they’re just different,” says David Wilson, the co-founder and co-director of True/False Film Fest, which has been a reliable annual showcase for innovative nonfiction since 2003. “We’re seeing films that are artful, pushing boundaries, and taking real risks, and [committee members] are taking them seriously. That feels like progress to me.” One of the breakout films from last year’s True/False Fest, Johnson’s “Cameraperson,” takes first-person documentary filmmaking to a startling new place. Over 15 years as a globetrotting nonfiction cinematographer, Johnson collected footage from locales as diverse as the war-torn regions of Bosnia and Darfur, a maternity ward in Nigeria, a secret prison in Yemen, and her childhood home in Wyoming, where her mother is suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. Without even the connective tissue of voiceover narration, Johnson creates a personal collage of her life and art that emphasizes the power of the camera to forge relationships and give a voice to the marginalized.  “I feel like one of the things I was willing to do as a director, was not know what this film should be, but to pursue, with the greatest intensity and attention, the deep questions that are completely real to me and urgent in this moment in history,” Johnson says. She cites another film from this year’s shortlist, “Weiner,” about Anthony Weiner’s failed bid for New York City mayor, as an example of the dynamic qualities of nonfiction, which can change context and meaning both during and after filming. “When you look at ‘Weiner,’ the meaning of Weiner allowing himself to be filmed in that moment changes over time. In my mind, the documentary relationship is always alive and changing. ‘Weiner’ means different things now than it did, as a film, when they made it, because historical events have shifted.” The shifting of historical events also brings new meaning to “Tower,” an ingenious re-creation of the day Charles Whitman took the elevator to the top floor of the University of Texas Tower and opened fire for 96 minutes, killing 16 and wounding dozens more. In August 1966, the country had never experienced a mass shooting on campus, but they’ve become all-too-common in recent history, and Maitland’s powerful documentary celebrates the courage and humanity of those in the line of fire. Working from a wealth of archival footage, as well as pictures he shot around campus, Maitland filmed much of the action in his backyard and composited it through the same rotoscoping animation technique that his fellow Austinite, Richard Linklater, used for “Waking Life” and “A Scanner Darkly.” Drawing on interviews with victims, witnesses, and other survivors, Maitland evokes the horror of that afternoon with a DIY resourcefulness that stands as one of the year’s shrewdest directorial achievements. “I have a 40-foot palm tree in my back yard, and that became the stand-in for the Tower, for eye-line purposes,” recalls Maitland, who also synced the movements of his actors with the movement of background shots he picked up on his iPhone. “All along, the guiding principle was that the more immersive we can make the experience of the film, the more empathetic our audience will be with these characters.” Maitland sees the boundaries between fiction and nonfiction filmmaking as fluid, citing the ensemble work of Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson as influences along with doc directors like Brett Morgen (“Chicago 10”) and Ari Folman (“Waltz With Bashir”) who conducted similar experiments. “There’s been a blurring back and forth lately and I think that’s a good thing,” Maitland says. “The grammar and language of film is only about 100 years old, so it makes sense that it continues to be written.” Compared to such singular documentary achievements as “Cameraperson” and “Tower,” “O.J.: Made in America” doesn’t exactly reinvent the form, but Edelman’s scrupulous assemblage of interviews and archival footage is radical in its own way. Edelman doesn’t even get to the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman in the first third of film, choosing instead to set the context of Simpson’s life and career within the larger scope of African-American history in Los Angeles. And the home stretch is a post-trial odyssey that few remember or witnessed, but says equally profound things about faded celebrity and black justice. “For me, in terms of this film, the main undertaking [as director] was to take this massive idea and ground it in real narrative thrust and structure,” says Edelman. “As a storyteller, my job was to elicit the most honest, thoughtful, colorful responses from this vast array of interview subjects. I had to figure out a way to tell a story in as engaging and thoughtful a way as possible.” Edelman credits the team responsible for the massive footage-gathering process, including producers Caroline Waterlow and Nina Krstic, but even with extensive archival images, he needed to fill in visual gaps, particularly in how he could suggest Los Angeles as a city of stark class and racial divisions. “I thought, ‘We have to be able to capture this city from the air, and be able to show, literally, the two L.A.s.,’” he says. “[Viewers] had to understand the layout and the segregation that comes because of it.” Though the Academy may not look to documentaries for director nods any time soon, the diversity of visions in this year’s shortlist suggest a continued openness to where a nonfiction film can go creatively. For Wilson, what stands out about “Cameraperson,” “Tower,” and “O.J.: Made in America” from a filmmaking standpoint is the range. “You have three directors with three distinct visions, bringing a wholly different set of tools to the table,” says Wilson. “I think they’re three great films that illustrate the idea that nonfiction is not a genre. Nonfiction is a kind of storytelling, just like fiction is a kind of storytelling.  “If people can get their head around it, that will be the next big advance in how people think and talk about nonfiction.” The Business of Entertainment"

Josh Rhoden, 38, is accused of selling prescription pills in Pike County. He was charged with aggravated trafficking, a third-degree felony, and spent the night in the Ross County Jail. He is a cousin to the members of the Rhoden family found slain in Pike County in the largest homicide case in Ohio history. Information leading to Josh Rhoden's arrest was discovered during the investigation of the April 22 Pike County massacre, but the arrest is unrelated to the homicides, said Jill Del Greco, a spokeswoman for the Ohio attorney general. Officials also arrested Rhoden's neighbor, John McJunkin, 63, on a charge of drug possession. The arrests give a rare glimpse into the activity of the authorities investigating the Rhoden killings. No one has been arrested in connection with the deaths, which shocked the close-knit rural community and the country nine months ago. Officials say they are working diligently on the case, but have provided little information. Search warrants and related records are sealed from public view. Both Pike County Sheriff Charles Reader and Attorney General Mike DeWine have said in recent months they believed the killers were local and that community members knew more than they were saying. Reader and DeWine have threatened arrests if people with information don't come forward. It is not uncommon for investigators to arrest individuals on unrelated charges as a means to obtain information on other cases. More coverage • Death in the foothills • Ohio 32: A road of unintended consequences •  3 in custody after Pike overdoses, including 1 death On Thursday night, deputies from Pickaway, Ross and Pike counties and agents from Ohio's Bureau of Criminal Investigation searched Josh Rhoden's trailer at 3207 Grassy Fork Road in Peebles. Authorities found $7,700 in pills, nine guns, a small amount of marijuana and $8,000 in cash in that residence and in one neighboring it, where McJunkin lives, Del Greco said. Neighbors said they noticed the gathering law enforcement vehicles around 6 p.m. Thursday. The presence of so many officers and vehicles raised suspicion, they said. Pike County Prosecutor Rob Junk declined to say whether officials are trying to use the two arrests to get more information about the April 22 slayings. ""Every little bit helps,"" he said of information related to the killings. Josh Rhoden has a history of drug arrests and convictions. In 2003 in Pike County, he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor drug possession in exchange for other drug charges being dropped. Three years later, in 2006, he pleaded guilty to possessing marijuana and a drug paraphernalia charge. Tony Rhoden, brother of two of the victims in the April slaying, said earlier this week he had not heard anything new in the case. But the family remains hopeful the case will be solved. ""Let's all pray for law enforcement to solve this,'' he said via a text message Tuesday. The Pike County slayings occurred in the early morning hours of April 22 in three trailer homes on Union Hill Road and at another scene on Left Fork Road. Killed in what authorities have called a methodical, targeted attack on the family were: Christopher Rhoden Sr., 40; his ex-wife Dana Rhoden, 37; their children Clarence ""Frankie"" Rhoden, 20, Hanna Rhoden, 19, and Christopher Rhoden Jr., 16; Christopher Rhoden Sr.'s brother Kenneth Rhoden, 44; a cousin, Gary Rhoden, 38; and Hannah Gilley, 20, the fiancee of Frankie Rhoden.

Anonymous tips are still being taken at the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation at 855-BCI-OHIO (224-6446) or the Pike County Sheriff's Office at 740-947-2111. A $10,000 Crime Stoppers reward would be paid for any information that leads to the apprehension of suspects and a conviction in the case. Chrissie Thompson and Kevin Grasha contributed.   "
597482317,2017-01-29 07:00:00,Suspect in deadly Canadian mosque shooting charged with six counts of murder,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/01/29/multiple-people-reported-shot-by-gunmen-at-quebec-city-mosque/?utm_term=.290cdfe729c2,en,False,,2,Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,"This article is more than 1 year old QUEBEC CITY — Authorities charged a 27-year-old Canadian man with murder and attempted murder with a firearm Monday following a deadly attack on a suburban Quebec City mosque. The shooting, which was quickly labeled an act of terrorism, left six people dead and numerous others wounded. Alexandre Bissonnette was charged with six counts of murder and five counts of attempted murder, according to officials. The Sûreté du Québec, the Quebec provincial police, said two men were arrested Sunday night, though authorities said Monday that only one of the men is now a suspect in the mass shooting at the Quebec Islamic Cultural Center. Police provided no possible motive as they began their investigation of the attack in one of Canada’s safest cities. But government officials wasted no time in calling it terrorism. “This was a group of innocents targeted for practicing their faith,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in an address at the House of Commons, hours after condemning the attack in a statement. “Make no mistake: This was a terrorist attack.” “These were people of faith and of community,” Trudeau added, “and in the blink of an eye, they were robbed of their lives in an act of brutal violence.” Five victims remained hospitalized Monday morning, hospital officials said, noting that 14 others had been treated and released from area hospitals. Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard also called the shooting a “terrorist act,” saying at an overnight news conference that he reacted with “horror and incredulity” when he learned about the attack. He promised increased police protection for mosques and Islamic centers across the province of Quebec. “We are with you,” Couillard said, addressing the province’s Muslim community. “You are at home. You are Quebecois.” Quebec mosque saw itself ‘in harmony’ with Canadian society At a subsequent news conference with Muslim leaders, Couillard said he could not theorize why members of the mosque were gunned down — but he acknowledged that they were the targets. “This community was targeted, that’s true,” he told reporters. “The individuals who were attacked were attacked because they were part of this community.” But, he added: “All Quebecers have been the victims of this attack.” While mosques in Canada and the United States have been the targets of numerous acts of vandalism and other hate crimes in recent years, the Quebec City attack appears to be one of the first mass shootings at an Islamic house of worship in North America. Witnesses said a gunman in a hood or ski mask opened fire on congregants at the mosque shortly before 8 p.m. Police said the six people killed were between 35 and 60 years old, all men. Mosque officials said the victims were all Canadian citizens, and included men of Tunisian, Moroccan and Algerian descent. One man was arrested close to the mosque, according to police. ‘It will be a bloodbath’: Inside the Kansas militia plot to ignite a religious war A second man called 911 about 20 minutes later, police said, and told a dispatcher that he wanted to talk. That person gave the dispatcher his location and waited for police about 14 miles east of the mosque along the shore of the St. Lawrence River on the approach to a bridge leading to the Island of Orleans. He surrendered without incident and has been cooperating with investigators, police said. Authorities have not publicly identified either of the two men who were arrested — and police said midday Monday that one of them is now considered a witness, not a suspect. Authorities have not described the ethnicity or religious identity of the perpetrator. Neither of the two men who were detained was previously known to police, authorities said. Charges are still being sorted out, police said at the news conference Monday morning. Authorities did not provide information about the type of firearms used in the attack. Mohamed Belkhadir, a 29-year-old man who had been identified by local news sources first as a suspect and then merely as a witness, told La Presse that he was at the scene of the shooting Sunday night trying to help a friend who had been injured when he saw someone with a firearm. He said he assumed it was a gunman returning to shoot more people so he ran away. But it was a police officer, and Belkhadir was arrested when he fled from the area, he said. “I understand; I respect that they caught me,” Belkhadir told the Canadian newspaper, in French. “They saw me flee. They thought I was suspicious. That’s normal. For them, someone who flees is a suspect.” Bissonnette, the suspect, was charged early Monday evening. The long history of terror and violence in Canada Officials at the mosque urged followers not to spread rumors about Sunday’s mass shooting. Still, the context of the attack was inescapable, coming after a rise in anti-Muslim rhetoric, behavior and vandalism in the United States and Canada, amid a heated debate about President Trump’s executive order temporarily shutting U.S. borders to refugees and migrants from seven mostly Muslim countries. While debate has raged in the United States over whether to accept refugees from war-torn Syria and elsewhere, the Canadian government has become more open to people fleeing conflict in the Middle East. Trudeau has personally greeted some refugees who have entered the country, and on Sunday said he welcomed people who were rejected from the United States under Trump’s order. Ahmed Hussen, Canada’s minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship, announced Sunday that he would grant temporary residence permits to people there who were affected by Trump’s travel ban. “Canada is a country of immigrants,” Hussen said, according to the Globe and Mail. “Canadians are proud of our long history of acting with compassion and humanitarianism to those seeking refuge for themselves and their families.” Trudeau called Canada’s diversity “our strength,” and noted that “religious tolerance is a value that we, as Canadians, hold dear.” Still, Muslims in both Canada and the United States have reported a surging number of hate crimes in recent years, including vandalism, assault and arson at their places of worship. The Quebec Islamic Cultural Center, one of several mosques in the area, was the target of an apparent hate crime in June, when someone left a bloody pig’s head wrapped in cellophane at the front door, along with a note reading, “Bonne appétit.” The consumption of pork is banned by Islam. Concerned about that kind of incident, the mosque installed several closed-circuit cameras around the building. “All our thoughts are with the children, whom we must tell about the death of their fathers,” the mosque said Sunday on its Facebook page. “May Allah give them patience and endurance.” Through tears, Mohamed Labibi of the Quebec Islamic Cultural Center called the mass shooting a “very, very big tragedy,” and pleaded with reporters to “personify” those who had lost their lives — businessmen, shopkeepers and a university professor, though he did not name them. “We cannot express our sadness,” he said. The president of Laval University confirmed Monday afternoon that Khaled Belkacemi, a professor at the school of agriculture and food sciences, was among the dead. There are more than 1 million Muslims in Canada. About 6,000 live in Quebec City, according to Canada’s 2011 National Household Survey. Addressing the nation’s Muslims, Trudeau said in his televised House of Commons speech: “I want to say directly: We are with you. Thirty-six million hearts are breaking with yours. And know that we value you. You enrich our country in immeasurable ways. It is your home. “Last night’s horrible crime against the Muslim community was an act of terror committed against Canada and against all Canadians. We will grieve with you, we will defend you, we will love you and we will stand with you.” Interim Conservative Leader Rona Ambrose called the attack “a sad reminder that our country is not immune to terrorism” and said it violated one of the country’s most cherished freedoms: “to worship without fear.” Imam Sikander Hashmi, of Ottawa, said there has been a rise in the number of reported anti-Muslim hate crimes in Canada, which the National Council of Canadian Muslims has documented. “Unfortunately,” Hashmi said in an interview with The Washington Post, “it has come to this — to what we saw last night.” The imam, who said he grew up in Canada, said the idea that an attack such as this could occur in Canada has crossed his mind, but the chances seemed slim to him. In recent years, however, he said Muslims in Canada have been paying close attention to the political climate both in Canada and the United States. Specifically, he said, many were concerned about Quebec’s proposed “Charter of Values” bill that would have prohibited government employees from wearing religious symbols, such as head coverings. He said Muslims in Canada watched the U.S. presidential campaign, Trump’s inauguration and the controversial executive orders that the president pushed during his first few days in office. “Muslims — we live in a global village,” Hashmi said. The imam said that although he cannot say whether there is a link between the current political climate and the attack Sunday night in Quebec City, many Muslims might make that connection. “Canadians and people around the world won’t be seeing this in isolation,” he said. “They’ll be seeing it in this context.” But, he said, the Muslim community will stand firm. “We’re going to get through this together, and stand against anyone who tries to spread hatred and fear,” Hashmi said. Couillard, the Quebec premier, told reporters: “We are obviously in a world where people tend to divide themselves rather than unite themselves. This is why our country … has to remain a beacon, a landmark of tolerance and openness in this troubled world.” Police said a joint task force of terrorist specialists from the Quebec provincial police, the City of Montreal Police and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police was deployed to the site, with explosives experts and canine teams among them. The Quebec Islamic Cultural Center is located near Laval University, which has a large community of international students, many from French-speaking Africa and the Maghreb. The mass shooting was a particular shock for Quebec City, a quiet white-collar community that has one of the lowest violent crime rates in Canada. The city, whose metropolitan area is home to about 806,000 people, reported just two killings in all of 2015. Samer Majzoub, the president of the Canadian Muslim Forum, a Muslim advocacy group in Quebec, said that he knows people who attend the Quebec City mosque, but that he and other area Muslim leaders were still trying frantically to find out who had been shot. “People that we know, we are not sure if they’re alive right now,” he told The Post. “It is shocking. It never came to our mind that we’d have a terrorist act as such, especially in Canada.” “This act of wanton murder must be punished to the fullest extent of the law,” Ihsaan Gardee, director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims, said in a statement. “We are heartened by the overwhelming support from fellow Canadians in this time of deep crisis,” he added. “We must unite together against divisive forces that seek to harm our communities.” Majzoub, Canadian Muslim Forum president, said Canada has seen increasing anti-Muslim hostility over the past year, but still nowhere near the level witnessed in the United States and Europe. He said the area near the mosque has appeared to be particularly prone to anti-Muslim sentiments. “This masjid has witnessed a lot of issues before — threats and vandalism, and some Islamophobic graffiti,” he said, using the Arabic word for mosque. “It’s not the first time.” Majzoub said the mosque has a small congregation of about a hundred people and attracts a lot of students because it’s near a university. He said many of its attendees are of North African descent. “We never thought it could happen,” he said. “It was a slaughter.” Trump called Trudeau to express his condolences, according to the prime minister’s office — the first condolence call Trump has made for a terror attack since taking office on Jan. 20. In an afternoon news briefing, White House spokesman Sean Spicer confirmed that the president had offered his support to the Canadian prime minister. “This is another senseless act of violence that can not be tolerated,” Spicer told reporters. Spicer called the attack “a terrible reminder of why we must remain vigilant, and why the president is taking steps to be proactive rather than reactive when it comes to our nation’s safety and security.” Russian President Vladimir Putin offered his condolences, as well, sending a telegram to Trudeau. “This murder of people who had gathered at a mosque to pray is staggering in its cruelty and cynicism,” Putin said, according to the Kremlin. French President François Hollande denounced the attack, and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo announced Monday that the lights on the Eiffel Tower will be turned off to send a message of solidarity. Pope Francis met Monday with Quebec Archbishop Cardinal Gerald Cyprien Lacroix and said he was praying for the victims and their families, explaining “the importance of remaining united in prayer, Christians and Muslims,” according to the Vatican. Said Couillard, the premier: “Today if you see someone from the Islam community, stop and say hello.” Bever and Hawkins reported from Washington. Marissa Miller in Quebec City, David Filipov in Moscow and Ben Guarino, Abigail Hauslohner and Bastien Inzaurralde in Washington contributed to this report, which has been updated numerous times.

563755939,2017-01-06 22:10:00,Fort Lauderdale shooting suspect was an Iraq war veteran with delusions of being forced to fight for Islamic State,http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/hottopics/~3/Dytb0QgBAPI/la-na-airport-shooting-20170106-story.html,en,False,,9,Chicago Tribune,http://www.chicagotribune.com/,"The young Iraq war veteran suspected of fatally shooting five people and wounding eight others at Fort Lauderdale's international airport Friday had become mentally agitated in recent weeks, family members said, despite his happiness over the birth of a son less than four months ago. Esteban Santiago, 26, was in custody following the attack, being questioned by local and federal law enforcement. Eyewitnesses described an eerily calm assailant who fired bursts from a semiautomatic handgun at fellow airline passengers as they clustered around a baggage carousel – and then just as calmly tossed his weapon away and positioned himself spread-eagle on the ground, waiting for police to arrest him. The country's largest mass shooting of the new year threw the busy Florida airport into chaos, with thousands of travelers and airport staff fleeing onto walkways and the tarmac as emergency responders and law enforcement officers, many heavily armed and in tactical gear, rushed to the scene. In addition to the eight people hurt in the shooting, 37 others were injured in the chaotic aftermath, authorities said. The Federal Aviation Administration said it had grounded flights around the country destined for Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, but some flights that were landing when the shooting broke out shortly before 1 p.m. were stranded for hours on the tarmac with passengers aboard. Hundreds more people were trapped as security forces swept the airport. As the attack unfolded, the Transportation Safety Administration said on Twitter that there was an active shooter in the airport and urged people inside to shelter in place. Later, television video showed long lines of people trudging with their luggage away from the terminals or milling around outside, with most vehicles still blocked from entering the closed airport. President-elect Donald Trump tweeted that he was following the ""horrific events"" at the airport – briefed by Republican Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who said he had phoned Trump rather than calling President Obama. The White House said Obama was briefed about the attack by staff. The trajectory of Santiago's life had taken him from balmy Puerto Rico to snowy Anchorage. Along the way, many troubling signs emerged. LAX beefs up security in wake of Fort Lauderdale airport mass shooting A federal law enforcement official said Santiago boarded a Delta Air Lines flight in Anchorage and flew to Fort Lauderdale by way of Minneapolis. Authorities are investigating whether he got into a dispute with another passenger on the Anchorage-to-Minneapolis leg of the flight, said the official, who was not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly. After getting off the plane, the gunman retrieved his baggage and went to the bathroom, where he pulled out the gun, the official said. Unloaded firearms can be legally checked in baggage in a secure container if declared, according to TSA regulations. Law enforcement authorities said the suspect was taken into custody without any additional shots being fired, and no other suspects have been identified. Authorities said the motive was unknown. But worrying details of the suspect's life in Alaska were beginning to emerge. George L. Piro, the special agent in charge at the FBI's Miami field office, reported that Santiago had walked into the agency's Anchorage field office in November. ""At that time, he clearly stated that he did not intend to harm anyone,"" Piro told reporters. But the FBI agents who spoke to him were concerned about his ""erratic behavior"" and turned him over to local law enforcement, which in turn took him to a medical facility for evaluation. A federal law enforcement source said Santiago had complained in his visit to the FBI of being forced to fight for the militant group Islamic State. He reported that his mind was being controlled by a U.S. spy agency, the official said. Last January, he was arrested and charged with assault in an incident involving his girlfriend. According to the court complaint, police said he had been yelling at her through a locked bathroom door, then busted through the door, pulling it out of its frame. He then began striking her and strangling her, the woman told police, though they observed no apparent injuries. The prosecutor dismissed the case in March when Santiago entered into a deferred prosecution agreement. Santiago was formerly a member of the Alaska Army National Guard and left the organization for ""unsatisfactory performance"" in August 2016, a National Guard spokeswoman confirmed to the Sun-Sentinel newspaper in Florida. His rank at the time was private first class. ""He is no longer a member of our organization,"" said Lt. Col. Candis A. Olmstead, who added that she could not elaborate on the reason for his discharge. ""Information on disciplinary actions [is] not releasable,'' she said. A combat engineer, Santiago joined the Puerto Rico National Guard in December 2007. He was deployed to Iraq from April 2010 to February 2011, according to the Alaska Army National Guard. In Union City, N.J., an aunt, Maria Luisa Ruiz, told reporters that Santiago had been happy upon the birth of his son, but that she and family members had feared his mental state was deteriorating. She showed reporters a photo of him wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the word ""Disturbed."" ""Like a month ago, it was like he lost his mind,"" she said, according to the website NorthJersey.com. ""He said he saw things."" Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel told reporters the incident appeared to have been limited to the lower-level baggage claim area of Terminal 2, and there was no evidence to support unconfirmed reports of gunshots in another terminal. ""There's no confirmation of any kind of gunshots anywhere at any time other than this horrific, horrific incident,"" Israel said. The FBI has joined the investigation. Santiago will face federal charges and will most likely make his first court appearance in Broward County on Monday, Piro said. He did not specify the charges and declined to speculate about a motive, saying it was too early in the investigation. Agents have not ruled anything out, including the possibility of terrorism, he said. ""It is a long-term, very difficult, complex investigation."" Hours after the shooting, most vehicles were still blocked from entering the closed airport, and authorities said it wasn't scheduled to reopen until 5 a.m. Saturday. For some of those caught up in the attack, Friday was to have been the start of a voyage on one of the many cruises that depart from Fort Lauderdale. Mark Lea, a 53-year-old financial advisor, had just arrived on a flight from Minnesota with his wife to catch a cruise to celebrate their first wedding anniversary. The couple collected their luggage and were about to leave the terminal when they heard three quick bursts of what they thought were firecrackers. They quickly realized, however, that a gunman had opened fire about 100 yards away. ""At that point, people started frantically screaming and yelling and running for the exits,"" Lea said by telephone from the airport. ""People were kind of tripping over each other."" He helped his wife to safety, then went back to aid others. He described the shooter as ""very calm, very quiet, no emotions."" The gunman, who was dressed in jeans and a blue polo shirt, was carrying what appeared to Lea to be a 9-millimeter handgun. He fired off a few dozen rounds near the luggage carousels, then dropped his gun to the ground and lay spread-eagle on the floor, waiting for sheriff's deputies to apprehend him, Lea said. ""This whole thing took place in about 45 seconds and he was done,"" said Lea. Hours later, the couple were still waiting at the airport with other passengers to retrieve their luggage.  Authorities moved passengers upstairs to the ticketing area to wait while they secured the crime scene. Travelers described huddling inside a restaurant in Terminal 2, using tables for cover, after the gunfire erupted or ducking behind parked cars when they saw people running out the doors. Others told of surreal scenes that suddenly punctuated the tedium of a routine wait at the airport. Bruce Wagner, 55, and his husband were on their way to New York after an 11-day Caribbean cruise. They were sitting at their gate when they suddenly saw people running and screaming. The crowd stampeded for the exits, he said – but there was no way out except for the jetways for boarding planes. Alarms blared, and security officials struggled to open emergency exits leading down to the tarmac. ""Everybody just plowed through them, packed like sardines, shoving and pushing and screaming,"" Wagner said by phone, with alarms still screeching in the background. Some of those who ran outside stayed close to the terminals, but others fled as far as the runways. Finally passengers were let back inside, where passengers' bags and outerwear were strewn everywhere, and iPads were left still plugged in for charging in the melee. Only moments later, an apparently false alarm sent people fleeing again. ""It was totally inept as far as security or any kind of safety,"" Wagner said. ""It seems like nobody's had any experience or training."" Josh Marsh, 24, described airline staff just one terminal over from the attack scene as being unaware of the shooting – even after he showed an agent social media reports of the shooting. ""Nothing happened for a good 20 minutes,"" Marsh said. ""No lockdown, no announcements, no nothing."" Former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer was one of those caught up in the incident, tweeting that shots had been fired and ""everyone was running."" The Fort Lauderdale airport, about 25 miles north of Miami, is a major travel hub, with more than 70,000 people passing through daily, according to the airport. Security was stepped up at the larger Miami airport in the wake of the shooting. Panic spread rapidly. A traveler identified only as Ben told CBS' Miami affiliate that he was boarding a shuttle outside the terminal when he saw ""everyone in a big pack just running as far as possible away from the shots."" ""It was a scene of ambulances and police cars, trucks, all kinds of people with automatic weapons blocking all the exits,"" Sisley said. As he headed back from the airport, emergency vehicles roared past him, sirens blaring, he said. That's when the magnitude of the situation hit him. Even though he had received training for these types of incidents, Sisley said, it all seemed unreal. ""I'm shocked,"" he said. ""And I'm worried.""

Noor Salman was arrested at her family home in San Francisco, California but the charges she will face were filed in the state of Florida about the 49 people killed by her husband during his massacre at the Pulse nightclub in June. The wife of the accused terrorist will face charges of obstruction of justice and aiding and abetting by providing material support to a terrorist organization. The New York Times was the first media outlet to report that the FBI had arrested of the Orlando shooter's wife.  Investigators had spent hours interviewing Salman after the June 12 mass shooting and had made it clear that Salman would face criminal charges it was ever determined that she knew of the plans husband Omar Mateen's, had to carry out the attack on the gay nightclub, and did nothing to stop him. Those hours of questioning did not get the Muslim woman to confess though and last November she continued to proclaim her innocence during a session with the media. ""I was unaware of everything,"" she insisted. Noor Salman also stated that her marriage had been rocky and her husband had become increasingly violent, even becoming physically abusive. Salman said that during her pregnancy Mateen had even punched her during a trip to buy clothes for the baby.  As the weeks went by Noor Salman avoided speaking publicly about the massacre her husband had carried out and it was only at the November interview that she claimed to have no knowledge of what Mateen had been planning. She says she thought that her husband had been out with a friend that night. Omar Mateen and Noor Salman had a son together, a boy who is now 4-years-old and partly named after his father. Last month Salman filed a petition to change her son's name. [Featured Image by Chris O'Meara/AP Images]"

BuzzFeed News; Getty Marine Le Pen has dragged the National Front from the extreme fringes of French politics and now has a shot at winning the presidency — with growing support from LGBT voters. J.

        Pierre Buet Reporting From Paris, France Reporting From Paris, France Posted on February 2, 2017, at 10:42 a.m. ET PARIS — The courtship of LGBT voters by one of the leading candidates for the presidency of France began as she tried to distance her party from the Nazis. While campaigning to lead the National Front in 2010, Marine Le Pen set out to bury the legacy of the party’s founder, her own father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, who had twice been prosecuted for Holocaust denial. She wanted to rebrand the party, to rid it of its obsession with the Nazi occupation of France in the middle of the last century. Instead, Le Pen believed voters should be much more worried by a new “occupation” that she thought would bring even the party’s old enemies to her side: the “illegal occupation” of France by Muslim immigrants. Muslim headscarves and public prayer had become so common in “a number of territories” that some areas have become “subject to religious laws that replace the laws of the Republic,” Le Pen said during a campaign speech in Lyon on Dec. 11, 2010. As a result, she said, ""I hear more and more testimonies about the fact that in certain districts, it is not good to be a woman, homosexual, Jewish, even French or white."" This was part of a strategy that the French press calls the “de-demonizing” of the National Front, which had never won more than 18% of the national vote during the nearly 40 years it was led by her father. Le Pen’s strategy is working. Since winning the leadership of the National Front in 2011, she has succeeded in bringing the party into the mainstream. Current opinion polls have Le Pen as one of the frontrunners for president ahead of elections to be held this spring, and her position has grown stronger as her chief rival has been embroiled in a corruption scandal. And one sign of her ability to broaden her base is that some opinion polls hint at rising support among LGBT voters. The race is the next key test of the nationalist wave that led the UK to leave the EU and to the election of Donald Trump in the US. Some on the right have predicted — and some progressive LGBT activists are worried — that LGBT voters could help put politicians like Le Pen into office because they increasingly fear Muslim immigrants. Left-wing parties have been responsible for nearly every LGBT rights advance on the continent, and if their supporters were to defect to nationalist parties it would suggest the political crisis in the continent is even deeper than many on the left have feared. This strategy hasn’t been easy for Le Pen to pull off, however. If she pushes too hard, she risks a revolt from a strong social conservative faction within her party’s traditional base. So she mentions LGBT people rarely and formally supports repeal of the 2013 marriage equality law. But she has welcomed a number of gay men — and all of them are men — into her inner circle, including her chief lieutenant, National Front Vice President Florian Philippot. The National Front now has more high-ranking gay figures than any major party in France, including the Socialists, the center-left party that passed a marriage equality law in 2013. Opinion polls show LGBT voters still disproportionately support the Socialists and other left-wing parties. But many feel the Socialists badly mishandled the marriage equality debate, even though they got the legislation passed. They believe the party’s failure to make a strong moral case for the law gave an opening to social conservatives, who have become an organized force in French politics for the first time. Disappointment with the Socialists has made LGBT votes up for grabs, some LGBT activists say. They have also detected growing xenophobia — especially in their conversations with gay men — over the past few years, which could make them ripe for the picking. “What’s happening in bars, especially when people have a couple drinks, when they are among friends, you can hear that they’re not afraid to voice opinions that for a long time were repressed within the gay community,” said Didier Lestrade, founder of Act Up France and author of the book Why Gays Turned Right. (Activists who spoke to BuzzFeed News say they have not detected this shift among lesbians, which some attribute to a deeper commitment to the left based on support for reproductive rights.) The National Front’s platform calls for repeal of marriage equality, but the party’s leaders claim marriage is no longer a concern for gay people. Instead, National Front leaders say, LGBT people are far more worried about being attacked by Muslims on the street. “I believe that French people feel threatened; I believe that about gay people as well,” said Sébastian Chenu. The founder of a gay rights group inside France’s major center-right party — now known as the Republican Party — Chenu made headlines when he joined the National Front in 2014 and now heads the party’s committee for the entire north of France. Marriage equality “is not a central issue anymore,” he said, but there is a real threat that France could become “less free.” And “when society becomes less free, when one is gay, one has very much to lose.” There’s still a lot standing in the way of LGBT voters actually voting for Marine Le Pen in large numbers. But her anti-immigrant, anti-EU position — coupled with a more center-left economic policy that supports France’s robust social safety net — is pulling voters from left-wing constituencies to her side. Courting LGBT voters remains a high-wire act, because beneath Le Pen’s march to victory is a simmering internal battle that could build into a true revolt from within. If she does pull it off and win the presidency, Marine Le Pen would upend not just French politics, but potentially the politics of all of Western Europe. A victory could offer a radical new template for nationalist parties and demonstrate that even the most reliable of left-wing voters may be up for grabs. At the end of last year, a 20-year-old college student named Guillaume Laroze found himself making national news as a casualty of the National Front’s civil war over homosexuality. Laroze is a student at the prestigious Panthéon-Assas University in Paris and represents exactly the kind of new voter the National Front needs to attract if it wants to expand beyond its traditional base among less educated, working-class voters concentrated in the country’s southern and eastern regions. In 2012, Laroze had supported François Hollande of the center-left Socialist Party, but, like many leftists, became bitterly disappointed with Hollande’s presidency; Hollande’s approval rating fell to 4% during his last year in office. Laroze's personal and political story says a lot about the complex nature of modern French politics, in which the old divisions of right and left no longer suffice. Laroze is gay and says he was attacked by a group of people he believed were immigrants. It happened in a train station in Paris in September 2016, Laroze said, although he believes it was a mugging, not a hate crime. But his experience resonated with Le Pen’s anti-immigrant message. “I was assaulted by three ‘opportunities for France,'” he remembered posting on social media after the incident. The phrase had become a sarcastic term used in nationalist circles ever since a Socialist leader described Muslims as “opportunities for France” in a 2014 speech. National Front supporters regard “opportunity” as a kind of do-gooder euphemism for people they believe are in fact a problem for France. (Laroze has since deleted the post because he came to believe it was racist.) Even before the attack, Laroze had immersed himself in the Marianne Collective, a National Front discussion group that started out on a couple of college campuses in Paris and was in the process of building itself into a national student union. He was initially drawn to Le Pen’s opposition to the EU, which he believed served the interests of large corporations. Laroze quickly rose to become the group’s number two, charged with forging relationships with new college campuses, and was being encouraged to run for parliament. Although there is a powerful social conservative wing of the party, he wasn’t worried, because he was assured they were in the minority. The people Laroze knew who were close to Florian Philippot, the party’s highest-ranking gay leader, told him: “Don’t worry, there are two factions and that [social conservative] one is minor,” Laroze said. But as he got to know the party firsthand, Laroze said, he realized “that this [conservative] faction is dominant within the activist base.” Philippot himself didn’t come out voluntarily, but rather was outed when a gossip magazine published photos of him with his partner. To the surprise of some, Philippot didn’t use that as an opportunity to make a direct appeal for gay support, quipping, “No, the National Front is not gay-friendly ... It's just French-friendly.” But the fact that he remained one of the party’s most powerful members sent a signal that there was a certain tolerance for gay people within the party. The National Front has always been something of a family business, and the social conservative faction’s brightest star is Marine Le Pen’s 27-year-old niece, Marion Maréchal-Le Pen. Many see her as someone who could potentially become a major rival to Marine’s leadership of the party if the push to modernize the party doesn't win the presidency. Marion holds one of the two seats in parliament that are controlled by the National Front, and she was elected from Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur, the same region in southern France once held by Jean-Marie Le Pen. She has built her national brand by courting social conservatives. While Marine Le Pen was conspicuously absent from the massive street protests against the marriage equality law passed in 2013, Marion Maréchal-Le Pen became one of their most vocal supporters. Laroze stepped into the crosshairs of Marion’s supporters with a cartoon he posted on social media criticizing a rally last fall calling for repealing the same-sex marriage law. Marion was a speaker at the rally, and it was organized by the first-ever socially conservative organization in France to become a major force in national politics. The group is called La Manif Pour Tous, or “Protest for All,” a play on the French term for marriage equality, “le mariage pour tous” — marriage for all. Laroze immediately became an online scapegoat for those angry about gay leaders in the party. “The ominous [Florian] Philippot has turned the [National Front] into a pederastic brothel,” one user tweeted. “Another minion,” tweeted someone else, using a term with a connotation like “fairy” that Philippot’s opponents have used as an epithet against a supposed “gay lobby” they contend he has built around him. These anonymous attacks might have been easy to shrug off, Laroze said, but he was getting more serious heat inside the party behind the scenes. Laroze said the president of the Marianne Collective student organization showed him a text message from Marion Maréchal-Le Pen informing him that Laroze was now unwelcome in her part of France. Another message denouncing him came from an even more extreme quarter — the former leader of a nativist group called Sovereignty, Identity, Liberty — a far-right group that had been pushed out of Marine Le Pen’s campaign effort. The Marianne Collective’s president, Daniel Auguste, said he does “not deny” receiving these messages in an interview with BuzzFeed News, but stressed he got no “pressure” to muzzle Laroze. By the end of November, Laroze said, he’d decided he’d had enough. He announced his resignation from the Marianne Collective in a Facebook post. “I was called a ‘leftist Islamized infiltrator,’ an LGBT ‘parasite,’ ‘pederastic waste’ (or its lovely variant, ‘sodomite,’)” he wrote, saying he was told he should suck it up in the name of party unity when he complained. “If it is easy to be conservative and a supporter of La Manif Pour Tous inside the National Front, it is much less so to be in favour of marriage equality and to adopt a measured voice on certain issues.” Though Laroze was a junior party activist, his resignation touched off a firestorm, with outlets across France covering the story. In a text message Laroze shared with BuzzFeed News, Philippot summoned Laroze to party headquarters to try to talk him out of quitting, making the case that “societal issues are secondary” in a party working to rein in immigration and the European Union. But Laroze thought Philippot was blind to the power of the party’s conservative wing. “Marion Maréchal-Le Pen brings so many people together because she does talk about social issues,” Laroze said. Marine Le Pen, he said, is balancing on a “a tightrope.” (Philippot did not respond to interview requests from BuzzFeed News; Marion Maréchal-Le Pen declined an interview through a spokesperson who said she believes BuzzFeed is “too militant.”) But Marion Maréchal-Le Pen and her allies have not shied away from confrontation with Marine and Philippot over hot-button issues. In December, for example, Marion called for curtailing abortion coverage through the state health care system in a country where abortion rights are accepted as mainstream, pushing Marine to directly take a position in support of abortion coverage. Marine shut her down flat on this issue — curtailing abortion is “not part of my program,” she pronounced — but she could face an internal backlash if she wins the presidency and does not follow through on her pledge to repeal marriage equality. Marianne Collective President Daniel Auguste told BuzzFeed News that Guillaume Laroze was overreacting to the harassment and that he was not representative of gay National Front supporters. “Guillaume is not the only homosexual in the Front National … and so it follows that Guillaume’s departure is not the departure of the whole LGBT community,” Auguste said. “I receive insults every day ... and I don’t make a fuss about it. He wanted to have his 15 minutes of fame — that is his choice. He had absolutely no weight in this party."" The director of the National Front’s youth wing, Gaëtan Dussausaye, said Laroze’s mistake was that he “did not read the entirety of Marine Le Pen’s program” before joining the party. “It is true that within the National Front, we do have positions on societal issues: We are opposed to same-sex marriage, we are opposed to adoption for gay couples, we are opposed to medically assisted procreation, we are opposed to surrogate mothers. But we consider nonetheless that these issues are not a priority,” Dussausaye said. “I believe, unfortunately, that [Laroze] chose to place these issues on the foreground whereas the National Front places them in the background.” Marine Le Pen during the annual National Front rally in honor of Jeanne d'Arc, May 1, 2015. In December last year, Le Monde published a story with the headline, “The [National Front] captures the attention of a part of the gay electorate.” The article was based on a poll, conducted by the research institute Cevipof, which caused a round of stories suggesting there was an earthquake in gay politics. Some reported the study found nearly 40% of gays voted for the National Front in regional elections, a rate higher than straight voters, a statistic repeated by National Front politicians. But that was not actually what the researchers found. It is true that a small subset of gay voters — married gay men — said they voted for the National Front at a rate of 38.6%, but that bloc generally skews older and more conservative than the LGBT population as a whole, according to French public opinion researchers. It is remarkable that a party long known for its bigotry and that officially favors repeal of marriage equality could pick up this demographic, but a broader look at polling data suggests gay, lesbian, and bisexual voters still tend to support left-leaning parties at a rate higher than straight voters. (French pollsters do not routinely ask about gender identity, so data on transgender voters was not available.) As a whole, these voters appear to be moving to the National Front at the same rate as straight voters, casting doubt on the idea that queer people feel especially threatened by Muslim immigration. And the total amount of support remains relatively small, according to data provided to BuzzFeed News by the polling firm IFOP: Between March 2011 and November 2016, IFOP found that support for the National Front in its surveys had grown from 9% among both LGB and straight respondents to 16.5% among LGB and 14.5% among straight ones. (The poll had a sample of 1,620 LGB respondents out of a total sample of 15,379, so the difference between the two groups appears to be smaller than the margin of error.) In contrast, pollsters with the firm Ipsos told BuzzFeed News they found 52% of the gays and lesbians included in an exit poll during regional elections in December 2015 said they voted for left-wing parties, as opposed to 36% of straight people; around one-quarter of both gay and straight respondents reported voting for the National Front in that survey. There’s not much good data on what queer voters think about immigration, but a small sample of LGB people — 302 people — in a survey Ipsos conducted in 2016 gives a hint. They expressed concern about immigration, crime, and terrorism at rates that were essentially the same as straight respondents. Available hate crime data doesn’t suggest the growth of immigration has made LGBT people a greater target for attack. Hate crimes reported to a hotline run by the group SOS Homophobia reached an all-time high of 3,517 in 2013, the year the marriage equality proposal was debated, and fell to 1,318 in 2015, even as hundreds of thousands of immigrants have been granted new residence permits in that period. This data has its limitations — hotline reports can increase because its contact information is well-publicized, for example, rather than because incidents have increased — but calls into question the assertion that Muslim immigrants pose a special threat to LGBT people. Didier Lestrade, the Act Up founder, published Why Gays Turned Right in 2011, well before Le Pen’s new direction solidified or the first polls appeared showing gay support for the National Front growing. He said that regardless of the numbers, the prominence of the party has made it more socially acceptable — especially among gay men — to express anti-immigrant views. “People are not conflicted anymore to voice right-wing opinion,” Lestrade said. “It is the end of a taboo.” But LGBT people and others who have historically voted Socialist might be moving into Le Pen’s column not because they support her views on immigration, but because the other options seem even worse. Some LGBT activists angry about the handling of the marriage equality debate — and other issues that have made traditionally left-leaning voters lose faith in the Socialists — say they may not vote at all this year. The Socialist Party only chose its presidential nominee, Benoît Hamon, in a vote last Sunday so there is still time for the race to shift, but the party has a lot of work to do to win back support. Current polls show it coming as low as fourth place in the first round of voting. France votes for president in two rounds: There’s a first vote on April 23 in which 11 parties or more will have a candidate on the ballot. If no candidate gets more than 50% of the vote, the top two then face off in a second election scheduled for May 7. The candidate who entered the race with the best shot of beating Marine Le Pen is the Republicans' François Fillon. But his campaign has been shaken by allegations that he paid hundreds of thousands of euros of government funds to his wife for work she never did. Fillon is also seen as a die-hard ally of Catholic conservatives — overtly courting participants in La Manif Pour Tous protests against marriage equality — and has taken public positions to the right of Le Pen on economic questions like slashing unemployment benefits and raising the retirement age. The race is now in deep turmoil, with polls suggesting that neither of the two parties that have dominated modern French politics might make it into the second round of voting. The disarray in the Republican and Socialist parties has meant an independent candidate who supports marriage equality, former economy minister Emmanuel Macron, is emerging as a serious contender. But Le Pen still leads the polls for the first round of voting, and has a chance to consolidate LGBT support later in the election cycle simply by emerging as the lesser of two evils were it to end with a runoff against the Republican candidate. The National Front hasn’t tried especially hard to directly recruit LGBT voters. Even Sébastien Chenu, who started an organization called GayLib to promote LGBT issues inside the party of former President Nicolas Sarkozy before joining the National Front in 2014, told BuzzFeed News that he is not a “gay activist” and does not “recognize a gay community.” “Here in France … we do not recognize different communities,” Chenu said. Less than 5% of French people usually identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual in public opinion surveys, according to François Kraus of the polling firm IFOP. So even if the National Front manages to win a chunk of it, it’s not a huge pool of votes. But it could still be enough to make the difference if the vote is close. A victory for Le Pen would not only mean a president who wants to weaken the EU at the helm of one of the continent’s most powerful countries as the union sets a new course without the UK. It could also provide a template for nationalist parties in other Western European countries. Such parties generally have much deeper ties to the religious right than France’s National Front, but this could nudge a realignment as they seek to expand their base. The Netherlands, the first country in the world to establish marriage equality, holds elections in March, and its nationalist Party for Freedom has long tried to court LGBT support for its anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim platform. Germany is due for elections in late summer, and although the nationalist Alternatives for Germany party is also anti-LGBT — a regional lawmaker made headlines in June by suggesting gay people should be jailed — it is experimenting with appeals to LGBT voters, such as posting signs in Berlin with the slogan ""My partner and I don't have any use for getting to know Muslim immigrants; to them our love is a mortal sin."" This strategy doesn’t seem to have gained many LGBT votes for Donald Trump in the United States. He made a play for LGBT support by declaring after the mass shooting in June at a gay nightclub in Orlando, “I will fight for you while Hillary [Clinton] brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs,"" but he performed worse than any Republican candidate in the last 24 years among LGBT voters in the US presidential election, winning just 14% of their votes, according to exit polls. But the immigration backlash has made European politics so volatile that this strategy could work better for nationalist leaders, especially those who seem less beholden to their countries’ religious right than Trump. “I know that people are worried,” said Boris Dittrich, who authored the world’s first marriage equality law while a member of the Dutch parliament. He is now based in Berlin and serves as advocacy director of Human Rights Watch’s LGBT rights program. “In many European countries, left-wing parties ... in terms of immigration didn’t really address the worries and the fears of their voters, and their voters left them,” Dittrich said. “I would argue those voters are lost to the left unless those parties change their way of looking at immigration.” Le Pen is betting that this formula will make her president of France. Some activists are skeptical that LGBT people will give her their votes, but they believe there is a real possibility. “There’s a real risk, but I think it’s small,” said Gwen Fauchois, a longtime activist on HIV issues and LGBT rights in Paris. “Gays don’t vote only on gay questions, but if they’re in a stage of hesitation [about how to vote], it may sway them one way or another. In the present case, it can definitely sway them to Marine Le Pen’s side.” Contact J. Lester Feder at lester.feder@buzzfeed.com. Got a confidential tip? Submit it here.

Even as police calls were rising at the airport, Broward County slashed more than two dozen jobs and ordered many of the deputies to move from the terminals to direct traffic along the curbs rather than guard the public areas inside, records and interviews show. By the time Santiago stepped off his Delta Airlines flight Jan. 6, retrieved his 9 mm Walther handgun from his bag and opened fire on travelers, there were no armed deputies in the lower level of the terminal during the worst airport attack in U.S. history. ""There should have been (deputies) in that terminal,"" said Anthony Roman, an airport security expert who conducts risk management investigations. ""Their primary mission was to protect the airport. Clearly, things went wrong."" As law enforcement investigators turn up details about the 26-year-old Iraq War veteran, local and federal authorities are examining protection at the airport and whether it was staffed adequately at the time of the rampage, which led to a shutdown the airport and stranded thousands of travelers. Sheriff Scott Israel declined to answer specific questions about safeguards during the attack, but he said the airport was properly policed and the shooter was arrested within a minute and 20 seconds of opening fire -- a timely response, he said. “It was seamless,” Israel said. “I’ve never seen such cohesion” among law enforcement agents. However, experts say that as traffic at the airport grew dramatically in recent years — with millions of more passengers since 2014 — Broward County never kept up with the growth by hiring more deputies, leaving large areas unprotected, including the baggage area where Santiago embarked on his mass shooting. In fact, the county cut at least six sworn deputies and nearly two dozen traffic enforcement officers since 2009, despite the opening of a new runway two years ago that drew scores of new flights. The Broward County aviation department, which runs the airport and pays the sheriff for security, did not respond to questions about staffing. The cuts took place while airports around the world were under increased attack, including a bloody rampage in Los Angeles International Airport in 2013 that led to the shooting of a federal security worker and the wounding of two others, prompting sweeping recommendations for other airports to improve safety. Yet, Fort Lauderdale airport managers and sheriff's commanders never responded by beefing up patrols in the sprawling hub, now among the fastest-growing in the country. “The lines (in the terminals) are getting so long it's scary,"" said Jeff Bell, president of the union that represents deputies, who is planning to ask the sheriff to increase deputies in the terminals. Bell said the drop in law enforcement presence has forced deputies to patrol far greater areas with fewer people.  Just in the last year, they have been called to investigate hundreds of more incidents — including unruly passengers, car thefts and accidents throughout the 18,000-acre airport grounds. In addition, more than a dozen community service aides were cut from the budget, forcing the deputies to take over traffic duties that had been previously carried out by aides. ""You’re asking people to do more and more with less and less,"" Bell said.  “When you come into the entrance, you can't see a police car. Just put some cars out there and turn on the lights.” Israel, a former Fort Lauderdale police captain who was elected sheriff in 2012, said he has not seen the staffing data and was unaware that positions at the airport had been reduced over the years, including the loss of 14 jobs during his tenure. As police calls doubled over the past decade, the number of positions at the airport were cut to 116 jobs — a drop of 23%, records show. During a meeting Tuesday at the sheriff’s headquarters to discuss security in the four terminals, Israel said his agency is reviewing its response to the attack in Terminal 2 and the pandemonium that followed. ""If we need more deputies, I will ask for them,” Israel said. The debate over security has spawned greater attention to public areas of airports across the country, including the baggage claim areas, where guard duties are largely left to the city and county law enforcement agencies at most facilities. Passenger checkpoints and airplanes are under the watch of federal agencies such as the Transportation Security Administration. But the vast public areas, including check-in counters and curbsides, are guarded by local law enforcement officers. Sheriff Israel said it could be weeks before his agency completes its study to pinpoint possible breakdowns at the hub, which hosts more than 26 million passengers a year. He defended his deputies' actions, saying they were able to stop Santiago within 76 seconds of the attack. But even that claim has drawn skepticism from some airport security experts who questioned why no guards were posted in the lower level and whether a police presence could have made a critical difference in the response time. “We’re talking precious seconds,” Roman said. “Seventy to 80 seconds gives an active shooter time to fire off 30-40-50 rounds.” After exiting a restroom, Santiago was able to fire his 9mm handgun — 10 to 15 rounds — before he ran out of ammunition. By the time the first deputy approached him, he had thrown down his gun, dropped to the floor and surrendered. USA TODAY What we know about Fort Lauderdale airport shooting suspect Esteban Santiago Roman said that if one armed deputy had been in the immediate area at the outset, it could have created at least one obstacle for the shooter. ""It allows passengers more precious seconds to escape. We're talking seconds in these scenarios."" Jeffrey Price, a published researcher on airport security who teaches at Metropolitan State University in Denver, defended the deputies at the airport. “They engaged him very quickly,” Price said. But he also said the presence of armed guards in the baggage claim area might have deterred the gunman from opening fire in the area, where dozens of people were gathered close to one another. “Most people don’t want to engage someone who is armed and ready to shoot,” said Price, who has written two textbooks on airport safety. The Sheriff’s Office turned down USA TODAY Network’s request to review any security studies that might have been conducted at the airport in recent years. The Sheriff’s Office said that information is exempt from state open records law because it covers safety matters. Tensions arose two years ago when deputies were forced to take over most of the traffic detail just before the new runway opened, putting officers out in the roadways — and out of the terminals — for much of their shifts, said Jeff Marano, president of the Broward County Police Benevolent Association. “It was horrendous,” said Marano, whose unit then represented the deputies. “In those lower levels, you’re breathing in fumes. The heat. They’re carrying 30 pounds on their belts.” Despite a 10% increase in calls for police services since the new runway opened, the Sheriff’s Office has not requested more deputies, according to its past two proposed budgets, leaving the staffing at 116 positions, its lowest level in at least a decade. ""They peeled back the personnel,” said Jeff Bell, the union president who now represents most of the deputies. He said the staffing has been so low in recent years, “You can go out there and won’t see a patrol car.” To boost security, the sheriff would have to staff about a dozen officers for every shift — three in each terminal — and hire others to patrol the grounds, Bell said. He said the staffing should be closer to what it was a decade ago: 150. “After 9/11, you could not walk 10 feet without seeing an armed, uniformed deputy,” Bell said. Price, who advises airports on security breakdowns, said the shooting in Fort Lauderdale was drastic enough to raise issues that had rarely been discussed, including the questions over staffing. Until now, the Transportation Security Administration has never required police to place a specific number of people in the terminals, but reviews the security programs created by local police to ensure that they can respond to trouble at the checkpoints. “I’m hoping this could be a tipping point,” he said. Unlike attacks in public places such as shopping malls, shootings in air facilities are strikingly different, he said. As after the tragedy in Fort Lauderdale, airports can be shut down immediately and flights diverted to other airports. “When  you shoot up an airport, you’ve disrupted the the entire aviation system of the country,” he said.

Raffi Freedman-Gurspan was tapped by President Barack Obama to become the White House’s LGBT liaison in March 2016, making her the first-ever openly transgender person to fill the position. It was actually the 29-year-old public policy expert’s second, history-making appointment ― in August 2015, she was hired by Obama to serve as Outreach and Recruitment Director in the Presidential Personnel Office, making her the first openly trans White House staffer ever. (Watch a news report on her initial appointment above.) Freedman-Gurspan turned out to be a pivotal figure early in her tenure, following the June 12, 2016 massacre at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub. In the days following the mass shooting, Freedman-Gurspan connected with victims’ families as well as Florida-based advocacy groups on the ground. Now, though, she told BuzzFeed, she’s concerned her role will essentially be eliminated once Trump is sworn into office Jan. 20, given that she’s had no contact with the president-elect’s transition team. If that happens, the White House stands to “lose touch, ultimately, with what is going on out there. We lose that ability to inform our president about our community and our needs,” she told BuzzFeed’s Dominic Holden. “There is no one inside the hallways to advocate for the community, so we lose an internal advocate.” Given that Trump’s victory cast a shadow on the future of queer rights, the LGBT liaison role could, in theory, be a critical one. If the position is scrapped, Freedman-Gurspan fears that the incoming president’s approach to LGBTQ issues would mirror that of the Reagan administration, whose lack of response to the HIV/AIDS crisis in the mid-1980s has since been deemed catastrophic. “It actually gives me a little bit of chills thinking about not having a potential person here, if, God forbid, we have another outbreak of, say HIV or AIDS or something like that,” she said. “If we don’t have a particular individual here in this building who has an immense amount of influence and power and impact [within the LGBTQ community] — that’s a loss.” Read the full BuzzFeed interview with Freedman-Gurspan here.

                    Joshua Barajas Leave your feedback FBI said Friday there were several pieces of evidence that prompted the agency to officially investigate the San Bernardino, California, mass shooting as an “act of terrorism.” The shooters crushed their cell phones and attempted to destroy their digital fingerprints, said David Bowdich, assistant director of the FBI’s Los Angeles division, adding that authorities continue to investigate “these horrific acts.” PBS NewsHour will live stream updates from San Bernardino today. One of the two shooters accused of fatally shooting 14 people at a holiday party San Bernardino, California, on Wednesday posted online messages that pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group, a U.S. law enforcement offical told the Associated Press. READ MORE: Everything we know about the San Bernardino shooting Tashfeen Malik, 27, used an alias on Facebook to show support for the extremist group’s leader, but deleted the message before Wednesday’s attack. A separate anonymous U.S. official told the AP that it appeared there was no indication that ISIS made contact with her. More specific details of Malik’s appeals to ISIS were not immediately given. Although officials, including President Barack Obama, have shied away from labeling the San Bernardino mass shooting a terrorist attack, these developments are the first significant details to understanding why Malik and her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, allegedly opened fire in a room of his county co-workers at the Inland Regional Center. Following the aftermath of the shooting, San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan told reporters there was “some degree of planning.” Not long after, police found a dozen pipe bombs, more than 4,500 rounds of ammunition and hundreds of bomb-making tools in the garage of a California home rented by the couple. Weapons confiscated from last Wednesday’s attack in San Bernardino, California, are shown in this San Bernardino County Sheriff Department handout photo from their Twitter account released to Reuters on Dec. 3, 2015. Photo provided by San Bernardino County Sheriffs Department/Handout Farook, who had no criminal record, was born in Illinois and raised in Southern California. He worked for the county’s health department for five years as an environmental inspector. Bowdich said Malik, a Pakistani, entered the U.S. on a fiancee visa in 2014. They would later marry and have a daughter, who is now 6 months old, who they dropped off with Farook’s mother on the morning of the attack. Police also detonated three bombs that were attached to a remote control car that didn’t set off. Police found the device in a bag at the scene. Authorities said they had assault rifles and semi-automatic handguns, and were dressed in “assault-style clothing” when they entered the center. The suspects fired between 65 and 75 rounds and fled in a dark-colored SUV. A car chase ensued that ended when the suspects exchanging gunfire with police. Farook and Malik were killed, and two officers sustained non-life-threatening injuries during the confrontation. PBS NewsHour will live stream updates in our live stream player above.

          / CBS/AP ORLANDO, Fla. -- The widow of the gunman who carried out a deadly shooting at a Florida gay nightclub before he was killed has filed a petition in a California court to change the name of their son. An online docket from Contra Costa County, California, shows that Omar Mateen’s wife, Noor Salman, filed the petition on Wednesday on behalf of the 4-year-old boy, who is partly named for his father. A hearing is scheduled for February. No other details are provided in the online docket. Contra Costa County is in the San Francisco metro area.  Salman moved there from Florida after her husband was killed in a shootout with SWAT team members during the June 12 massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. Forty-nine patrons were killed. Mateen pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) during a three-hour standoff. The fence around Pulse opened early Monday for an intimate ceremony marking six months since the mass shooting, CBS Orlando affiliate WKMG-TV reported. Survivors, staff and family members of victims killed during the massacre held a moment of silence at 2:02 a.m., the exact time gunman Mateen started shooting. The early-morning memorial at Pulse wasn’t open to the public -- only to those with a direct connection to the shooting.

870867057,2017-01-10 17:47:02,Domestic Violence Allegations Were A Missed Red Flag Before Florida Mass Shooting,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-mass-shooting-domestic-violence_us_58753271e4b043ad97e62de1,en,False,,623375,Huffington Post - United States,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/?country=US,"Senior Reporter, HuffPost In the year before Esteban Santiago allegedly opened fire on unsuspecting travelers at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on Friday, killing five and injuring six others, he had at least five run-ins with police in Anchorage, Alaska. Many involved allegations of domestic violence, including two reports of strangulation that don’t appear to have been taken seriously. In January 2016, Santiago was arrested after his girlfriend told Anchorage police he attacked her while she was in the bathroom. He broke the door, forced his way in and began to strangle her, she said. “She stated that he continued to yell at her to ‘get the fuck out bitch’ while strangling her and smacking her in the side of the head,” the responding police officer wrote. Strangling his girlfriend ― impeding her ability to breathe ― shows a capacity to kill, experts say. Years of research has established that the act of strangulation is an important predictor of future lethal violence: If a woman has been choked by an intimate partner, she is seven times more likely to become a homicide victim in the future. Strangulation, defined as cutting off air supply or blood circulation by applying pressure to the neck, can lead to neurological damage within seconds and death in under five minutes. Despite its danger, strangulation often leaves no visible injuries, making it particularly difficult to prosecute. Because of that, experts say, the offense has historically been treated as minor, akin to a slap or a punch. But over the past 10 years, most states, including Alaska, have passed laws to treat strangulation as a serious, felony-level offense ― even in cases where there are no observable injuries. That didn’t happen to Santiago. He was charged with criminal mischief for damaging the bathroom door, and fourth-degree assault ― both misdemeanors ― and ordered to stay away from his girlfriend. A month later, he was rearrested for violating the conditions of the no-contact order when cops spotted him with his girlfriend. Prosecutors gave him a second chance. In March, they offered to drop the domestic violence charges if he attended anger-management classes and stayed out of trouble for a year ― a process called deferred prosecution. Experts contacted by The Huffington Post questioned the decision to defer prosecution in a case involving strangulation, and said Santiago’s history of domestic violence allegations should have been a red flag that he was a potential danger to others. “I don’t believe any case involving strangulation should be deferred, ever,” said Gael Strack, a former domestic violence prosecutor and one of the country’s leading experts on strangulation. “We now know that strangulation involves a high level of violence and lethal violence. Much like when someone points a gun or holds a knife to a victim’s neck ― those cases also don’t have visible injury, but they are life-threatening acts of violence.” Casey Gwinn, who headed the prosecutor’s office in San Diego, California, and now runs trainings across the country on strangulation with Strack, noted that if Santiago had been convicted of a misdemeanor domestic violence offense, he would have been barred under federal law from owning or purchasing firearms. “The handling of this case has all the earmarks of poorly investigating a strangulation case and minimizing its significance at every turn,” Gwinn said. “Where was the follow-up investigation? Where was the forensic exam?” Gwinn added that Alaska has a manual on how to investigate and prosecute strangulation cases. “There is no indication that the prosecutors followed any of the best practices guidance of their manual,” he said. It’s unclear if Santiago attended anger-management classes, as he was required to do. Police responded to his residence on three occasions for “physical disturbances” from March to October, according to Anchorage Police Chief Chris Tolley, including for a second allegation of strangulation. Police wouldn’t release details on those disturbance calls. In a press conference on Sunday, Tolley said there was no probable cause for an arrest in any of the three calls. Anchorage municipal prosecutor Seneca Theno told The Huffington Post her office takes allegations of strangulation very seriously, but a successful prosecution requires evidence. Theno said that in her experience, it was rare for a strangulation to occur without injuries. “Usually, you are going to see something,” she said. “Those things tend to be observable and would serve as corroboration of the report.” The handling of Santiago’s domestic violence case raises questions, experts say. “Why was this even a deferred prosecution? Why did they charge it as the lesser crime?” said Dawn Dalton, executive director of the Domestic Violence Legal Empowerment and Appeals Project. “When you look at the escalation of violence in the research that has been done, strangulation is one of the final acts before homicide takes place in intimate-partner relationships.” Dalton said she was especially concerned about the decision to offer deferred prosecution after Santiago broke the no-contact order barring him from seeing his girlfriend, and wondered why authorities didn’t regard the domestic disturbances in October as violations of the deferred-prosecution conditions. “To me, that is a system failure,” Dalton said. Santiago’s alleged history of domestic violence adds him to the long list of suspected mass shooters who physically assaulted those close to them before going on to attack the public. As The Huffington Post has previously reported: This story is tragically familiar. In the past few years, many of the men who have committed heinous, unthinkable acts of violence against the public have had a history of abusing the women in their lives. Prior to unleashing their deranged violence onto the world, they practiced it against the most vulnerable and accessible targets ― those living inside their homes. Micah Johnson. Omar Mateen. Robert Dear. Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Cedric Ford. Man Haron Monis. And others. Domestic violence and mass shootings are intricately linked in the United States. Many mass shootings actually target intimate partners or family members, though those incidents rarely make the news. According to data collected by Everytown for Gun Safety, of the 16 mass shooting incidents in 2016, seven ― 43 percent ― involved a male shooter targeting a family member or intimate partner. In those shootings, women and children made up 81 percent of the victims. “As a practical policy matter, society needs to recognize that by intervening in family violence, we are protecting the larger society as well,” said Joan Meier, a law professor at George Washington University. “The same people who attack members of their family are people who attack total strangers.” This article has been updated to include a comment from the Anchorage municipal prosecutor. ______ Melissa Jeltsen covers domestic violence and other issues related to women’s health, safety and security.

Women's rights groups and feminists joined hands with known Islamists, in the hope that they'd deter the man in the White House from touching women's rights; he went ahead and pulled funding from NGOs providing reproductive health services in other countries. People carried placards with ""refugees welcome"" and ""no more walls"" messages; he placed the first symbolic brick on that wall with Mexico and put curbs on immigration and entry of refugees from some seven Muslim majority countries - out of the 50 in this world. Net result from these protests apart from lots of opportunities for social media posts and smiling selfies; zero! Had they waited for him to start delivering on his promises, and had then taken up specific issues to protest against, in a similarly coordinated manner, there is a tiny chance Trump's advisors might have paid more notice to them and would've given it some more thought the next time he'd be preparing to sign an Executive Order. Regrettably, the allegedly spontaneous protests couldn't achieve their objectives other than pumping up the ego of a man who thrives on controversy and rubbing people the wrong way. Till now, his policies have been evidently ill-conceived and poorly executed, nevertheless they are pledges he made during his campaign and is fulfilling those promises. The latest blow to his opponents and critics has come in the form of Trump picking up a list of countries that his predecessor had compiled and acting on it in the form of increased restrictions of their citizens travelling to the USA. During the same week, an otherwise seemingly harmless white terrorist opened fire on a mosque in Canada killing six Muslims. Justin Trudeau and the rest of the left leaning western society were appalled at this mass shooting just as they were at Trump's actions during his first few days in office listed above. Neither what Trump's enacted policies are surprising, given that he's been saying he'd do all that for the past couple of years, nor is the opposition to his actions unanticipated, by the very people who said they'd oppose him no matter what. What requires a moment of introspection or perhaps longer, is the fact that what most people are protesting against, has been a norm in front of their eyes, if not in their own backyards, then certainly around  the world. Take for example the mosque shooting in Canada. There have been hard-line Islamist preachers from Canada who have been travelling to other nations to promote similar attacks on the houses of worship of minority groups there. Apart from a few groups who tried to bring this fact to the authorities' attention, there was no uproar in the social circles of the largely peaceful and welcoming country. Shia mosques and Sufi Shrines get attacked regularly across the Muslim world, by other Muslims.  Whilst they burn the vast majority of Sunni Muslims don't even bother to take a brief pause to feel sorrowful. After all the victims are considered apostates at best or deviant sinners at the least by many. The left embraced the American Flag hijabs as a symbol of female empowerment dished out by very Islamists who indoctrinate young girls as little as 3-4 into believing the sight of their hair might incite lust in older men and boys their ages alike thereby enforcing the garb upon their heads and minds, sexualising them. The same Muslim leaders who led pro-choice anti-Trump protests alongside feminists, proudly act as champions of Sharia Law and hold celebrity status within extremist groups opposed to abortion rights. These Islamist leaders took this opportunity to bolster their credentials within the emerging Islamist-Left Alliance who act as apologists for the regressive Neanderthal  laws of Saudi Arabia and have never spoken out against the inherent racism within the Middle East, whilst complaining about racism in USA because of populism promoted by Trump. Had it not atleast ticked an fairness box if the protestors had also been vocal against the proposed border wall between Mexico and Guatemala, or the restrictions placed by Muslim nations on prospective visitors with even an airport stamp suggesting they'd ever been to Israel? Trump will certainly face difficulties imposing enhanced security upon Muslim travellers from any given countries for the simple reason that unless their attire or names would give it away, or they admit to it themselves, determining one's faith is a rather difficult feat to accomplish. However in the case of some Muslim countries their discriminatory laws that force people to accept that their version of Islam is not acceptable to the state, and whose passports carry a ""religion"" section, it would be exceedingly easy for US immigration officials to allow the non-Muslims to pass through without much of a hassle. Genuine Syrian and Iraqi refugees will bear the brunt of the new administration's policies barring them entry into far away USA for a period of 90 days, esp when they're not even allowed into neighbouring rich Arab states. Iraqis suffered the same treatment in 2011 under Obama, however tactfully it was implemented, painful it still was. Atleast Trump's not barred Rohingya Muslims from entering, knowing there's no chance in their lifetimes these most deserving people could ever even contemplate reaching the US shores. How can they, when their co-religionists wouldn't turn their attention away from the Middle Eastern politics and the plight of self-professed superior Muslims in the divinely-promised yet massively disputed piece of real estate and surrounding nations to even consider the ongoing genocide of the Burmese lesser Muslims as remotely important? Across the pond from the land of dreams, in the UK, a petition has been doing the rounds, with over 1.7 million people having signed a petition (from around the world to be correct) to ban Trump from getting invited to a state visit. The same was honour bestowed upon the Chinese premier and the King of Saudi Arabia, both carrying beacons of human rights and democracy when they arrived, yet didn't attract a fraction of the protests that people are joining in anticipation of the President's tea with HM the Queen. In the light of the above, it would be better for the protesters, both Muslims and non-Muslims, Americans, Hispanics and Asians alike, to indulge in a bit of serious introspection to examine for themselves where they loose out on retaining moral high-ground. Where exactly, as a result of them applying double standards on issues like freedom, equality, human rights and dignity, do their slogans begin to appear hollow. Perhaps the next round of protests would be seen as meaningful when those participating would have pledged to themselves, not never allow any form of discrimination and abuse to go unchallenged, within their own communities or elsewhere, both domestic and foreign, coming from the White House or the House of Saud.

After Sunday’s mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, Donald Trump was quick to respond. He delivered a speech on Monday intended to address what he called “the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders.” The Republican Party’s presumptive presidential nominee reminded the world of his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country. He promised to “protect and defend all Americans who live inside our borders.” Counterterrorism experts warn that politicians should not exaggerate the threat of terrorism or create unrealistic expectations about what they can do to keep the country safe. Yet in his speech, Trump dramatized the danger facing the United States and made promises that would be difficult for any president to keep—a reaction that could make it more difficult for the U.S. to respond effectively to the threat of terror. Exaggerating the risk of terrorism can lead to public demand for a disproportionate response to an attack. During his speech, Trump suggested terrorism poses an existential threat to the U.S., even though terrorist attacks in the U.S. remain relatively rare. Trump called the Orlando shooting “a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation,” adding, “if we don’t get tough, and we don’t get smart—and fast—we’re not going to have a country anymore—there will be nothing left.” At best, exaggerating the threat of terrorism “means we lose perspective,” said John Horgan, a professor who studies the psychology of terrorism at Georgia State University. “We need to be able to talk about these threats in an informed way. And if we don’t, we will end up with counterterrorism policy grounded in emotions instead of evidence.” As Micah Zenko, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote a few years ago, Americans are about as likely to die in a terrorist attack as they are to be fatally crushed by their own furniture. “This is not to diminish the real—albeit shrinking—threat of terrorism,” Zenko concluded. “For Americans, however, it should emphasize that an irrational fear of terrorism is both unwarranted and a poor basis for public-policy decisions.” If political leaders look for scapegoats or inaccurately assign blame for terrorist attacks, they can make it more difficult for the government to evaluate and respond to threats. As Trump described his plan for immigration restrictions on Monday, he suggested immigrants pose a grave threat to the U.S., in at least one instance without offering clear evidence. He promised to “suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe, or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats.” He added that “we cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer.” (A Trump spokesperson did not respond to a question about where this number came from.) “Trump already has a tendency to overstate, exaggerate, and sometimes say things that are simply wrong,” said Martha Crenshaw, a terrorism expert at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford. “In this case, the danger is that you stereotype a very large group of people as a danger to the security of the American homeland when it’s simply not true.” Crenshaw’s research indicates there have been roughly 220 jihadist perpetrators or would-be perpetrators of violent terrorism against the U.S. since 1993. Most of the plots were unsuccessful. “When you leap into this and assume you know exactly why somebody did something and then blame a certain set of beliefs or ideas such as a religion or associate a person’s actions with an entire community of people, that narrative can take on a life of its own,” Crenshaw said. “It can be very difficult to correct these initial assumptions and assertions, even when they are not correct.” Any claim that politicians can completely safeguard Americans from future terrorist attacks is unrealistic. In his speech, Trump made sweeping pledges to keep the country safe. He vowed to “protect and defend all Americans who live inside our borders” and “ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety,” promising outcomes no politician can guarantee. “Terrorism is first and foremost a strategy, and you can’t defeat a strategy. So there’s no question it’s always going to exist,” said Horgan of Georgia State. “We can work to undermine and delegitimize terrorism, and we can work to make sure we don’t heighten the risk, but to confront the risk effectively we have to also be realistic about what we are actually facing.” It is only natural for politicians to want to reassure a nation reeling from tragedy. Trump is not the only official offering comfort and promises to safeguard the country. On Monday, Hillary Clinton argued that “the barbarity we face from radical jihadists is profound” in her own speech. “The attack in Orlando makes it even more clear: We cannot contain this threat—we must defeat it.” There’s no perfect political response to terrorism. Cautious, evidence-based ideas do not necessarily satisfy the role most citizens expect their leaders to play in the wake of a terrorist attack. Americans look to their representatives to be reassured, often demanding punishment for injustice. Those expectations make it all the more difficult to for political leaders to exercise the kind of restraint counterterrorism experts advise. No politician wants to be accused of failing to take a terrorism threat seriously or appearing callous in the face of atrocity. President Obama has frequently been criticized on this count: His opponents portray him as unconcerned and prone to underestimating the danger posed by terrorism. But if politicians fuel fear and prejudice as they work to position themselves as capable leaders, or promise what they cannot deliver, their actions could end up making it harder for America to productively prepare for and respond to danger."

A Look At Hate Crimes After Quebec City Mosque Attack Leaves 6 Dead, 17 Injured",http://www.ibtimes.com/canada-anti-muslim-look-hate-crimes-after-quebec-city-mosque-attack-leaves-6-dead-17-2483501,en,False,,41550,IBTimes,http://www.ibtimes.com/,"Police have detained two suspected killers -- one is now considered a witness -- in Quebec City after Sunday’s Mosque attack that killed six people and left 17 wounded during evening prayers. Canadian Prime Minster Justin Trudeau and Quebec premier Phillippe Couillard called Sunday’s incident “terrorist attack on Muslims.” ""Six people are confirmed dead - they range in age from 35 to about 70,"" Quebec provincial police spokeswoman Christine Coulombe told reporters, adding that about 40 or so people were at the Québec City Islamic cultural center, also known as the Grande Mosquée de Québec, during the shooting. Authorities initially said Alexandre Bissonnette, who is of French-Canadian origin, and Mohamed El Khadir, who is of Moroccan origin, were arrested on suspicion after Sunday’s attack. But the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RMCP) took to Twitter Monday and tweeted that ""following the investigation, the second individual is now considered as a witness"" -- referring to El Khadir.  Police said early Monday they were confident no other suspects were involved in the attack. ""They consider this a lone wolf situation,"" a source said.  ""Why is this happening here? This is barbaric...we are sad for the families,"" Trudeau said in a statement following the shooting. “We condemn this terrorist attack on Muslims in a center of worship and refuge. “While authorities are still investigating and details continue to be confirmed, it is heart-wrenching to see such senseless violence. ""Diversity is our strength, and religious tolerance is a value that we, as Canadians, hold dear,"" he said. President Donald Trump apparently called Trudeau to express his condolences ""and offered to provide any assistance as needed,"" said Trudeau spokesman Cameron Ahmad, according to Reuters.   The shooting came on the weekend that Trudeau said Canada would welcome immigrants and refugees after Trump temporarily banned seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. on national security grounds. “There is nothing nice about searching for terrorists before they can enter our country. This was a big part of my campaign. Study the world,” Trump tweeted Monday. There have been other antagonistic acts against Muslims in Canada within the last year. In July, during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, a gift-wrapped pig's head was left at the front door of the Quebec City mosque that was attacked. In October, a group based in Quebec showed a banner at the province’s legislative assembly, which said in French: “Death to terrorists; Muslims out.” In November 2015, a mosque in Peterborough, Ontario, was set on fire. In 2013, police investigated after a mosque in the Saguenay region of Québec was smeared with what have been believed to be pig's blood.  Though it is still unclear whether Sunday was truly a terrorist attack, the Canadian Council of Imams said in a statement that ""Islamophobia has killed innocent Canadians."" ""We ask all decent people to stand against hatred of Islam and Muslims in any forum,"" the statement read. Couillard, who said the Muslim community was the target of Sunday's ""murderous attack,"" planned to increased security at mosques in Quebec City, the capital of Quebec, and Montreal, Quebec's most populated city.  ""We are with you. You are home,"" Couillard said. ""You are welcome in your home. We are all Quebecers. We must continue together to build an open welcoming and peaceful society."" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio also followed suit. He said police were providing additional protection for mosques in the city. ""All New Yorkers should be vigilant. If you see something, say something,"" he tweeted.   Sunday's attack is currently being investigated by the Integrated National Security Enforcement Team, Canadian security agencies including police forces and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, according to the Telegraph. So far, no charges have yet been filed against the alleged shooter. “The inquiry is ongoing to determine the motives,” said RCMP Supt. Martin Plante. “It is too early to determine what charges will be laid.” There were 63 anti-Muslim hate crimes reported in Canada in 2016, up from 59 in 2015, and 23 in 2014, according to the National Council of Canadian Muslims. A vigil in Quebec City will be held Monday night to honor the victims of the mass shooting."

The wife of Omar Mateen, the man who killed 49 people in a shooting rampage at an Orlando nightclub last June, was arrested Monday. Noor Salman, Mateen's wife, was arrested on a charge of obstructing justice and aiding and abetting by providing material support to a terrorist organization. Salman grew up in Rodeo, Calif. Her parents immigrated to the United States from the West Bank in 1985, according to The New York Times. Salman, 30, met Mateen online and they married on Sept. 29, 2011, the Associated Press reports. The couple has a son, who is now 4. Salman told the The New York Times in November that Mateen was abusive and used to beat her. How was she involved in the shooting? In interviews with federal investigators after the shooting, Salman allegedly acknowledged driving Mateen to the Pulse nightclub at least once before her husband launched the assault. She also accompanied her husband to Walmart to purchase ammunition.  But she told the Times she was unaware of his true intentions until he sent her a 4 a.m. text message the night of the shooting, asking whether she had seen what happened on the news. Did she know about the attack? Salman told officials in June that she feared her husband was plotting an attack and attempted to dissuade him from following through. Did Salman know her husband was becoming radicalized? Salman told the Times she knew her husband watched jihadist videos. She said she didn't believe he was radicalized because the FBI had investigated him previously but never charged him. In 2013, the FBI began investigating Mateen after the contract security guard told co-workers he had family connections to al-Qaeda and Hezbollah. From May 2013 through March 2014, authorities placed Mateen on a terrorist watch list. When the investigation ended without charges, authorities removed him. Where was she arrested? Salman was taken into custody in California, where she was living with family members. When will she appear in court? Salman will likely face her first court appearance Tuesday. The charges could indicate that authorities believe she knew more about the assault — the most deadly mass shooting in U.S. history — than she has previously admitted.

Then the election happened. And Kennedy changed his mind. ""Cryptography seemed a little frivolous in the current context,"" he said. Instead, Kennedy will teach a class called Truth. It will delve into a complex subject that has grown only more complex in recent months: the nature of truth, the role it plays in communication and why it is so easily malleable. President Donald Trump was his inspiration. Kennedy is clear: Manipulation of truth and facts is as old as politics itself. Democrats do it. Republicans do it. The Green Party does it. Those pot-loving, tax-hating Libertarians do it. But our newly inaugurated president has reinvented the genre. ""With Trump, it seems to be at a whole other level,"" Kennedy said. Here is a fact: Of 353 statements double-checked by the nonpartisan, Pulitzer Prize-winning PolitiFact website as of this writing, a mere 4 percent of Trump's claims have been judged to be ""true."" Four percent! A whopping 51 percent have been graded either ""false"" or so profoundly false as to be ridiculous and therefore ""pants on fire"" false. The lies have come and gone as needed. Because he lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million, he has repeatedly claimed that at least that many illegal votes were cast (without a wisp of evidence). However, until the election, it was going to be ""rigged."" Then, once he sneaked to victory, he dropped that suggestion. It no longer suited his needs. Trump's army of enablers has spent ample breath normalizing his fictions. The guilty parties range from former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski complaining that the media took Trump's words ""so literally,"" to Speaker of the House Paul Ryan saying a Trump fabrication ""doesn't matter to me; he won the election,"" to Trump strategist Kellyanne Conway's widely mocked idea of ""alternative facts."" The cynics have raised the white flag, declaring the birth of a ""post-truth society"" where facts no longer exist and reality is wholly up for interpretation: Climate change is a hoax (despite ample evidence to the contrary), President Barack Obama wasn't born in this country (and he's Muslim) and Trump's inauguration was fabulously, beautifully attended by millions of adoring patriots. Are facts dead? Not a chance, Kennedy said. The problem is that our basic tenets of communication — along with the shared beliefs and assumptions from which rational conversation springs — have been rotted to the core. All day and every day, we share information, much of it mundane: It is supposed to rain tomorrow. The Cubs were the best team in baseball last year. Half Acre makes good beer. That exchange of information comes with built-in requirements, at least in a civil society: A person sharing information believes what he or she is saying and has evidence to support it. ""If you accept as what I say as true, it changes your beliefs,"" Kennedy said. ""You know something new about the world. It's a pretty good system. Every time you learn something new, you eliminate uncertainty about the way things are."" But when a president can say something false much of the time he opens his mouth, and his supporters either believe what he says or choose not to care, we break down. Kennedy suggested that Trump is not a liar so much as a ""bullshitter"" — which, yes, is a technical term. Philosopher Harry Frankfurt's legendary essay ""On Bullshit"" suggests that the liar is acutely aware of his lies and tries to hide them; the ""bullshitter"" doesn't care about truth and only wants to manipulate an audience. ""(Trump) may not care whether (what he says) is true or false,"" Kennedy said. ""But he knows it can be addressed to a community that is willing to take what he says as being backed by evidence, and is willing to take him as though he is speaking truthfully."" Others have figured this out, which has led to the rise of so-called ""fake news,"" and the legitimacy that some people will bestow on even the most preposterous ideas, like a Democratic child sex ring in a Washington, D.C., pizza restaurant. Or that the horrific mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., was a fabrication. The left has its moments, too; no evidence exists of Trump actually telling People magazine (or any other magazine) in 1998, ""If I were to run, I'd run as a Republican. They're the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News."" Still, the quote has been shared extensively. Kennedy blames not just the messengers but the medium for our short-circuiting relationship with the truth: Social media and chat rooms have made it too easy to insulate ourselves in echo chambers of agreement. We sabotage our own critical thinking, willing to be satisfied with ""evidence"" that simply corroborates what we want to believe. When I argued that the people who believe and regurgitate misinformation lack a reasonable standard of critical thinking, he expressed sympathy. He sees them as victims. ""They're being told things that are crafted specifically to be presented as though the speaker is part of their common ground, and that fit in with the beliefs and evidence that they bring to the table,"" Kennedy said. ""This is a huge threat to our democracy, I'm afraid, which relies on an equal and open exchange of ideas."" The solution, he said, is three simple questions when faced with a highly charged ""fact"": Is there actual belief behind the sentiment? Is there convincing, objective evidence? What effect is someone trying to achieve by sharing this information? As Kennedy plans his Truth class for the spring quarter, he finds himself weighing the idea that Trump's supporters take him ""seriously but not literally"" — the idea that his specific sentiments are less important than the insulated, conservative worldview behind them. ""That's a bad way to have a conversation about policy issues that affect our nation, our future and our children's future,"" he said. The fallout is a world where the idea of facts is corrupted, even if facts themselves remain ever-present. Finding them just takes some work. jbnoel@chicagotribune.com Twitter @joshbnoel CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"

Orlando mass shooter Omar Mateen's wife arrested by FBI.,http://mic.com/articles/165594/who-is-noor-salman-orlando-mass-shooter-omar-mateen-s-wife-arrested-by-fbi,en,False,,109076,Mic,http://mic.com/," Noor Salman, the wife of mass shooter Omar Mateen, was arrested by the FBI Monday in connection with the 2016 Pulse nightclub massacre that left 49 people dead and 53 wounded in Orlando, Florida. She has been charged with ""aiding and abettingÂ by providing material support to a terrorist organization and obstruction of justice,"" according to a statement by Orlando Police Chief John Mina published in OrlandoÂ Weekly. Mateen was killed in a shoot-out with police after carrying out the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history at a gay nightclub in OrlandoÂ last June. Since then, authorities had been considering leveling charges against Salman, whom they suspected of lying about what she knew of her husband's planned attack, the New York Times reports. Salman, 30, is expected to appear in a San Francisco federal court Tuesday. Salman, a child of immigrants from the West Bank who grew up in Rodeo, California, met Mateen on a datingÂ website in 2011. In an interview with the New York Times, she saidÂ that he had physically and verbally abused her during their marriage. ""He had no remorse,"" she told the Times. She claimed that she did not know about Mateen's plans to commit mass murder and that she believed he was out with a friend on the night of the attack. The two reportedly exchanged text messages on the night of the massacre; she asked him where he was and attempted to call him. But investigators doubted her account, the Times reports. She had gone with Mateen to OrlandoÂ when he scouted the club, but she said she did not know the purpose of the visit. She also knew he bought ammunition in the days leading up to the attack, but said she did not know he had planned to use it in a mass shooting; he was a security guard who frequently purchased ammunition, according to the Times. Members of Mateen's familyÂ have defended Salman, saying she ""doesn't know anything"" with regard to the attack, and her lawyer has said that she bought Mateen a Father's Day card the day of the attack and expected him to return home that night, suggesting she was unaware of his plans. In his statement to OrlandoÂ Weekly, Chief Mina said he was ""glad to see"" Salman charged and thatÂ that ""some measure of justice will be served in this act of terror that has affected our community so deeply."" ""Nothing can erase the pain we all feel about the senseless and brutal murders of 49 of our neighbors, friends, family members and loved ones,"" Mina said in the statement. ""But today, there is some relief in knowing that someone will be held accountable for that horrific crime.""Â"

Last June, ex-Democrat Fairbanks flipped to the Trump column, which she explained in a YouTube video and elsewhere on the Internet. Protesters yesterday identified her as a ""traitor"" for climbing aboard the Trump train after supporting Bernie and called her a ""scumbag fascist,"" Fairbanks also claimed in the clip below about the incident. The same group also elbowed Canadian journalist Lauren Southern. Fairbanks, 31, switched her support to Trump after Hillary Clinton defeated Bernie in the Democrat primary in part because she believed Hillary Clinton was essentially a warmonger, the same argument that Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein made during the campaign. ""Fairbanks decided to attend President Trump's Inauguration on Friday in Washington D.C. and she was attacked by protesters at the event. Protesters spat at her, chanted 'f**k you"" at her, called her names, and elbowed her friend…because she supported Trump,"" Gateway Pundit reported.  Although most of the demonstrations on inauguration day were peaceful, cops arrested about 200 anarchists/protesters on charges of rioting for vandalizing storefronts, tossing bricks at officers, and other violent acts, according to the Washington Times.  The Deploraball — which is a callback to Hillary Clinton's famous ""basket of deplorables"" remark about Donald Trump supporters — was a sold-out social party for about 1,000 pro-Trump grassroots activists and social media luminaries who backed the New York real estate mogul in the election. The gala took place at the National Press Club in downtown D.C.  The alleged plan emerged in a Project Veritas undercover video. A civil lawsuit is also in the works. Security was tight at the event, with a large police presence in the street. #Disrupt20 claims it was purposefully feeding bogus information to the Project Veritas operative and had no real plans to engage in any violence at the Deploraball.  — Mike Cernovich????????

(Stephen M. Dowell, Orlando Sentinel via AP) ORLANDO, Florida -- A suspect remained at-large Monday night after a police officer was killed in a shooting and a sheriff's deputy later died in a car crash during the search for the gunman. Investigators identified the suspected gunman as Markeith Loyd, 41, the Orlando Sentinel reports. A suspect in the murder of his pregnant girlfriend, Loyd is accused of shooting Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton outside a Walmart at 7:15 a.m. after someone pointed him out and Clayton began chasing him on foot. Loyd fired shots at pursuing police while escaping in a vehicle, CNN reports. It was during a search for the suspect that a deputy on a motorcycle, Norman Lewis, 35, was killed in a crash with a 78-year-old drive. Loyd carjacked another vehicle, then ditched it and reportedly ran to an apartment complex. SWAT members surrounded the apartment complex around noon but did not locate Loyd, Fox News reports. The hunt for Loyd was ongoing throughout the day Monday and resulted in more than a dozen schools being closed, the Sentinel report. It also caused traffic jams on area highways.

909823627,2017-01-16 00:00:00,F.B.I. Arrests Wife of Killer in Orlando Mass Shooting - The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/16/us/politics/noor-salman-arrested-orlando-shooting-omar-mateen.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=second-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news,en,False,,1,New York Times,http://nytimes.com,"Advertisement Supported by By Adam Goldman and Alan Blinder WASHINGTON — The F.B.I. arrested the wife of the man who carried out a deadly terrorist attack in Orlando, Fla., and charged her with obstructing the investigation of the mass shooting, law enforcement officials said on Monday. Noor Salman, whose husband, Omar Mateen, killed 49 people and wounded dozens in an Orlando nightclub that was popular with gays, was also charged with aiding and abetting by providing material support, the officials said. She was taken into custody by F.B.I. agents at her home outside San Francisco, where she had been living with her young son. Prosecutors had been weighing charges against her for months in the aftermath of the attack by her husband on June 12, 2016. Investigators interviewed Ms. Salman for hours after the attack and came to believe she was not telling the truth about her husband’s plans to carry out the rampage. A Justice Department spokesman said Ms. Salman would make her initial appearance on Tuesday morning in federal court in Oakland, Calif. The Justice Department’s decision to prosecute Ms. Salman, 30, ends part of the mystery that has surrounded her since the first days after the attack, when she became a central subject of the wide-ranging investigation into her husband. “Noor Salman had no foreknowledge nor could she predict what Omar Mateen intended to do that tragic night,” said her lawyer, Linda Moreno. “Noor has told her story of abuse at his hands. We believe it is misguided and wrong to prosecute her and that it dishonors the memories of the victims to punish an innocent person.” Accounts of what happened from officials and witnesses. The aiding and abetting, a terrorism charge, suggests that prosecutors believe that Ms. Salman helped him in some way — either before or after the terrorist attack. The decision to charge her is not without risks for prosecutors. If the case goes to trial, prosecutors will have to contend with a jury that could be sympathetic to Ms. Salman, who said she was in an abusive relationship and living in fear. In an interview last year with The New York Times, Ms. Salman said she was “unaware of everything” in connection with the attack. Ms. Salman said she had accompanied her husband to Orlando with their child once when he scouted the club but did not know the purpose of the trip. On the day her husband drove to Orlando, she claimed he said he was going to visit a friend, named Nemo, who lived in Florida. But Nemo was not living in Florida at the time, a fact Ms. Salman said she did not know. She also said she had no reason to suspect that ammunition he bought in the days leading up to the attack was to be used in the shooting, given that her husband was a security guard who frequently purchased ammunition. On the day of the shooting, she bought her husband a Father’s Day card, expecting him to return that evening. Her lawyers believe that supports her story that she did not know about the attack. During his rampage, Mr. Mateen used Facebook to pledge his allegiance to the Islamic State. President Obama has said that Mr. Mateen “took in extremist information and propaganda over the internet and became radicalized.” Federal investigators do not believe that Mr. Mateen, who was 29 and who was killed by the police after the shooting, received any specific training or support from the Islamic State. Part of their inquiry has focused on whether anyone in the United States assisted in his plans for the attack. There has perhaps been no figure more central to those questions than Ms. Salman, who grew up in an avocado-colored home in Rodeo, Calif., near San Francisco. In Rodeo, on a diverse block populated by Chinese, Indian, Korean and Mexican families, neighbors recalled a younger Ms. Salman as warm and kind. Ms. Salman married Mr. Mateen in a ceremony near her childhood home in Northern California, a second marriage for both. After the wedding, Ms. Salman moved to Fort Pierce, Fla., where she and Mr. Mateen lived in a condominium complex. Their marriage in 2011 caused consternation among some of Ms. Salman’s relatives, mostly because of her Palestinian heritage and Mr. Mateen’s ancestral ties to Afghanistan. Ms. Salman said in the interview with The Times that her husband beat her repeatedly and verbally abused her. Members of Mr. Mateen’s family, who have tried to shield Ms. Salman from public scrutiny, have said they believe she did nothing improper. “She is shocked, that poor lady,” Seddique Mateen, Mr. Mateen’s father, said in June 2016. “And she doesn’t know anything.” The Orlando police chief, John W. Mina, said in a statement that he was “glad to see” that Ms. Salman had been arrested. “Nothing can erase the pain we all feel about the senseless and brutal murders of 49 of our neighbors, friends, family members and loved ones,” the chief said. “But today, there is some relief in knowing that someone will be held accountable for that horrific crime.” In two recent mass shootings, prosecutors have brought charges against people with ties to the attackers. In South Carolina, a friend of Dylann S. Roof, who was convicted of killing nine people on June 17, 2015, in a Charleston church, pleaded guilty in April to lying to federal investigators and misprision of a felony, or failing to inform authorities that a felony had been committed. The friend did not testify against Mr. Roof, who was sentenced to death last week. In 2015, the federal authorities in California brought charges against a neighbor of the husband and wife who killed 14 people and wounded 22 others in San Bernardino. The man, who bought the rifles used in the attack on Dec. 2, 2015, was accused of lying on forms filled out in connection with the purchase. Although he was also accused of planning a terrorist attack several years ago, the man was not charged with having a direct role in the San Bernardino rampage. However, federal prosecutors in the summer of 2014 declined to prosecute Katherine Russell, the wife of one of the assailants in the Boston Marathon bombing on April 15, 2013. F.B.I. agents believed she had made false statements to investigators and concealed knowledge of a crime. Advertisement"
569097623,2017-01-18 20:46:00,Mayor Rick Kriseman to St. Pete Pride: No city money if parade moves downtown,http://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/st-pete-pride-parade-will-move-to-the-citys-downtown-waterfront/2310006,en,False,,22,Tampa Bay Times,http://www.tampabay.com/,"ST. PETERSBURG — Hours after the St. Pete Pride Parade announced a new downtown waterfront route, Mayor Rick Kriseman said he would pull city financial support for the annual event. That has angered some gay activists. The mayor announced the move Wednesday on his Facebook page. His spokesman said the mayor wanted to keep the parade in its original location, along Central Avenue in the Grand Central and Kenwood neighborhoods. ""The mayor told us he just really wanted sun to shine everywhere,"" mayor's spokesman Ben Kirby said. ""He wants exciting events all over the city and not just downtown."" However, the money the city would withhold is the $45,000 that would help pay for security for Florida's largest LGBT pride parade — and it would be withheld a year after the terrorist attack on the gay nightclub Pulse in Orlando that killed 49 people and wounded 53 more. The parade started in 2003 and now draws more than 200,000 people. In the past, St. Petersburg has helped pay for police overtime, barricades and other security costs. The mayor's reasoning baffled Pride executive director Eric Skains. He said it was the mass shooting in Orlando and recent terrorist attacks in France and Germany that drove organizers' to relocate the parade downtown. The group's board voted unanimously with one abstention Tuesday night to move the parade to a mile-long waterfront route along Bayshore Drive between Albert Whitted Park and Vinoy Park. The parade will take place on June 24 and is sandwiched by a weekend of events. Pride organizers met with Kriseman in October, Skains said, and the mayor agreed to the new route. Kirby said the mayor had been told construction made the old route difficult, but later learned it could still work. But Skains said organizers will not bend to mayoral pressure. Kriseman's decision also threatens to divide the city's large LGBT community, which has strongly supported a mayor who has returned that embrace, making the parade a high point of his mayoral calendar. Last year, the mayor greeted parade spectators while wearing a rainbow-colored cape. Has the relationship soured? ""The event existed for a number of years under Rick Baker and Bill Foster, supporters in name-only,"" Skains said. ""It looks like we're reverting back to that. To me, that's a shame."" Baker and Foster, both Republicans, are also potential opponents to run against Kriseman, a Democrat, who is running for re-election this year. It's not just the mayor who opposes moving the parade. Jeff Danner, a former City Council member and neighborhood activist, said Kenwood and Grand Central residents feel betrayed that the parade would move away from the residents who helped nurture it during less-accepting times. ""We did it at a time when maybe it wouldn't have been so welcome in other parts of the city,"" he said. Kirby said parade organizers should not be concerned about security. He noted there were no arrests last year and vowed police will continue to ""make this event safe for everyone."" But Skains pointed out that the bomb-sniffing drones and surveillance cameras that were deployed last year weren't put out there to catch drunken people.. Tampa City Hall Reporter"

Here’s what you need to know: • American divisions are rapidly widening over President Trump’s order to close the U.S. to refugees and people from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Implemented with little regard for basic governance, the measure drew support from Mr. Trump’s supporters but criticism from self-organized protesters, Silicon Valley, some members of his own party, State Department diplomats and even former President Obama. Mr. Trump fired the acting attorney general, a holdover from the Obama administration, after she instructed the Justice Department not to defend the order. World leaders have objected to the order, but the leaders of U.S. allies are faced with either openly criticizing Mr. Trump or facing protests at home, like the one above in Scotland. _____ • Mr. Trump’s team was also on the defense over his startling reorganization of the National Security Council, a crucial adviser on major decisions. Stephen K. Bannon, the former head of the provocative website Breitbart, now has a full seat on the principals committee, while the roles of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence were downgraded. Mr. Trump sought to shift the focus to his coming Supreme Court choice. _____ • Messages of solidarity poured into Canada after a mass shooting at a Quebec mosque that left six dead. The suspect in custody was identified as a 27-year-old French-Canadian university student who, according to local press reports, had a history of provocative views and antisocial behavior. _____ • The top police official in the Philippines said the police would suspend participating in the nation’s bloody drug war while he purged rogue officers like those who strangled a South Korean businessman at Police Headquarters last year. “Ready yourselves, you bad cops,” the official, Ronald dela Rosa, said. “We no longer have a war on drugs, but we now have a war on scalawags.” The order came hours after President Rodrigo Duterte rejected calls to fire Mr. dela Rosa, above right. Rights groups dismissed the move as a bid to deflect attention from police impunity. _____ • And Australian police are reviewing the deaths of 88 men between 1976 and 2000 to determine whether they should be classified as anti-gay hate crimes. The authorities now say gangs of teenagers hunted gay men for sport, sometimes forcing their victims off the cliffs that line Sydney Harbor. Above, a man whose brother fell to his death there in 1988. “We can now see that predators were attacking gay men,” said a former police minister. “And they were doing it with the almost-certain knowledge that the police would not have gone after them.

Shortly before his death, Gustave Eiffel famously predicted that his Eiffel Tower in Paris would stand for a thousand years. Nearly a century later, the city has now said it wants to almost double what it spends on maintaining the tower for a face-lift. The French capital is eager to host the Olympic Games in 2024 and the World Expo in 2025. If it wins either bid, Paris will need to accommodate more than the normal roughly six million tourists visiting the landmark each year. But this concern would not exist — nor would the tower itself — had Eiffel’s many early opponents prevailed. Some appeared to have worked at The Times. In 1887, when construction started, critics called the monument “the grotesque and mercantile imagination of a machine maker,” according to a Times report. When the tower was inaugurated at a world exhibition in 1889, The Times wrote: “Oh! who will deliver us from the Eiffel Tower!” And in 1937, The Times described the tower as “an aesthetic misfit” that would soon be razed. “It is felt that the Eiffel Tower is out of date and out of perspective. So it is doomed.” We were, of course, wrong. Patrick Boehler contributed reporting. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings. What would you like to see here?

Jeff Sessions Blamed Culture, Not Guns, For Columbine Massacre | HuffPost",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeff-sessions-guns-columbine_us_5894d54de4b0c1284f25dd10?p0xs52l3zpaurf6r,en,False,,27502,HuffPost,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/#,"Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― During the Obama presidency, conservative politicians came up with a standard response to any mass shooting. Within hours of a tragedy, whether in a school at Newtown or a church in South Carolina, Republicans would issue statements saying they were praying for victims. It became so commonplace that last year, Slate published “Thoughts & Prayers: The Game” that allowed readers to offer up thoughts and prayers ― and fake empathy ― after a mass shooting. To talk about gun-control measures that may prevent mass shootings is to risk angering the National Rifle Association. To address the complex role that a mental health crisis plays in many mass shootings would require a meaningful examination of our underfunded and poorly resourced mental health system. To send thoughts and prayers is an easy way to express sympathy for victims and their families without actually having to do anything. By the end of President Barack Obama’s term, thoughts and prayers felt like a cop-out that fooled no one. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), soon to be confirmed as President Donald Trump’s attorney general, may have helped invent this grief response to mass shootings. Eight days after 12 students and one teacher were killed at Colorado’s Columbine High School in 1999, Sessions joined a chorus of conservative cultural warriors who argued that the horrifying shooting didn’t require new gun laws, but a deeper examination of Hollywood. The senator didn’t stop there. In a speech on the Senate floor, Sessions suggested that the real cause of the massacre was the faith ― or lack of faith ― of the teenage perpetrators. In a remarkable turn, he suggested maybe it was their parents’ fault, too: “As chairman the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Youth Violence, I have given an awful lot of thought to it. But I am perplexed. A few things occur to me. There is what appears to me a pattern here that would suggest how we have gotten to this point. It strikes me that an extremely small number of young people today have gotten on a very destructive path. They have headed down the road of anger and violence. They have not been acculturated with the kind of gentlemanliness and gentlewomanliness, not inculcated with religious faith and discipline, maybe a lack of values or whatever ― somehow it did not take. Maybe their parents tried. Maybe they did not.” Maybe. Maybe not. What drove Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold to commit such violence would consume law enforcement and mental health experts for years. Both Harris and Klebold were deeply troubled, and the setting of their high school for the shooting was most likely incidental. Harris was the mastermind, and was no “wayward boy who could have been rescued,” experts came to believe. Last year, Sue Klebold published a much-admired memoir about her son. She recalled that Dylan was outgoing and smart. He’d attended prom with his fellow students three days before massacring them. It was only after the shooting that Sue Klebold began to realize that her son had been severely depressed and expert in concealing it. “This wasn’t a kid we worried and prayed over, hoping he would eventually find his way and lead a productive life,” Klebold wrote. “We called him ‘The Sunshine Boy’—not just because of his halo of blond hair, but because everything seemed to come easily to him.” Klebold has become a suicide-prevention advocate. Sessions is about to become the nation’s top lawman. Most likely, he will face a mass shooting early in his tenure. If his response to Columbine is any indication, he will offer a pious remedy and launch a salvo from his side of the never-ending culture war. Sessions, unable to wait until law enforcement authorities had completed their investigation into Columbine, found his culprits: the Internet, violent video games and movies, an androgynous singer. That day on the Senate floor, he offered that the two teen killers “are alienated and angry,” then turned to his bigger, easier targets: “They are able to hook into the Internet and play video games that are extraordinarily violent, that cause the blood pressure to rise and the adrenaline level to go up, games that cause people to be killed and the players to die themselves. It is a very intense experience. They are able to get into Internet chat rooms and, if there are no nuts or people of the same mentality in their hometown, hook up with people around the country. They are able to rent from the video store ― not just go down and see “Natural Born Killers” or “The Basketball Diaries” ― but they are able to bring it home and watch it repeatedly. In this case, even maybe make their own violent film. Many have said this murder was very much akin to “The Basketball Diaries,” in which a student goes in and shoots others in the classroom. I have seen a video of that, and many others may have. In music, there is Marilyn Manson, an individual who chooses the name of a mass murderer as part of his name. The lyrics of his music are consistent with his choice of name. They are violent and nihilistic, and there are groups all over the world who do this, some German groups and others. I guess what I am saying is, a person already troubled in this modern high-tech world can be in their car and hear the music, they can be in their room and see the video, they can go into the chat rooms and act out these video games and even take it to real life. Something there is very much of a problem.” You can read Sessions’ full floor speech here. Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how."

Stacey Dash, an occasional contributor on Fox -- and an outspoken critic of Democrats, Barack Obama and groups like Black Lives Matter -- reportedly is not returning to her role on ""Out Numbered."" According to the Hollywood Reporter, executives ""declined to renew the 'Clueless' actress' contract."" Still, others say Stacey Dash was ""fired,"" with unconfirmed rumors that she had worn out her usefulness since the election is over. Stacy Dash made her mark at Fox with her unrelenting -- and early -- support of then-candidate Donald Trump. Her contract began in 2014. Sources told THR the decision not to renew Dash's contract was made months ago.  Further,Stacey expressed her vociferous views aimed at the LGBTQ community and her support for Trump's radical plans on immigration, particularly of Middle Eastern migrants. NJ wrote about Staceyas Dash's suspension by Fox in 2015 in the wake of her sharp critique of Obama's comments after the San Bernardino mass shooting last year. Dozens of people died in the rampage. Stacey opined that transgender people should relieve themselves ""in the bushes"" instead of using public restrooms based on their gender. In 2015, Fox News suspended Stacey after she used profanity in criticizing an address President Barack Obama delivered in the wake of the San Bernardino shooting. In 2016,Stacey suggested that transgender people should go to the bathroom ""in the bushes"" rather than use bathrooms corresponding to their gender.

That is what the gunmen who shot up a Quebec mosque late on Sunday hollered as they ruthlessly slew six innocent people. But according to some mainstream media reports about the attack, that never happened, or at least it wasn't worth mentioning. The Gateway Pundit reported that as of 1 a.m. EST on Monday the fact that the shooters had proclaimed ""Allahu Akbar!"" during the attack had not been included in reports by ABC, NBC, CNN, the New York Times, the Associated Press, CBS, the Washington Post, and Reuters.  As of the time of this writing, the most recent coverage vis-à-vis the Quebec mass shooting from the Washington Post, ABC, CNN, the New York Times, the Associated Press, Reuters, NBC, and CBS did not include the information about ""Allahu Akbar,"" though a few referenced the original CBC News report that did mention the proclamation as their source. It's also evident by skimming the content of these reports that they're trying to tie the tragic incident to Donald Trump's ""Muslim ban"" and Islamophobia. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is aiding them in this respect if his comments about the Quebec mass slaying is any indication. To fuel this narrative, each source said that a direct motive for the shooting has yet to be established. Unless you've been living under a rock, you know that ""Allahu Akbar,"" which translates in English to ""God is great,"" is what radical Islamic terrorists yell either prior to blowing themselves up via suicide bomb or during a mass casualty attack like that of the Quebec mosque shooting. It's a simple fact, so what does it tell us that some within the mainstream press didn't feel it worth reporting to the public? Perhaps they don't want us to know Islamic extremists are responsible for the mass murder of their fellow Muslims? It's possible, but that doesn't make much sense because, after all, over in Middle Eastern war zones, radical Islamists are killing other Muslims on an almost daily basis, and you just don't hear about it because, sadly, it's become normal. Maybe the media doesn't want the general population to know about the Quebec attackers yelling ""Allahu Akbar"" because then the millions of Americans who hate President Donald Trump and his ""Muslim ban"" (it's not a Muslim ban) can misdirect their outrage at the carnage in Quebec at Trump. This makes sense in my mind because Trump opponents have been saying for months that Donald's attitude towards Middle Eastern refugees is a recipe for disaster in regard to fueling radicalization. Hence, leaving out the ""Allahu Akbar"" proclamation fits the narrative of the Democrats and their media lackeys.   As already mentioned, a handful of mainstream outlets conveniently inserted Trump's controversial immigration ban into their pieces on the Quebec attack. Also included in most if not all of the coverage was the fact that the Quebec mosque was previously the target of a non-violent, anti-Islamic hate crime. Let's let the facts speak for themselves. Dylann Roof did not shout out ""Allahu Akbar"" when he ruthlessly gunned down worshippers inside an African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina. Robert Lewis Dear, who killed three and injured nine during an attack on a Planned Parenthood Clinic in Colorado Springs, Colorado, was suspected of having done it because of radical Christian beliefs, and as such, he did not say ""Allahu Akbar"" before or in the midst of carrying out his evil crime. Adam Lanza, who mercilessly and maliciously murdered 29 souls at Sandy Hook Elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, was not heard by the survivors to have hollered, ""Allahu Akbar!"" Yet, when Islamic terrorists strike, they almost always are heard yelling the phrase ""Allahu Akbar!"" It happened in Paris when a group of Islamic terrorists killed over 100 concert-goers at the Bataclan Concert Hall, it happened on November 5, 2009, when Major Nidal Malik Hasan went on a shooting rampage at Fort Hood in Texas, ending the lives of 13 military personnel.   It happened in July of 2016, when a man drove a truck into a crowd of hundreds celebrating Bastille Day in Nice, France, resulting in upwards of 80 deaths. Omar Mateen, the man who murdered 49 people at the Orlando gay nightclub Pulse, was heard shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" while he battled it out with law enforcement.  Do you believe ""Allahu Akbar"" being proclaimed by the Quebec killers is something the media should disclose to its consumers, or is it a needless detail which offers nothing of merit to the Quebec attack?

NewsBusters adds: Both actions severely limited immigration from certain regions, but CBS This Morning and NBC’s Today hyped the Castro regime “praising” Obama’s policy decision. In contrast, the coverage of Trump’s executive order has been overwhelmingly negative, with NBC’s Today even going so far as to suggest a link between Trump’s immigration ban and a mass shooting at a mosque in Quebec, despite a complete lack of evidence. … But this wasn’t the only instance of the networks ignoring one of President Obama’s bans on refugees. It wasn’t until 2013 that ABC News reported that “State Department stopped processing Iraq refugees for six months in 2011,” after the discovery that two al-Qaeda operatives had used the program to enter the U.S. and move to Bowling Green, Kentucky. … … CBS and NBC never followed up on the story, and ABC dropped its coverage after that single day of attention. Coverage of Obama’s rapprochement and normalization of relations with Cuba has been generally laudatory, ignoring the Cuban regime’s complete failure to make progress on democracy and human rights, while praising the diplomatic commitment of the Obama administration to back down, unilaterally.

On Saturday, one of Jessa Duggar's in-laws shared an Instagram post about the hundreds of thousands of Women's March participants who rallied all across the globe the day after Donald Trump's inauguration. The Duggar Family News: Life Is Not All Pickles and Hairspray Facebook page speculates that Jessa's father-in-law, Michael Seewald, penned the short message. ""Women of the world who are marching by the thousands, I am ashamed to call you sisters today. You do not fight for women's rights. You have no class. You have no dignity. You fight for death,"" the Instagram post read. It was accompanied by an anti-abortion meme. [embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/BPiTsY9jpO-/?taken-by=seewaldfamily&hl=en[/embed] As Pickles and Hairspray points out, the Women's March events weren't just about keeping abortion legal. According to Wired, organizers outlined eight different concerns that they were encouraging participants to march for: LGBTQIA rights, ending violence, environmental justice, reproductive rights, civil rights, immigrant rights, disability rights, and workers' rights. It's true that protecting a woman's right to choose was one of the most popular issues with marchers who are active on social media, but an analysis of Twitter data found that healthcare in general was also a top concern; many participants marched because they don't want Donald Trump to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Jessa Duggar's husband, Ben Seewald, has not shared his thoughts about the Women's March, but he did seemingly endorse his father's anti-choice message on Twitter. On the day of the Women's March, Ben tweeted a link to an article titled ""We Know They Are Killing Children — All of Us Know."" It was written by John Piper, a theologian Jessa Duggar's husband is a big fan of. As the Inquisitr previously reported, Ben stirred up controversy by quoting the anti-gay pastor in response to the June 12, 2016, mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Jessa Duggar also hasn't taken to social media to weigh in on the Women's March. However, she's made her own feelings about abortion abundantly clear. As the Huffington Post reports, the Counting On star was criticized for comparing abortion to the Holocaust in 2014. Jessa and Ben had visited the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., a few days before she penned a lengthy anti-choice post on Instagram. Jessa Duggar also tried to claim that belief in evolution was partially responsible for the Holocaust. [embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/tY_PCYjfjZ/[/embed] One of Ben Seewald's close friends shares his anti-choice views, but she decided to attend the Women's March in New York City. Pickles and Hairspray shared a photo of Seewald's pal, Krista Gay, holding a sign with Michelle Obama's famous words painted on it: ""When they go low, we go high."" In a Facebook post, Krista explained why she was marching. She ticked off most of the eight concerns listed above, and she also revealed that she is against many of Donald Trump's policies.

As SheKnows reports, he used his Instagram pulpit to criticize Trump's promise to ""Make America great again."" ""Make America great again? America needs something greater than the Republican Party or the Democratic Party have to offer,"" Seewald said in a short video. ""No man, other than the God-man, Jesus Christ, can ever make a nation truly great."" Ben doesn't seem to be on the same page as the evangelicals who voted for Donald Trump simply because he had a ""R"" beside his name. ""We don't need a Republican. We need a revival,"" Jessa Duggar's husband said at the end of his mini-sermon. [Featured Image by Jessa Duggar Seewald/Facebook]"

Noor Salman, the wife of Omar Mateen, will face extradition from San Francisco to Florida to face obstruction and abetting charges in relation to the massacre, ABC News reports:   The wife of the gunman who carried out a mass shooting an Orlando, Florida, nightclub was arrested by the FBI today in San Francisco, the FBI and her lawyer said. Gunman Omar Mateen’s wife, Noor Salman, faces two federal charges: obstruction of justice and aiding and abetting the attempted provision of material support to a foreign terrorist organization. Why did it take seven months? Almost immediately after the shooting, CNN reported that the Department of Justice would present evidence to a grand jury about Salman and her alleged role in the shooting: FBI investigators don’t believe Noor Salman was a co-conspirator in the attack that killed 49 people Sunday morning at Pulse, the source said. But authorities are looking into whether she should face charges for what she may have known of his intentions and possibly failed to report to law enforcement. The charges mentioned today suggest greater involvement than merely a failure to report what Salman knew. Obstruction would relate to providing investigators with false information, and abetting would indicate a more active involvement either before, during, or after the attack to facilitate the crime. This could also be a strategy to levy the most serious charges on Salman in order to effect a plea deal, but why wait seven months for that tactic? And for that matter, did the grand jury prompt these charges, and if so, why now? She’s been going public with her story for two months, and even then the New York Times’ Adam Goldman reported that the FBI didn’t buy her explanations: Ms. Salman, whose parents immigrated to the United States from the West Bank in 1985, was immediately a person of interest. F.B.I. agents questioned her for hours, eliciting from her that she had been with her husband when he bought ammunition and scouted the club. Some agents came to believe that she was not being truthful. But in an interview, the first she has given, Ms. Salman denied any involvement in the attack or any knowledge of what her husband was going to do. She described him as someone who angered easily, beat her often and lived his life in secret. And she lives in legal limbo, with prosecutors weighing charges that could include lying to the F.B.I. Her lawyers, Linda Moreno and Charles Swift, say their client did nothing wrong. They declined to let Ms. Salman, 30, talk about her discussions with the F.B.I., but Mr. Swift said she had told investigators “everything she knew to the best of her ability.” Clearly they don’t agree. Earlier, her family claimed she had learning disabilities, and couldn’t have comprehended Mateen’s intentions. Fox News reported on it at the time, and declared that a weak defense: Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com She’s adept enough to file a court petition to change her son’s name. It seems doubtful that a diminished-capacity claim will stand up with that in mind, or at all unless she’s committable for incapacity. Absent that, the question of diminished capacity is more of a penalty-phase consideration for the jury and the judge, not a Get Out Of Jail Free card. Salman will get arraigned tomorrow at a federal court in San Francisco. If she fights extradition, we may see more of the case that the FBI and DoJ plan to present in the motions, but we’ll almost certainly see the indictment in short order.

          / CBS News ORLANDO, Fla. - A manhunt has been launched after a police officer was shot and killed Monday morning near an Orlando Walmart, officials said. Police said Orlando Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was approached Monday morning at around 7 a.m. by a person who recognized Markeith Loyd, a man suspected of killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend in December. The witness pointed Clayton toward Loyd, and the sergeant called dispatch to announce she was approaching the suspect. Moments later, a man believed to be Loyd shot Clayton multiple times. She died soon after. The Orlando Police Department family is heartbroken today.  One of our own was taken in the line of duty.  There are no words. pic.twitter.com/M48o1nnr4h Loyd fled the scene, hijacking a car, and firing at least two shots at a pursuing police vehicle. He then abandoned the first car he hijacked and stole another, according to police. During the manhunt, an Orange County Sheriff’s deputy was killed in a motorcycle accident. The Florida Highway Patrol confirmed to CBS News that the deputy, identified as Deputy First Class Norman Lewis, was involved in the manhunt at the time of the crash. Clermont, Florida resident Billie Jarrard allegedly “turned into the direct path” of the deputy, am 11-year veteran. The Florida Highway Patrol said in a statement that charges are pending against Jarrard. That million dollar smile. The consummate professional. That's how we will remember our gentle giant DFC Norm Lewis. RIP.  #BigNorm pic.twitter.com/I6BbSSCLeW Orlando Police Chief John Mina said during a Monday morning press conference that Clayton, a 17-year veteran, was well-known on the force. “She organized several marches against violence by herself. That’s how dedicated she was,” Mina said. Police announced on Monday a reward of up to $60,000 for information leading to Loyd’s arrest. Mina said during a Monday afternoon press conference that if Loyd is arrested, he will be charged with first degree murder of a law enforcement officer and attempted murder of a law enforcment officer. Authorities have so far searched dozens of apartments and houses in their search for Loyd, who police believe has received assistance during his flight. Markeith Loyd is the suspect who shot OPD officer this morning. Anyone w/info please call 1-800-423-TIPS @CrimelineFL pic.twitter.com/TeABsCsTh4 Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said police had circulated Loyd’s image in the community because of the previous murder case, in which 24-year-old Sade Dixon was shot and killed, and officers had been on the lookout for him. “That indicates to me he is receiving help,” Demings said. Loyd previously spent four years in prison for battery of a law enforcement officer and resisting arrest with violence. He was sentenced to 27 months in prison in 2011 for possessing homemade weapons while in federal custody. He was also charged in a 1995 murder case, but those charges were dropped.

According to NBC, there were more than 50 people present at the mosque when a gunman opened fire, killing six and injuring 17. Bissonnette then called 911 from a bridge ""nearÂ Ãle d'OrlÃ©ans, an island in the Saint Lawrence River, and was armed and ready to surrender."" The Globe and MailÂ additionally reported Bissonnette's ""online profile and school friendships revealed little interest in extremist politics until last March when French nationalist leader Marine Le Pen visited Quebec City and inspired Mr. Bissonnette to vocal extreme online activism, according to people who clashed with him."" ""I can tell you he was certainly no Muslim convert,"" fellow Laval student Vincent Boissoneault told the paper. ""I wrote him off as a xenophobe. I didn't even think of him as totally racist, but he was enthralled by a borderline racist nationalist movement."" Boissoneault also said Bissonnette supported U.S. President Donald Trump, who recently issued an executive order banning refugees and residents of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the U.S., in online posts. Earlier coverage cited reports from witnesses the attacker shouted ""Allahu Akbar,"" a common Arabic phrase translating to ""God is greatest"" known as the takbir. But the identification of Bissonnette indicates the massacre, which Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau referred to as a ""terrorism attack on Muslims,""Â was motivated by far-right views on race and nationalism similar to white supremacist Dylann Storm Roof's 2015 massacre of nine African-Americans at Charleston, South Carolina's historically black Emanuel AME Church."

FILE - In this July 18, 2011, file photo, an examiner at an FBI digital forensics lab views data extracted easily from a smartphone, in Salt Lake City. (AP Photo/Lynn DeBruin, File) Cellebrite, a digital forensics firm known for helping law enforcement crack into locked smartphones, has itself fallen victim to hackers. Technology news website Motherboard said Thursday that it had obtained 900 gigabytes of data related to the Israel-based company. It said the trove of data includes customer information, databases and technical data about the company's products. Cellebrite released a statement Thursday acknowledging that one of its external web servers had been hacked, adding that that it's investigating the extent of the breach. Motherboard journalist Joseph Cox said that an unidentified hacker gave him 900 gigabytes of data from Cellebrite’s servers. In a series of messages posted to Twitter, he said that most of the data consisted of technical information, evidence and log files but that some of the information contained customer data. In an article , Cox wrote that the trove contained messages from authorities in Russia, Turkey and the Arab Gulf. Cellebrite could be in for more unwelcome attention. Cox said that Motherboard would ""likely be doing more stories from the data."" According to Cellebrite, the server in question included a database backup of an old license management system. It said the hackers accessed basic user contact information and encrypted passwords for users who had not yet moved to the company's new system. While Cellebrite says it's not aware of any risk to customers as a result of the breach, it's still advising them to change their passwords. Cellebrite, founded in 1999, has contracts with the FBI dating back to at least 2013. The firm makes devices that allow law enforcement to extract and decode data such as contacts, pictures and text messages from more than 15,000 kinds of smartphones and other mobile devices. It also makes commercial products that companies can use to help their customers transfer data from old phones to new ones. The company found itself in the spotlight last year after some industry observers speculated that it might have helped the FBI hack into an iPhone used by one of the killer in the San Bernardino, California, mass shooting. That phone was the subject of a major legal fight between the FBI and Apple; the company refused to help break iPhone security. The FBI dropped its case after finding another way into the phone. Cellebrite claims to do business with thousands of law enforcement and intelligence agencies, militaries and governments in more than 100 countries. But its involvement in the San Bernardino case was never proven. Get a daily look at what’s developing in science and technology throughout the world.

574590715,2017-01-31 07:12:17,Undercover FBI Agents Swarm the Internet Seeking Contact With Terrorists,https://theintercept.com/2017/01/31/undercover-fbi-agents-swarm-the-internet-seeking-contact-with-terrorists/,en,False,,269138,Intercept,https://theintercept.com/,"© First Look Institute. All rights reserved First Look Institute is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. President Trump has inherited a vast domestic intelligence agency with extraordinary secret powers. A cache of documents offers a rare window into the FBI’s quiet expansion since 9/11. The FBI operates on the internet with unprecedented vigor and under loose rules, according to secret internal guidelines obtained by The Intercept, with undercover agents freely chatting online with unsuspecting people who are not even under investigation. The bureau has made online counterterrorism a strategic focus, lavishing staff and attention on a clearinghouse project called Net Talon and measuring performance through such metrics as the amount of time agents spend online, how many postings they make, and the personas they create. The FBI’s virtual tentacles are so ubiquitous that the bureau sometimes finds itself investigating its own people. Because terror groups have made effective use of online networks to spread propaganda and to connect with troubled individuals, the virtual realm has become a significant counterterrorism theater for the FBI. The bureau has given broad authority to agents operating online in order to ramp up counterterrorism sting operations, among other activities. But lawyers, experts, and activists express concern that the FBI’s aggressive use of undercover operations may be creating terrorists out of hapless people who say stupid things online. The information in this story is drawn largely from the FBI’s Counterterrorism Policy Guide, a manual for agents working on both international and domestic terrorism cases. The document, classified secret, is dated April 1, 2015, and has not been previously released. The Intercept is publishing sections of the guide dealing with the FBI’s online investigations, a subject on which the bureau has offered little transparency. Other guidance on undercover operations has been made public in the past, but none that goes into as much detail on online investigations. According to the guide, an online counterterrorism investigation can target websites or online networks that the FBI believes terrorists are using “to encourage and recruit members” or to spread propaganda. Such probes may extend to the administrators or creators of those forums, as well as people engaged in “the development of communications security practices” or “acting as ‘virtual couriers’ for terrorist organizations by passing online messages among members or leadership.” The guide classes as online investigations those that rely primarily on online informants or undercover employees, and those that involve surveilling internet facilities or foreign websites hosted on U.S. servers. The FBI often runs such operations jointly with other U.S. intelligence agencies or “international partners,” according to the document. Since 2008, the Counterterrorism Division has coordinated these operations under a program called the Net Talon National Initiative. Net Talon uses informants, linguists, and FBI employees working undercover, posing as ordinary internet users, to zero in on terrorists’ use of the internet, according to the guide. The initiative was meant to centralize expertise on particular targets and platforms, to “address intelligence gaps,” and to create a clearinghouse of the intelligence the bureau has collected on terrorists’ use of the internet. The FBI’s online activities are apparently pervasive and uncoordinated enough to lead to confusion. The document refers to “resources being wasted by investigating or collecting on FBI online identities,” including undercover employees, informants, or people who have already been investigated by other offices or agencies. An FBI official told the Intercept, “You would be in a forum, and you’re like, ‘This person’s way out there,’ and we’ve gone and opened up a case, and sometimes that was a local police department, or a friendly foreign service. There are still instances of that, and deconfliction is still necessary.” Khurrum Wahid and Joshua Dratel, defense attorneys for Ahmed Omar Abu Ali, answer questions from the media after Abu Ali was sentenced on March 29, 2006, at a federal court in Alexandria, Va. Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images The Counterterrorism Policy Guide shows just how much flexibility informants and undercover agents have when operating online, even when they’re not working specific targets. The FBI insists that there is nothing to see here: In statements provided to The Intercept, the FBI said that “while there are obvious differences between online and offline environments,” FBI employees and informants working on the internet are subject to the same rules, and that bureau employees can only monitor people’s online activity as part of an authorized investigation. The guide, however, suggests that the internet offers areas of ambiguity. Much comes down to the questions of what informants can do, as opposed to FBI employees, and whether the goal of an operation should be construed as seeking to obtain specific intelligence, simply watching public websites, or developing a profile for an undercover identity. For instance, the guide states that an FBI employee can visit a message forum or blog only when the site is relevant to an investigation. An FBI employee, according to the guide, could be an undercover agent or an “online covert employee,” a term that presumably refers to FBI workers other than agents, like analysts. FBI employees can’t chat online with someone who isn’t already the subject of an investigation for the purposes of gathering intelligence on that person. They can, however, “engage in unlimited communication with associates” of a person under investigation, if the conversations are relevant to the investigation. Informants and undercover FBI employees are also allowed to do a great deal online in the name of “building bona fides,” such as creating fake identities or making themselves appear to be normal commenters on online fora. The guide says that in order to establish credibility, FBI employees “may make postings and communicate with individuals who are neither the subjects nor the associates of subjects … there is no limitation with respect to the amount of communication [they] may initiate in this regard.” And the FBI is allowed to open new investigations on people it identifies through “passive monitoring or active communication” on websites. An FBI spokesperson clarified that in order for an undercover or covert employee to monitor a website or forum, the site must already be associated with an investigation, “either because the forum was known to be used by a subject [of an investigation], or because the subjects are there. I can’t be in the forum trying to bait you into conversation.” However, the FBI acknowledges that when its employees participate in online fora, they interact with people who may be bystanders to whatever activity led the bureau there in the first place. And that is not accidental. “We want to know if the subject has other people who are joining in, which people are part of the activity, and who is just there,” a spokesperson explained. In other words, FBI agents can post and chat online with people who have nothing to do with an investigation, so long as they aren’t collecting intelligence — but in the course of those online communications, they can decide to start investigating someone. Michael German, a former FBI agent who is now with the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School, said that agents have always had a little bit of wiggle room in this regard. They can have a certain number of in-person meetings with someone, or in some circumstances go to public meetings or public websites, without identifying themselves as part of the FBI. This helps agents avoid a bureaucratic mess when carrying out a simple “buy and bust” drug sting, for example, German said. But the ability to conduct unlimited online conversations in the name of building bona fides gives agents “a pretty long rope,” German said. Criminal defense attorney Khurrum Wahid, who has handled or been an adviser on many national security cases, notes that FBI employees or informants frequently pose as experts offering guidance to lost individuals. “These uninformed young people go online and become almost smitten with people who show a level of knowledge, who often turn out to be informants or undercovers,” said Wahid. Informants operate under looser rules than FBI personnel. They are allowed unlimited engagement with a target in the course of an “assessment,” a preliminary investigation that can be opened on a loose tip of suspicious behavior, in order to collect general intelligence on a subject, or to evaluate a potential new informant. Assessments were created as a category in 2008. German finds their allowance for the expansive use of informants problematic. “What we’ve seen in sting operations is that there is this shady portion before the official operation begins which often involves the informant,” said German. “And then it’s passed off to an agent, and it looks like they are ready to commit a crime pretty quickly.” Wahid noted that at least in online cases, there are generally logs of all the conversations between suspect and informant, whereas “when it’s a live informant, they can turn off the recorder and we never know what it was all about.” The use of informants in counterterrorism sting operations has expanded since the 9/11 attacks, when the FBI adopted the mantra that its job is to stop terror attacks before they occur, not just investigate them afterward. The government argues that the anonymity the internet affords to suspects necessitates an aggressive approach, including stings. The FBI’s national security director told the New York Times this summer that “using undercover agents online allowed the FBI to ‘flesh out’ suspects by gaining their trust and persuading them to disclose their real identities.” In some cases, the FBI even created fake webpages in order to draw in suspects. “Agencies are under a lot of pressure to find a needle in a haystack, something that has haunted us since the beginning of the war on terror,” said Karen Greenberg, director of the Center on National Security at Fordham Law School. “It’s true that the internet has changed everything about how we communicate, but are we just going to be trawling online forever? It turns the principles of criminal investigation on their head.” FBI officials collect evidence from the parking lot of Pulse nightclub, the site of a mass shooting days earlier, in Orlando, Fla., June 15, 2016. Photo: Adrees Latif/Reuters Little better illustrates the importance the FBI places on online operations than the Counterterrorism Policy Guide’s section on how to claim “statistical accomplishments.” Such numbers can factor into agents’ job evaluations and the bureau’s reports to Congress. According to the document, the FBI has generated new measures of employee performance that are specific to online work, tallying “duration online, the number of postings made, the extremist online venue identified (e.g., blog or Web site), and online personas created.” “I think we’re in a transition for law enforcement, between the old-school shoe-leather knocking on doors, and the new school of online undercover employees looking on forums and such,” said Seamus Hughes, an expert in extremism at George Washington University. “They are very clearly focusing resources online, and that makes sense, because it’s often the most overt sign that people are self-identifying as radicalized, and it’s easier than introducing an in-person informant, putting a wire on them. And if you’re a 17-year-old from Indiana, you’re more likely to have your connection to a known or suspected terrorist online than you are to find one in Indiana.” There is no disputing that online propaganda and messaging have allowed overseas terror networks to sow the seeds of violence in the United States, whether through direct communication or by serving as an inspiration for lone attackers like Omar Mateen, who shot up Pulse nightclub in Orlando. And yet, Hughes has also written that “the role of the internet in radicalization has been overblown” and reflects “a vast over-simplification.” “That’s not to say that the online environment isn’t important, but it’s basically a reflection of real life — the average age of an ISIS recruit is in their 20s, and everyone that age is online,” Hughes told The Intercept. “People will pull up a Facebook profile and say, ‘Hey, this is online radicalization, he posted a photo of an ISIS flag,’ but that’s probably a very superficial analysis.” In most cases of people who actually did try to join ISIS or plot a violent attack, offline relationships were critical. “Radicalization does not occur in a vacuum,” Hughes wrote. “While the online environment can solidify beliefs and provide support that was unimaginable just a few years ago, it is not the single cause of terrorist recruitment.” Top photo: A laptop computer displays internet research on the Islamic State terrorist organization.

Well, the feds finally picked her up anyway. Pamela Brown, CNN: Authorities have arrested the wife of Pulse nightclub shooter Omar Mateen in connection with their investigation into the June mass shooting, FBI spokesman Prentice Danner said… [Noor] Salman, who married Mateen in 2011, came under increasing scrutiny as authorities investigated Mateen, who killed 49 people and injured more than 50 others when he opened fire at the gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Well, that was quick. It was only the deadliest mass shooting in American history, guys. It seems unlikely that Salman will be able to clarify Mateen’s motive, though. We already know his motive: He killed all those people because they were gay. His religious beliefs, whatever they may have been, had nothing to do with it. After all, plenty of Christians hate gay people too. And every Muslim in the world, other than Omar Mateen, didn’t do it. Please stop being racist.

The CVE is going to become CRIE, Countering Radical Islamic Extremism, according to reports from five inside sources as published by Reuters on Thursday. In addition to correcting what the Trump administration has long argued was an inadequate response to Islamic terrorism from President Barack Obama, the reported change also means that CVE won't focus on white supremacists and other far-right groups that have engaged in violent activities like mass shootings, bomb threats, and bombings. One source told Reuters that Trump has been planning this as far back as December, when members of his transition team met with members of the CVE to discuss the change. As of February 2016, right-wing extremists had engaged in terrorist attacks in the United States twice as often as radical Islamists since 2002 (18 times versus 9 times) and left more people dead (48 versus 45), according to Newsweek. The Reuters report comes days after Alexandre Bissonnette allegedly went on a mass shooting spree in a Quebec mosque. Bissonnette was a far right-wing extremist who supported Trump and other radical right-wing causes. According to the Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security. Meanwhile, the FBI has been investigating white supremacist groups who have been infiltrating a number of law enforcement agencies. Trump's belief that radical Islam is a unique threat is consistent with the ideology propounded by two of his closest advisers, National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and chief strategist Steve Bannon. Similarly, his reported downplaying of the threat posed by white supremacists is consistent with the ideology that fueled both his presidential campaign and the s0-called ""alt right"" movement in general.

""No one is above the law and that includes the president,"" Ferguson said Friday night. Trump railed against US District Judge James Robart last weekend for handing down the ruling. Though the broad scope of his action in particular has faced criticism, Trump has claimed repeatedly that ""many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country."" For you For you"

Tamzin B. Smith Jay Franzone just wanted a Six Flags ticket. As a 16-year-old student in Connecticut, Franzone went with his friends to donate at their high school’s blood drive back in 2011. Students who donated received a ticket to Six Flags New England. His friends got to go, but Franzone didn’t – as a gay man, he wasn’t allowed to give blood. Starting in 1977, guidelines from the Food and Drug Administration stipulated that men who have had sex with men (MSMs) were banned from donating blood for life. In  December 2015, that policy was updated to a one-year deferral for gay and bisexual men since the last instance of same-sex sexual contact. “When I heard about this policy, it didn’t make sense,” Franzone tells Rolling Stone. “I’ve known all my life that anyone can get HIV. It’s a virus – it doesn’t discriminate.” Related

						'Silence of the Lambs': 'It Broke All the Rules'					



						'MTV Unplugged': The 15 Best Episodes But Franzone, who had come out only a year earlier, wasn’t thinking about the science behind the policy. According to the FDA, the deferral is based on data from the Centers for Disease Control showing that “about two-thirds of all new HIV cases occur in men who have sex with men, who make up two percent of the total U.S. population.” But when you’re 16, he says, you think that you’re dirty and that you’re somehow the problem.  “You can’t give blood because you’re gay, so there must be something wrong with you,” Franzone says. Now 21, Franzone decided to protest the current policy by remaining abstinent for a year in order to donate under current FDA guidelines, and this week wrote an op-ed for the New York Times about his experience. Franzone made an appointment with the American Red Cross to give blood on January 10th, and the morning of donation day, Franzone was not thinking about the importance of the act. He was nervous about what to wear. A recent college graduate, he has a collection of bow ties; his favorite is pink with blue polka dots on it. But as he waited to be seen in the lobby of the Red Cross building, Franzone wore a short-sleeve henley, anxious but prepared to do good. After all, that’s what this is about. “In the U.S., we have an altruistic donor system,” Franzone says. “People give blood because they want to do the right thing. They either want to give back if they’ve needed blood, they know someone who needs blood, or they might need blood someday. A unit of blood is used every two seconds in this country.” Last year, the LGBT community was powerfully reminded of that statistic following an attack on Pulse nightclub, the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. Forty-nine people were killed and 53 more were injured after a gunman opened fire on the Orlando gay bar. Although OneBlood, a Florida-based donation center, estimated that over 28,000 people donated the week following the tragedy, MSMs were not among them. For gay and bisexual men who will remain sexually active throughout their lives, a one-year deferral amounts to a lifetime ban. This means that these people were not allowed to help their own community members during a time of extraordinary need. Meanwhile, current medical science actually supports allowing gay and bisexual men to donate. The lifetime ban on MSM donations was put in place during the height of the AIDS epidemic in 1983, a time when researchers knew very little about how HIV was contracted or transmitted. Due to subsequent advances in testing, the presence of the virus can now be detected in the bloodstream in as few as seven days.   The Pulse shooting, however, served as a pivotal moment for the movement to push for a full lift of regulations that keep MSMs from donating blood. Democratic representative Mike Quigley, who has been working on the blood ban since being voted into the House of Representatives in 2009, says that a number of Congresspeople who were unaware of the issue suddenly got on board. Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Mark Kirk, a Republican, signed a letter to the FDA urging them to reconsider the current policy and, in July, the department announced that it would be considering recommendations toward enacting new donation guidelines. But a mixture of fear and outdated stigma continues to hold the FDA back, according to Jason Cianciotto of Harlem United, a New-York-based HIV advocacy group. From conversations with the department, Cianciotto claimed that the organization is worried about a new virus – referred to as a “blood borne pathogen” – entering the donation pool, one that would unable to be detected or filtered out through current screening processes. “There’s a concern that gay and bisexual men could be a ‘vector’ for a yet to be known or discovered pathogen that could be transferred through blood the same way that happened with HIV in the 80s,” Cianciotto claims. “The de facto lifetime ban is an action they’re taking based on an unknown fear of something happening in the future versus what is already known.” Jeremiah Johnson, the HIV Prevention, Research and Policy Coordinator for New York’s HIV Research Treatment and Action Group, argued this belief is not only bad science but sends a harmful message that gay and bisexual men are inherently diseased. “I don’t think that we can make policy based on hypothetical risk,” Johnson says. “If that were the standard, we would have a lot of silly policies – because we can dream up a lot of bad scenarios. Assuming that the next major blood-borne pathogen that will have a major impact on our healthcare system will come from gay sex is a huge assumption, completely unfair, completely unfounded and based solely in homophobia and stigmatization of the sex that we have.”  In an email to Rolling Stone, FDA spokesperson Lyndsay Meyer acknowledged concerns in the department about a new virus entering the blood supply, but maintained that the “current guidance focuses on reducing the risk of HIV transmission.” Meyer also says that the FDA is simply doing what has worked for other countries. Although Spain and Italy have switched to a risk-based assessment, which looks at individual risk factors rather than singling out particular groups for discrimination – without leading to an outbreak of HIV – she believes those cases are “very different.” Meyer compares the U.S. to Australia, another country with a one-year deferral for MSMs. “A 12-month deferral has been well-studied and, among other things, found to maintain the safety of the blood supply in Australia, a country with epidemiology and blood screening systems similar to the U.S.,” Meyer says. Cianciotto also acknowledges another issue with striking down the deferral period for gay men: the bottom line. Because blood testing in the U.S. is conducted through regional groups, rather than a national center, not every testing center has the same access to updated, current medical testing technology. Because of budgetary concerns, many groups employ what’s known as “pooled testing” to save money. “They take samples from a number of blood donations and test them all at once for HIV, rather than testing each individual donation,” Cianciotto says. This protocol is vastly different from other nations, including Australia, where blood samples are tested separately. Switching to an individual testing process would be costly for the FDA, and it’s an open question as to whether the incoming Trump administration will be willing to put the funding and the effort into updating the screening process to meet current medical standards, which support either reducing the deferral period or striking down the ban entirely. Kelsey Louie, CEO of Gay Men’s Health Crisis, claims that all blood borne pathogens, including Hepatitis C, can now be detected in up to 25 days. The LGBT advocacy organization has, thus, suggested a two-month waiting period for MSM donors. Cianciotto believes that a window, were it necessary, could be reduced to a month.  Changing those policies could have an enormous impact on the blood supply. The American Red Cross has said that of the 38 percent of Americans eligible to donate at any given time, just 10 percent actually do. Should the FDA move to a risk-based assessment, The Williams Institute, a pro-LGBT think tank at the University of California Los Angeles, estimated that 4.2 million more people would be allowed to donate than were previously allowed under the lifetime ban. That would result in 615,000 more pints of blood each year. That massive influx of donations would result in countless lives being saved.  When Franzone went public with his pledge to remain abstinent to donate blood, he received a Facebook message from a mother whose son was born with a congenital heart defect. Her gay family members and friends became her support network while her son was on life support in the ICU, where he stayed for four months. When she learned that they couldn’t donate the blood her son needed to stay alive, she wrote, she was “heartbroken.” She had no idea. “We saw firsthand how unfair and unjust policies kept some of the kindest, most caring men from helping, and made them feel lesser,” the woman wrote. Her son, who receives frequent blood transfusions, turned four this year. In the donation room of the Red Cross, the walls are plastered with photos featuring the smiling faces of those impacted by the sacrifices of men and women who took the time out to give. There’s the happy toddler with her hair in a messy ponytail who has had 100 transfusions in four years, and the woman who needed an emergency donation to save her life following a skiing accident. And if the FDA could only ditch outdated stigma and catch up to modern science, more of these stories will get to be told. In This Article:

657379558,2017-01-15 00:15:00,"Aurora, Colorado: Small Town Shaken by ‘Dark Knight’ Shooting",http://www.thedailybeast.com/aurora-colorado-small-town-shaken-by-dark-knight-shooting,en,False,,1707,Daily Beast,http://www.thedailybeast.com/,"SEARCH What is Aurora really like? Kevin Fallon reports on the city that was once one of the safest in America. Senior Entertainment Reporter Aurora, Colo., is a city of superlatives. It’s appeared on Men’s Health magazine’s list of best cities for men five years in a row. U.S. News and World Report recently ranked five of the specialties at the University of Colorado Hospital as among the best in the nation. Sports Illustrated named it Colorado’s best “Sportstown” in 2003. In December 2011, Forbes declared it the ninth-safest city in America. Just seven months later, Aurora adds another superlative to its list: the site of the worst mass shooting in the U.S. since the 2009 attack at Fort Hood, Texas, and the deadliest in Colorado since Columbine. A 24-year-old gunman named James Holmes, a former University of Colorado graduate student, reportedly opened fire at the audience attending a packed midnight screening of the hotly anticipated summer blockbuster The Dark Knight Rises Thursday night, killing 12 people and leaving at least 50 injured. It’s a particularly startling turn of events for a city that, according to FBI crime statistics, had only six killings in all of 2011, making Aurora the cruelest of clichés: the quiet town rocked by unspeakable tragedy. “People are in shock,” says Melanie Zeitler, director of development and marketing at the Plains Conservation Center in Aurora. “It’s such a horrific crime that it’s just kind of unfathomable to hear of it happening anywhere, let alone five or seven miles from where you work.” To hear people describe Aurora as a sort of suburban utopia, it’s easy to believe their surprise. It’s the third-largest city in Colorado—population just over 325,000—and the quintessential All-American city. It’s less than 10 miles from the urban sprawl of Denver, yet it’s a High Plains city with picturesque views of the Rocky Mountains. It’s home to the Buckley Air Force Base, populating the city with more than 12,000 military personnel and their families. Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman both have large outposts there. Smack dab in the middle of town is the Plains Conservation Center, a 1,100-acre prairie reserve where one of the largest herds of pronghorns in North America roam free as if on the Serengeti—yet just six miles away is the bustling Town Center at Aurora mall, with its Macy’s, Sears, and Century 16 movie theater, where the deadly shooting took place. “Aurora blends a rural setting with an urban feel,” says Gary Wheat, president and CEO of Visit Aurora, the city’s tourism board. “You feel like you know everyone, but again it’s a city of almost 330,000 people and has all the services that demands.” By some respects, the town is ubiquitously suburban. Just across the street from Century 16 is a Target. The parking lot for Sears has a T.G.I. Friday’s restaurant in it. Strip malls and shopping plazas dot the center of the city. The housing, largely, is in pop-up communities, “cookie-cutter things that are typical of suburbia,” says Zeitler. There are a “plethora” of megachurches and 10 golf courses. No proper Auroran would be caught out on a winter Sunday without their navy and orange on, prepping for the Denver Broncos football game. Want to take advantage of the dozens of hiking trails? Feel free—Aurora averages 300 days of sunshine a year. Now? The town included on U.S. News and World Report’s list of 10 Winter Wonderlands for Retirement, America’s Promise Alliance’s roster of Best Communities for Young People, and—it bears mentioning again—the Forbes list of safest cities has been invaded by a circus of media reporters and gawkers. The busy intersections surrounding the Town Center mall and Holmes’s apartment building have been cordoned off by police tape, shut down completely. “This obviously takes the breath away of everyone in the city,” Wheat says. Tonight, less than 24 hours since tragedy struck, between 400 and 500 people—an extremely large gathering by Aurora’s standard—are expected to attend the Eighth Annual Hops for Habitat Festival at the Plains Conservation Center, a beer festival with tastings from 16 microbreweries and two food trucks, and which will feature prairie wagon rides and a campfire marshmallow roast. The current mood in Aurora isn’t exactly what its organizers expected when they planned the supposed-to-be-jovial affair. “We’re sort of hoping that it’s a community galvanizing event,” says Zeitler, who helped plan the festival. “People need to come together and grieve as a community and also celebrate the fact that life is fragile.” But don’t expect Aurora to forget recent events any time soon. “I look back at Columbine, which also happened in Colorado,”  says Zeitler. “It was years of grieving and healing. You still hear the name Columbine and it elicits all kinds of things. People in Aurora are resilient, but while we can heal, we don’t forget. For a long time, there will be many stark reminders of how delicate life is.”"
575125054,2017-02-01 13:28:31,Fox News Retracts Tweets Implying Quebec City Mass Shooter Was Muslim,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/motherjones/main/~3/Ge6tXjHV6Ks/fox-news-false-tweets-retraction-quebec-city-mosque-shooter,en,False,,1112,Mother Jones,http://www.motherjones.com/,"Fox News has retracted and apologized for three tweets misidentifying the suspect in the massacre at a Quebec City mosque on Sunday night as a Moroccan. Quebec authorities initially indicated on Monday that they had two suspects in custody, but soon clarified that the sole suspect in the killings was a white Canadian man. Although Fox News updated its story with that information on Monday, the network’s erroneous tweets remained online, pointing to a person identified by authorities as Mohamed el Khadir as the perpetrator. In fact, the sole suspect in the attack was 27-year-old Alexandre Bissonnette, who was reported to be a right-wing extremist and vocal supporter of Donald Trump. A day after Mother Jones first reported on the erroneous Fox News tweets—which collectively were retweeted thousands of times before their removal—the director of communications for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sent an email to Fox News calling for a retraction and rebuking the network for allowing “false and misleading language” to continue circulating: These tweets by Fox News dishonour the memory of the six victims and their families by spreading misinformation, playing identity politics, and perpetuating fear and division within our communities. We need to remain focused on keeping our communities safe and united instead of trying to build walls and scapegoat communities. Muslims are predominantly the greatest victims of terrorist acts around the world. To paint terrorists with a broad brush that extends to all Muslims is not just ignorant — it is irresponsible. (See the full text of the email from Trudeau’s communications director, Kate Purchase, in her timeline.) In a statement emailed to Mother Jones, the managing director of FoxNews.com, Refet Kaplan, said: “FoxNews.com initially corrected the misreported information with a tweet and an update to the story on Monday. The earlier tweets have now been deleted. We regret the error.” The earliest information to emerge as a mass shooting unfolds almost always contains inaccuracies, a well-known fact in newsrooms. Two of the Fox News tweets highlighting the unconfirmed identity of the shooter as a Moroccan were posted on its primary account, which has 13 million followers, and remained online for more than a day. A third tweet, posted on anchor Bret Baier’s Twitter feed for his show “Special Report,” was removed on Wednesday morning. It had circulated widely since Monday, after being retweeted by Donald Trump Jr. (See all three tweets here.) On his show Monday night, Baier appeared to remain focused on the shooting suspect as a Moroccan—even after his own correspondent reported otherwise on the air. “Bret, in the aftermath of this attack there was a great deal of confusion and contradictory reports,” said Fox correspondent David Lee Miller, reporting from Quebec City. “Initially it was said that there were two shooters. Now authorities are saying there was only one, and just a short time ago the suspect was brought into court. He is identified as Alexandre Bissonnette.” Miller described Bissonnette’s age and the murder charges brought against him. Then he added: “We are told he had been a student at a local university here, and that he had what are described as extreme right-wing views.” Miller also went on to say that the mosque had previously faced anti-Muslim harassment, including reports of it being vandalized with swastikas and the delivery of a pig’s head to the building last summer. After Miller’s reporting of all these details, Baier responded: “And just to be clear, David Lee, one of them is Moroccan? Do we know anything more about the background?” Miller again emphasized that el Khadir had by then been identified as a witness to the shooting, not a suspect: “The man described as the Moroccan was someone who was worshiping inside the mosque when the gunfire erupted.” “OK, that’s a good point to make,” said Baier.

STR Five people were killed and a dozen more injured when gunfire broke out during the final night of the BPM Festival, an EDM music fest in Playa del Carmen, Mexico. The shooting took place at around 3:30 a.m. local time outside a venue called the Blue Parrot, which was hosting the closing party of the BPM fest. “It is with great sadness to share that police have confirmed reports of a lone shooter outside the Blue Parrot nightclub in Playa del Carmen earlier today, which resulted in four fatalities and 12 injured,” BPM said in a statement. The four victims were shot to death, while a subsequent fifth victim was trampled to death in the ensuing chaos, according to the New York Times. “The violence began on 12th street in front of the club and three members of the BPM security team were among those whose lives were lost while trying to protect patrons inside the venue.” Related

""On a damn Facebook Live video made public Wednesday, they allegedly kidnapped a mentally challenged white man, beat him, humiliated him, cut his hair, and yelled 'f—k Donald Trump' and 'f—k white people' while filming it for the world to see. . . ."" Almost every journalist reporting on the case agreed about its ""truly awful"" nature. There was more to discuss, however. What made this a hate crime? Were media outlets careful enough about not jumping to conclusions? Did they allow false accusations about Black Lives Matter involvement to tarnish their coverage? Is Facebook's new technology an enabler? How did this crime fit into the ""big picture"" of today's culture? How did the journalists react viscerally? ""I just arrived back in America this morning after a week away and just watched the video moments ago,"" King's column continued. ""It’s awful. I have deep empathy for the victim. Twenty years ago, a racist mob of young white men beat me so badly that I missed 18 months of high school recovering from three spinal surgeries and fractures to my face and ribs. ""I hate violence. Nearly 100 people are killed with guns per day in this country. Every 98 seconds someone is sexually assaulted in this country. Hate crimes are on the rise from coast to coast. Our incoming President of the United States admitted that he sexually assaults women. Women all over the country came forward to allegedly confirm it. His first wife, in a sworn deposition, said that he raped and brutally assaulted her. Ivana Trump later said she didn’t want the allegation to be considered in a literal or criminal sense. ""This country is sick. . . ."" Listen up!Incredibly portable, easy to pull out on the fly, and compatible with all your Apple devices. Al Tompkins of the Poynter Institute gave good marks to broadcast outlets. ""For news directors in Chicago, the video posed several questions,"" Tompkins wrote Thursday. ""First, how much of it should they show to the public, if they decided to show it at all? To what extent should the identities of the assailants or the victim be obscured? And in the early hours, how should they treat a video that was published publicly but hadn't yet been verified by police? . . ."" Tompkins also wrote, ""Chicago media have become sadly proficient in using violent video thoughtfully as a result of the Laquan McDonald shooting, where a dash-cam captured a Chicago police officer shooting 16 rounds at the 17-year-old. The video was initially everywhere, but as time passed, stations scaled back its use. ""For all the criticism journalists get for exploiting and sensationalizing awful events, journalists in Chicago are putting a lot of thought into delivering this graphic news responsibly. . . ."" The role of the Facebook Live feature was the subject of a piece by Dylan Byers for CNN Money. ""In 2017, Facebook's role as a disseminator of news will face even more scrutiny,"" Byers wrote Thursday. ""On Wednesday, four people in Chicago bound and gagged a man with special needs, then beat and tortured him — and they broadcast the whole thing on Facebook Live, allowing people all over the world to watch in real time. ""The Facebook Live feature, which the company has been promoting in television ads and on billboards as a way to share fun or uplifting videos with friends, was now being used as a means to broadcast torture. ""The video was eventually taken down. 'We do not allow people to celebrate or glorify crimes on Facebook and have removed the original video for this reason,' a spokesperson told CNNMoney. ""Still, Facebook acknowledges 'the unique challenges of live video.' The broadcasts are live, after all, and almost impossible to prevent before they start. ""This presents Facebook with a dilemma: Will it simply show everything, or will it acknowledge the responsibilities that come with being a media company and hire editors who can supervise the content and decide in real time what is important and newsworthy and what must be taken down as inappropriate? . . ."" Black columnists focused on the crime itself and the administration of equal justice. Mary Mitchell wrote Thursday in the Chicago Sun-Times, "". . . let’s be clear. As ugly as the assault upon the special needs young man was, this incident pales in comparison to what happened in Joliet in 2013. ""Then, an even more depraved group of young white people lured Terrance Rankins and Eric Glover, two African-Americans, into a Joliet house, strangled them and then had sex on top of the corpses. ""Adam Landerman, Alisa Massaro, Joshua Miner and Bethany McKee were each charged with first-degree murder and attempting to dismember the bodies. ""Although the victims were black and the attackers white, a spokesman for the Will County state’s attorney’s office said at the time that prosecutors were unsure whether race was a factor in the murder. ""Where was the outrage then? . . ."" King echoed that theme in the Daily News. ""I speak out on injustice. What happened to this man in Chicago was terrible. It was criminal. I hate it, but guess what — justice was swift. It was miraculously swift,"" King wrote. ""Justice is always swift and easy when black folk mess up, but you know who’s not in jail right now? George Zimmerman. ""You know who’s not in jail right now? The officers who fired 41 shots at and killed Amadou Diallo on the doorstep of his Bronx home. . . ."" King then added more names to his litany. In the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Friday, Tony Norman wrote that perhaps ""hate crime"" should be redefined. ""Much of the talk surrounding this case has been consumed with whether the suspects should be charged with a hate crime. They were charged with hate crimes on Thursday. Hate crime charges are a no-brainer as far as I’m concerned. I’m not a lawyer and there may be nuances of the way bias crimes are prosecuted that I’m not aware of, but if you tie someone up, assault them and mock them for their race, it feels like a hate crime to me. ""Then again, some blacks in Chicago appear to be equal-opportunity assaulters as the murder rate of other blacks in that town will attest. In a way, those daily murders are 'hate crimes,' too, but they’re not rooted in racial animus per se. They’re rooted in evil, stupidity, pride and gang affiliation. The end result is hateful and certainly [constitutes] a crime. I’m sure there’s a lot of black self-hatred wrapped up in every murder that’s taken place in Chicago in recent years. . . .""

The conspiracy also used a picture of an entirely different man named Esteban Santiago — not the alleged shooter.

Herbert Lowe, a professional in residence at Marquette University in Milwaukee and a past president of the National Association of Black Journalists, and his wife, Mira, a senior editor at CNN Digital in Atlanta who is also active in NABJ, are leaving their respective jobs to work in the same place. ""Alas, my wife Mira and I have only lived and worked in the same city for 10 months since we left Newsday in New York, as an editor and reporter, respectively, just about 10 years ago,"" Herbert Lowe wrote Friday on medium.com. ""Honestly, those 10 months (in 2009) were when I wasn’t employed full-time. So, with that in mind, we are pleased to share that we have accepted positions with the University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications (CJC) in Gainesville. . . ."" The school announced that ""journalism stalwart and veteran educator Mira Lowe has been named the new director of the Innovation News Center (INC), the College’s award-winning multimedia newsroom. ""Lowe, a senior editor at CNN Digital in Atlanta, will lead a team of seven news professionals and more than 500 student journalists each year to provide local news coverage for 17 North Central Florida counties. The 100-seat INC is one of the largest student newsrooms in the country — developing and distributing news, weather and sports content across the College’s owned-and-operated television, radio and digital properties, including the local PBS, NPR and ESPN affiliates. The INC director serves as both executive editor and news director. . . . "" It also said, ""Herbert Lowe will join the College as a lecturer in journalism and director of its Summer Media Institute. . . . ""As a lecturer, Lowe will teach a range of digital journalism and other courses on the undergraduate and graduate levels. The Summer Media Institute is an annual five-night, six-day camp in which students are immersed into the world of journalism and communications. . . ."" Mira Lowe starts on Jan. 27; Herbert Lowe begins this summer. They met in 1997 at the New York Association of Black Journalists annual dinner. The Atlantic magazine announced Friday that it is reprinting its January/February issue, with the cover story ""My President Was Black"" by Ta-Nehisi Coates. But the reprint will contain an error that Native Americans say is all too common. In his 17,000-word piece, Coates wrote, ""African Americans rank at the bottom of nearly every major socioeconomic measure in the country."" According to the U.S. Census Bureau, that dubious distinction belongs to Native Americans. For example, the 2015 American Community Survey shows that: The percentage of those enrolled in preschool or nursery school who are ""African American or black (alone)"" is 6.1 percent; for American Indian or Alaska Native alone, 5.7 percent. For those in college or graduate school, the figures are ""African American or black (alone),"" 28.3 percent; American Indian or Alaska Native alone, 21.4 percent. For those with less than a high school diploma, African American or black, 15.3 percent; American Indian or Alaska Native alone, 20.9 percent. Graduate or professional degree, African American or black, 7.5 percent; American Indian or Alaska Native alone, 4.8 percent. Grandparents responsible for grandchildren as a percentage of living with grandchildren, African American or black, 42.4 percent; American Indian or Alaska Native alone, 50.5 percent. Not in labor force: African American or black, 38 percent; American Indian or Alaska Native alone, 41.9 percent. No health insurance coverage: African American or black, 11 percent; American Indian or Alaska Native alone, 20.7 percent. Poverty rates for families and people for whom poverty status is determined: Identical for both groups at 21.6 percent for ""all families."" Those with a computer: African American or black, 80.2 percent; American Indian or Alaska Native, 76.5 percent. Bryan Pollard, Cherokee, president of the Native American Journalists Association, told Journal-isms by telephone Friday that the omission of Native Americans in such statements is ""fairly common. ""With all due respect to Mr. Coates, I would suggest that he make an appointment to visit an Indian reservation. The level of profound poverty found on so many Indian reservations is difficult to comprehend in the midst of the world's most affluent nation."" The invisibility of Native Americans is not new. Indians have complained that police violence against members of their communities does not receive its fair share of coverage. Last year, when a gunman killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, media outlets quickly dubbed it ""the worst mass shooting in U.S. history,"" ignoring earlier mass shootings of African Americans and Native Americans. On Dec. 29, 1890, for example, as many as 300 Lakota men, women and children were slaughtered by the 7th Cavalry at Wounded Knee. (Tim Giago, founder of the Native American Journalists Association, is raising money for a ""Holocaust Memorial"" there.) The Atlantic is reprinting its second magazine issue in six months, both due to high newsstand sales and record December subscriptions to The Atlantic, the publication said in a news release. ""Last summer, The Atlantic made the then-unprecedented step to put the July/August issue of the magazine back on press to meet newsstand demand."" ""The Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde has joined an increasing number of other Native American Tribes nationwide in adopting an Independent Press Ordinance that will codify that the Tribal news publication has the independence to report Grand Ronde news objectively and free from undue political influence by Tribal elected officials,"" the Native American Journalists Association announced Thursday from Grand Ronde, Ore. The news is significant because ""a free press is the exception and not the rule"" in Indian Country, NAJA President Bryan Pollard, Cherokee, told Journal-isms by telephone on Friday. The association applauded the tribal government for ""putting these protections in place so they can practice [journalism] free from fear of retaliation,"" Pollard said. Reporting on the Dec. 28 decision, Smoke Signals, the tribal publication, said, ""The new ordinance establishes a free and independent press and ensures Smoke Signals has the independence to report Tribal news objectively. ""The new ordinance will establish an Editorial Board, which will supervise the editor of Smoke Signals. Currently, the Tribe’s Publications Coordinator reports to the Tribal Council Chief of Staff, who is a direct report to Tribal Council. ""The Editorial Board, according to the ordinance, will consist of between three to five members with a majority being Grand Ronde Tribal members. Current Tribal employees are allowed to serve on the Editorial Board, but a majority of the board must be non-employees. . . ."" ""The next person to lead the city's long-running alt-weekly is one that loyal readers — and city residents who used to live in Charlotte — will recognize,"" Thomas Wheatley reported Thursday for Atlanta's Creative Loafing. ""Carlton Hargro, who oversaw CL’s culture coverage in the mid-2000s and led our former sister paper in the Queen City, will return to the publication as editor-in-chief. His first day is Jan. 17."" Hargro is likely the only African American top editor of what are known as alternative newsweeklies and websites. Jason Zaragoza, interim executive director of the Association of Alternative Newsmedia, told Journal-isms that he could think of only two others who had ever been top editors: W. Kim Heron, editor of Metro Times in Detroit from 2006 to 2012 and previously managing editor of the paper, and Adamma Ince, editor of Philadelphia Weekly from 2008 to 2012. Wheatley also wrote, "" 'Taking on the role of editor-in-chief at Creative Loafing is beyond a dream come true,' Hargro says. 'It's an honor to grab the reins behind a slew of incredible editors — like the paper's most recent EIC, Debbie Michaud. I'm dedicated to continuing that long legacy of great journalism, along with pushing CL deeper into digital and other platforms. Keep your eyes peeled for more details on all the great stuff we have planned.' ""The Ball State University graduate, who will become the first black editor-in-chief in CL's history, has worked in various roles throughout his journalism career in Atlanta, which began in 1997 at the Atlanta Tribune. In 2004, he joined CL and oversaw the culture section, assigning and editing articles about the city’s arts scene. In addition, he created, produced, and hosted Audiofloss, CL’s urban music podcast. ""Two years later, he moved to Charlotte to lead that city’s edition of CL. . . ."" ""President Barack Obama says he's concerned about Republican commentators who appear to side with Russia over the US, saying Russian President Vladimir Putin should not be trusted,"" Kevin Liptak reported Friday for CNN. "" 'What is true is that the Russians intended to meddle and they meddled,' Obama told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos in an interview that aired Friday. 'One of the things I am concerned about is the degree to which we've seen a lot of commentary lately where there are Republicans or pundits or cable commentators who seem to have more confidence in Vladimir Putin than fellow Americans because those fellow Americans are Democrats.' . . ."" Chris Ariens reported for TVNewser, ""The sit-down will air Sunday on This Week as well as on Monday’s editions of Good Morning America, World News Tonight and Nightline. . . ."" Commentators from the left, such as Glenn Greenwald of the Intercept, have also questioned the intelligence agencies' reports of Russian meddling. Greenwald recently wrote, ""[I]n my 10-plus years of writing about politics on an endless number of polarizing issues — including the [Edward] Snowden reporting — nothing remotely compares to the smear campaign that has been launched as a result of the work I’ve done questioning and challenging claims about Russian hacking and the threat posed by that country generally,"" the radio and television show ""Democracy Now!"" reported on Friday. The founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, an ally of Greenwald, has denied that Russia was the source of the emails it published. However, an extraordinary report released by the nation’s top intelligence agencies Friday concluded “with high confidence” that Russia’s main military intelligence unit, the G.R.U., created a “persona” called Guccifer 2.0 and a website, DCLeaks.com, to release the emails of the Democratic National Committee and of the chairman of the Clinton campaign, John D. Podesta, Michael D. Shear and David E. Sanger reported for the New York Times. ""When those disclosures received what was seen as insufficient attention, the report said, the G.R.U. 'relayed material it acquired from the D.N.C. and senior Democratic officials to WikiLeaks.' . . .” Meanwhile, ""The Trump administration will respect the use of a protective press pool and will continue to allow the media to fly with the President on Air Force One, members of the incoming White House communications team told representatives of The White House Correspondents Association on Thursday,"" Hadas Gold reported for Politico. ""The incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and incoming Communications Director Sean Spicer have indicated there will be changes to how the Trump White House interacts with the media, potentially altering the daily press briefing and which outlets sit where in the White House briefing room.

""Watters frequently attracted controversy in that role, including twice last fall.

""This was supposed to be the awards season when Hollywood, having been scorched by consecutive #OscarsSoWhite years, avoided tumult over race,"" Brooks Barnes reported Wednesday for the New York Times. ""Not so. ""In heated conversations in Hollywood in recent weeks, prompted by articles on websites like The Daily Beast, Mic and ThinkProgress, producers, publicists, studio executives and other movie insiders have been grappling with whether there is a double standard at play — involving race, power or both — in the treatment of Nate Parker, a relatively unknown artist who has been sidelined as an Academy Award candidate, and Casey Affleck, the brother of moviedom royalty who is being feted as the leading contender for best actor. ""Mr. Parker, the force behind the slave-revolt film 'The Birth of a Nation,' faced intense scrutiny in August, including from The New York Times, when new details surfaced concerning a case in which he was accused — and later acquitted — of raping a fellow student while at Penn State nearly two decades ago. ""The media storm, made worse by several contentious interviews given by Mr. Parker, 37, resulted in a poor performance at the box office for his film and its shunning on the seasonal awards circuit. While heralded at festivals, the film received mixed reviews upon release. ""Mr. Affleck, 41, has not received similar scrutiny over two sexual harassment suits that were filed against him by two women in 2010 in civil court. At the time, a lawyer for Mr. Affleck, who plays a sorrowful New England handyman in the celebrated drama 'Manchester by the Sea,' denied the accusations as 'desperate, fabricated claims' and called them an 'extortion tactic.' Nothing was proved. Ultimately, he settled for undisclosed sums. ""Mr. Affleck’s performance has continued to rack up accolades, despite fresh attention on the 2010 lawsuits by the news media. (Asked about them by The Times for an article in November, he responded: 'It was settled to the satisfaction of all. I was hurt and upset — I am sure all were — but I am over it.') More than two dozen critics’ groups and festivals have named him best actor for his 'Manchester by the Sea' performance. He is up for a Golden Globe on Sunday and a Screen Actors Guild award on Jan. 29. ""Why do the two men find themselves in much different circumstances? ""Perhaps people think Mr. Affleck’s performance, and the movie in which he stars, is better. Maybe it’s because, as an Oscar nominee and the brother of the box-office star Ben Affleck, Mr. Affleck has attained a privileged status in Hollywood; the power surrounding him may make people reluctant to openly criticize him. Certainly a factor is the fact that there was unsettling new information revealed about Mr. Parker’s rape case in August — that his accuser later committed suicide — while there have been no new disclosures regarding Mr. Affleck’s cases. ""Or maybe, say those mindful of Hollywood’s checkered racial history, it is because Mr. Affleck is white and Mr. Parker is black. . . ."" The declining fortunes of New Jersey's newspapers ""are part of a retrenchment in newspaper publishing across the country, but they have been acutely felt because of New Jersey newspapers’ role in holding powerful institutions and people accountable in a state that lacks a major independent television station,"" David W. Chen reported Tuesday for the New York Times. ""The timing also could not be worse, given all the news in the past year related to [Gov. Chris] Christie, terrorism, crumbling infrastructure and the sizable local presence of President-elect Donald J. Trump. . . ."" Dave Harmon, chief people officer at Gannett Co. Inc., wrote to employees Tuesday, ""It has come to my attention that some of you may have received an automated email from ExitSurvey@Gannett,"" retired media blogger Jim Romenesko tweeted on Wednesday. ""The email states you 'will be leaving the company in the near future' and also has an exit interview attached. Please disregard any emails ExitSurvey@Gannett and there is no need to respond. We are currently working to troubleshoot the issue and will have it resolvedCit as soon as possible."" New York Times Pentagon correspondent Helene Cooper was in a motorcade for Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, in Cameroon last April as a motorcade vehicle struck and killed six-year-old Toussaint Birwe, Cooper told Times readers on Thursday. Cooper said she stumbled when asked why she wrote about the incident. ""This is what I should have said, but didn’t: We went back and wrote about Toussaint because The New York Times believes that African lives are as important as American ones.

575559981,2017-02-02 04:58:00,"On LGBT rights, Trump seems willing to anger Christian right &#8212; but activists aren&#8217;t convinced",http://www.salon.com/2017/02/02/on-lgbt-rights-trump-seems-willing-to-anger-christian-right-but-activists-arent-convinced/,en,False,,1757,Salon,http://www.salon.com/,"Donald Trump hasn’t yet been president for two weeks, but already he has taken numerous actions to fulfill promises he made as a presidential candidate. He has set the repeal of Obamacare in motion, implemented a travel ban for immigrants and visitors from certain Muslim-majority countries and worked closely with a conservative legal affairs group to nominate a Supreme Court justice. While Trump’s swift actions in his early presidency have thrilled his voter base and many Republicans, there is one right-wing constituency that surely must be disappointed: conservatives who hope to roll back the expansion of LGBT rights. It’s far too soon to write off the religious right as a political force. But it has become apparent by now that the Trump's administration has departed from traditional Republican politics when it comes to his party's unease with gays and lesbians, who overwhelmingly vote Democratic. There were indications of this during his presidential campaign, as Trump played both sides of the fence in an unconventional fashion. He met with strongly anti-gay Christian nationalists and courted religious conservatives, yet also expressed openness to LGBT rights advocates. In February of last year, early in the GOP primary season, the former reality-TV star assured viewers of Pat Robertson’s Christian Broadcasting Network that he would find a way to repeal the Supreme Court's  “shocking” Obergefell v. Hodges decision that gave same-sex couples the right to marry nationwide. In August Trump spoke before a gathering of an avowedly Christian supremacist organization that seeks to have members of its faith in complete control of the government. At the same time, however, Trump sought the votes of lesbians and gays, particularly after the June 12 mass shooting at a gay nightclub called Pulse in Orlando. Since that day, Trump has tried to argue that his anti-terrorism policies would protect sexual minorities. His campaign even opened a field office across the street from Pulse. He even adopted that message in his prime-time Republican National Convention speech. “As your president I will do everything in my power to protect LGBTQ citizens,” he said, before congratulating the crowd for offering some modest applause. Trump also allowed prominent gay Republican Peter Thiel to proclaim, “I’m proud to be gay” from the stage, something that would have been unthinkable at any prior GOP convention. Since winning the presidential election, Trump has made it clear that despite his campaign promises to Christian nationalists, he largely intends to ignore their wishes, at least when it comes to LGBT issues. In a November interview with CBS, Trump called the issue of marriage rights for same-sex couples “irrelevant” and “already settled” by the Obergefell v. Hodges decision. “It’s law. It was settled in the Supreme Court. I mean, it’s done,” he told “60 Minutes” correspondent Lesley Stahl. “And I’m fine with that.” Trump further angered the Christian right this week when he went back on his promise to repeal “every single Obama executive order” by refusing to revoke a 2014 regulation signed by his predecessor that prohibited federal contractors from discriminating against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees. In a statement released by the White House on Tuesday, the administration said that the president “is determined to protect the rights of all Americans, including the LGBTQ community.” In addition, “President Trump continues to be respectful and supportive of LGBTQ rights, just as he was throughout the election,” the statement continued. “The President is proud to have been the first ever GOP nominee to mention the LGBTQ community in his nomination acceptance speech, pledging then to protect the community from violence and oppression.” The decision to keep the Obama executive order intact was hailed by gay and lesbian Republicans. “Donald Trump campaigned promising to be a ‘real friend’ to the LGBT community, and now President Trump is delivering on that commitment,” said the president of the Log Cabin Republicans, Gregory T. Angelo. “Log Cabin Republicans is proud to have directly advocated for this important preservation of LGBT equality in the federal workforce.” Despite Trump's departures from Republican orthodoxy, however, many left-leaning LGBT activists remain unconvinced that Trump is a reliable ally. There is some evidence for that opinion. After initially saying he would oppose North Carolina’s anti-transgender bathroom bill, Trump reversed himself in July, claiming that he was “going with the state” instead. Since being elected, he has not mentioned the controversy. Many of Trump’s top advisers have been staunch opponents of LGBT rights throughout their careers, including attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions and Tom Price, secretary-designate for the Department of Health and Human Services. Vice President Mike Pence is also infamous among activists for his long record of opposing LGBT equality and for signing a bill as governor of Indiana that allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBT customers on religious grounds. Activists are also concerned about Trump’s nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, noting that his opinions on two cases indicate a willingness to let religious people be exempt from laws that they consider violate their faith. “Judge Gorsuch gained national attention for his opinions in two federal cases supporting an employer’s right to refuse to pay for contraception as part of employee health coverage if doing so violates the employer’s religious beliefs,"" said Equality California's executive director, Rick Zbur, in a news release. ""That bodes ill for LGBT people who are facing an onslaught of laws sanctioning discrimination in the name of religious liberty.” That assessment was shared by Rachel Tiven, CEO of Lambda Legal, a gay rights advocacy group. “The Hobby Lobby decision set a terrible and destructive standard for bosses being allowed to meddle in our sex lives and decide whether or not birth control is covered by the employer’s insurance plan,” she said in a public statement, referencing one of the cases that Gorsuch had heard concerning religious exemptions. Tiven added: In Judge Gorsuch’s decision, he calls the inclusion of health coverage that includes birth control  —  ""complicity . . . in the wrongdoing of others."" Even the Supreme Court, affirming that case, acknowledged how dangerous this line of thinking is: it creates a nation in which some religions are obliged to follow the law and others are not. Troublingly, Judge Gorsuch does not even see this as a problem. Gorsuch has not, however, directly ruled on any cases related to LGBT rights so there is no clarity or certainty about his attitudes on the subject. Some religious conservatives, meanwhile, are incensed about the direction the GOP appears to be moving under President Trump. “God isn’t smiling on this one,” wrote Free Republic member “Maudeen” in response to Trump’s failure to roll back Obama's LGBT executive order. “Do you think the President earnestly prayed about this before making his announcement?” “I don't think President Trump has ever earnestly prayed about anything,” wrote member Drew68 in reply.

Yes we can.’ President Barack Obama took to the stage Tuesday night for his farewell speech in Chicago, the city where he said he “learned that change only happens when ordinary people get involved, get engaged, and come together to demand it.” The former state senator from the South Side took the stage at McCormick Place at 8 p.m. and spoke for just over 50 minutes. Obama walked in to the U2 song “City of Blinding Lights,” the same song he walked out to when he first won election. “Hello Chicago,” the president proclaimed. “It’s good to be home.” Within minutes, the crowd began chanting “Four more years!” Obama responded, “I can’t do that.” “I first came to Chicago when I was in my early twenties, still trying to figure out who I was; still searching for a purpose to my life.  It was in neighborhoods not far from here where I began working with church groups in the shadows of closed steel mills. “It was on these streets where I witnessed the power of faith, and the quiet dignity of working people in the face of struggle and loss.  This is where I learned that change only happens when ordinary people get involved, get engaged, and come together to demand it. “After eight years as your President, I still believe that.  And it’s not just my belief.  It’s the beating heart of our American idea – our bold experiment in self-government.” The president told the crowd, “By almost every measure, America is a better stronger place than it was when we started.” Best President that I can remember in my lifetime. Reuters: Russia hacked Republican state campaigns but not Trump's: FBI head by Dustin Volz and Jonathan Landay Russia hacked into Republican state political campaigns and old email domains of the Republican National Committee but there is no evidence it successfully penetrated President-elect Donald Trump's campaign, FBI Director James Comey said on Tuesday. Comey also told lawmakers Russia did not release information obtained from the state campaigns or the old RNC email domains, comments that may buttress the U.S. intelligence view that Moscow tried to help Trump against Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign. U.S. intelligence agencies on Friday released an assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a covert effort to help Republican Trump's electoral chances by discrediting Clinton. The report, which omitted classified details, was the U.S. government's starkest public description of what it says was a Russian effort to manipulate the American electoral process by leaking hacked emails from Democrats. Russia has denied interfering in the election but President Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian suspected spies from the United States and imposed sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies last month in response to the allegations. Defense Secretary Ash Carter told a news conference on Tuesday those penalties were ""a start and not the end"" of U.S. retaliation for the hacks, and senior officials have suggested covert action may be taken. Comey told lawmakers the Federal Bureau of Investigation ""did not develop any evidence that the Trump campaign, or the current RNC, was successfully hacked."" He did not say whether Russia had tried to hack Trump's campaign. Remember this: It happened: @Cubs win World Series. That's change even this South Sider can believe in. Want to come to the White House before I leave? Chicago Tribune: Cubs to visit White House on Monday by Mark Gonzalez The Cubs will continue one of sports' most treasured honors for a champion by visiting the White House on Monday. The Cubs will be honored for their first World Series title since 1908, a source confirmed Tuesday night. The visit holds special significance, since President Barack Obama developed his political roots in Chicago and will have the distinction of honoring the Cubs in the White House just days before leaving office on Jan. 20. In addition, Cubs co-owner Laura Ricketts and President Theo Epstein are supporters of the president. The Cubs' visit will occur after the annual Cubs Convention this weekend, which nearly all of the members of the World Series team will attend. The White House and then-President George W. Bush hosted the White Sox after they won the 2005 World Series. The Cubs' visit was first reported by Mary Ann Ahern of NBC-5. The Post and Courier: Dylann Roof sentenced to death for Emanuel AME Church massacre by Glenn Smith, Jennifer Barry Hawes and Abigail Darlington Just a few hours after he told a crowded courtroom, “I still feel like I had to do it,” Dylann Roof was sentenced to death by a federal jury Tuesday for carrying out the mass shooting inside Charleston's Emanuel AME Church in a bid to spark a race war. The 12-member panel – three black jurors, nine white – deliberated for a little less than three hours before unanimously deciding the 22-year-old self-avowed white supremacist should die for his crimes rather than spend his life in prison without the possibility of parole. U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel has scheduled a hearing for 9:30 a.m. Wednesday to formally impose that sentence and hear from loved ones who wish to address the killer. Roof, who sat stone-faced and silent through most of his hate crimes trial, showed no emotion as the jury’s verdict was read. During his closing argument earlier in the day, he passed on the chance to argue for his life, saying “I’m not sure what good that will do anyway.” The decision capped an anxious month and a half in Charleston as families of the dead and the community at-large waited to see how justice would be delivered in a case that shook the city to its core. The same jury that voted for death found Roof guilty in December of 33 federal offenses stemming from the mass shooting. Macomb Daily: Fewer flushes make a difference at sinkhole by Mitch Hotts The Fraser sinkhole and the Super Bowl have little in common, but officials working on the failed sewer line say there is a lesson to be learned from the big game. During the 2004 sewer collapse on 15 Mile in Sterling Heights, a short distance from the current site, workers noticed a sizable increase in sewage flow at one point in the game. “They found out all of a sudden there was a big flow moving through the sewer,” said Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller. “That’s because at halftime, everyone went to the bathroom, increasing the flow coming through the system.” That scenario illustrates the impact of conserving water during the sinkhole emergency in Fraser and communities in the Macomb Interceptor District (MID) that are served by the failed sewer pipe, which resulted in home evacuations and the shutdown of 15 Mile Road. With snow, melting snow, sleet and rain in the forecast this week, engineers and public officials are again asking residents in the MID to conserve water by flushing the toilet less often, using less water while brushing their teeth and running full loads of laundry. Those steps will lessen the amount of wastewater flow going through the sewer and lower the chances of discharging the waste into the Clinton River, which empties into Lake St. Clair. When a heavy rains soaked the area Dec. 26-27, millions of gallons of sewage were discharged into the river to prevent from sewage from backing up into residents’ basements. San Francisco Chronicle: ‘This is a big deal’: Storms could spell end to historic drought by Kurtis Alexander The storms barreling into California aren’t only flooding neighborhoods, ripping trees from the Earth and igniting roadway chaos. They’ve had the extraordinary effect of filling reservoirs that haven’t breached their brims in years and, for much of the north state, intensifying a rainy season that is finally, mercifully, driving an end to the historic drought. “In the very northern part of California, yes, the drought is over,” said Marty Ralph, director of the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes at UC San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography. “In the south, not so much.” Nearly 63 million gallons of water per minute poured into the Folsom Reservoir near Sacramento at one point over the rainy weekend, leaving dam operators at the long-dry basin releasing water in an act that has occurred just a few times in the past five years. The story was similar across the state, where California’s 154 major reservoirs on Tuesday held what they typically do at the beginning of February. AlJazeera: KKK members leave Klan after befriending black musician Ryan Rifai Daryl Davis, a renowned black American blues musician, took the initiative to reach out to members of the Ku Klux Klan, the US white supremacist organisation, which has led to more than 200 leaving the group. He has travelled across the country, sometimes with ex-KKK members, to give lectures aimed at curbing racism. Davis has written a book on the KKK called Klan-Destine Relationships. And an award-winning documentary about his unique efforts to combat racial hatred - Accidental Courtesy - is set to be aired across the United States in February. Hate acts have been on the rise in the US since president-elect Donald Trump, who made many statements against minority groups during the election campaign, saw a drastic rise in popularity last year. Davis talked to Al Jazeera about his journey in confronting the KKK, and what Trump's election means for the country. I applaud Mr. Davis in taking this initiative, of course. But I often find that when stories like this become known, many (if not most) white people seem to think that every black person should be able to take initiatives like this, as if there is some sort of genetic disposition to do this...just as many white folks seem to think that every black person should follow the example of, say, Dr. King. If you read the story, you might note that Mr. Davis’ background is not all that unlike President Obama's. Every black person isn’t like that; there are wide variations in experiences among black people just as there is among every other ethnicity on the planet. Mic: Smoking weed at Trump's inauguration? Police might look the other way. by Jack Smith IV On Donald Trump's Inauguration Day, there's going to be more in the air than factional tension. There'll be plumes of smoke from thousands of joints. Marijuana activists will be handing out pounds of free bud to draw attention to the legalization movement — and they're prepared to be arrested for it. It looks like the local authorities, however, will turn a blind eye to the weed smokers. This became evident on Tuesday when, according to the Associated Press, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said making marijuana-related arrests at counter-inaugural protests ""wouldn't be our first priority."" Local activists from DCMJ, a marijuana advocacy group that helped pass D.C.'s own legalization laws, are planning to hand out pre-rolled joints filled with sticky, high-quality, locally grown pot. Smoking, vaping or ingesting said weed at the inauguration isn't technically illegal — the city legalized weed by a ballot measure in 2014 — but smoking it at a protest is. Hypothetically, the Metropolitan Police Department could arrest protestors for smoking on the city's public land. At 10 a.m., the marijuana activists will march to the National Mall, where they could be arrested by federal police — the use of marijuana is illegal on federal land. If the arrests do come, DCMJ cofounder Nikolas Schiller told Mic, the organization is fully prepared. DCMJ wants to force Trump to clarify his stance on marijuana legislation, and in order to do that, it needs to make its point loud and clear. Hey, if smoking weed and catching contact highs gets bigger crowds that will better appreciate the “soft sensuality” of the presidential inauguration, I don’t think that PEOTUS would mind that, do you? New York Times: Republicans, Facing Pressure, Delay Hearings for 4 Trump Cabinet Nominees by Jennifer Steinhauer and Steve Eder WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans, under increasing pressure to ensure that President-elect Donald J. Trump’s nominees are fully vetted by federal authorities, have delayed the hearings of four potential cabinet members, three of whom have not been cleared by the agency charged with unraveling potential conflicts of interest. As frustrations over confirmations grow, a group that supports Republicans accused the ethics office and its leader — in a highly unusual attack on the nonpartisan agency — of politicizing a process long viewed by both parties as arduous but essential for anyone serving in government. Hearings for Betsy DeVos, Mr. Trump’s choice to lead the Department of Education; Andrew Puzder, his labor secretary nominee; and Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, Mr. Trump’s pick to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, have all been pushed back as Democrats clamor for more time to collect and review the standard background checks that nominees traditionally undergo before their hearings commence. Wilbur Ross, Mr. Trump’s pick for secretary of commerce, will also be delayed several days because his ethics agreement is not complete, according to the chairman and ranking Democrat of the commerce committee. The Guardian: Restaurants run by labor secretary nominee report 'disturbing' rates of sexual harassment​ by Oliver Laughland and Lauren Gambino Two-thirds of female fast food workers at restaurants operated by Andrew Puzder, Donald Trump’s controversial nomination for US labor secretary, experienced sexual harassment at work, a rate much higher than the industry average, a stinging advocacy survey has claimed. Many female workers, according to the research conducted by Restaurant Opportunities Center (Roc) United, have been harassed by customers referencing the highly sexualised advertising campaigns Puzder has championed as CEO of CKE Restaurants, the parent company of chains including Carl’s Jr and Hardee’s. “Customers have asked why I don’t dress like the women in the commercials,” one Tennessee-based Hardee’s employee told researchers. “I continually get notes left on tables from customers, customers flirt or ask me out,” said another Carl’s Jr employee in California. “I have also been followed outside the store by customers.” Puzder, CEO of the billion-dollar company since 2000, has staunchly defended his company’s notorious advertising that often features scantily dressed women eating burgers in scenes some have compared to pornography, arguing in 2011: “We believe in putting hot models in our commercials, because ugly ones don’t sell burgers.” Deutsche Welle: Call for 'prescription sex' highlights division among Germany's Greens by Kate Brady ""The start to this year is enough to make us tear our hair out,"" said Green party politician Boris Palmer on Monday. Going into Germany's election year, it's a far cry from the start the Green party would have hoped for. Within the first week of 2017, Green party co-chair Simone Peter had already been criticized by members of her own party for bemoaning the tactics of police patrolling the New Year's celebrations in Cologne. And just days later, the newly appointed justice minister for the state of Berlin, Dirk Behrendt, busied himself in his first document to the state parliament with the matter of unisex toilets in public buildings. Most recently, on Sunday the Greens hit the headlines again after the party's care policy spokeswoman, Elisabeth Scharfenberg, told the ""Welt am Sonntag"" newspaper that people with severe health issues should be able to claim sex with prostitutes as a medical expense - a concept already in place in the Netherlands. ""I can imagine a [public] financing of sexual assistance,"" she said. Local officials could provide information about ""offers of this kind in the area,"" as well as grant the necessary funds. Under the concept, patients would need to obtain a medical certificate confirming that they are unable to achieve sexual satisfaction in other ways, as well as prove they are unable to pay sex workers on their own. Well... BBC: India serial killings: Could 'house of horrors' accused be innocent? by Geeta Panday Ten years ago, India was gripped by serial murders in Noida, a wealthy suburb of the capital Delhi, where at least 19 children and women were raped and killed. Businessman Moninder Singh Pandher, in whose house the murders took place, and his manservant, Surinder Koli, were arrested for the crimes. Koli has since been convicted and sentenced to death in some of the cases, while the trial continues in the others. The businessman has been freed on bail. An explosive new documentary, The Karma Killings, which globally released on Tuesday on Netflix and other digital platforms, now argues that Mr Pandher may not be guilty. Indian-American filmmaker Ram Devineni, who spent more than three years investigating the Nithari crimes, was visiting relatives in India in December 2006 as the murders played out on news TV channels. ""I was reading the stories in the papers and magazines and watching it on TV, thinking this is too unbelievable. Every day, new revelations were being reported and each one stranger than the next,"" he told the BBC on the phone from New York. Many children had gone missing from the nearby slums of Nithari over the past two years and their parents alleged that police had ignored their complaints. Don’t forget that Mr. Meteor Blades is hosting an open thread for night owls this evening. May you have a night as soft and sensual as the upcoming presidential inauguration!"
773492228,2017-02-01 06:17:00,"FBI fears Police infiltrated by white supremacist ""Ghost Skins"" & sovereign citizen terrorists",https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/2/1/1628572/-FBI-fears-Police-infiltrated-by-white-supremacist-Ghost-Skins-sovereign-citizen-terrorists,en,False,,115,Daily Kos,http://www.dailykos.com,"Recently the Intercept has reported on the efforts by the FBI to investigate domestic terrorist organizations including neo-Nazis, white supremacists, sovereign citizens and right-wing terrorists  infiltrating our local police forces. White Supremacist and other domestic extremists maintain an active presence in U.S. police departments and other law enforcement agencies. A striking reference to that conclusion, notable for its confidence and the policy prescriptions that accompany it, appears in a classified FBI Counterterrorism Policy Guide from April 2015, obtained by The Intercept. The guide, which details the process by which the FBI enters individuals on a terrorism watchlist, the Known or Suspected Terrorist File, notes that “domestic terrorism investigations focused on militia extremists, white supremacist extremists, and sovereign citizen extremists often have identified active links to law enforcement officers,” and explains in some detail how bureau policies have been crafted to take this infiltration into account. This infiltration includes covert supremacist operatives called “ghost skins” who the FBI guide states are encouraged and trained to “blend in” to regular society without displaying their real views while advancing the goals of supremacists and also that they have implemented a strategy of protecting these investigations from discovery by specific officers who actually been added to the terrorist watch list by hiding that information within the NCIC and other national crime databases from them. And it goes like this... In a heavily redacted version of an October 2006 FBI internal intelligence assessment, the agency raised the alarm over white supremacist groups’ “historical” interest in “infiltrating law enforcement communities or recruiting law enforcement personnel.” The effort, the memo noted, “can lead to investigative breaches and can jeopardize the safety of law enforcement sources or personnel.” The memo also states that law enforcement had recently become aware of the term “ghost skins,” used among white supremacists to describe “those who avoid overt displays of their beliefs to blend into society and covertly advance white supremacist causes.” In at least one case, the FBI learned of a skinhead group encouraging ghost skins to seek employment with law enforcement agencies in order to warn crews of any investigations. That report appeared after a series of scandals involving local police and sheriff’s departments. In Los Angeles, for example, a U.S. District Court judge found in 1991 that members of a local sheriff’s department had formed a neo-Nazi gang and habitually terrorized black and Latino residents. In Chicago, Jon Burge, a police detective and rumored KKK member, was fired, and eventually prosecuted in 2008, over charges relating to the torture of at least 120 black men during his decadeslong career. Burge notoriously referred to an electric shock device he used during interrogations as the “nigger box.” In Cleveland, officials found that a number of police officers had scrawled “racist or Nazi graffiti” throughout their department’s locker rooms. In Texas, two police officers were fired when it was discovered they were Klansmen. One of them said he had tried to boost the organization’s membership by giving an application to a fellow officer he thought shared his “white, Christian, heterosexual values.” Let me repeat, we’re not talking hypothetical here, we’re talking actual walking talking neo-Nazis, skinheads and supremacist with badges and guns. During the Obama Administration the DOJ Civil Rights division investigated 20 different local police departments for a systemic “pattern and practice” of discrimination.  14 of those departments including Chicago, Baltimore, Cleveland, Ferguson, New Orleans and Puerto Rico who were eventually placed under consent decrees which through the oversight of Federal Judges are intended to gradually correct the lack of training, problems and abuses that seem to exist in these departments. The idea there was in addressing the systemic tendency for persons of color to be presumed guilty until proven innocent, where the benefit of the doubt and the deference that is sometimes granted to white people who encounter the police — which is generally described by the constitutions as “reasonable suspicion” and “probable cause” — that black and latino people simply do not receive as frequently. The Bureau of Justice Statistics does not show a correlation between race and crime or violence, but rather between poverty rate and violence. For the period 2008–12— Persons in poor households at or below the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) (39.8 per 1,000) had more than double the rate of violent victimization as persons in high-income households (16.9 per 1,000). Persons in poor households had a higher rate of violence involving a firearm (3.5 per 1,000) compared to persons above the FPL (0.8–2.5 per 1,000). The overall pattern of poor persons having the highest rates of violent victimization was consistent for both whites and blacks. However, the rate of violent victimization for Hispanics did not vary across poverty levels. Poor Hispanics (25.3 per 1,000) had lower rates of violence compared to poor whites (46.4 per 1,000) and poor blacks (43.4 per 1,000). Poor persons living in urban areas (43.9 per 1,000) had violent victimization rates similar to poor persons living in rural areas (38.8 per 1,000). Poor urban blacks (51.3 per 1,000) had rates of violence similar to poor urban whites (56.4 per 1,000). Yet at the same time the BJS notes that as a typical manner of practice police departments tend to target black and latino citizens by a rate of 2 or 3 to 1 over others for stops, searches, arrests and officer violence despite their actual likelyhood of committing a crime. o The most common reason for contact with police in 2008 was being a driver in a traffic stop (44.1%) o Black drivers were about three times as likely as white drivers and about two times as likely as Hispanic drivers to be searched during a traffic stop. ...from 2002 through 2008 that Black citizens encountering police received threats of force, or use of force at least Three Times More Often than White citizens. Latinos citizens were threatened with force, or had force used on them about Twice as Often. ...the percentage of Blacks that are arrested during traffic stops is twice (4.7% to 2.4%) as high as White Drivers.  And similarly their likelyhood of being ticketed is greater (58% to 53%) - although Latinos top them both at 62% - and their likelyhood of receiving a written warning (14.8% to 17.7%) or a verbal warning (6.0% to 11.2%) are consistently lower. Of course when you specifically target black and brown people for stops, searches and arrests it only follows that more of them are going to be in our jail system creating the circular justification for the policy to stop, search and arrest them in the first place.  But that doesn’t mean fair justice is being applied. This analysis has been verified by independent studies and as bad as all that is — it is nothing compared to idea of neo-Nazi groups deliberating creating footholds and racist “gangs” within law enforcement that use an electric shock interrogation “nigger box”. That’s some next level badness there. And it’s not like were weren’t warned of this possibility with Homeland Security released it’s report on Right-Wing Terror back in 2009, arguing that there was a particular issue with terroristic violence from former members of the military and paramilitary militias.  Since that time there have been several such attacks including the mass murder at the Sihk temple in Wisconsin by Wade Michael Page who became a radicalized neo-Nazi in the Army. When Wade Michael Page strode into a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wis., and began to murder people, it was the culmination of more than a decade in the neo-Nazi movement. The best evidence suggests that Page initially came to his beliefs while serving at a North Carolina Army base that was then a hotbed of white supremacist activity, but they were honed by a dozen years on the white power music scene. The reports concern about veterans who may be on the edge of snapping was also confirmed in 2013 with the Navy Shipyard shooting by veteran Aaron Alexis who seems to have been suffering from delusions.  And also there was this… In a 2011 article, the FBI’s counterterrorism analysis section called sovereign citizens “a growing domestic threat to law enforcement.” In one 2010 incident, two Arkansas police officers were killed when 16-year-old sovereign citizen Joseph Kane fired on them with an AK-47 assault rifle after he and his father were pulled over for a routine stop. And yet we didn’t hear the quaintly not ironic “Blue Lives Matter” mantra then, now did we? Following the massive complaint and outcry from the right that this report was “political persecution” the group within Homeland Security that produced it was disbanded, even though they’d previously done a similar report on “Left-Wing Terrorism”, since then generally the issue of right-wing fostered terrorism has remained off the radar even though the chances of being killed in America by a mass shooting terrorist attack from a white christian are far greater than a brown Muslim as shown by Mother Jones table of all mass shootings since 1981. From the perspective of the victims the totals are Asian Mass Shooters (6 incidents, 72 killed, 31 wounded), Black mass shooters, (12 incidents, 116 killed, 94 wounded), Muslim Mass Shooters (4 incidents, 81 killed, 106 wounded), White mass shooters (47 incidents, 561 killed, 628 wounded). Apparently It was so bad that the FBI has apparently adopted a strategy of blocking the information they’re gathering on specific “ghost skins” and white nationalist who are members of and affiliated with law enforcement. According to the Guide, the FBI has the option to mark a watchlisted police officer as a “silent hit,” thus preventing queries to the National Crime Information Center, a clearinghouse for crime data accessible to law enforcement agencies nationwide, from returning a record that identifies the officer as having been flagged as a known or suspected terrorist. The document states that a “specific, narrowly defined, and legitimate operational justification” must be given in order to mark a Known or Suspected Terrorist (KST) entry as a silent hit. The suspect’s membership or affiliation with a law enforcement or military agency with access to the NCIC database is one of the specific justifications listed, implying that extremist infiltration is enough of a concern that the FBI has built-in protocols to prevent domestic terrorism investigations from being obstructed by members of law enforcement. The FBI is tracking officers who have been flagged as known and suspected terrorists, and are so concerned that are hiding portions of the NCIC from them. Let that one sink in for a bit. The FBI frequently works with and aids local law enforcement but at the same time they are charged with investigating local police and battling terrorism.  Even when those suspected terrorists are police.  Police sworn to “serve and protect”, allegedly. The last thing you want to have happen is for the targets of your investigation to realize that they’re  the target of an investigation.  Like when members of the Los Angeles Sheriff’s department discovered they were the target of an FBI investigation for their pattern of inmate abuse and they kidnapped the informant who had tipped off the FBI and made him “disappear” within the jail system. The inmate informant at the heart of a widespread civil rights scandal overshadowing the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department says he was moved to different jails and hidden in cars to keep him from talking to his FBI handlers. Anthony Brown says he was kidnapped by deputies, held in isolation and watched around the clock so that federal agents wouldn't be able to contact their chief whistleblower in a massive investigation that has led to 20 arrests within the country's biggest sheriff's office. ""I'm supposed to be a criminal,"" Brown told KABC-TV in an exclusive interview broadcast Wednesday. But ""these are people that are sworn to uphold the law."" Now just imagine if those deputies were also neo-Nazis or aligned with the Sovereign citizens movement while we have a fresh new alt-Right and KKK approved POTUS in charge and the FBI themselves have shown signs of being “Trump land.” This my friends, is potentially a very, very bad thing. My work here — like that of so many others — is voluntary. If you appreciate this article any and all support you can offer to make more and better diaries in the future would be deeply and sincerely appreciated.  Thanks. More bad news. President Donald Trump's administration wants to change a counter-extremism program so that it focuses solely on ""radical Islamic extremism,"" Reuters reported on Friday, citing five unnamed sources briefed on the matter. The ""Countering Violent Extremism"" program, which currently aims to lone attackers or groups through community partnerships, would no longer focus on groups like white supremacist organizations which have carried out attacks in the United States, according to the report. Per Reuters, the program would be renamed ""Countering Islamic Extremism"" or ""Countering Radical Islamic Extremism."" "
684826618,2017-01-15 00:15:00,Why Haters Play the Victim Card,http://www.thedailybeast.com/why-haters-play-the-victim-card,en,False,,1707,Daily Beast,http://www.thedailybeast.com/,"SEARCH After Dallas, remember this: Righteous anger breeds little more than bigotry; moral outrage breeds intolerance; and violence and death are the result. Why are we all hating each other? Black nationalist terrorism appears to have struck in Dallas as 12 policemen were shot by a sniper. Five brave officers lost their lives. Only last month—but last month seems so long ago already— the world reeled in shock at the biggest mass shooting in modern U.S. history in Orlando by a jihadist, while across the Atlantic, British Member of Parliament Jo Cox was hacked to death by a suspected neo-Nazi terrorist. Only last week, jihadist terrorists did everything they could to stain the holy month of Ramadan in blood. Istanbul suffered 45 deaths at their hands; Yemen lost 43; Dhaka saw the deaths of 20 hostages; while Baghdad—poor Baghdad—mourned the loss of over 280 to ISIS directed or inspired terrorists. Then there was Dallas, a slaughter of police coming in the aftermath of videos showing police killing black people, but not those police, not in that place. They were murdered as symbols, not as people. And there is only one word that can possibly describe what has afflicted us the world over. Hate. Global Hate is well and truly on the march, so ascendant that the last “worst ever” atrocity pales in insignificance to the current one. Extremist Muslims are hating on kuffar infidels. Neo-Nazis and their Populist Right bed-fellows are hating on the multicultural Left. And the Hard Left are hating on neo-liberal globalists. The extremes are on the rise the world over as many people are wondering what on earth is going on? Great change is afoot, and a consequence of this change is great upheaval. We often hear that globalization has disenfranchised people, but its most obvious and pernicious effect right now is that it has empowered parochialism. Due to historically unparalleled connectivity and mobilization, globalization has stratified entire populations. Average Muslims now feel more connection and affinity with their religious counterparts across the world than they do with their fellow countryman at their local social club. For all their talk of anti-globalization, nationalism—and even Brexit—the Populist Right, too, are forging transnational global alliances with similar nativists the world over, while hating on their “liberal elite” neighbours. Meanwhile, the globalist Left protests neoliberal capitalism everywhere, while using the very technology neoliberal capitalists invented. Globalised localism is what I call this. And as these political strands draw in on themselves due to connectivity, they grow further apart from each other. All of this is happening across borders that were drawn for another time, during another era. Some seek to identify common cause amid all this rebellion. The truth is, these disparate and competing strands have nothing but anger and hate in common. The contradictory aspirations of global hate suffice in demonstrating this. Depending on who you talk to, we are simultaneously witnessing the end of progressivism and the return of state socialism. The end of borders and resurgent nationalism. The sidelining of religion and a revival of theocracy. Immigrants are stealing our jobs and unjustly claiming welfare. Indeed, the only thing this Hate has in common is the overwhelming narcissism of its most devout adherents. Everything must revolve around us, only we are the victims. Nobody else’s pain matters, unless of course it can be used to teach them how much we have been suffering, too. No, there is no single Great Rebellion against “The Establishment” worth talking about. There is only the stratification and polarization of society. None of these groups have anything in common but hate for the status quo, and hate for each other. This Hate plays on common human emotions that are easy to exploit. The uncertainty caused as borders and barriers break down is easily comforted by a time-tested retreat into the unholy trinity of victimhood, tribalism and cultural supremacy. But those who plunge down such ideological rabbit holes must look at history. For Islamists, ISIS’s neo-caliphate is the logical consequence of theocratic ideology.  For the Far Left and Right, Fascism and Nazism provide recent lessons for us all. To travel down this path is to return to the 1930s, before World War II devastated entire generations with state orchestrated hate. We must take heed. The new recruit in each group may start with the “good intentions” and seek to solve real grievances. But I’ve yet to witness evil rear its demonic head in this world without first beginning with good intentions. African-Americans and other minority communities have suffered, and are suffering still. Yes, Muslims globally are suffering, too. The white working classes—especially the underemployed men among them—are in dire straits. Police and veterans have lost some of their bravest for merely doing their jobs. But if the shootings by a Black Nationalist terrorist in Dallas this week, if the jihadist killings in Ramadan, and if the suspected neo-Nazi murder of Jo Cox can teach us anything, it is that the only winner from our perpetual state of victimhood is death, not life. Reciprocal human rights, individual liberty and mutual respect are values much subscribed to but seldom adhered to in today’s hate-filled world. We have become quick to demand our rights while slow to afford those same rights to others. If all blacks are not thugs, if all Muslims are not terrorists, likewise all policemen cannot be racist killers. Only a new commitment to the universality of human rights and human dignity can lift us out of this current quagmire. But that will require foot soldiers of peace who preach what we have in common rather than how we are different; what we have gained, rather than what we have lost; and what we seek to achieve rather than what we have failed to accomplish. These foot soldiers of peace must be able to transcend their own victimhood while pulling people together. Love and empathy must win over hate and vengeance. Everyone is a victim, and everyone is an aggressor. After the tragic, calamitous events in Dallas this week, the obvious must be restated. There are good and bad blacks. There are good and bad whites. There are good and bad Muslims. There are good and bad police. We are all good and bad humans, and we are all everything in between, too. Righteousness breeds nothing but certainty, which breeds moral outrage, which breeds personal judgment, which breeds intolerance, which breeds bigotry, which breeds hate and violence.

In the accompanying video, DiFranco plays her guitar and then it cuts to archival imagery of women caring for children in different time periods. “But look how weary the chief/It will be a relief to someday hear him say/Get it yourself,” she repeats. “I vote in every election, I hope someday these kids are gonna help us win.” The video closes with footage of President Obama’s tearful eulogy at the funeral for Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, one of the victims of the June 2015 mass shooting in Charleston. DiFranco dedicates the video to “all those who spend their lives in service of others (service that is endless and often thankless too),” but she tells Rolling Stone that she gives “special extra thanks” to the 44th president, “for being not just the spiritual center of the third verse of this song, but for being the most awesome fucking human being any citizen could ever have the privilege of voting for as their president.  You lifted us up and you gave us our pride back.  Goddess give us the strength to harness that belief in ourselves now and go forward.”  Last October, DiFranco released “Play God,” her first single since 2014, and is currently working on a  memoir that details her independent music career and activism. Both tracks will appear on her upcoming album, Binary, out in late spring from her label, Righteous Babe Records. In This Article:

The media’s acknowledgment of him will likely garner the same condemnation that recent instances like the San Bernardino killers and Kalamazoo, Michigan’s so-called “Uber shooter” have received. Some suggest that such coverage elevates the assailant’s celebrity status at the cost of the lives lost to his or her rampage. Perhaps there’s some truth to this, but as more about Mateen’s past makes its way out into the world, the more confusing his possible reasoning for killing 49 people and injuring more than 50 others becomes. Consider this exclusive report from The Daily Beast, in which a drag queen and former high-school classmate of Mateen’s recalled never seeing any of the homophobia claimed by the suspect’s father in prior reports. Instead, Samuel King (whose drag performance name is unclear) knew the fellow mall worker and high-school classmate as a man who “always had a smile on his face”: “That’s the thing that’s pinning me to the wall the most, that it was a gay nightclub,” King said. “Because he would come into the [the restaurant] and laugh with us. “He might’ve even sat down at the bar and had a drink and laughed with the bartenders, knowing that they were lesbians,” King added.  King’s story first made waves on Facebook, where he wrote that Mateen “worked at GNC at the treasure coast mall when I was at Ruby Tuesday’s and he graduated from the same high school in 2004.” He called him a “jokester” and noted that he “didn’t have an issue with the LGBT community” back then. In fact, King suspects that Mateen may have even attended one of his drag shows, as the latter knew about the former’s performances and never expressed any issues with them: King likely showed him, like the rest of the employees and regulars, photos in full costume from his performances. “I can’t pinpoint a date that he went with us, but he probably gone there with us once,” he said. However, just because King never saw any signs of Mateen’s potential dislike of the LGBT community or religious extremism doesn’t mean that reports suggesting either aren’t true. Already there is plenty of evidence indicating that Mateen had become a self-made radical — including a 911 call in which he pledged his allegiance to ISIS, said terrorist organization’s own attempt to claim responsibility for the shooting, and past interviews with the FBI in 2013 and 2014. Add allegations of homophobia by Mateen’s ex-wife to the mix, and it’s easy to see why King’s contributions to the conversation have rendered an already confusing situation into an inescapably complicated puzzle for investigators to solve.

Mateen’s father originally said his son was upset when he saw two men kissing prior to committing the horrific mass shooting. Chris Callen, a Pulse regular who performs under the name of Kristina McLaughlin, told the Canadian Press he remembered seeing Mateen at Pulse repeatedly. “It’s the same guy. He’s been going to this bar for at least three years,” Callen said. Another witness named Ty Smith, who goes by Aries and who is married to Callen, recalled seeing Mateen at the club before the horrific mass shooting. “(He’d get) really, really drunk… He couldn’t drink when he was at home — around his wife or family. His father was really strict… He used to bitch about it,” Smith also told the Canadian Press. The Orlando Sentinel spoke to at least four regular clubgoers, including Smith, who also remember seeing Mateen frequent the club more than a dozen times. Smith told the Sentinel he remembered having conversations with Mateen where he discussed his home life with his father and wife. “Sometimes he would go over in the corner and sit and drink by himself, and other times he would get so drunk he was loud and belligerent. We didn’t really talk to him a lot, but I remember him saying things about his dad at times… He told us he had a wife and child.” Callen and Smith told the Canadian Press they stopped talking to Mateen after he threatened them and pulled out a knife after someone made a religious joke. “He said if he ever messed with him again, you know how it’ll turn out,” Callen said. On Monday, a drag queen and former classmate of the reported shooter told The Daily Beast Mateen was a “jokester” who “always had a smile on his face” and “didn’t have an issue with the LGBT community” back in 2004 when they used to work at the same mall. MSNBC’s Chris Hayes will interview a man who claims he spoke with Mateen through messages on a gay dating app a few months ago tonight on his show All In.

574110060,2017-01-30 11:01:35,America Divided: Heartland Voters Shrug Off Global Uproar Over Immigration Ban,http://www.nationalmemo.com/heartland-voters-shrug-off-global-uproar/,en,False,,25363,National Memo,http://www.nationalmemo.com,"(Reuters) – Many of President Donald Trump’s core political supporters had a simple message on Sunday for the fiercest opponents of his immigration ban: Calm down. The relaxed reaction among the kind of voters who drove Trump’s historic upset victory — working-class residents of Midwest and the South — provided a striking contrast to the uproar that has gripped major coastal cities, where thousands of protesters flocked to airports where immigrants had been detained. In the St. Louis suburb of Manchester, Missouri, 72-year-old Jo Ann Tieken characterized the president as bringing reason into an overheated debate. “Somebody has to stand up, be the grown up, and see what we can do better to check on people coming in,” she said. “I’m all for everybody to stop and take a breath … Just give it a chance.” By executive order on Friday, Trump banned immigration from seven Muslim majority countries – Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen – and temporarily halted the entry of refugees. In the electoral strongholds for Trump, residents seemed nonplussed about the uproar flashing across their television screens. They shrugged off concerns about botched execution, damage to foreign relations, and legal challenges across the country. In New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and other cities, Trump’s action set off an outpouring of anger. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, evoked an image of the Statue of Liberty weeping. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York teared up himself on camera as he seethed over the “mean-spirited and un-American” immigration ban. Veterans in government agencies, including the Homeland Security and State departments, blasted Trump’s team for what they called slipshod planning and scant interagency communication, criticism the White House rejected. At airports, security officials also struggled to consistently enforce vague rules. But allegations of operational or administrative blunders may do little to dampen enthusiasm for a president who rose to power on a populist and protectionist platform, political analysts said. Louise Ingram, a 69-year-old retiree from Troy, Alabama, said she forgave the new administration a few “glitches,” such as widespread confusion over treatment of green card holders, as it moved to protect U.S. citizens from attacks. “I’m not opposed to immigrants,” she said. “I just want to make sure they are safe to come in.” FEAR OF EUROPE A senior Trump administration official said political considerations had little to do with the executive orders. They rather represent a reaction to the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California; the Boston Marathon bombing; and multiple attacks by radicalized groups in Europe. “The reality is that the situation that exists today in parts of France, Germany, and parts of Belgium is not a situation that we want replicated inside the United States,” one official told Reuters. Candace Wheater, a 60-year-old retired school cafeteria worker from Spring Lake, Michigan, also referenced the attacks in Brussels and Paris. “Look at what’s happening in Europe,” she said. “I don’t dare travel there, out of fear.” Steve Hirsch, 63, from Manassas, Virginia, drove to Washington’s Dulles airport on Sunday to pick somebody up, rather than to protest as hundreds of others did. He said he supported Trump’s order. “A country is not a country if it doesn’t have borders,” he added. He lauded Trump’s actions as a calculated step toward the larger goal of tightening border security. “He probably went as far as he thought he could,” Hirsch said. “You can’t ban everybody in the world, but I think it’s prudent considering the conditions in certain places in the world.” FIRM BASE OF SUPPORT Trent Lott, a former Senate Republican leader from Missouri who is now a lawyer in Washington, D.C., said the orders made sense to “working-class Americans in the real world.” “Out in the rest of the country, people are excited to see the president moving forward with securing the border,” he said. University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato agreed that the weekend protests over the executive orders would not hurt Trump politically. “His base is as firm as ever,” he said. “What he’s lost in the very early polls is the Republicans who were never Trumpers and ended up voting for Trump.” Trump opponents have succeeded in winning some early court decisions that could undermine the practical impact of his executive orders, but Sabato said his base would perceive those as attacks from liberal elites. Trump could eventually lose support if he fails to keep promises important to regions that supported him, such as delivering jobs to the so-called Rust Belt, the Midwestern states dotted by dying factory towns. DEEP DIVISIONS Whatever Trump ultimately accomplishes, his election has ushered in a new extreme of political polarization to an already deeply divided country. “I just have not found a single person who has any neutrality at all about Donald Trump,” Sabato said. In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, 40-year-old teacher Trista Carles said she had been ordered to keep her views about Trump out of the classroom. “We were told to be Switzerland,” she said. “We’re not allowed to take any sides or views.” She has her own opinions, of course, and said she appreciated that Trump, in his blunt way, gave voice to them “with no sugar-coating.” “I think it’s just too easy to get into our country and stay illegally,” she said. “I feel like he is going to – to the best of his abilities – make a lot of things he said happen.” (Reporting by Laila Kearney in New York; Additional reporting by Diane Bartz, Doina Chiacu, Steve Holland and Lacey Ann Johnson in Washington and Curtis Skinner in San Francisco; Writing by Brian Thevenot; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn) IMAGE: Pro-Trump demonstrators yell slogans during protest against the travel ban imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump’s executive order, at Los Angeles International Airport in Los Angeles, California, U.S., January 29, 2017.

He posted this about the terrible shooting at Fort Lauderdale:   He immediately had to defend his offensive tweet to critics who saw it as crass and unsympathetic to the victims:     This is just the latest in a long series of offensive jokes and statements by the comedian. In December he got into a full-fledged Twitter feud with conservative Ben Shapiro after one of the GOP presidential debates. The month before that he had to delete a badly worded joke that appeared to encourage terrorists to attack Trump hotels and other properties.  Last September he went on the attack against conservative actor Adam Baldwin in defense of socialist Bernie Sanders.  In 2013, he tweeted ""abort to end prayer"" in order to mock those tweeting ""pray to end abortion."" In 2012 he didn't waste a minute to calling for gun control after the terrible shooting at Newtown, Connecticut, joining a chorus of other lefty celebrities.  Oswalt doesn't limit himself to Twitter either - in May he joined Samanthee Bee on her show in a profanity-laced segment bashing pro-life advocates and crisis pregnancy centers.

                since Five people are dead after a shooting at the Ft. Lauderdale-Hollywood Airport on Friday afternoon, according to the Broward County Sheriff. At least eight others are wounded. The gunman is in custody, the sheriff’s office said. Eyewitnesses, including former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer, described scenes of panic, with people fleeing the sounds of gunfire. Trace contributor Adam Weinstein was nearby when the shooting started: The term “mass shooting” lacks a consistent definition, but is often understood as a shooting in a public place that claims four or more lives, and attracts widespread media coverage. In the last five decades, these events have become far more common. Other groups use a much broader definition for what counts as a mass shooting, sweeping in incidents that happen in homes, and where there are four or more casualties — not just deaths. Gun Violence Archive tallied 385 mass shootings using this broader definition in 2015, resulting in at least 457 deaths and 1,546 injuries. The random nature of indiscriminate gunfire unleashed without warning is all the more frightening because it can happen anywhere. Just in the past four years, gunmen have massacred worshipers at a church, moviegoers at a theater, people at a gay nightclub, and young children at an elementary school. In July, a 25-year-old Army reservist who was reportedly angry over police shootings of unarmed black men killed five police officers and wounded 11 others during a rampage in Dallas. Mass shootings are both tragedy and spectacle. As a result, they attract a huge amount of attention, which tends to distort views about the prevalence of incidents, the most common victims, and how the weapons that are used are obtained. Here is our guide to understanding mass shootings in America. The FBI does not count “mass shootings,” but defines “mass murder” as an event in which four or more people are killed — excluding the perpetrator, and not including domestic violence incidents — at one time. People stand on the tarmac at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.
                            


                                Lynne Sladky/AP Photo Roughly two out of three Americans who die from a gunshot wound commit suicide, according to the latest federal data. Omar Mateen, the gunman who killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, purchased the rifle and handgun he used in the assault from a federally licensed firearms dealer. Syed Farook purchased two of the handguns used in the San Bernardino massacre from a California gun shop. An analysis of recent large-scale mass shootings by the New York Times found that 13 of 16 purchased their guns in a similar fashion — legally, after undergoing a background check administered by a federally licensed dealer. Here’s a step-by-step guide to what that entails. Probably not. Many experts believe it is not what the gun looks like that matters most — it’s how many rounds it can fire without reloading. An examination by the New York Times found that gunmen who perpetrated 16 recent mass shootings used a variety of firearms in their attacks, including handguns and assault-style weapons. While rifles like the AR-15 could increase the lethality of an attack in some situations, experts say that the use of high capacity magazines that can hold dozens of rounds of ammunition may give shooters an even greater advantage, allowing for more bullets to be fired without reloading without pause — breaks that can provide an opportunity for an officer or civilian to interrupt an attack.

                                Wilfredo Lee/AP Photo America’s most notorious mass shooters have been young, angry men who displayed antisocial behavior before they carried out attacks. Many perpetrators of mass killing also have a history of domestic violence; social scientists have found that the same factors drive the two phenomena. A 2015 Huffington Post analysis looked at incidents over a five year period in which at least four people were killed with a gun, including shootings in domestic settings (a criteria which the FBI’s definition excludes). A majority of the shootings involved a family member or intimate partner — women and children comprised 64 percent of victims. While mental illness may drive some mass shooters to kill, media coverage of the mentally ill exaggerates their role in gun violence. Less than 4 percent of violent acts are carried out by someone who is mentally ill — and research shows that individuals with mental illness are a greater risk to themselves. Violent behavior and substance is a better predictor of future violence than a mental health diagnosis. The substance most often associated with violent crimes is alcohol. A University of Alabama researcher found that a uniquely American cultural and mental strain leads mass shooters to target workplaces and schools — as opposed to the military installations often targeted by international mass shooters — because these institutions represent the social systems that the gunmen believe mistreated them. REUTERS/Jim Young The gun violence burden is disproportionately carried by men of color, who comprise half of American gun death victims — despite making up just 6 percent of the population. A New York Times analysis of shootings that killed or wounded four or more people in 2015 found that two-thirds of the victims were black. Seventy-two percent of the victims were men. Some urban neighborhoods are plagued by persistent, truly epidemic shooting rates. Violent gun crime varies even more within American cities than between them. A glance at murder rates by neighborhood — not just by city — reveals a terrible murder inequality that ensnaring men of color in a cycle of killing. Gun rights activists say they want to abolish so-called gun-free zones — areas where guns are not permitted, including schools and many private businesses — because they deny civilians carrying concealed handguns the opportunity to stop a massacre, while providing an unprotected target for mass shooters looking to perpetrate large-scale carnage. Indeed, the foundational tenet of the National Rifle Association’s agenda is that more “good guys” carrying guns in public will reduce crime and make society safer. There is no evidence to support this claim. Of the 160 active-shooting incidents from 2000 to 2013 that were analyzed by the FBI in 2014, only one active shooting was stopped by a concealed-carry license holder. Twenty-one were stopped by unarmed civilians.

873184736,2017-01-31 01:24:16,"Despite tough Canadian rules, illegal guns within reach",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-mosque-shooting-guncontrol-idUSKBN15F038,en,False,,4442,Reuters,http://www.reuters.com,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Rod Nickel, Nia Williams 3 Min Read WINNIPEG/CALGARY (Reuters) - Canada’s gun control laws ban dozens of assault rifles, but some permitted firearms are easily modified for greater damage, and more lax regulations in the United States make smuggled weapons accessible, experts said after a rare Canadian mass shooting on Sunday. A man was charged on Monday with six counts of first-degree murder and five counts of attempted murder with a restricted weapon in the shooting at a Quebec City mosque. Police have not commented on the type of gun used, but sources said it was a semi-automatic weapon. Semi-automatic guns can legally hold magazines up to five rounds in Canada, but many military-style semi-automatics are easily modified to 30 rounds, said A.J. Somerset, an author on gun issues. And while some rifles are banned by name, knock-offs are allowed, he said. “Canada’s classification system is a mess,” Somerset said. “If someone wants to do the shooting at the mosque, they can obtain a non-restricted firearm in Canada that is functionally the same as an AK-47, illegally modify it, and they have exactly the rifle we don’t want them to have.” Handguns in Canada are far tougher to obtain than in the United States. Canadians must obtain licenses and endure safety training and extensive checks that delve into the potential owner’s criminal record, mental health and third-party references. A restricted class of guns must be registered for tracking, while fully automatic weapons are prohibited. The tight restrictions have opened up an illegal flow of guns from the United States. In Quebec, gangs may contribute to availability of illegal guns, since smuggling is done through networks, Somerset said. “There is an illegal market for all manner of weapons that are openly available in the U.S,” Rob Gordon, a criminology professor at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, said. “The link to organized crime is quite profound, so where you see organized crime in Quebec, B.C. and Ontario ... they seem to have access to these types of weapons. Quebec has a higher rate of gun licences per 100,000 residents than Ontario and British Columbia, but lower than most other provinces and territories, according to government statistics. Quebec lawmakers passed a bill last year to launch a provincial gun registry in 2018. Editing by Alan Crosby Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

Though he supports Donald Trump, his customers aren’t buying as many firearms now that they have a National Rifle Association supporter in the White House. But Daniel, 54, sees a promising long-term future for gun makers. He’s weathered sales surges and dips since he founded the company in 2001 after inventing a custom attachment for his Colt rifle and selling extra pieces online. At a 2002 gun show, he was discovered by a rep for U.S. Special Forces, which wound up signing a $20 million contract. Daniel Defense has since grown into one of the country’s largest privately held producers of guns and accessories, with $73 million in 2016 sales, a gross profit margin of 35% and 279 employees. In this interview, which has been edited and condensed, he describes building the company, how news and politics affect gun sales, and where he sees his business going under President Trump. Susan Adams: Did you always want to be an entrepreneur? Marty Daniel: In college I was more into beer drinking than studying. I flunked out and my mom got me a job in a saw mill. After six months of that, I went back to school but I didn’t learn my lesson and I flunked out again. I even got a letter saying, don’t re-apply. I went back to the saw mill for a year and somehow talked my way back into school. I made the dean’s list after the first quarter and ended up graduating with a degree in electrical engineering and technology. I didn’t want to work in a saw mill for the rest of my life. Adams:  What kind of career did you want? Daniel: My college roommate had started a business with his dad and he asked me to buy his dad out. I borrowed $25,000 from his father and became his partner. We built replacement storm windows and then we moved into the garage door business. I bought my partner out in 1993. Adams: How did garage doors lead to guns? Daniel: I was complaining about my golf game one day and a friend said, let’s take up shooting. I had hunted growing up but I’d never done target shooting. That’s where I was introduced to the kind of gun we sell now, the AR-15. Adams: How did you turn your hobby into a business? Daniel: I wanted something called a flat top upper that would allow me to mount a scope on the gun. In 2001 I started calling around to find a manufacturer. But to get the four I needed, I had to buy 100. I set up a website to sell the other 96. I bought the pieces for around $100 each and sold them for $130. Adams: How did you come up with that price? Daniel: I just pulled it out of the air. Adams: How did you go from selling parts online to a full-fledged company? Daniel: I developed a rail system where I could mount other accessories on the gun, like lights, lasers and rangefinders. I also hired a patent attorney to make sure I wasn’t stepping on anyone’s patents. I sold the rails for six or eight months, and then went to a gun show in Orlando where a contractor from Special Forces walked up to me and said he was looking for civilian providers who could provide new and innovative products for the government. We bid on the contract and won it. Adams: How much was the contract worth? Daniel: Twenty million dollars. That contract has been renewed and we’ve gotten other contracts. Adams: How did you feel about winning that contract? Daniel: Very excited. The garage-door business was limited to how far you could drive. I could sell gun parts all over the world. This was 2003, after 9/11, and I was motivated to provide products for our soldiers. I thought it was really cool, that I could help them come home safely. Adams: What was your next big break? Daniel: In 2007 the U.K. was looking for rail systems for their military rifles and we won the contract. Adams: When did you become profitable? Daniel: We were profitable every year. We didn’t have any backing so we had to make money from day one. But my wife and I kept working in the garage door business and we didn’t draw a paycheck from the gun business until 2008. The housing market was crashing. We would have gone broke if we didn’t have the gun business. Adams: What was it like to compete with big gun manufacturers like Colt and Smith & Wesson? Daniel: I’ve had conversations with people there and they’re happy for us because we’re still in a niche. Their goal is to sell volumes of firearms. Adams: How difficult was it to make the transition to manufacturing whole guns? Daniel: It was an uphill climb. We bought a machine called a hammer forge that forms steel into a barrel but we didn’t have any idea how to operate the beast. At the time it was overwhelming. But we thought making guns was the way to grow our business. Adams: What are the economics of gun manufacturing like? Daniel: In any manufacturing business, if you can make 30% gross profit or better and do enough volume to cover your overhead, you can be successful. The challenges are cash, people, space and know-how. A big issue is cash because it takes a lot of money to build a manufacturing plant. Adams: Where do you manufacture? Daniel: We have a plant in Ridgeland, SC and a plant in Black Creek, GA. We’re building a new 300,000-square-foot plant in Black Creek and we’re going to be moving everything there in September. Adams: What percentage of your sales are to governments vs. shops or consumers? Daniel: Last year 90% of our sales were to consumers. Adams: Can you sell online? Daniel: We can but because of background checks, the sale still has to go through a gun store. Also we don’t want our dealers and distributors to feel like we’re using their supply to sell directly to a consumer. Adams: What’s your marketing strategy? Daniel: We’ve done some TV, a lot of magazine advertising and a lot of gun shows. We also have relationships with prop houses and celebrities and our guns have been featured in movies. Adams: Do the movies help sales? Daniel: Not that much. Hollywood in general is anti-Second Amendment. It’s amazing how many celebrities use guns in their movies and also speak out against guns. Adams: Which celebrities do you know? Daniel: Steven Segal. We love him and he loves the Second Amendment. Adams: What happened when you tried to run a Super Bowl ad? Daniel: We were going to spend $400,000 to target five big local markets with a 30-second commercial that showed a soldier coming home from war and wanting to protect his family. But the Super Bowl has to approve the ad. We couldn’t show a firearm in the commercial even though there were five or six Super Bowl commercials for upcoming TV shows that were full of guns. Adams: But those shows aren’t trying to sell guns. Daniel: I get that we’re trying to sell guns but we didn’t show an actual firearm. We showed a silhouette at the very end that had a gun in it. Fox rejected the ad but we went on Fox and Friends and ended up getting a lot of media out of it. Adams: Why were your sales up in 2013 and then down in 2014? Daniel: The mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012 drove a lot of sales. That was a horrible event and we don’t use those kinds of terrible things to drive sales but when people see politicians start talking about gun control, they have this fear and they go out and buy guns. Adams: What about common-sense gun control proposals like closing the gun-show loophole? How would such a measure affect your business? Daniel: Terms like “common sense” come from people whose only goal is to take our guns away. There is no gun show loophole. Every licensed dealer has to follow the law. Adams: But unlicensed private dealers sell at gun shows and they don’t have to do background checks. Daniel: Those transactions happen at shows, outside of shows and on Craigslist and between friends. They don’t affect our business. Adams: How did Hillary Clinton’s candidacy affect your sales? Daniel: Mrs. Clinton was definitely aiming to take away gun rights. People overbought out of fear that they would not be able to buy guns in the future. If she had been elected our business would be going through the roof right now. We’d be doubling in size. Adams: Were you at all disappointed when she lost? Daniel: No. I’m more interested in conserving our gun rights than making a dollar. Adams: What does the Trump presidency mean for your business? Daniel: We are very much relieved in the long term. We know that 10 or 20 years down the road we’re going to remain in business. But we’ll see a little bit of a down cycle compared to the last few years. It will take about a year for the market to correct. Adams: Did you support Trump’s candidacy from the beginning? Daniel: I voted for Ted Cruz in the primary because I was trying to figure out who had the best chance to beat Hillary Clinton. But I was 100% behind Donald Trump once he got the nomination. He’s absolutely good on guns. Also he’s the first president who isn’t a politician or who came out of the military. We talk about this great democratic process and this great experiment with self-government but we’ve never experimented with having a businessman president. Adams: What’s the biggest challenge you face? Daniel: Working through the slow market and continuing to build our brand. There were a lot of people in the gun business who were for Donald Trump but were planning on Hillary Clinton. We had a Trump plan and a Clinton plan. We’re fortunate that instead of being overstocked we’re still understocked because our brand is still growing faster than our ability to produce.

Though he supports Donald Trump, his customers aren’t buying as many firearms now that they have a National Rifle Association supporter in the White House. But Daniel, 54, sees a promising long-term future for gun makers. He’s weathered sales surges and dips since he founded the company in 2001 after inventing a custom attachment for his Colt rifle and selling extra pieces online. At a 2002 gun show, he was discovered by a rep for U.S. Special Forces, which wound up signing a $20 million contract. Daniel Defense has since grown into one of the country’s largest privately held producers of guns and accessories, with $73 million in 2016 sales, a gross profit margin of 35% and 279 employees. In this interview, which has been edited and condensed, he describes building the company, how news and politics affect gun sales, and where he sees his business going under President Trump. Susan Adams: Did you always want to be an entrepreneur? Marty Daniel: In college I was more into beer drinking than studying. I flunked out and my mom got me a job in a saw mill. After six months of that, I went back to school but I didn’t learn my lesson and I flunked out again. I even got a letter saying, don’t re-apply. I went back to the saw mill for a year and somehow talked my way back into school. I made the dean’s list after the first quarter and ended up graduating with a degree in electrical engineering and technology. I didn’t want to work in a saw mill for the rest of my life. Adams:  What kind of career did you want? Daniel: My college roommate had started a business with his dad and he asked me to buy his dad out. I borrowed $25,000 from his father and became his partner. We built replacement storm windows and then we moved into the garage door business. I bought my partner out in 1993. Adams: How did garage doors lead to guns? Daniel: I was complaining about my golf game one day and a friend said, let’s take up shooting. I had hunted growing up but I’d never done target shooting. That’s where I was introduced to the kind of gun we sell now, the AR-15. Adams: How did you turn your hobby into a business?

568495576,2017-01-17 15:12:53,FBI: Ft. Lauderdale Terrorist Says He Carried Out Attack for Islamic State,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/VzCc17ZClNY/,en,False,,19334,Breitbart,http://www.breitbart.com,"Esteban Santiago Ruiz told the FBI that he carried out an attack on Fort Lauderdale on behalf of the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL), Michael Ferlazzo, an FBI special agent, reportedly testified at the attacker’s bond hearing Tuesday. Santiago is the New Jersey-born Iraq war veteran of Puerto Rican descent who killed five people and wounded six others at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in Florida earlier this month. Citing public records opened last week, Sunshine State News adds that Santiago converted to Islam and created a “jihadist identity” for himself, assuming the Islamic name Aashiq Hammad, prior to joining the U.S. Army. He reportedly downloaded Islamic terrorist propaganda and recorded Muslim religious music online. However, the Miami Herald, citing unnamed law enforcement sources, reported that despite rumors to the contrary, nothing in Santiago’s social media history suggests he was “an Islamic convert inspired by terrorist organizations.” On Tuesday, the attacker was ordered held without bond. CNN notes that FBI agency Ferlazzo “did not elaborate on whether Santiago was purporting to be linked to ISIS or simply inspired by the terrorist organization.” ISIS has not claimed responsibility for the attack. Nevertheless, Ferlazzo revealed that, during the six-hour interview conducted after the attack, Santiago claimed “to be fighting for ISIS and that he’d been in touch with like-minded people via jihadi chat rooms who were planning attacks as well,” reports CNN. Moreover, the “FBI agent confirmed that the 9 mm gun used in the Jan. 6 shooting rampage at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport is the same weapon Anchorage, Alaska, police seized and later returned to 26-year-old Esteban Santiago last year,” reports CBS News. “The agent also testified that Santiago mentioned after the shooting that he was under government mind control.” The terrorist has already been charged with using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a violent crime; performing a violent act against a person at an airport serving international civil aviation that caused serious bodily injury; and killing a person with a firearm. Of the charges, the latter two are punishable by death, while the first charge carries a maximum penalty of life behind bars. Santiago revealed before the attack that he was hearing voices and that the CIA had been controlling his mind, federal authorities and the killer’s brother Bryan Santiago have revealed. Nearly a month prior to the attack, Esteban Santiago specifically confessed to the FBI in Alaska where he was living at the time, that he was suffering from government mind control linked to ISIS videos. The FBI reportedly contacted law enforcement in Anchorage and told them the veteran had been having “terroristic thoughts” and believed he was being influenced by ISIS. Although authorities did take Santiago to a mental facility, he was ultimately released along with his weapon. Santiago has confessed to the mass shooting. “At Tuesday’s hearing, the defense did not argue the prosecution’s assertion that Santiago posed a flight risk, as well as a danger to the community, and said that the defendant was prepared to be detained throughout his trial,” reports CNN. “The judge ruled he be held without bond. His next court appearance is January 30.” CrimeIsrael / Middle EastNational SecurityDaeshEsteban SantiagoISISILISISIslamic State . Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

(Courtesy photo) A former CEO of Smith & Wesson is hoping to attract investors to fund the expansion of his novel restaurant concept, combining alcohol, food and shooting guns for an evening of entertainment. At Modern Round, which opened its first location in Peoria, Ariz., last June, customers use laser technology-based replica weapons to fire at a 16-foot-wide screen. They can choose between games or live-action police and military scenarios, while seated at plush lounge tables. An annual membership fee of $5 gives patrons the right to reserve a table by the hour. The company says it has signed up 23,000 members so far. The entrance to the restaurant is keyhole-shaped, in a riff on the Bond movies. Hostesses handcuff themselves to a metal briefcase containing the guns that the members will use to shoot targets like ducks, flying pigs or zombies. For a little more money, patrons can upgrade to real police simulations. VirTra Systems supplies the law enforcement training systems, which feature replica guns that are wireless and have the size and weight of real firearms. Two of the models use a CO2 cartridge to give the real feel of a firearm discharging; one is a replica AR-15. While the company is targeting the adult drinking crowd, it will allow children between the ages of 12 and 18 to come to the restaurant if they are accompanied by an adult. The company stresses safety and makes all new members watch a gun safety video. Modern Round is poised to open its second location in -- where else -- Las Vegas. There are plans for locations in Dallas and San Antonio. The company says 65% of its revenue at its current location comes from food sales and the remainder is from the fees. Aside from the membership fee, they also charge $25-$45 per hour per lounge depending on the day of the visit. The company was founded by Mitchell Saltz, a former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of firearms maker Smith & Wesson. Barry Monheit, a current board member at Smith & Wesson, is also on the board at Modern Round. Smith & Wesson just renamed itself American Outdoor Brands and changed its ticker symbol from SWHC to AOBC as it tries to branch out into other businesses like flashlights, knives and tools. Modern Round is trying to secure funding for its expansion, pitching to investors at the ICR conference in Orlando this week. It's garnered a mixed response. Some investors at the conference said they thought it was an intriguing concept, with one comparing it to Topgolf, a similar theme restaurant that has 38 locations. One person suggested it would be well-received in parts of the country that are gun-friendly. Another expressed discomfort with the idea, saying guns were just too much of a hot-button issue for an investment.

But those incidents, while tragic, are a tiny sliver of America’s gun homicide problem. Mayors Against Illegal Guns, analyzing FBI data, found that fewer than 1 percent of homicide victims in 2010 were killed in incidents where four or more people died. A Congressional Research Service (CRS) report from 2013 identified 78 “public mass shootings” between 1983 and 2012, which claimed 547 lives. For context, 11,622 people (more than 20 times the mass shooting toll over three decades) died in gun homicides in 2012 alone — and murder is, in general, on the decline, so that number was higher in the 1980s and ‘90s. “While tragic and shocking, public mass shootings account for few of the murders or non-negligent homicides related to firearms that occur annually in the United States,” CRS concluded. Some analyses find that mass shootings are, contrary to popular perception, fairly stable over time. James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, has found that the number of mass shooting victims, perpetrators, and incidents didn’t change much from 1980 to 2014: Fox uses a fairly straightforward definition of mass shootings as shootings in which at least four people die, and found no statistically significant increase in the number of such incidents or the number of total victims. Other researchers, like Mother Jones’ Mark Follman and the Harvard School of Public Health’s Amy P. Cohen, Deborah Azrael, and Matthew Miller use a more restrictive definition, excluding killings related to domestic violence, drugs, or gangs. Using data Follman and Mother Jones compiled, the Harvard researchers concluded in 2014 that the amount of time between mass shootings has been declining: Vox uses yet another definition, which is instances in which four or more people are shot, not necessarily killed. The data there doesn’t go back far enough to make firm conclusions about whether the rate is increasing or holding steady. Determining the “right” definition in cases like this doesn’t matter much for the gun control debate. The best case for gun control is about suicide, not mass shootings. But the definition fight matters for the purpose of ideological proxy warfare. Declaring Fox or Cohen et al right has a certain political valence in the wider gun control debate. Fox’s analysis seems to rebut liberal concerns about an increasing rate of mass shootings; Cohen et al seem to confirm those concerns. You see something similar in discussions around school shootings, wherein gun control skeptics are as eager to declare that gang-related shootings in school are not real school shootings as they are to embrace Fox’s definition in which gang-related mass shootings are real mass shootings — and vice versa for gun control supporters.

He has confessed to the shooting and will undergo a health evaluation before being brought to officials, Hurriyet reported. A statement released by the ISIS-linked Aamaq news agency following the shooting said the gunman opened fire with an automatic rifle in “revenge for God’s religion and in response to the orders” of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Noor Salman was arrested by FBI agents in San Francisco and charged with aiding and abetting by providing material support, federal officials told the New York Times, which first reported the arrest. In an emailed statement to BuzzFeed News, Salman’s lawyer, Linda Moreno, denied she had any knowledge of the impending slaughter, and maintained she was a victim of domestic abuse by her husband, Omar Mateen.

713194228,2017-01-07 09:03:06,"Gunman Opens Fire At Fort Lauderdale Airport, Killing Five",http://dailycaller.com/2017/01/07/people-shot-at-floridas-fort-lauderdale-airport/,en,False,,18775,Daily Caller,http://dailycaller.com,"REUTERS/Joe Skipper By Zachary Fagenson FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (Reuters) – Police in Alaska took a handgun from the man accused of killing five people at Fort Lauderdale’s airport on Friday, but they returned it to him last month after a medical evaluation found he was not mentally ill, authorities said on Saturday. Esteban Santiago, a 26-year-old Iraq war veteran, had a history of acting erratically and investigators are probing whether mental illness played a role in the latest U.S. mass shooting. According to court papers, he told agents he planned the attack and bought a one-way ticket to Florida. Santiago was charged on Saturday in federal court and could potentially face the death penalty if convicted in the case, U.S. prosecutors said. Marlin Ritzman, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s office in Anchorage, told a news conference Santiago walked into the office in November and said his mind was being controlled by a U.S. intelligence agency. He was turned over to local police, who took him to a medical facility for a mental evaluation. “Santiago was having terroristic thoughts and believed he was being influenced by ISIS (the Islamic State militant group,)” Anchorage Police Chief Chris Tolley told the news conference. A handgun police took from Santiago during the evaluation was returned to him early last month, Tolley told reporters. The police chief said it was not clear if it was the same weapon used on Friday. Officials in Anchorage said the gun was returned because Santiago had not been adjudicated to be mentally ill. “As far as I know, this is not somebody that would have been prohibited (from having a gun) based on the information they had,” U.S. Attorney Karen Loeffler told the news conference. Investigators said they have not ruled out terrorism as a motive and that the suspect’s recent travel is being reviewed. Federal prosecutors charged Santiago with carrying out violence at an airport, causing serious bodily injury, using a firearm during a crime of violence and causing death to a person through the use of a firearm, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement. He will appear in court in Fort Lauderdale on Monday. Five people were killed and six wounded in the rampage, while about three dozen were taken to local hospitals with bruises or broken bones suffered in the chaos as passengers fled the crowded baggage claim area. ‘METHODICAL’ SHOOTING Authorities say Santiago arrived in Ft. Lauderdale on a connecting flight from Alaska and retrieved a Walther 9mm semi-automatic handgun from his checked luggage before loading it in a bathroom and shooting indiscriminately. According to the criminal complaint, Santiago fired the weapon 10 to 15 times, aiming it at his victims’ heads. “He was described as walking while shooting in a methodical manner,” the complaint said. Witnesses said the gunman, who was wearing a blue “Star Wars” T-shirt, said nothing as he fired and surrendered to police only after running out of ammunition. The Broward County sheriff has said it took the first deputy about 70 to 80 seconds to contact the suspect after the first shots rang out and that when the deputy confronted him, he dropped the gun and was taken into custody. Authorities said three of the six victims who suffered gunshot wounds are in intensive care. The others are in good condition. Those killed included a volunteer firefighter in his sixties and a retiree on holiday with her husband. Santiago served from 2007 to 2016 in the Puerto Rico National Guard and Alaska National Guard, including a deployment to Iraq from 2010 to 2011, according to the Pentagon. A private first class and combat engineer, he received half a dozen medals before being transferred to the inactive ready reserve in August last year. An aunt said Santiago returned from his deployment “a different person,” MSNBC reported. Santiago’s brother Bryan, who lives in Puerto Rico, told CNN he believed authorities did not do enough to help his mentally ill sibling. “They had him hospitalized for four days, and then they let him go. How are you going to let someone leave a psychological center after four days when he is saying that he is hearing voices?” Bryan Santiago told CNN. The attack was the latest in a series of U.S. mass shootings, some inspired by Islamist militants, others carried out by loners or the mentally disturbed. Last June, Florida was the scene of the deadliest shooting rampage in modern U.S. history, when a gunman apparently inspired by Islamic State killed 49 people and wounded 53 at the gay nightclub “Pulse” in Orlando.

                since Noor Salman, 30 faces up to life in prison on a charge of aiding and abetting husband Omar Mateen's attempt to provide material support to a terrorist organization and is also accused of obstructing justice, according to federal prosecutors. The first person charged by U.S. authorities in connection with the 2016 massacre, she did not enter a plea at her initial court appearance. Dressed in a yellow t-shirt and gray sweatpants, she spoke only to acknowledge she understood the court proceedings. Salman was arrested on Monday in California, where she was living with her mother in the San Francisco area, according to her uncle, Al Salman, who denied her alleged role in the attack. ""She had no idea,"" he told reporters outside the courthouse, adding that she was ""absolutely not"" involved. Mateen was killed in a shootout with police after he took hostages during a three-hour standoff in the Pulse nightclub. He wounded dozens more in the June 12 shooting, which intensified fears about attacks by Americans inspired by Islamic State. The indictment, unsealed on Tuesday, was returned last week by a federal grand jury in the U.S. Middle District of Florida, which includes Orlando. U.S. prosecutors expect Salman to be transferred there to face the charges, said William Daniels, a spokesman for the Florida federal district. The indictment accuses her of criminal activity beginning as early as April, several months before the massacre. It said she abetted Mateen in providing support to a designated terrorist organization and engaged in ""misleading conduct"" toward authorities regarding the Pulse attack. Mateen, 29, pledged allegiance to the leader of Islamic State during the rampage in which he used an assault rifle and pistol that had been legally purchased. He had twice been investigated by the FBI for possible connections with militant Islamist groups. U.S. authorities have said Mateen, who lived in Fort Pierce, Florida, with Salman and their young child, was self-radicalized and acted alone without assistance or orders from abroad. Salman, a U.S. citizen and the daughter of parents who immigrated from the West Bank in 1985, was repeatedly questioned by investigators. ""She is a very simple person,"" Al Salman said. ""I know that justice will prevail, and she is going to show that she is innocent."" For you For you"

                since Five people were killed in a mass shooting in the baggage-claim area of Terminal 2 at Florida's Fort Lauderdale International Airport just before 1 p.m. on Friday. At least seven others were injured and taken to area hospitals, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said in a Friday night news conference. The suspected attacker, identified as 26-year-0ld Esteban Santiago, was shot by police and taken into custody. Santiago is now in federal custody and is expected to appear in court on Monday. NBC's Pete Williams reported that Santiago had signed up to serve in the National Guard in August 2016 and had been living in Alaska. He was born in New Jersey, Williams reported, and his family was originally from Puerto Rico. The suspect is in federal custody. Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel confirmed that there were no additional incidents in any of the other terminals. ""At this point it looks like he acted alone,"" he said of the suspect. Investigators said terrorism has not been ruled out as a possible motive. The suspect was apparently receiving some form of psychological treatment while in Alaska, according to The Associated Press, which cited the suspect's brother, Bryan Santiago. FBI spokesman George Piro said in a news conference Friday night that Santiago walked into an FBI field office in Anchorage last November and spoke to detectives. After the conversation, Santiago was taken into custody by local police and admitted to a medical facility for an evaluation, Piro said. It is unclear what type of treatment the suspect may have received. Santiago, who was born in New Jersey but grew up in Puerto Rico, served in Puerto Rico's National Guard and was deployed to Iraq in 2010. His aunt, who lives in New Jersey, told reporters that Santiago had started acting strangely when he returned from Iraq, and about a month ago ""lost his mind."" ""He said he saw things,"" she said. Santiago served in the Alaska National Guard when he moved to Anchorage in 2014, but  received a ""general discharge"" from in August for ""unsatisfactory performance."" Santiago flew Delta from Anchorage, Alaska to Fort Lauderdale via Minneapolis-St. Paul on Thursday night, NBC reported. He arrived in Fort Lauderdale late Friday morning, which is when he apparently he used a gun he had checked into his luggage to carry out the massacre in the baggage claim area of Terminal 2. The Transportation Security Administration allows passengers to transport unloaded firearms in a locked, hard-sided container ""as checked baggage only,"" according to its website. ""Only the passenger should retain the key or combination to the lock"" on the container, the guidelines state, and the firearm must be declared ""each time you present it for transport as checked baggage."" All services at the airport have temporarily been suspended until 5 a.m. Saturday morning. Video released from inside the baggage claim area appears to show the aftermath of the shooting at Terminal 2. A witness told CBC that the gunman shot several people ""execution-style"" as they waited for their bags. The attacker was wearing a dark blue T-shirt and was silent as he opened fire with a handgun, witnesses told MSNBC. He had time to reload as he shot people in the head, one witness said, but ""threw down his gun and laid on the ground spread eagle"" after he ran out of ammunition. Video released from inside Fort Lauderdale airport baggage claim area pic.twitter.com/QVfWnhhNiE A witness to the shooting shared a graphic photo on Twitter that showed a man bleeding on the lower level of the airport. Florida Gov. Rick Scott traveled to the airport to be briefed on the attack. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted that he is ""praying for the victims and everyone at the #FortLauderdale airport. #FLL."" President-elect Donald Trump tweeted that he is ""monitoring the terrible situation in Florida. Just spoke to Governor Scott. Thoughts and prayers for all. Stay safe!"" President Barack Obama was briefed on the shooting, the White House said. The Federal Aviation Authority issued a ground stop for all flights at Fort Lauderdale airport, one of the country's busiest transport hubs. The airport is in South Florida's Broward County, about 30 miles north of Miami. Bryan Logan contributed reporting. For you For you"
576832051,2017-02-05 12:10:33,Turkey detains over 440 people in anti-Islamic State operation,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/267492522/0/phoenix/nation~Turkey-detains-over-people-in-antiIslamic-State-operation/,en,False,,25128,AZCentral,http://www.azcentral.com," ISTANBUL — Turkey’s anti-terrorism police have detained over 440 people for alleged links to the Islamic State, the state-run agency reported Sunday. The Anadolu Agency said 60 Islamic State suspects, the vast majority of them foreigners, were taken into custody early Sunday in the capital, Ankara. A total of 445 people were detained in simultaneous pre-dawn police operations that spanned several cities, including Istanbul and Gaziantep, near the border with Syria, the news agency said. The largest operation was in the southeast province of Sanliurfa, where police took into custody more than 100 suspects from multiple addresses and found materials relating to the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS. Security forces also apprehended nine suspects who were allegedly preparing an attack in the northwestern city of Izmir. Anadolu did not give the nationalities of all those detained, but 10 minors were among the foreigners detained in Istanbul and the northwestern province of Kocaeli. Turkey, which last year endured a failed coup attempt and dozens of bloody attacks linked to the Islamic State or Kurdish militants, has been stepping up its anti-terrorism efforts. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for a New Year Eve mass shooting at an Istanbul nightclub that killed 39 people. The militant group claims to have multiple cells in Turkey. Turkey is a member of the NATO alliance and the U.S-led coalition against the Islamic State. It shares borders with Syria and Iraq, two war-torn nations at the heart of the fight against the Islamic State. Turkish forces have been deployed in Syria since August with the aim of clearing a border patch of Islamic State militants and Syrian Kurdish fighters that Ankara considers related to its own Kurdish insurgency. Some of those taken into custody Sunday reportedly were active in conflict zones and engaged in recruitment efforts for the Islamic State, relaying its propaganda over social media."

No links to ISIS or al-Qaida, so nothing to see here, folks. Just another mass shooting, a small price to pay for the right to own as many guns as you can stockpile. By now we've all heard the background story: Federal agents in Alaska say an American citizen, a veteran, voluntarily walked into FBI headquarters in Anchorage and confided to them that he was hearing voices. After a four-day mental evaluation he was released and shortly thereafter he got back his gun. When he boarded a plane for Fort Lauderdale, he was just another gun owner with a legally owned firearm on his way to Florida. Once he got off that plane though, he ceased being a good-guy-with-a-gun and is accused of being a mass murderer. Not a terrorist though, because he lacked the religious and/or political affiliations required to strike terror in our hearts, unless of course you happened to be at the airport that afternoon. When he ran out of ammo, he simply dropped his weapon and surrendered to police. We can't go violating the Second Amendment rights of everyone who seems a little delusional just because a few of these folks might be dangerous, now can we? Oh wait, isn't that the argument being made in this country to keep out Muslims seeking refuge out? Unless committed by someone professing allegiance to a foreign terrorist organization, mass shootings have become just another unfortunate fact of life in America. Until we start electing politicians willing to stand up to the gun lobby this pattern of random violence will continue unabated. Peter Gurtenstein, St. Pete Beach Do markets work in  health care?  | Column, Jan. 16 Hard to shop around Columnist David Brooks wonders if markets work in health care. His analysis seems to be based on consumers dealing directly with doctors and hospitals. However, that's not the way health care works. Health care has a middleman called insurance. Suppose you are hurt and unconscious. There is no shopping around getting quotes. Suppose your child is hurt, say, a broken bone. You go to the doctor or hospital. They verify a broken bone that needs a cast. Are you going to go to other hospitals looking for the lowest quote? Brooks suggests that people figure out the best places to go. I tend to agree. But those places would, in theory, be the most expensive in a free market. I may be willing to go to the lowest cost store around for food, clothes and other stuff. But when it comes to health care, I want to go to the place everyone agrees is the best. Health care is not a normal market, so I don't expect normal market practices would work. Russ A. Johnson, Hudson Scant evidence housing vouchers  curb poverty  | Column, Jan. 16 Poverty vs. homelessness As a retired educator who worked in a poverty community for 31 years, I read professor Susan Greenbaum's column with considerable interest. While she rightly questions if housing vouchers substantially curb poverty, I thought housing vouchers are intended to curb homelessness. Poverty can be curbed with more better-paying jobs as Professor Greenbaum states. But it's not an either/or choice. Both housing vouchers and better paying jobs are needed — the first to curb homelessness and the second to curb poverty. Better-paying jobs can be directly and quickly accomplished by raising the minimum wage in stages to $15 per hour over five years. Florida's minimum wage is only $8.10. Frank Lupo, St. Petersburg The presidential inauguration I will march in Washington On Saturday, the day after President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, I will participate in the Women's March in Washington, D.C., in a show of solidarity against the threats against our rights and liberties. Like many others who had believed that the social progress our country had experienced in the past few years would continue when our first woman president was elected, I was horrified when a man was elected whose bullying tactics and treatment of women, Mexicans, Muslims, African Americans, the disabled and anyone who challenges him instills fear and despair and divides our country. I will be proudly and loudly marching with two of my granddaughters, two sisters, my daughter-in-law, and many friends who are coming from all over the country. I am marching because the world needs to see that the majority of our citizens, shown by popular vote, want to protect our human rights and those of the disenfranchised. Mary Kaplan, New Port Richey Presidential inauguration Hoping for the best As a moderate Democrat, I will feel relief on Inauguration Day. I will no longer have to defend President Barack Obama and Obamacare. I will be able to sit back and watch President Donald Trump and the GOP improve health care and make it cheaper; improve our infrastructure; build the wall on the border with Mexico; get better trade agreements and improve our relations with our friends and enemies. Oh, how I pray, this comes true. Dominick Vazzano, St. Petersburg Walmart closing in Midtown  | Jan. 18 Start a co-op instead I was sad to read about the closing of Walmart in South St. Petersburg. Rather than depend on another chain to come in and break hearts again, why doesn't the city work with the neighborhood to create a food co-op? I've shopped in food co-ops in other cities. Usually they are started by people who want organic produce and small batch cheeses, but they can take any form. A successful co-op would would enhance the neighborhood in many ways.

Trump’s Ties to Truther Alex Jones Disgust Her.,http://www.thedailybeast.com/erica-lafferty-lost-her-mother-in-sandy-hook-trumps-ties-to-truther-alex-jones-disgust-her,en,False,,1707,Daily Beast,http://www.thedailybeast.com/,"SEARCH Alex Jones, who says the Sandy Hook massacre was staged by actors, is an adviser to the president-elect. The daughter of the school’s slain principal finds their association appalling. Senior Entertainment Editor “I never saw her without a smile,” recalled Amy Seaver. “I believe she had the children’s best intentions [in mind] all the time. She was always looking out for them.” Seaver, then mother to a first grader at Sandy Hook Elementary, was sharing her thoughts on the school’s principal, Dawn Hochsprung. On Dec. 14, 2012, Hochsprung sacrificed her life by lunging at gunman Adam Lanza in an attempt to stop his vicious shooting spree. When all was said and done, 20 young children and six adults lay dead. Enter Alex Jones, the rotund host of the conspiracy-theory program Infowars. His greatest hits include: believing the U.S. government was behind the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing; accusing the Bush administration of orchestrating the 9/11 attacks; and his General Jack D. Ripper-esque theory that the government is poisoning our drinking water via fluoridation in order to turn straight people gay. Jones also spent much of the election boasting of his advisership role to Donald Trump, who appeared on Jones’s Infowars program in the early days of his presidential campaign and showered praise on the loon, proclaiming: “Your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down.” And on Saturday, Jones posted a video to YouTube claiming that President-elect Trump had given him a call to thank him for his help, and that he’d “be on [Infowars] in the next few weeks” to thank his audience personally. For those keeping track, yes, Trump called a 9/11 truther before he phoned the Pentagon. On the Jan. 13, 2015, edition of his show, Jones promoted one of his more disgusting theories: that the Sandy Hook massacre was staged. “Sandy Hook is a synthetic completely fake with actors, in my view, manufactured,” said Jones. “I couldn’t believe it at first. I knew they had actors there, clearly, but I thought they killed some real kids. And it just shows how bold they are, that they clearly used actors.” (There is absolutely no evidence to support this.) And on his program Thursday, Jones doubled down on several of his thoroughly debunked Sandy Hook conspiracy theories, including: that CNN’s Anderson Cooper “was using a green screen” to report on the shooting, that Sandy Hook Elementary was “closed years before” the shooting, and that “weird videos” exist of parents fake-grieving. Erica Lafferty, daughter of the late Sandy Hook hero Dawn Hochsprung, has had enough of Jones’s sick exploitation of the Sandy Hook tragedy. “On Alex Jones, this is a man who for nearly four years now has put great effort into making not only my family and not only the 25 other victims’ families but the entire town of Newtown miserable, and to degrade and disregard the hurt, anguish, and pain that we have to live with every day by claiming that it was a conspiracy theory and a hoax,” she tells The Daily Beast.“Honestly, I would love to have him at my house on Thanksgiving. I would love for him to come and sit in the chair where my mother would be sitting and have to look at my nieces and nephews in the eye and explain to them why grandma can’t be there. If he actually had to experience something like that, his ideas and conspiracy-theory rhetoric would change significantly.” In an Aug. 25 speech railing against the “alt-right,” Hillary Clinton criticized Trump’s deeply troubling alliance with Jones. And on Oct. 16, her campaign released an anti-Trump ad targeting Trump’s cozy relationship with the conspiracy theorist. Lafferty, who served as a Clinton surrogate during her White House run, is also appalled by Trump’s close ties to Jones. “As far as our now president-elect praising Alex Jones, calling his reputation ‘amazing,’ and telling him he’s not going to let him down, it is absolutely unacceptable,” she says. “This is a man who, in the wake of the next mass shooting, is going to have to address the nation and comfort those families. I cannot imagine what it would be like for me—having gone through this election and seen all the hateful things Trump has supported, heard all the derogatory things he’s said about gun violence, and witnessed all the conspiracy theories he’s pushed—to walk into that room in the wake of the shooting and see Donald Trump instead of President Obama. I don’t know that that’s a man I would be able to respect if he’s standing on the side of people like Alex Jones.” She continues: “I have put great effort into not paying attention to anything that Alex Jones does because it’s not worth my time, effort, or energy. But I think it’s imperative that the president-elect does not associate with people like Alex Jones because, as the child of a mother who was murdered in a mass shooting in an elementary school, it’s disgusting, and it’s degrading, and I expect a lot more from a president than that.” While President-elect Trump has flip-flopped on nearly every major issue over the years, the one subject he’s been remarkably consistent on is guns. According to his campaign website, Trump wants to bring concealed carry to all 50 states as well as abolish any and all gun and magazine restrictions, stating “the government has no business dictating what types of firearms good, honest people are allowed to own.” He is, unsurprisingly, heavily backed by the National Rifle Association, which spent $30 million on anti-Clinton and pro-Trump ads over the course of the presidential election. “I think a lot of his gun comments are just wiped under the rug,” says Lafferty. “Specifically, to say that he could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and not lose any votes is absolutely disgusting and degrading to all survivors of gun violence across the country, and that definitely didn’t have enough attention paid to it. Like so many of the outrageous things he does and says, people just say, oh, here’s a reality star doing what he does, but the fact of the matter is presidents are held to a higher standard than reality-TV stars, and he’s going to need to learn that. This December 14th will mark four years since the Sandy Hook massacre. One of the things that’s helped Lafferty cope with her mother’s passing is her work on behalf of gun control groups, including Moms Demand Action and Everytown for Gun Safety. “I’d like to say that it has gotten easier, but I don’t think that’s a fair assessment. You just kind of learn to live with the new reality that has been forced upon you,” she offers. “Myself and many others in my family have taken on the fight of gun violence prevention and that has been very therapeutic for me. I work with Moms Demand Action and Everytown for Gun Safety has been my guiding light for the past three and a half years. I don’t know where I’d be without them. All I can do is wake up every day and try to do the next best thing.”"

What is it like to be a Muslim, or a person frequently mistaken for a Muslim, in the aftermath of an apparent terrorist attack? Americans who don't fit that description can't really know for sure, but three news items from the last few days show that knee-jerk prejudice is inexcusably common. If your ethnic group were treated this way, you'd be walking around paranoid and anxious. Innocent victim number one is a 20-year-old Saudi who is studying in the Boston area. He was watching the marathon when the force of the bomb blast tore into him. Amy Davidson tells his story: Why the search, the interrogation, the dogs, the bomb squad, and the injured man's name tweeted out, attached to the word ""suspect""? After the bombs went off, people were running in every direction -- so was the young man. Many, like him, were hurt badly; many of them were saved by the unflinching kindness of strangers, who carried them or stopped the bleeding with their own hands and improvised tourniquets. ""Exhausted runners who kept running to the nearest hospital to give blood,"" President Obama said. ""They helped one another, consoled one another,"" Carmen Ortiz, the U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts, said. In the midst of that, according to a CBS News report, a bystander saw the young man running, badly hurt, rushed to him, and then ""tackled"" him, bringing him down. People thought he looked suspicious. Innocent victim number two, a 17-year-old high-school student whose name I'll withhold, had his image plastered across the front page of The New York Post, a newspaper also involved in spreading the story of the Saudi youth. Here is the effect of the tabloid's irresponsible journalism: I think Hayes is correct about the purpose of that phrase, though admittedly neither of us can prove it. In any case, it would be enlightening to hear CNN explain why it found that descriptor relevant. In light of these incidents, it's worth taking a close look at Jonathan Tobin's work at Commentary. ""The need for the media to behave responsibly is greater than ever,"" he writes. That's the high point of his piece. Here's the low point: This is the sort of analysis that's taken seriously at Commentary. Tobin doesn't acknowledge the pervasive suspicion born by all Muslims since 9/11; he doesn't mention that America's largest city began a spy campaign that ethnically profiled innocent Muslims for more than a decade; he doesn't mention the string of incidents targeting mosques; or the national politicians who urged that New York Muslims be forbidden from building a community center in lower Manhattan; he doesn't mention the Gallup survey in which 40 percent of Americans admitted feeling prejudice toward Muslims; or the survey of Muslims who say it is more difficult for them in America since 9/11; nor does he mention that hate crimes against Muslims went from less than 30 in the year just before 9/11 to almost 500 in the year after it; or the events summarized above from the last week. No, in Tobin's world, Rush Limbaugh has suffered more in the aftermath of terrorist attacks than America's Muslims. That belief doesn't make Tobin a bad guy -- just a case study in extreme obliviousness. It's especially hard to forgiven because I've alerted him to this evidence before. Most Americans have behaved responsibly in the last week. But a significant minority has shown itself willing to make knee-jerk accusations that do significant harm to perfectly innocent people. Amidst it all, responsible journalists don't disappear the problem. Americans ought to be made aware of all the times innocent Muslims have been victimized in hopes that it makes their would be tormenters less sure of themselves. That is so whether the Boston perpetrators turn out to be Islamists, left-wing, right-wing, or anything else. The value of speculating about their identity before it is known? Zero."

Images of Leitch’s office in Collingwood, Ont. surfaced online early Wednesday. “Hate puts us all at risk,” the banner reads, before citing the six people who were gunned down Sunday night during evening prayers: Khaled Belkacemi, 60 Aboubaker Thabti, 44 Abdelkrim Hassane, 41 Ibrahima Barry, 39 This was hung on Kellie Leitch's office overnight in Collingwood @NewsBayshorepic.twitter.com/yHa87dtsIz — Ally G (@algibbons) February 1, 2017 Though the banner includes the term ""#notmymp,"" the organizer behind a lawn sign campaign using that hashtag in Leitch’s Simcoe-Grey riding told the Collingwood Connection Tuesday that her group was not responsible. Leitch has called for immigrants, refugees, and visitors to screened for so-called “anti-Canadian values” and raised eyebrows by lauding the election of Donald Trump last November. Though she has long denied that the controversial policy is directed at Muslims, fellow Tory leadership rival Michael Chong dismissed it as “dog-whistle politics”and xenophobic. Leitch not backing down Leitch told The Globe and Mail’s Laura Stone Tuesday that it is “ridiculous” for anyone try to link her proposal to the attack, arguing her policy could also apply to white supremacists. Though Leitch’s campaign has been endorsed by two white nationalist groups, she suggested during a previous interview that she was not overly concerned about racists gravitating to her. “I’m not one [a racist] myself,” she told AM640 in November. “It is not for me to speak about other individuals.” Statement after mosque attack did not mention Muslims Like other Tory leadership candidates, Leitch released a statement Monday condemning the shooting, but her remarks notably did not mention that the attack took place in a mosque or that the victims were Muslims. Colin Walmsley, a University of Oxford student, later took to Twitter with an edited version of Leitch's statement that created a splash on social media. Hey @KellieLeitch, something about your statement seemed a bit off, so I edited it for you #StandwithMuslims#WelcometoCanada#cdnpolipic.twitter.com/dawbZu4wEL — Colin Walmsley (@ColinWalmsley) January 31, 2017 Chong also released a fiery statementthis week, saying it was time to root out politicians who are “playing footsie with hate.” His release did not mention Leitch, but noted that one of his leadership rivals has been endorsed by white supremacist groups. “Proposals to add an additional screen for immigrants based on anti-Canadian values is not a practical solution, and frankly, is playing to fears and prejudices,” Chong said in the statement. “Demagogues and wannabe demagogues, playing to fears and prejudices, have created the space for hate to grow. The politicians espousing these policies may do it in a genteel fashion that sounds acceptable, but check out the comments on their social media platforms and you will find cesspools of hate.” This mosque attack is no accident: It's a direct result of demagogues and wannabe demagogues playing to fears and prejudices 1/3 — Michael Chong (@MichaelChongMP) January 30, 2017 Chong also wrote on Twitter that, yes, he was angry: ""This is Canada.

The six men were ages 39 to 60. ■ Thirty-nine worshipers who were at the mosque, the Islamic Cultural Center of Quebec, were unharmed, the police said. ■ Police officials said that one suspect had been arrested at the scene of the shooting and another was apprehended nearby, on Île d’Orleans. The police have not yet identified a motive for the attack. At a news conference Monday morning, the authorities declined to comment on the identity or origin of the suspects. The authorities said it was the first time that the police in the city had dealt with an attack of such magnitude. They repeated their characterization of the attack as an act of terrorism because of its size and style. Antiterrorism forces activated in response. One spokesman said that it might have been something else. The police said all of the victims were men, although they revised their age range to 39 to 60. One of the suspects fled by vehicle and called 911 at 8:10 p.m. Sunday, describing his actions and saying he wanted to cooperate. He gave his location and was quickly apprehended. Canadian television showed an abandoned gray Mitsubishi S.U.V. with the driver door open and emergency lights flashing. The police said neither of the suspects was known to the police. Kellie Leitch, a conservative member of Parliament who has proposed screening immigrants for “Canadian values,” released a statement saying that “this outrageous act of violence is an attack not just on those gathered in a house of worship, but on the very fabric of Canadian society.” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a statement on behalf of himself and his wife after the shooting: It was with tremendous shock, sadness and anger that I heard of this evening’s tragic and fatal shooting at the Centre Culturel Islamique de Québec, located in the Ste.-Foy neighborhood of the city of Québec. We condemn this terrorist attack on Muslims in a center of worship and refuge. On behalf of all Canadians, Sophie and I offer our deepest condolences to the family and friends of all those who have died, and we wish a speedy recovery to those who have been injured. While authorities are still investigating and details continue to be confirmed, it is heart-wrenching to see such senseless violence. Diversity is our strength, and religious tolerance is a value that we, as Canadians, hold dear. Muslim-Canadians are an important part of our national fabric, and these senseless acts have no place in our communities, cities and country. Canadian law enforcement agencies will protect the rights of all Canadians, and will make every effort to apprehend the perpetrators of this act and all acts of intolerance. Tonight, we grieve with the people of Ste.-Foy and all Canadians. The leaders of the province and city of Quebec held a news conference Monday morning to express their solidarity with Muslims. “We are with you. You are at home,” said Philippe Couillard, the premier of Quebec, addressing Muslims. “I have no doubt that one particular community, the Muslim community, was the target of this deadly attack.” The officials are set to meet with Muslim leaders at 10 a.m. on Monday. In a post on Twitter, Mr. Couillard called for solidarity with Muslims: “Let’s unite against violence. Solidarity with the Québécois of Muslim faith.” Martin Coiteux, the provincial minister of public security, said that “the police systems for dealing with terrorist acts have been activated.” In a post on Twitter, he said that “ensuring the safety of the population is our priority.” Mr. Trudeau quickly responded to the shooting on Twitter: Régis Labeaume, the mayor of Quebec, said in a statement that the city was in a state of shock. “Quebec City is an open city, where all must be able to live in safety and respect,” he said. Of the city’s roughly 765,000 people, 6,760 identified themselves as Muslim in the last national census. While Muslims make up a small percentage of the primarily-Roman Catholic city, they significantly outnumber members of Canada’s two main Protestant churches. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York said the police were providing additional protection for mosques there after the Quebec shooting, according to The Associated Press. “All New Yorkers should be vigilant. If you see something, say something,” he posted on Twitter. The police in Montreal and other Canadian cities also plan to increase security at and around mosques, according to CBC. Mohamed Yangui, the president of the mosque, was not present at the time of the attack, but he told the Toronto daily The Globe and Mail that evening prayers were usually attended by 60 to 100 people. He relayed the accounts of witnesses who told him that the assailants had reloaded their guns as they worked their way through two floors. “A mass shooting. In Quebec City. I can’t believe it,” he said. “We’ve never done anything to provoke anyone, and we’ve never cultivated hatred for anyone. I’m just beside myself.” Advertisement"
634919675,2017-01-13 07:00:00,Chelsea Manning Describes Bleak Life in a Men’s Prison,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/13/us/chelsea-manning-sentence-obama.html?_r=0,en,False,,1,New York Times,http://nytimes.com,"Advertisement Supported by By Charlie Savage Most mornings at 4:30, half an hour before the “first call” awakens inmates at the Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas, an alarm rings within an 80-square-foot cell. Inmate 89289, slightly built with short hair, rises to apply makeup and don female undergarments and a brown uniform before the still-slumbering men in the adjacent cells stir. That is the routine for Chelsea Manning, America’s most famous convicted leaker and the prison’s most unusual inmate. She is serving the longest sentence ever imposed for disclosing government secrets — 35 years — and her status as a celebrity of sorts and an incarcerated transgender woman presents continuing difficulties for the military. During the day, Ms. Manning, who was an Army intelligence analyst known as Bradley Manning when she disclosed archives of secret military and diplomatic files to WikiLeaks in 2010, builds picture frames and furniture in the prison wood shop. In the evenings, before the 10:05 p.m. lockdown, she reads through streams of letters, including from antisecrecy enthusiasts who view her as a whistle-blower. “I am always busy. I have a backlog of things to do: legal, administrative, press inquiries, and writing — lots of writing,” Ms. Manning wrote in response to questions submitted by The Times because the Army does not permit her to speak directly to journalists. “Being me is a full-time job.” But Ms. Manning, who is struggling to transition to life as a woman while enduring a bleak existence at a male military prison, has asked President Obama to commute the remainder of her sentence before he leaves office next week. She poses particular challenges as a prisoner, with a volunteer support network that helps bring global attention to her treatment, fragile mental state — she twice tried to commit suicide in 2016 — and need for treatment that the military has no experience providing. Her request comes as the world is again focused on WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, whom her leaks made famous. The organization last year published Clinton campaign emails, obtained in a hacking, as part of what American intelligence officials claim was a covert Russian operation aimed at tilting the election to President-elect Donald J. Trump. (Ms. Manning declined to discuss WikiLeaks, saying only that her decision to send documents to it “was neither an endorsement nor an affiliation.”) It also comes at a time of flux in the military’s policies on gender identity. Last June, the Obama administration rescinded a ban on transgender people serving in the military and began overhauling its practices, which eventually would include providing gender reassignment surgery. But Mr. Trump has derided the lifting of the ban as “politically correct,” raising the possibility that his administration may roll back the changes. The White House declined to comment on Ms. Manning’s commutation request. The Army declined to comment about her situation at Fort Leavenworth, citing privacy laws. A military prosecutor had called Ms. Manning a “traitor” at her 2013 court-martial, and officials have said the disclosures disrupted government operations and put people at risk, although prosecutors did not claim anyone was killed because of them. In a statement accompanying her petition asking Mr. Obama to reduce her sentence to the nearly seven years she already has served, Ms. Manning, now 29, said she never intended to hurt anyone and pleaded for a chance to start her life over. “I need help,” she wrote. “I am living through a cycle of anxiety, anger, hopelessness, loss, and depression. I cannot focus. I cannot sleep. I attempted to take my own life.” On Aug. 22, 2013, the day after her sentencing for sending documents to WikiLeaks, Ms. Manning’s lawyer read a statement on the “Today” show announcing that she was female, wanted to be called “Chelsea” rather than “Bradley” and would seek cross-sex hormone therapy. To observers of her court-martial, this was no surprise. Her motivation for leaking hundreds of thousands of files she had copied from a classified computer network while serving in Iraq, as she wrote at the time, was hope that they would spark “worldwide discussion, debates, and reforms.” But at her trial, she apologized and noted that she was “dealing with a lot of issues” when she had made that decision. Testimony showed that she had been in a mental and emotional crisis as she came to grips, in the stress of a war zone, with the fact that she was not merely gay, as she had believed while growing up in Oklahoma, but had gender dysphoria — a disconnect between one’s gender identity and sex assigned at birth. In the months before her leaks and May 2010 arrest, she had been behaving erratically and emailed a picture of herself wearing a woman’s wig to her supervisor. The military sent Ms. Manning to serve out her sentence as a medium-security inmate at the Fort Leavenworth Disciplinary Barracks, its main prison for male inmates. Court documents show that Ms. Manning has had counseling sessions with a prison psychologist, Dr. Ellen Galloway, at least once a week, and military authorities have over time allowed her access to some treatments doctors prescribed for her gender dysphoria, in part because of pressure from a lawsuit filed by Chase Strangio, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, in September 2014. She can now wear female prison undergarments, including a sports bra, and “subdued cosmetics.” In early 2015, she was permitted to get speech therapy to feminize the tone and pitch of her voice and began cross-sex hormone therapy prescribed, Mr. Strangio said, by an endocrinologist brought in from the military’s Walter Reed hospital. Since then, Ms. Manning wrote, she has developed breasts and curvier hips. “There have been significant changes since I’ve been taking the hormones, and I am happy with them,” she said. But, citing security risks, the military rejected the recommendation of an outside psychologist who said she should be permitted to further feminize her appearance by growing her hair longer than male military standards. Mr. Strangio is helping her challenge that restriction. “Plaintiff feels like a freak and a weirdo — not because having short hair makes a person less of a woman — but because for her, it undermines specifically recommended treatment and sends the message to everyone that she is not a ‘real’ woman,” he wrote in a court filing. “She is getting hormones, but it sounds like the inability to socially transition, or to have surgery, could be contributing to suicidality — especially when she is looking at decades in prison and thus a certain hopelessness about whether that might ever be available for her,” said Dan Karasic, a University of California, San Francisco psychiatrist and the chairman of the American Psychiatric Association’s work group on gender dysphoria; he cautioned that he had not examined her. The military turned down a request by The New York Times to visit the facility. But an Army spokesman, Wayne Hall, provided written answers from the Army Corrections Command to questions posed by The Times, from which a sketch of her environment emerged. Ms. Manning’s cell, like others at Fort Leavenworth, contains a bed, toilet, sink, locker, storage bin, chair and desk, according to the Army. She showers in a nearby communal bathroom with individual stalls. She has no access to the internet, but says she receives “at least a couple hundred pieces of mail every week.” The Army does not permit her to see people who did not know her before her incarceration, so she is not allowed to meet with a handful of volunteers who have formed an informal network of supporters, but she calls one of them daily. A volunteer who relayed questions from The Times to her asked not to be named, citing security concerns. Ms. Manning said she recently finished reading “Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies,” a book about artificial intelligence by the Swedish philosopher Nick Bostrom, and “1Q84,” a dystopian novel by Haruki Murakami. She is interested in efforts to develop stronger encryption and has been “going through” the “Princeton Companion to Mathematics.” She also said she reads women’s athletic, fashion and lifestyle magazines like Shape, Vogue, Vanity Fair and Cosmopolitan. Her cell door has a window looking onto a central “day room” with tables, chairs, pay phones and televisions. For a time, Ms. Manning played Dungeons & Dragons with a few fellow inmates, but she said she had had no time in recent months. She eats meals with other inmates in a dining facility and works on a team at the wood shop. The roughly 424 inmates held at Fort Leavenworth with Ms. Manning include men accused of routine crimes as well as some who drew public attention, including Nidal Hasan, convicted in a 2009 mass shooting at Fort Hood and held on the prison’s death row wing, and Robert Bales, who murdered 16 Afghans in Kandahar and was sentenced to life without parole in August 2013. Ms. Manning declined to say much about the guards or fellow inmates, other than to say that they have never bullied or attacked her. “It’s best to keep to yourself and try not to get involved in any drama,” she wrote. “It’s a little harder for me to keep to myself, since the staff is constantly watching me and those that interact with me. But I’m used to it by now. I don’t feel threatened by the other prisoners. I have friends.” Her special status at Fort Leavenworth is evident. Nancy Hollander, one of the lawyers working on the appeal of her conviction and sentence, said the Army built a special secure information facility in a windowless basement room so she could meet with them and discuss still-classified documents she leaked. While Ms. Manning said she could not say on her monitored phone calls “anything critical of the prison or the current administration or I can get charged for violation of a lawful general order,” her supporters pay close attention to her treatment. Scrutiny of the military’s struggles to deal with Ms. Manning go back to her confinement at the Quantico, Va., brig after her arrest, when she was held for months in isolation, shackled during exercise and sometimes stripped of clothing and glasses to prevent her from harming herself — even after a prison psychologist said such steps were unnecessary. A military judge ruled that the treatment had been illegal. At Leavenworth, after a minor disagreement with a guard in 2015, officials punished her, among other things, for “medical misuse” because they found a tube of toothpaste in her cell that was past its expiration date. Her supporters publicized the incident. In September, her supporters issued a news release saying she was on a hunger strike because of an “overzealous administrative scrutiny” and lack of progress in getting more treatment. She resumed eating after five days. Mr. Strangio said an official told her she would be eligible for the same medical treatment as non-incarcerated transgender soldiers, suggesting she would eventually be permitted to proceed with surgery. But months have passed, and Ms. Manning wrote that she has not seen a surgeon. Later in September, a prison board disciplined Ms. Manning for the disruption a July suicide attempt had caused. The punishment: solitary confinement. While in isolation in October, she tried again to kill herself — by choking herself on a piece of clothing, according to a support network member — before guards intervened. About a week further into that stint in solitary, she experienced a bizarre episode in which four people impersonating guards simulated breaking into the prison one night and pretended to kill her regular guards, filling her with fear, according to an account she filed with the army inspector general. A military official denied her account. Dr. Stuart Grassian, a specialist in the psychological effects of solitary confinement, said her description is consistent with hallucinations often experienced by unstable people placed in isolation. Now, with 28 years of her sentence to go and uncertainty over whether the Trump administration will deny her sex-reassignment surgery, Ms. Manning is hoping Mr. Obama will take mercy on her and free her from military prison, which goes by the acronym U.S.D.B. “I am not asking for a pardon of my conviction. I understand that the various collateral consequences of the court-martial conviction will stay on my record forever,” she wrote in her commutation application. “I am merely asking for a first chance to live my life outside the U.S.D.B. as the person I was born to be.” Advertisement"

Local authorities have since charged 27-year-old Canadian citizen Alexandre Bissonnette with murder and attempted murder for his alleged role in the attack. In an address to the House of Commons shortly after the incident, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned the shooting. ""Make no mistake: This was a terrorist attack,"" Trudeau said. A number of world leaders quickly denounced the attack, with Russian President Vladimir Putin calling it ""staggering in its cruelty and cynicism,"" according to the Kremlin. But more than three days after the shooting, the response from Canada's southern neighbor has been remarkably muted. President Donald Trump did call Trudeau on Monday to offer his condolences. While the White House did not offer a statement about the exchange, a spokesman for Trudeau told Canadian reporters that Trump had also ""offered to provide any assistance as planned"" during the phone call. White House spokesman Sean Spicer later confirmed the call took place when asked at a news briefing on Monday. On Trump's famed social media accounts, a bullhorn the president often uses to communicate with millions of followers, the attack in Quebec City does not appear to have been mentioned at all. Trump's personal Twitter account has posted 16 times since the shooting, and the official POTUS account on the same service tweeted or retweeted other messages 30 times. Neither mentioned the Quebec City attack as of Wednesday afternoon. During the same period, a Facebook account linked to Trump posted at least 20 times. It also had not mentioned the shooting by Wednesday. That radio silence is unusual for Trump. The president is a ravenous consumer of media, and even before he entered the White House he was known to respond quickly and forcefully to acts of terror and mass murder abroad. Just a few hours after an attack in Berlin on Dec. 19 in which a Tunisian-born man drove a truck through a Christmas market, killing 12 people, Trump released a statement that suggested ""innocent civilians were murdered in the streets"" as they prepared to celebrate the holiday. Trump fired up a tweet in just a few hours, noting that there had been a number of violent acts on the same day. ""It is only getting worse,"" the soon-to-be president said. ""The civilized world must change thinking!"" A few days later he returned to the subject of the Berlin attack. ""Such hatred!"" he wrote. ""When will the U.S., and all countries, fight back?"" Over the past year, Trump tweeted more than 4,000 times. At least 49 of those tweets directly mentioned ""terror"" in some way. He often quickly and clearly responded to terror attacks on foreign soil. Here are just a few examples: In almost every case, Trump was responding to an attack claimed by a militant Islamist group. One of the only exceptions is the shooting in Munich, Germany, last July that left 10 people dead, including the perpetrator. While there was initial speculation that the attack was carried out by an Islamic extremist, it was later announced that the attacker was not religiously motivated and had in fact been obsessed with school shootings. Trump did also refer, in passing, to a shooting at a mosque in Switzerland that left three injured in his Dec. 19 tweet. However, police later said that incident was not terror-related. The attack in Quebec City does not appear to have been carried out by a Muslim or inspired by Islamic extremist ideology. In this case, the victims were Muslims and the shooting took place at a mosque, apparently the first mass shooting at an Islamic house of worship in North America. The suspect, Quebec native Bissonnette, was attracted to far-right politics and known for posting comments on social media that denigrated refugees and women on social media, an acquaintance told the Globe and Mail. Bissonnette was also said to be a supporter of French National Front leader Marine Le Pen — and President Trump himself. Trump also appears to have never mentioned the 2015 Charleston church shooting on his Twitter account, and did not share a reaction when white supremacist Dylann Roof was found guilty of the murders of nine African American churchgoers in the attack. The president has only been office for less than two weeks, and he may be finding that the transition period keeps him busier than he was last year. But since Sunday's attack, Trump has found time to tweet a number of times about an executive order that blocked access to the United States for Syrian refugees and a number of other Muslim-majority countries. Meanwhile, members of Trump's camp have seemingly referred to the shooting in Quebec City as a justification for Trump's executive order. Spicer told reporters Monday that the attack was a ""terrible reminder"" of ""why the president is taking steps to be proactive instead of reactive when it comes to our nation’s safety and security.” Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, was also found to have ""liked"" a tweet that suggested that if the Quebec City shooter was found to be a Muslim, it would give Trump's executive order ""political capital."" The White House did not respond to a request for comment from The Washington Post. More on WorldViews Donald Trump’s already complicated relationship with Saudi Arabia Is Trump a Berlusconi?

While Americans of all creeds and faiths were rallying across the country opposing Trump’s immigration ban on travelers and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries, news broke about a mosque shooting in Quebec.  Some of the six worshippers who were killed had moved to Canada from places like Algeria and west Africa for a better life. Although recent events might hint at dark times ahead for millions of American Muslims, the reality is that racism and Islamophobia are nothing new. According to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, the rate of hate crimes against Muslims in the United States rose to 38 per month from 12.6 after the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. As part of my ongoing photography project, Just Me and Allah: A Queer Muslim Photo Project, I am asking my subjects to share how Islam shapes their lives in the hope of exploring what it means to be Muslim at this time in history. So this week, I asked three queer Muslim women from Durham, North Carolina to discuss how the new administration is affecting their lives, and how collective resistance is what will move America forward. I think right now, like many folks in America, I am balancing a lot of different feelings. There is fear for what this administration is going to do, and how that will impact me and the people I love. Our safety, our survival, is routinely threatened in the name of some hypothetical greater safety that does not include us. What they are trying to keep safe is white supremacy, what they are trying to protect is their own power. I’m scared about hate crimes, about healthcare, about same-sex marriage and reproductive rights being negatively impacted, about voter suppression, Muslim registries, and deportations. It is a really sobering time, seeing how power is operating in this country and how important it is that we get organized so we can take that power. Right now, there are protests in Durham daily. I’m seeing more and more brand-new folks showing up to protests than ever before. We are coming together to hear directly from those impacted by these racist policies, to speak out in solidarity with them. Folks are calling their representatives and encouraging others to do the same. I’ve been in North Carolina my entire life. There are a lot of challenges and fears, to be sure, but I love that I am born and raised in the south. As I’ve gotten older, I feel more deeply that this is my state, and that makes me dedicated to stay here and make it better. Although I am worried about the new legislation and executive orders coming down the pipeline, what I am concerned about the most right now is the majority of US folks staying silent in the face of oppression. I’m concerned that the people who could say or do something in a moment when it will matter the most, won’t. Though I feel these concerns, I am also fueled by the ways in which we are already coming together, the dreaming, healing, and creation which is already happening, and I absolutely feel that this most recent version of fascism rearing its head is just the dying gasps of white supremacy. There is a new level of entitlement that is very concerning to me. I think people have held these racist and oppressive beliefs for generations, they aren’t new, but I do think we are seeing a new wave of emboldened harm being enacted on people’s bodies and lives. At this point in my life, my Muslim identity is really more of a political one; though so much of who I am has been shaped by the Muslim community and the space for deep questioning that I found within Islam as a young person, my spiritual practice is now earth-based. Moving to Durham and finding other queer Muslim-identified folks has been hugely transformational in my relationship to Islam. I no longer feel that I have to decide between being queer and Muslim. My Muslim identity is inherently queer, because I am. Islam in its purest form is simply a way of life. From its teachings, I have gathered a deep appreciation and respect for the concept of inner struggle, and believe that this is the work every human needs to do to be healthy. I recognize that my inner struggle is to develop the spiritual strength to be emotionally and spiritually ready to show up against oppression, fascism, racism and to move this outward into my work in solidarity with the health of our planet, and the creatures on it. Trump winning the presidency was a disaster. It seemed like all of the work done to progress this country had come to a standstill for a moment. Afterward, my partner Saba (who is also Muslim) and I weighed the consequences of losing healthcare or being denied the right to marry, which could result in not having the legal right to be present in case of a medical incident. I want to be with her until I die, so it was an easy decision to get married before the inauguration. Though we’ve received some criticism, there’s been an overwhelming outpour of affirmations, love and support. There’s no doubt that this new administration is bringing the truth of white supremacist hetero-patriarchy to the surface for a lot of white folks. The women’s marches were proof of this awakening. It’s long overdue and I’m glad it’s happening. There are so many small and big ways folks can step up to assert and uplift the dignity and humanity of queer Muslim women of color. From speaking out against Islamophobic attacks or passive-aggression online and IRL, to funding our work, our own platforms, or providing more platforms for us to speak our truths and be seen. We exist and we’re fierce as fuck. I do a lot of organizing work. Going door-to-door, couch-to-couch, talking to working-class people of color about the economic struggles in our community is amazing and exhausting work. Trying to identify ways to move my people into organizing and taking action is a long haul but it’s a labor of love. There is a deep numbing and hopelessness from generational trauma that black folks have in this country often referred to as post-traumatic slave syndrome (PTSS). Outside of the churches and finding some spiritual healing in this life, I meet so many black folks, especially young people, who struggle with hopelessness and I know that feeling because I experienced that every single day. The work is hard, necessary and rewarding. Between music and community organizing, I know this is my contribution to changing this world."
564924603,2017-01-10 06:00:07,These nine White House staffers remember their most inspiring day working for President Obama,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2017/01/10/these-nine-white-house-staffers-remember-their-most-inspiring-day-working-for-president-obama/,en,False,,2,Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,"This article is more than 1 year old For many Americans, Barack Obama’s presidency embodies inspiration. A black man raised by a single mother, he made it to the highest office in the land on a message of hope and inclusiveness. A devoted husband and father, he will leave the White House without any notable scandal, either policy, political or personal. What his legacy will be, how history will judge America’s first black president, remains to be seen. His presidency was not without its stumbles and disappointments, but many who worked in his White House will remember the dignity and optimism with which Obama took on the major issues of our time. Obama returns Tuesday evening to Chicago for his farewell address to the country, where he will remind Americans of the good times and stress his enduring faith in public service. In advance of his swan song, we asked those who served in his White House to recall their most inspiring day over the past eight years. Here are the moments they shared: Cecilia Muñoz, assistant to the president and director of the Domestic Policy Council In my eight years in the White House, I have savored especially the moments that have enormous impact without attracting much notice from official Washington. One of my favorites took place in July 2010, when President Obama signed the Tribal Law and Order Act. Native American women have a one in three chance of being raped in their lifetimes, something the president has described as a shock to the conscience. In part, this is because men who are not from a reservation can attack women on reservation land, escaping justice by tribal authorities once they are off the reservation. With the administration’s help, Congress addressed these issues in the Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 and the Violence Against Women Reauthorization of 2013. The standard procedure for a bill signing ceremony is for someone to introduce the president while he waits in the next room. In this case, Lisa Marie Lyotte, of the Sicangu Lakota Ospaya people, began her introduction by bracing herself to recount her very moving story of surviving a violent sexual assault that took place in her home in front of her children. Not surprisingly, she was full of emotion and was at first unable to speak. The president, not waiting for the introduction, burst into the room and gave her a hug, quietly telling her, “I’m right here.” He stood beside her quietly, occasionally squeezing her shoulder as she tearfully told her story and introduced him. There wasn’t much coverage of that signing ceremony in Washington, or of that dramatic moment in which a survivor of violence showed uncommon courage and her president showed uncommon grace. But I will treasure the memory for the rest of my days, with pride in the accomplishment and wonder that it took this country so long. Meet the man who can basically read President Obama’s mind Ned Price, special assistant to the president, and senior director and spokesman for the National Security Council Working in the White House, history is inescapable. Along with my colleagues, I’ve witnessed momentous events — ones that have the potential to lift the national spirit — and endured the stinging pain of setbacks and even tragedy. These are among the moments I will never forget. But perhaps the most inspiring experience — at least on a personal level — was one that has meaning to no one but me. I had been at the White House for just a few weeks, and — in classic newly-arrived-staffer-style — I was attempting to work at breakneck pace. In doing so, I made a rather mundane mistake by allowing my email to suggest a recipient whose name resembled that of a White House colleague. But, in this instance, the subject matter was sensitive, and the erroneous recipient turned out to be a reporter. My mistake was the stuff of headlines later that day. As my initial panic gave way to agony and despair, my phone began to ring. The first call came from a senior White House official, who, I assumed, would ask me to pack my things. But that wasn’t the message she had called to relay. Instead, she imparted words of encouragement. “Everyone makes mistakes. … You’re doing great work. … Don’t get discouraged.” Her call was followed by several more from other senior officials with a similar buck-up message. That was the moment I came to understand the nature of this workplace. Yes, the stakes are high and the pace can be grueling. But I became convinced that there was no better collection of decent colleagues anywhere — all of whom also happen to be among the most talented in their fields. Even as we collectively worked to serve the American people, I was inspired to learn how we also  looked out for each other. Deesha Dyer, special assistant to the president and White House social secretary My first inspiring moment at the White House was simply just stepping on the grounds inside the complex as a 31 year-old intern in 2009. Little did I know that eight years later those list of inspiring moments would grow so long. Another moment that immediately and easily comes to mind is the day that President Obama and the First Lady welcomed Pope Francis in September 2015. From everyday citizens to foreign dignitaries, the President and First Lady have made the White House the People’s House. They have encouraged us to open up the White House and make everyone feel included during their visit here. Immediately upon becoming Social Secretary in May, I brainstormed how the thousands of guests on the South Lawn and the millions watching at home could feel a part of Pope Francis’ arrival ceremony. Part of our approach included the choir at St. Augustine Church in Northwest DC. The church was founded in 1858 by freed Blacks and remains one of the most recognized African-American Catholic churches in the country. The choir arrived on that beautiful morning of the Pope’s Arrival Ceremony and took their position on the South Lawn. I remember looking nervously over at Pope Francis when the choir started to perform. His Holiness and the President were smiling. Until that moment, I had been lost in the fog of logistics and didn’t stop to think about the significance of this rare visit. Listening to the choir, and seeing the 10,000 plus guests gathered on the South lawn to welcome Pope Francis, helped me realize the significance of this historic and special moment in time. Greg Lorjuste, deputy assistant to the president and director of scheduling Since the first Monday of his administration, I have served under President Obama. Since that time, I have worked on hundreds of incredible events, met celebrities that would blow you away and traveled to more than 30 countries, including a surprise visit to Afghanistan and the president’s historic trip to Cuba. These experiences would leave anyone in awe, but my most inspiring day working at the White House came on Nov. 2, 2015 — the President’s visit to Newark. That day was special for two reasons. One, New Jersey is my home state, and my home town is Irvington, which borders Newark. Riding in the presidential motorcade down streets where I dwelled as a youth was surreal. And the issue that brought the president to Newark is one that I am passionate about — criminal justice reform. I’ve seen firsthand the numerous challenges these individuals face when returning home. They are physically freed, but not truly able to live as a free individual. They can’t find a job, in some states they can’t vote, and those who want to continue their education are denied access to many of the programs that would help them do so. The president talked about the struggles ex-offenders face and what his administration was doing to give them a second chance at being productive contributors to society. He announced that the city of Newark would partner with local colleges and businesses to provide job training and placement to ex-offenders, a step that would ease their transition back to society. The president fights for everyone, and especially those that need him most. Tyler Lechtenberg, senior presidential speechwriter One day sticks out above all the others — Friday, June 26, 2015.  It started with the news coming through our email — the Supreme Court had affirmed marriage equality in all 50 states.  Later that morning, I stood behind the cameras watching the president deliver a brief statement in response to perhaps the greatest civil rights achievement of my lifetime. Toward the end of the remarks, he strayed from his prepared text into a beautiful, off-the-cuff tribute to all the millions of nameless Americans whose example pushed forward the cause of equality. Standing there in the Rose Garden, I thought of a friend from high school and a cousin — the folks who opened my eyes to this issue years earlier; the kinds of Americans who opened eyes and hearts in families and communities all across the country.  LGBT rights is the issue that, probably more than any other, brought me into politics in the first place.  And to see marriage equality come full circle, from the routine bigotry and cynical ballot initiatives of my college years to equal protection in all 50 states, was one of the greatest feelings of pride and satisfaction I’ve ever experienced. But that was only part of the day. A few hours later, the President left for Charleston, S.C., to deliver a eulogy for the Rev. Clementa Pinckney. I sat and watched the speech alone in my office on the White House live-stream, until partway through the speech a colleague joined me.  By the end, we were both in tears.  This was the Amazing Grace speech.  The President paid tribute to the black church as an institution, to the faithful nine who passed, and to the spirit of grace that the people of Mother Emanuel showed in the aftermath of unspeakable horror.  He deftly grappled with the pain caused by the Confederate flag. And then he began to sing. It was a moment I’ll never forget — punctuated by that long pause just before his first note. In the midst of overwhelming tragedy and sadness, at a time when we’d just seen hate and evil made flesh, the president summoned, within us all, a song. I had nothing to do with either of those speeches; I was just along for the ride, watching history unfold; watching a president empathize with millions of Americans going through the highs and lows often laid bare by our democracy — but far less often both on the same day. It’s the kind of day that no president can prepare for.  But it’s exactly the kind of day President Obama has always, always risen to meet. And it’s a day that exemplifies these past eight years for me — pride in the work we’ve done; pride in the president we’ve served; and gratitude for the opportunity of a lifetime. MacKenzie Smith, special assistant to the president and director of scheduling and advance for the first lady For the past three years, I’ve been tremendously honored — and very lucky — to have worked for first lady Michelle Obama. I’ve traveled with Mrs. Obama from Washington to Los Angeles, the South Lawn to Liberia, and the East Wing to Cambodia. The private moments are the most memorable — the motorcade rides when it was only Mrs. Obama and me in the car and the hold rooms backstage before big events. That’s why my most inspiring day at the White House was Thursday, Jan. 5, 2017. It was the day a small group of staff gathered to discuss the event where the first lady would give her final remarks. We have had countless meetings like this before for countless past events, but that day was different. No one made the comment aloud, but no one needed to — the weight of finality was evident to us all. She spoke of the message she wanted to share with young people — that they belonged, that each and every one of them has a place in this country of ours. I sat in awe listening to her. In a time of personal transition and uncertainty, she gave me a feeling of confidence. In that moment, I realized she’s always going to have our backs. She’s always going to fight for kids, fight for women, fight for those who need her most. Maria Town, senior associate director, White House Office of Public Engagement July 26, 2016, marked the 26th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. It was also the second day of the Democratic National Convention, and White House staff knew that the eyes of the nation would be on Philadelphia. There was no reception nor speech from the president planned. Although intended to be a low-key ADA commemoration, the day became impactful and poignant. That morning, I greeted visitors taking White House tours celebrating disability history. The tours featured artifacts such as buttons from disability rights marches and a do-it-yourself curb cut. While guests witnessed this activist history being celebrated, I was soon reminded of the work that remains to be done to achieve equality for people with disabilities. I learned that same day that 45 Japanese people with disabilities were stabbed in an institution and 19 of them had died. Immediately, I began working with colleagues on a White House response. We created a dialogue between Japanese and American disability leaders, and the White House became a space for Japanese disability leaders to express their concerns and grief over their slain compatriots. We discussed how our countries could work together to advance the disability rights movement. Afterward, I attended the National Council on Independent Living’s rally, which was a way for me to learn about NCIL’s priorities and emphasize the importance of continued collaboration between disability organizations and the White House. Listening to the rally reminded me that public policy must center on the experiences of those whom the policy will affect. Charlie Anderson, special assistant to the president for economic policy Shortly after the 2014 midterm elections, I got an email that was short and to the point: President Obama had just approved moving forward with a Department of Labor effort cracking down on conflicts of interest in retirement advice. The system needed reform — some retirement advisers were steering their clients into sub-optimal investments, simply because those investment funds paid them money to do so. All told, these conflicts of interest were sapping a whopping $17 billion per year from Americans’ retirement accounts. Over time, people doing everything right to scrimp and save could lose up to an astonishing 25 percent of the savings from these conflicts, which was unfair and hard to believe. Over the past seven years working for the president, I had seen him make countless really tough calls, putting principled policy first. And he did so even when nobody was watching or when he wouldn’t get any credit or might have taken a political hit. But I had no idea how he’d come down on this issue. While it was a clear call on substance, an immense amount of moneyed special interests were aligned against the rulemaking. Even if we made an all-out push to get it done, our memo made clear that Wall Street might be able to lobby enough members of Congress to take it down. The memo was frank and relatively dark — while the policy was common sense, following a midterm election that was difficult for Democrats, the president could be weakened politically if he launched the effort and it was overturned soon after. As the president often says,  “Hard things are hard,” and just as I’d hoped he would, he made an all-out case for the need for the rulemaking. At AARP in February 2015, he announced we were moving forward and made a forceful case for why the rule was needed. And today, because the Department of Labor skillfully got those rules final after adjusting them with extensive feedback, retirement savers will get better advice and have bigger nest eggs for their golden years. Raffi Freedman-Gurspan, senior associate director, White House Office of Public Engagement I will never forget the unveiling of the Stonewall National Monument last June. It had been 47 years since that fateful night in 1969 when LGBT New Yorkers made a stand for human rights and dignity. Then, just two weeks before the historic commemoration by Obama and the National Park Service, the tragic shooting took place at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. The LGBT community reeled from the aftershocks of the worst mass shooting in American history. The administration — along with the state and city of New York — had planned a grand celebration at Christopher Street Park in Greenwich Village with members of the American LGBT community. It was to be a joyous day full of laughter and fun. I wondered: How would my community react in the midst of tragedy? Would this be received well? It turned out this was just the moment our community, indeed the entire nation, needed. As Valerie Jarrett and Secretary Sally Jewell spoke about the importance of Stonewall’s history as a part of the tapestry of the American chronicle, tears streamed down the of faces of young and old, Stonewall veterans, straight allies, police officers and residents of the Village. Everyone at that unveiling ceremony was moved and proud that despite harrowing odds the LGBT community was still celebrating its past and working toward our collective future. That’s the spirit of the Obama administration to me — dignified, resolute and deeply connected to the people. That diverse crowd of faces at Christopher Street Park celebrating our triumph over hate sticks with me to this day.

Please be aware that some of the images might be disturbing. The Quebec City mosque where six people were killed in a weekend shooting has reopened its doors, giving members of the media a chance to see the scene of the fatal attack, including the blood stains and bullet holes that remained in the aftermath. Ahmed El Refai told the Montreal Gazette that the Quebec Islamic Cultural Center opened up for reporters to show Canadians what had happened. “The gunman came in by this entry, this is the entrance of the mosque, started shooting two people on the outside at the entrance and then he came in,” El Refai told reporters as he described the night of the shooting, according to the Gazette. “He started shooting, if you look, that’s the bathroom, he started shooting people here and then he entered that opening and started killing people.” The National Post also wrote that El Refai “guided journalists through the mosque saying it was their responsibility to show what happened."" “As I said, it's our responsibility, as administration, to show people, to show our community first, our Muslim community, and the Canadian community and Quebecois community what has happened in this crime scene,” he said in a video posted to the National Post site. Charged in connection with the devastating mass shooting is Alexandre Bissonnette, a 27-year-old university student. Bissonnette faces six counts of first-degree murder in the attack, which also left several people injured and has been described as an act of terrorism by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Video shot inside the mosque, which was posted to the Islamic center's Facebook page, shows splatters of blood and bullet holes on walls, and blood stains on the carpet. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported that some members of the mosque on Wednesday stopped by to visit one another and “pay their respects.” Mosque administrators are expected to renovate the space in the wake of the shooting, the CBC reported. “The mosque must reopen,” one man who attended prayers Wednesday, told the CBC. “We must say to terrorists that we're here and we won't go away. We don't want them to attain their goal: that we stop praying.” Rosa Hwang, a CTV National News senior broadcast producer, detailed in several tweets what she saw Tuesday night inside the mosque. “Blood still smeared on the walls, pools of dried blood on the carpet,” she said in one tweet. “Graphic evidence of the massacre.” Hwang said that she noticed “shoes of the dead and injured” were still the mosque, and that she saw men crying. “The trauma still fresh,” she wrote. Here's how the Canadian Press described the scene Wednesday: The Sunday night shooting at the small mosque in the suburb of Sainte-Foy occurred as about 50 worshipers had competed evening prayer, and left the nation stunned. “This was a group of innocents targeted for practicing their faith,” Trudeau told the House of Commons. “Make no mistake. This was a terrorist attack.” Bissonnette, the suspect in the attack, was taken into custody 15 miles from the scene, after he called 911. He has been described in media reports as a nationalist and a supporter of Marine Le Pen, the French far-right politician, and President Trump.

573063137,2017-01-27 05:08:10,Chicago&#8217;s minister of carpentry: He made 762 crosses for the city&#8217;s homicide victims last year,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/01/27/chicagos-minister-of-carpentry-he-made-762-crosses-for-the-citys-murder-victims-last-year/,en,False,,2,Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,"This article is more than 1 year old Last month, hundreds of people marched through Chicago holding at least 762 wooden crosses, each representing one of the city’s 762 homicide victims that year. As 2016 closed on Chicago, they marched down Michigan Avenue, the city’s main thoroughfare, holding the four-foot-tall crosses high. Written on the crossbeam of each was the name and age of the deceased and a number, showing the order in which they fell. “Madison Watson, 4 years old, No. 456,” read one, according to The Chicago Tribune. “Donald Carter Brunson, 28 years old, No. 522,” read another. Now, those crosses rest in a lot in the Englewood neighborhood on Chicago’s South Side. The lot is a striking sight, the physical manifestations of lost lives spreading out almost endlessly before one’s eyes. Their creator is carpenter Greg Zanis. Since the new year began, he has made at least 40 more of the crosses. And that’s on top of all the others he constructs. Zanis’s woodworking ministry began about two decades ago. A 6-year-old girl was murdered in his hometown of Aurora, Ill. Her mourning mother visited her local carpenter, who happened to be Zanis, and asked him to build a cross to commemorate her daughter’s short life. She could pay $20. “I wouldn’t take the $20, but I came back in an hour with the cross,” Zanis told The Washington Post in a phone interview. Since then, in many ways, marking death has been Zanis’s life’s work. After his first cross for the Aurora girl, word of his good deed slowly seeped through the neighborhood, and those who lost loved ones began requesting the crosses. He made 13 more, all free of charge. Then he made one for his own use. His 71-year-old father-in-law was shot and killed. “They were like father and son. They were best friends,” his wife, Susan, told The Post in 1999. “I found him dead in a pool of blood at the bottom of the stairs,” Zanis said. “Within a week I built 14 crosses, and one for me.” “It just blossomed into a beauty ministry where I’d [bring them] to different states,” he said. At this point, he has built at least 16,000 crosses. “Every year, I put up around 1,000,” he said. “I’ve got 16,000 up right now. I personally put them in place. I write the names on them.” Added Zanis, “I’d been able to do this on the weekends, but now that I’m retired I can do it whenever I want.” Driven by his deep faith — “I’m pushing Christ, and that’s pushing hope” — the born-again Christian performed his duty quietly, driving “a million miles” around the country, all 50 states, placing crosses where men and women once stood. The general public might have seen his crosses but never known of their creator — and Zanis was fine with that. Then in 1999 Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold took several firearms to Columbine High School in Colorado and killed 12 fellow students and one teacher. Days later, Zanis drove to the school. “I put up 15 crosses. Two for the gunmen,” he said. “They had mothers and sisters and brothers who were grieving too.” He added, “That became a hot topic.” Suddenly, Zanis was known to the nation as newspapers profiled him, noting that an angry father of a slain Columbine student had torn down the cross remembering the gunmen. “I’m not exactly sure what this commitment is that I’ve started,” he told The Post at the time. “But I’ve started it.” Eighteen years later, he hasn’t slowed down. After June’s mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, he showed up with 49 crosses in tow. He doesn’t only build them for national tragedies, but for personal ones as well. “My phone’s been ringing since New Year’s Day,” he said. “Every 10 or 20 minutes, straight through.” Most of those calls are requests for a cross. Local lumber yards have donated some wood, other pieces he gets from Craigslist. He strips doors and old fences and thrown-out furniture for usable wood. And Zanis has the time. So he makes them. Some calls are simply former “clients,” for lack of a better word, expressing gratitude. One man recently arrived at his doorstep with a cross Zanis had constructed 19 years ago for the man’s lost son. “I get a huge amount of satisfaction from it,” Zanis said. His message, he said, is this: “It’s ‘Greg Zanis loves you. Somebody loves you. Somebody cares.’ And a lot of times that equates to other people signing these crosses and leaving messages,” he said. “The dead person doesn’t see the cross. This is for you.” The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning. By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy"

566378378,2017-01-12 12:40:41,"Alexandra Katehakis, M.F.T.:  The Best And Worst Sex Stories From The Last Year",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alexandra-katehakis-mft/best-worst-sex-list-for-2_b_14138020.html,en,False,,27502,HuffPost,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/#,"Contributor Alexandra Katehakis and Center for Healthy Sex (CHS) have released their Annual Best/Worst Sex List for 2016. It was a difficult and challenging year, especially seen through the lens of sexual health. It was a year in which politics came close to displacing sexual politics as the most-talked about topic on therapist couches. Even the positive advances in the field of sexuality seem to have emerged surrounded by an undertow of oppressive conflict threatening to pull them back under in the future. As always, our intention is to bear witness, to be better informed, and to develop our compassion. With this in mind, here is our annual list of the 10 Best & 10 Worst Sex Stories that made headlines this year, as well as 3 additional newsworthy stories that defy category. Best Sex #1: Supreme Court Protects Access to Abortion The Story: On June 27, the Supreme Court ruled 5-3 that Texas cannot place restrictions on the delivery of abortion services that create an undue burden for women seeking an abortion. On June 28, the Court refused similar challenges from Wisconsin and Mississippi. Why this matters: Anti-abortion activists in state government have been enacting harmful regulations for years designed to impede a woman's right to an abortion. Abortion is legal and access is crucial for the sexual health of women and families. Best Sex #2: ICC Makes First Conviction for Sexual Violence The Story: The International Criminal Court (ICC) has jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for the international crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. This year a Congolese politician became the first person to be convicted of crimes of sexual violence in war, as well as the first to be held directly responsible for subordinates' use of rape as a weapon of war. Why this matters: Throughout history, rape has often been considered an inevitable consequence of war. Since 2002, the ICC has made many convictions but never for sexual violence until now. It's high time the historic practice of military rape as a tool of war had its day in global court. Best Sex #3: Oregon Court Rules ""Non-Binary"" a Legal Gender The Story: In April, Jamie Shupe filed a sex change petition with the Multnomah County Court in Oregon to have their sex legally declared as non-binary. In June, a judge granted the petition, making Jamie Shupe the first person to be legally declared as non-binary in the United States. Why this matters: The perception of gender as solely binary might be rooted in tradition, religious dogma, power, or other forms of bias but it is not a perception integrating the reality of chromosomal, physiological and psychological variations. Best Sex #4: Pentagon Ends Transgender Military Ban The Story: Department of Defense regulations that ban transgender persons from US military service were repealed on June 30, 2016. Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced that medical coverage for transgender service members will include doctor-approved hormone therapy and gender reassignment surgery. Why this matters: It's estimated that more than 15,000 transgender people are already serving. It's vital for the policies and laws of America to support and protect transgender individuals in the military for their safety and respect. Best Sex #5: California Revokes Rape Statute of Limitations The Story: Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill revoking California's 10-year statute of limitations on rape cases. However, the new law will only apply to crimes committed after January 1, 2017. Why this matters: It takes years, often decades, to process the immediate trauma of sexual assault. This is especially true for a child. There is no set timeline in psychology for when a rape survivor will become capable of publicly revealing a rape, and there shouldn't be a timeline in the law. Best Sex #6: Africa Combats Female Genital Mutilation The Story: Unicef released 2016 statistics on Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) revealing there are 100 million girls and women alive having undergone the ritual cutting, 70 million more than previous estimates, with females in Egypt, Indonesia and Ethiopia accounting for half of FGM victims worldwide. As a result, Indonesia launched a national campaign this year to end the practice, while Egypt's parliament voted in August to increase penalties for those who perpetrate FGM. Why this matters: At its core, this ritual is based in gender inequality, in age-old attempts to control women's sexuality. FGM is traumatic and can result in lifelong health consequences, with no reported health benefits. Best Sex #7: Celebrity Voyeur Lawsuits Bring Major Damages The Story: Juries awarded $55 million to Erin Andrews and $115 million to Hulk Hogan in separate trials -- both had been filmed in the nude and the recordings were publicly uploaded to the Internet without their consent where they went viral. Why this matters: Voyeurism is not a victimless crime. It is a sexual violation without consent and today's technology makes it more possible than ever. The court has sent a clear message this year -- consequences for voyeurism can be costly. Best Sex #8: Scientists Invent 8-Inch Bionic Penis Implant The Story: Wisconsin scientists have invented a heat-activated metal penis implant made from nitinol, a metal alloy of nickel and titanium, that grows to 8 inches with the help of a remote control. Why this matters: This new device is designed to help men with erectile dysfunction who don't respond to other treatments. Satisfaction rates with currently available pump devices are very high with 80%-90% of men reporting they would choose the surgery again. Best Sex #9: Birth Control Apps Arrange Home Delivery The Story: At least six digital apps, including Planned Parenthood, now provide prescriptions written by clinicians after women answer questions about their health online or by video. Some apps even provide home delivery, no doctor or pharmacy visit needed. Why this matters: There are too many restrictions to birth control, which should be available over the counter. These apps are easily available, easy to use, and they make it easier for women to manage their sexual health, which is a saving grace in these times. Best Sex #10: Obama Defunds 'Abstinence Only' Sex Ed The Story: President Obama removed all funding for abstinence-only education in his proposed federal budget for 2017, cutting a $10 million per year grant from the Department of Health and Human Services that supports such programs, which have never been proven effective. Why this matters: Despite the lack of scientific evidence, over the last 25 years Congress has spent nearly $2 billion on such ""abstinence-until-marriage"" programs. Research has proven that abstinence-only campaigns have been unsuccessful at preventing teen pregnancy or sexual activity. The programs are usually religiously driven and don't feature any actual educational components. Worst Sex #1: Trump Elected Despite Sexism, Sexual Assaults The Story: During the 2016 campaign he took misogyny and casual sexism to unprecedented lows. Video tape showed Donald Trump bragging about forcing himself on women by outright grabbing their vaginas, which is sexual assault. Other women came forward credibly accusing Donald Trump of the very sexual assaults he bragged about. This man was elected President. Why this matters: Forget about eradicating rape culture on college campuses and comprehensive sex education, the President-elect and his policies are a threat to sexual rights we've taken for granted. Worst Sex #2: Closeted Male Attacks LGBT Club in Orlando The Story: Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old security guard, killed 49 people and wounded 53 others inside Pulse, a gay Latino nightclub in Orlando, Florida on June 12, 2016. It was both the deadliest mass shooting by a single shooter and the deadliest incident of violence against LGBT people in United States history. Why this matters: Sexual repression is a form of self-violence that, when projected outward, can be destructive and even deadly. Mateen's ex-wife claimed that his own father called him gay and her current fiancé revealed their family believed he was gay. Officially, the shooting has been classified as an act of terrorism and a hate crime. Worst Sex #3: Roger Ailes Accused of Sexual Harassment The Story: Roger Ailes, founder and former Chairman and CEO of Fox News, was forced to resign this year amidst allegations of sexual harassment. Fox privately reached financial settlements for a number of the cases, and Ailes went on to work as a political consultant for the Trump campaign. Why this matters: The public relies on major media outlets for true and ethical reporting of world events. When a sexual predator presides over such a toxic environment, the quality of the news is suspect. Suppression of sexual misconduct continues to be a major stain on human society worldwide. Worst Sex #4: States Plan Anti-Gay 'Religious Freedom' Laws The Story: A year ago, Indiana enacted the ""Religious Freedom Restoration Act"" into law to protect Christian businesses that did not want to provide services to gays and lesbians, but after massive boycott threats and businesses' concerns the state was later forced to recapitulate, amending the law to ensure civil rights protections. This year similar laws were attempted in Mississippi and Georgia. Why this matters: Within his first 100 days in office, the President-elect has pledged to join Congress and the Senate to pass the ""First Amendment Defense Act,"" an anti-LGBT bill allowing businesses to refuse service to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons based on religious beliefs. Homophobia goes to Washington. Worst Sex #5: Transphobic Bathroom Laws Cause Harm The Story: On May 13, the federal government told public schools they must allow transgender students to use bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity or risk losing federal funding. In August a federal judge in Texas ordered a nationwide injunction blocking the policy. In retaliation, several states attempted to implement so-called ""bathroom bills"" to require transgender persons to use the restroom corresponding to their assigned gender at birth. Only North Carolina signed such a bill, HB2, into law resulting in nationwide outrage, boycotts, and lawsuits. Why this matters: These terrible transphobic bathroom laws have resulted in cases of mistaken identities as cisgender women are mistaken for transgender and humiliated by patrons and police. Transgender individuals have experienced heightened harassment, fear, and trauma around this issue which speaks directly to the right to self-identify. Worst Sex #6: Zika Virus Found to Spread Via Sexual Contact The Story: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced in July that the mosquito-borne Zika virus can be sexually transmitted. Public health experts confirmed that Zika can be passed from a person who has Zika to his or her sex partners through sex that includes vaginal, anal, oral sex, and the sharing of sex toys even if the person does not have symptoms at the time. Why this matters: Zika can be passed from a pregnant woman to her fetus and infection during pregnancy can cause certain birth defects. Eighty percent of people who become infected never have symptoms. Condoms can reduce the chances of infection. Worst Sex #7: Brock Turner Serves 3 Months of Rape Sentence The Story: Brock Turner stood trial in March for sexually penetrating a 22-year-old unconscious woman behind a campus dumpster, in a case known as the ""Stanford Rape."" In June, Turner was convicted on three charges of felony sexual assault, carrying a potential sentence of 14 years in prison. But the judge only sentenced him to six months in prison, and after serving three months, Turner was released -- and the public was outraged. Why this matters: The rape victim submitted to the court a powerful and profound 7,138-word victim impact statement describing in vivid detail her physical, emotional, and spiritual experience. Public outrage railed against the judge and a system of judicial bias in favor of male and class privilege. Worst Sex #8: Pakistani Council Approves Domestic Violence The Story: Pakistan's Islamic Council on Ideology (CII) passed non-binding legislation this year recommending husbands should be allowed to ""lightly beat"" their wives. The CII was created so that democratically-elected legislators can seek clerical advice before implementing legislation that may conflict with Islamic law. Why this matters: Possible infractions include if a woman defies her husband's demands, turns down sexual intercourse, refuses to dress up per his desires, interacts with strangers, or speaks too loudly. Pakistan's Human Rights Commission estimates 70 percent of Pakistani women have suffered domestic violence. Worst Sex #9: Anthony Weiner Caught Sexting Underage Girl The Story: It was the final straw -- a photo of former Congressman Anthony Weiner in his underwear, his toddler child lying next to him on the bed while he sexts with yet another online woman. Huma Abedin, the wife who stood by his side through similar scandals, announced their separation in August. One month later it was reported Weiner knowingly engaged in sexting with a 15-year-old girl, provoking an FBI investigation. Why this matters: What kind of person would endanger the psychological health of his own child with that kind of neglect? Who would repeat the same sexual activity that has led to his public disgrace not once, not twice, but multiple times? This is obviously an unwell individual utterly driven to destruction by compulsive sexual behavior. Worst Sex #10: Rehab Mogul Charged with Sexual Assaults The Story: Christopher Bathum, a self-described ""rehab mogul,"" founded 19 sober-living facilities in Southern California and Colorado where prosecutors allege he sexually assaulted female clients and provided some with drugs. He's been charged with 12 counts of furnishing drugs and 34 counts of sexual assault-related offenses, including rape, as well as money laundering, insurance fraud, grand theft and identify theft. Why this matters: When operated ethically, sober-living homes are a great resource to the recovery community. The blatant abuse of power by criminals like Christopher Bathum defies the very concepts of safety and recovery. The Rest #1: Holland Grants Euthanasia to Sex Abuse Victim The Story: A Dutch woman in her 20s was the victim of child sex abuse from the age of 5 to 15. Her post-traumatic stress disorder included severe anorexia, chronic depression, tendencies to self-harm, hallucinations, obsessions and compulsions. She was almost entirely bedridden. This year it was revealed that doctors in Holland granted her request for euthanasia, the first known case of legally assisted suicide to end trauma resulting from sexual abuse. Why this matters: Euthanasia provides dignity for those who face unimaginable torment due to severe physical or mental dysfunction. The word comes from the Greek language meaning ""good death."" The Rest #2: Rolling Stone Loses U-Va. Rape Defamation Case The Story: In 2014, Rolling Stone published an article by Sarbina Erderly titled ""A Rape on Campus,"" depicting a gang rape at a fraternity at the University of Virginia. Rolling Stone retracted the story after it was revealed to be based on false information. The school's chief administrator for handling sexual assault issues filed a defamation lawsuit and in November 2016, a jury found Rolling Stone and Erderly liable for $3 million in damages. Why this matters: This false story caused a lot of collateral damage. It's not inconceivable that a rape victim might behave erratically, mis-identify people or mis-remember events -- all symptoms of trauma. But it takes unbiased, investigative interviews of all parties involved to uncover the truth. The Rest #3: Urinal Technology Cleans Penis After Urination The Story: There's a new toilet in town -- a team of Spanish inventors debuted a prototype for ""Urinal 2.0,"" which is basically a urinal bidet. After urination, programmed sensors inside the urinal activate an automated cleaning service using a soap-and-water mix to wash the penis and then blow dry it in just three seconds. Why this matters: Will men be seeing urinal bidets in rest stops and mall restrooms? It's confusing enough just to know how to operate the many variations of automated bathroom faucets and paper towel dispensers. At a time when waterless urinals sensibly are becoming the new standard, the Urinal 2.0 seems to require too many resources to operate. This invention fills a need no one seems to be voicing.

667595807,2017-02-01 10:04:08,Canada shooting suspect rented apartment close to mosque: neighbors,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-mosque-shooting-idUSKBN15F1RX,en,False,,4442,Reuters,http://www.reuters.com,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Kevin Dougherty, Allison Lampert 5 Min Read QUEBEC CITY (Reuters) - The French-Canadian student accused of killing six people during evening prayers in a Quebec City mosque had rented an apartment nearby, neighbors said on Tuesday, a sign he may have been targeting the house of worship. Alexandre Bissonnette, 27, was charged in court on Monday with six counts of premeditated murder and five counts of attempted murder with a restricted weapon after Sunday evening’s massacre at the Centre Culturel Islamique de Québec. Police said he acted alone but did not release specific details of the weapon. RDI, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s French-language arm, cited sources as saying the gunman had a 9 mm handgun and a long gun, but the report did not provide further details. The mass shooting, which was rare for Canada and which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned as terrorism, prompted an outpouring of support for the mosque and for Canada’s 1 million Muslims in the country of about 35 million. Authorities in Quebec have called for a spirit of inclusivity, and police have tightened security at all religious institutions in the province, which had the second-highest rate of crimes motivated by religious prejudice among the provinces in 2014, second only to Ontario, according to police crime data collected by Statistics Canada. The data showed that reported crimes of prejudice against Muslims in Canada more than doubled between 2012 and 2014. Bissonnette, who said on his Facebook page that he was a fan of U.S. President Donald Trump and far-right French politician Marine Le Pen, had moved into an apartment in the beige block near the mosque in July and drove a Mitsubishi truck, said a neighbor, who asked not to be identified. The Facebook page has been taken down since the shooting. Another neighbor on the fourth floor never spoke to Bissonnette but frequently heard piano-playing from the apartment. A neighbor of his parents told the CBC that Bissonnette shared the apartment with his twin brother. Related Coverage   Police declined to discuss a motive for the shooting, but friends and online acquaintances told Canadian media that Bissonnette had expressed anti-immigration sentiments, especially toward Muslim refugees. Both law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the United States believe the suspect was sympathetic to right-wing nationalist ideology, and that likely contributed to motive, U.S. officials said. On Tuesday, the prime minister’s chief spokeswoman, Kate Purchase, demanded that Fox News channel in the United States either retract or update a tweet that the gunman was of Moroccan origin. She said the tweet dishonored the victims. The tweet was later taken down. Fox initially corrected the error with a tweet and an update to the story on Monday, said Refet Kaplan, managing director of Fox News.com. “The earlier tweets have now been deleted. We regret the error,” Kaplan said in a statement. Purchase noted that Canada welcomed refugees and immigrants, effectively underscoring major differences between Trudeau and Trump, who on Friday temporarily banned citizens from seven Muslim-majority nations, citing the risk of terrorism. ‘TURNING POINT’ FOR QUEBEC A large turnout at vigils in Quebec City, Montreal and other cities on Monday evening showed people rejected hate speech and wanted to be inclusive, Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard said. “I think it’s a turning point for Quebec, to see people rallying around values like that,” he told reporters in Quebec City, the provincial capital, on Tuesday. Bissonnette did not hide his hostility toward Muslims during his long interrogation by police, Montreal’s La Presse newspaper reported, quoting a source close to the investigation. He was also interested in guns and practiced shooting at a club, La Presse reported. Bissonnette, a social science student at Université Laval and a former cadet, made a brief appearance in court on Monday under tight security. Prosecutors said all of the evidence was not yet ready and Bissonnette was set to appear again on Feb. 21. No charges were read in court and Bissonnette did not enter a plea. His lawyer, Jean Petit, declined to comment at the courthouse on Monday. Quebec’s public safety minister, Martin Coiteux, said security at all religious institutions across the province had been heightened, particularly at mosques. He told reporters that while police always treated reports of religious harassment and hate speech seriously, they had not always done a good job of letting communities know the results of their probes.

Ironically, this is coming from the same crowd that is selling the notion of a privatized VA and who can’t wait to eviscerate Obamacare — which started to make mental health resources far more available in the general population than they’d been previously. Both things are true — the country is awash in guns, and there are too many people who don’t have access to help for their mental health issues. But when it comes to veterans, a lot of other things are true as well. We train young men to to kill and then ask them not to feel bad about it. We teach them that questioning an order is a crime as grave as any crime they might be ordered to commit, and when they are emotionally incapable of completing the moral calculus involved in reconciling those two ideas, we label their psychological reaction a “disorder.” A close friend who was an army sniper in Iraq told me his first kill was a 16-year-old shepherd who was deemed a Taliban fighter. My friend was not asked to judge whether or not the intelligence about the boy was correct — his commander gave him an order and he obeyed it. “I had been perfectly trained by then to think of the men to my left and right as the only other human beings whose humanity I was required to consider. If I thought of that kid as anything other than a target, I would have been unable to pull the trigger.” But he thought about the teenager anyway, of course, just four tours of duty later. My friend’s long recovery from stepping on an IED was haunted by even worse memories of other deaths of civilians he witnessed and sometimes caused, just by following orders. (Like speeding a convoy through a town and running over a 5-year-old.) I asked him how he learned to live with it. “I finally realized the only thing worse than feeling guilty was not feeling guilty. I had to learn to be grateful for my capacity to feel guilt at all.” My friend’s theory was that more PTSD was caused by the effort to deny there was anything to feel bad about than by simply feeling bad about it. We need to drop the “D” from PTSD. There is nothing “disordered” about feeling overwhelmed by memories of violence and mayhem. Struggling with the stress of the actual trauma caused by war is hard enough; we don’t need to make it worse by viewing it as a mental illness. If you feel conflicted about having participated in violence, no matter what the reasons you had to do so, there is nothing wrong with you. Unlike the men who sent you to war, it just means you have a conscience. Author, Editor, Screenwriter, Activist"

We've received your submission. The widow of Orlando nightclub shooter Omar Mateen pleaded not guilty Wednesday to federal charges of aiding and abetting her husband in the fatal bloodbath, and obstructing the investigation. California federal prosecutors maintain that Noor Zahi Salman knew about husband Omar Mateen’s sick intentions, which left 49 people dead and another 68 injured in the June 12 mass shooting at Pulse nightclub. Salman was arrested Monday at her home near San Francisco, where she moved with the couple’s 4-year-old son following the Florida shooting. The 30-year-old will remain in California until a bail hearing set for Feb. 1, and will then head to Florida to face the charges. She could face life behind bars if convicted on the top count.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Teens charged with conspiracy to commit murder Two Florida teenagers were arrested Thursday for allegedly planning an orchestrated mass shooting at their Orlando-area middle school. Local news reports said that one of the the two planned to drop a pencil during gym class to signal to the other to begin shooting. Students who reportedly knew about the plot were told to wear white and shout “Eugene” to avoid being a target. Some students were told not to come to school altogether. The two teens, ages 13 and 14, were arrested when deputies executed search warrants. Weapons were found at both suspects’ homes. The teens were charged with conspiracy to commit murder and were placed in the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice. According to Fox 35 Orlando, the teens are students at The Villages Charter Middle School. Officials at the school became aware of the alleged plot when they heard other students talking about it. According to My News 13, Lake County Sheriff’s deputies questioned the 13-year-old who was allegedly planning the attack. The student told the police of the plot and referenced the Columbine shooting. Deputies learned of the second teen involved in the planning. The 14-year-old also referenced the Columbine shooting when speaking with authorities, according to My News 13. The Sumter County Sheriff’s Office expressed its gratitude to students who were “brave enough” for speaking up about the alleged mass shooting plot, according to WFLA-TV. Ignacio Liunoras, who has two kids at the middle school, echoed the Sheriff’s office statements. “I praise not only the students that reported it, but the parents that taught them to be aware of their surroundings and be aware of any dangers or unusual activity in the school.” Security at the Villages Charter Middle School was expected to increase Friday.

BuzzFeed News Reporter BuzzFeed News Reporter As police and news media scrambled to respond, early reports claimed that two shooters had entered the Islamic Cultural Centre of Quebec and opened fire on worshippers. Police later confirmed they only have one suspect, 27-year-old Alexandre Bissonnette. Police radio chatter is notoriously unreliable in such situations, as police exchange raw information that often proves to be wrong or incomplete. This comment appears to be the only source of this claim, and there is no evidence that police ever investigated such a lead. The Reddit user who posted it did not reply to questions from BuzzFeed News. Prominent alt-right figures like Lauren Southern shared the false claim on Twitter, where others took it up. To be clear, there is no evidence whatsoever that police ever suspected two Syrian refugees in the shooting, and it's unclear where those two names came from other than a single unverified Reddit comment. Davis Aurini and Matt Forney are bloggers affiliated with the men's rights movement. Her post was shared thousands of times on Facebook and remains online. When the police said Bissonnette was the only shooter, most news media deleted their tweets and updated their reports. Bissonnette and Belkhadir were first identified as suspects by TVA, based on anonymous police sources who spoke with the Quebec-based TV station. Other outlets followed. (Belkhadir's name was given as Mohamed Khadir in initial reports.) Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's director of communications, Kate Purchase, later sent an official complaint to Fox News. ""These tweets by Fox News dishonour the memory of the six victims and their families by spreading misinformation, playing identity politics, and perpetuating fear and division within our communities,"" Purchase said. Because police sources initially named Belkhadir as a suspect, many people pushed unfounded theories about a jihadi attack or, perhaps, internecine violence between Sunnis and Shiites. But as subsequent reporting later made clear, Belkhadir was actually one of the heroes of the night who called 911 and tried to help the wounded even while the actual shooter was still on the loose. “I was trying to give first aid to my friend who was on the ground,"" the 29-year-old university student told reporters after being released from jail. When he thought he saw someone with a gun, however, he fled. ""I got scared. It was an image of a man who had a gun. I didn’t know it was a police officer. I thought it was a shooter who had come back."" One of the Canadian media outlets still questioning Mohamed Belkhadir's innocence is TheRebel.Media, which also bought the domain QuebecTerror.com shortly after the shooting. The site's two videos on the Quebec shooting have been viewed over 40,000 times. Alexandre Bissonnette, the only suspect in the case, appeared in court Monday and was charged with six counts of first-degree murder and five counts of attempted murder while using a restricted firearm. buzzfeed.com Ishmael N.

Hours later, a different Esteban Santiago in Miami was inundated with messages on social media asking whether he was the alleged shooter. “Crazy day,” the falsely identified Santiago, 29, told International Business Times. Santiago was at work when people on Instagram and Twitter began asking him about his potential ties to the shooting. The case of mistaken identity unfolded after U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, released the suspect’s name out live on MSNBC. Nelson said the accused shooter used a handgun during the mass shooting. Five people were killed and eight others were injured. Once the name was unveiled, people took to social media to see if they could further identify the accused shooter, and in doing so, they bombarded the wrong Esteban Santiago. “When the shooting was going on, I was helping out a party that was going on at my job,” he said. ""Who wouldn't be annoyed?"" he added.    Later that afternoon, after he was no longer considered a suspect on social media, Santiago told International Business Times he loves his name despite the misunderstanding. “I don’t care what people think about it,” he said.  He said his focus was on the victims killed in Friday's shooting. “I feel sad and sorry for those who are dead today,"" he said. ""People are making fun of the name, but not thinking about the family’s who are not going to see their loved ones anymore.”  The Santiago who was named as the suspect in the shooting is a U.S. citizen with military identification. He was reportedly living in Lake Mary, Florida, at the time of the shooting, according to reports. Santiago served as a combat engineer under the Alaska Army National Guard until August. He joined the Puerto Rico National Guard on Dec. 14, 2007 and was deployed to Iraq from April 23, 2010 to Feb. 19, 2011. Santiago received a general discharge for unsatisfactory performance.  The mass shooting saw authorities at airports around the nation increase their security. “Airport Police are deploying additional resources into our terminals and an increased presence in the Central Terminal Area,” Los Angeles International Airport officials said on Twitter.  “Airport Police are monitoring the situation in Florida closely. Our thoughts and prayers are with those involved.”  Transportation Security Administration did not immediately return a request for comment from the International Business Times."

To revisit this article, select My Account, then View saved stories By Sean Flynn The bullet is still in his belly, but the wound is healing nicely, the abdominal muscles readjusting, strengthening. Three months after Javier was shot in an Orlando nightclub, he can stand and walk and even carry trays in the restaurant. He is getting better. Javier can feel it. An entire summer has passed, a whole season, since that night: dozens and dozens shot dead or wounded, all by one man with two guns in a club called Pulse. Javier spent five nights in the hospital and weeks in a wheelchair. But now he's back at work, functional, normal again. He's untangled the worst of the grief and horror, too, combed it into strands he could examine and understand. A therapist had asked Javier questions and listened to his answers and said he was doing fine, that maybe he could help other Pulse survivors. Javier leaves work late in the middle of September, gets in his car, drives through downtown Orlando. The radio is on. He hears something—a song, a phrase, it doesn't matter—and it reminds him of Gilberto. He smiles. Always the exuberant one, Gilberto. Funny, but in a ridiculous way, confrontational but protective, like that time in a club, crowded and sweaty, when he told Javier, “Just stay close, and if anyone bothers you, you tell me.” A touch of gentle menace. Made a friend feel safe. Gilberto was 25 years old, born and raised in Puerto Rico, studied health-care management. Javier met him when Javier and Adrian got married last May. Gilberto helped move Javier's things into Adrian's apartment, and looked after him when Adrian had to leave town. Javier had only been in Orlando a few months, didn't know many people, appreciated the company. Javier is driving and remembering and smiling. He believes he is happy. At first, I just think good things. And then…boom. Gilberto was at Pulse. The last time Javier saw him was on the dance floor, on his back, arms at his sides. He looked peaceful, as if he were sleeping instead of dead. He also was in color, which was curious: Everything else, the other bodies and all the blood, so much blood, for a moment receded into shadow, as if Javier's mind had focused a spotlight on his friend. And then Javier screamed, so abruptly that he startled himself. Just…boom. Gilberto's dead. In the car, it all floods back, immediate and crushing, like a small dam in his mind collapsed. Simon and Oscar are dead, too. Peter and Jean Carlos and Rodolfo, all dead. And now Javier is weeping in his car. It's hard to drive because it's hard to see, but he has to get home and he has to calm down. He doesn't want Adrian to know. He won't tell Adrian, not for weeks. Three months have gone by. Javier is supposed to be fine by now. Didn't the therapist tell him that? The man with the two guns walked into Pulse at two o'clock in the morning on Sunday, June 12. He carried a Sig Sauer MCX semi-automatic rifle, which he'd bought legally a week earlier, and a Glock 17 semi-automatic pistol, which he'd bought, also legally, the day after he got the rifle. An off-duty police officer working security at the door tried to stop him—tried, in fact, to shoot him—but was out-gunned, took cover, called for backup. The man with the guns continued inside, through the vestibule, toward the dance floor, which is when he started shooting people. By Michael Paterniti Shooting and reloading and shooting again, he remained inside for more than three hours. Dozens of police swarmed Orange Avenue, but they couldn't storm in. There were hostages inside, hiding in bathrooms and in closets and under desks and behind bars. Maybe the shooter had a bomb, like he told a police negotiator. Maybe he'd wrapped explosive vests around four strangers and scattered them to the corners of the building, as he supposedly also said. He claimed to be a soldier for ISIS, a claim that was as convenient and self-aggrandizing as it was empty. When it was over, when the police broke through a wall and shot him to death, Omar Mateen had killed 49 people and wounded 53. It was the worst mass shooting in American history, and the deadliest attack in the United States since 9/11. There were, as a matter of course, universal pronouncements of horror and shock. And there was immense grief, acute and unfathomable in Orlando, rippling out everywhere into something duller and wearying. Most of the victims were Latino, and most were gay, and for a brief while rainbows were appropriately prominent—flags and balloons and lit-up buildings—in mournful tributes. People, strangers, in Texas and Arizona and Ohio and everywhere else, sent money and supplies for the wounded and the families of the dead, $29.5 million to the largest fund alone. Weeks passed, a month, then two more. It happened so long ago, after all, before the summer even officially began. No one forgot, exactly, but memories scab over. Except if it happened to you. Even when you think it's over, when the therapist says you seem fine and you believe it because you're working again and you can barely feel the bullet anymore and you've stopped looking over your shoulder, you'll hear something on the radio and it all comes back, as raw and sharp as ever, and then you're sobbing in the car. It keeps happening, at an unpredictable frequency and with its own malevolent rhythm, because June 12 isn't when it happened. That's just when the shooting stopped. Javier usually works late, but he got off early that Saturday night in June. Oscar and Simon were just back from a short vacation, Niagara Falls, where they'd taken a photo of themselves pointing at the rainbow in the mist, and they wanted to meet Adrian and Javier at Pulse. In 12 years, Pulse had become one of the hubs of Orlando's gay community. It opened in 2004 and is owned by Barbara Poma, who named it as a tribute to her brother—his pulse of life, as it were—who died of complications from AIDS in 1991. It was divided into three separate, adjoining spaces: a main one in the center, with a bar on the back wall and a stage just to the left of the entrance; a smaller room, with another stage, on one side of the building; and, on the other side of the main room, a patio with a separate bar. There were go-go dancers and stage acts and DJs, and the crowd skewed young. (“Anytime anyone turns 18,” says Michael Slaymaker, of the Orlando Youth Alliance, “they go to Pulse for the birthday party.”) It would be too narrow, though, to define Pulse as simply a gay club. It hosted educational forums and fund-raisers and opened its doors to a demographic jumble. “When College Night happened,” says a dancer and theater owner named Blue who used to be the entertainment director at Pulse, “it just became this safe haven for young people—gay, straight, bisexual.” “For me, it was always an open bar,” Adrian says. “Anyone could go, and it was like a family. Maybe some drunk people might act stupid, but it was always happy.” Saturday was Latin Night, which meant Adrian, who was born in one of Havana's outer boroughs, and Javier, who was originally from Mexico City, would know a lot of the crowd. “You know,” Blue says now, “when you turn on CNN, it’s always another town, another city. You get the emotional waves that come with it, but that’s our little club on Orange Avenue.” They got to Pulse about 12:45, stayed inside for a while, went out to the patio because someone wanted a hookah, went back inside to dance. Adrian and Javier were in the main room, near the bar. They heard a bang. Adrian thought someone had dropped something. More bangs, fast pops. Adrian thought they might be firecrackers. Then he was on the floor. He doesn't remember how he got there or how long he was there. Fifteen minutes? Five? A body was on top of him. Could have been a man, might have been a woman, maybe dead, possibly not. He found his phone, slippery-wet with blood, and looked up: Everyone was on the floor, except a man by the main door with a gun. Adrian got up and ran to the patio, away from the shooter. Where was Javier? Adrian started back inside, saw the man with the gun, heard more shooting, stopped. He called Javier's cell, then realized his husband might be hiding, that the ringing might give him away. The police moved him to a safe spot behind a bagel shop. There was nothing Adrian could do but wait. Javier knew the sound was gunfire. An argument, he assumed, some drunk with a gun, firing bullets at someone. Then more shots, people on the floor, a quick, hot pinch on the right side of his belly. A hole in his shirt. He saw a stairway behind the bar, thought it might go to the roof. He ran up it, holding his side. There was only an office up there, five people already huddled inside, one shot in the leg. Javier stuffed himself under a desk with two other people. He called 911, but he was whispering and maybe he lapsed into Spanish. The operator couldn't understand him. He gave his phone to a woman who explained where they were, that two men were shot. While she talked, she kept a knee pressed into Javier's gut to try to keep his blood from leaking out. Javier mapped the building in his head, realized he was above the main dance floor. If the shooter raised the barrel of his rifle 30 degrees, he could put a magazine of bullets through the office floor, kill them all. They waited, six people in an office. The police pinned the shooter in a bathroom, cleared the main room, told everyone to come down from the office, hands in the air. Javier could only get his right arm up, his left pressing on his abdomen. An officer grabbed him at the bottom of the stairs, propped him up, helped him step around the bodies. He saw Gilberto, peaceful and in color. He saw a body dressed all in white on the patio and wondered how he got there to die. He saw Adrian running toward him, and, for an instant, he feared the police would shoot him. The morning after, the theater owner Blue—Blue Star, Baby Blue, or just Blue—woke up at 6 A.M. to the incessant chirping of her cell phone. “I probably missed a hundred calls, a hundred texts,” she says. Blue is a fixture in Orlando's LGBTQ community, involved in philanthropies and forums and boards. Atlanta-born and classically trained in ballet, she danced professionally in New York before she moved to central Florida to study sound engineering in 2000. She worked at Pulse for years, then opened her own theater, The Venue, in the Ivanhoe Village neighborhood. The phone messages were overwhelming, disorienting, fantastical. She was out of town for the weekend, holed up in St. Augustine to write; she stages and performs in plays and burlesque shows, including, every few months, at Pulse. She switched on the television. The cable anchors said it was true, said there were at least 20 dead. “You know,” Blue says now, “when you turn on CNN, it's always another town, another city. You get the emotional waves that come with it, but that's our little club on Orange Avenue.” A hundred and seventy miles away in Lakeland, Robin Maynard had been up since five, jostled awake by her cell. She'd been at her 30th high school reunion the night before, had helped plan it, which was ironic because she left after her junior year, when she realized she was gay and didn't want to be and thought a small, Christian school could wring it out of her. She runs a breast-cancer non-profit now, Libby's Legacy, named for her mother. Robin's not much for dance clubs these days, but she knows everyone in Orlando and at Pulse; the club had a Pink Party benefit for Libby's Legacy. For awards ceremonies and in bios for some board or another, a friend sometimes types “G.S.D.” after her name, where the Ph.D. or the M.D. would go for a doctor. It stands for “gets shit done.” She listened to her first voice mail. It was from a woman named Angela. Her granddaughter didn't come home the night before. She always came home. She had to find her. Robin had to find her.… She kept going through the messages, the TV on, the enormity sinking in, even though the official number of dead then was less than two dozen. She made calls, checked on friends. And then, by all rights, she could have curled up with her fiancée and cried. In the aftermath of a mass shooting, it is easy, even instinctive and reflexive, to be overwhelmed by the magnitude of the violence. But the violence is pixelated into dozens of individual tragedies in which people have immediate, desperate needs. There are innumerable details, mundane and frantic all at once, that need to be dealt with, and someone has to have the presence of mind to do so. Along with Blue, Robin was one of those people. She used to be a crime-scene investigator for the Orange County Sheriff's Office. She can separate, for a while at least, the emotion of a slaughter from the logistical response required to help the families, friends, and victims. She can get shit done. The two of them, Blue in St. Augustine and Robin in the corner of a hotel restaurant in Lakeland, worked their cell phones and computers. Pulse has a legal capacity of 300. In those early hours, all anyone knew was that 20 were dead, then 50. Whose son? Whose husband or wife or daughter? Whose friend? Facebook became a clearinghouse. Pictures went up of the missing. Names of those identified as safe were posted (like Angela's granddaughter, in a Panera Bread). They kept at it, both of them, until early afternoon. And when Robin finally got into downtown Orlando, she made a point of driving the perimeter police had sealed off, passing out water and bananas and jerky to cops stuck standing in the Florida heat. The sun was long up before Adrian left the police station, where he'd been taken to give a statement. He went straight to the hospital from there. Everyone was admitted under a code name to keep strangers, like reporters, from pestering the wounded. A nurse took Adrian to a room, but Javier wasn't in it. A second room, a third, and still Adrian couldn't find his husband. They have a Javier, Adrian thought. But is it my Javier? Panic started to slip in. The last time he saw Javier, he was holding his belly on the right side, blood staining his shirt, a police officer helping him out of Pulse. They found him in the fourth room. He was in good shape, all things considered. Javier had been hit by a bullet that either ricocheted off the floor or a wall or went through another body first: knocked down the velocity, slowed it enough to mitigate the damage. The surgeons sewed him up but left the bullet inside, decided to wait until it worked its way closer to the surface. Adrian was waiting for a phone call. He did not know from whom, but he was certain a voice would tell him that he met Oscar and Simon at Pulse, that everyone went home safe. Nothing else was real. No one was dead. Reporters called instead. Adrian talked to a Colombian television station—how did they get his number so fast?—and then stopped answering calls from numbers he didn't recognize. Javier went home five days later, in pain and in a wheelchair. He had a nightmare, but only one: He was in a club, or maybe a restaurant, lights bright and clear, so he could see everything. There was a gunman. He shot Javier in the head. Adrian didn't sleep much at all. He was usually awake until two in the morning before he drifted off, and never for long. Who knows what's there when your eyes are closed? Six of their friends were dead, but they did not go to the funerals. “I don't want to stay with the memory of them in a coffin,” Adrian said later. “I want to remember all my friends as people that were happy.” Javier physically couldn't work. Adrian just couldn't. Couldn't leave Javier, couldn't go back to the deli at the Wawa station, couldn't put himself into a bright public space, exposed and unguarded. “I thought,” he said, “that somebody was going to come back and look for survivors.” In the days following the shooting, the hospitals and churches of Orlando were inundated. Survivors like Javier and Adrian were among the fortunate but were by no means left unscarred. It's not a wholly rational thought, but on June 11, neither was the idea that a stranger would murder six of his friends and shoot 96 other people, too. Perspectives shift with experience. Aly Benitez was walking her dog when she got the first text, from the husband of the owner of Pulse. The death toll was 20. By the time she got to Pulse, it was 50. Aly is a lawyer and, like Robin and Blue, well-known in Orlando, involved. She assumes, knows, that millions of dollars will be donated, because more people are decent and kind than not. Indeed, two days later, Orlando mayor Buddy Dyer announced the formation of the OneOrlando Fund. The Walt Disney Company put up a million dollars; the Orlando Magic and JetBlue, $100,000 each; Darden Restaurants (Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, and such), $500,000. Eventually, those millions would be divvied up and dispersed. “But in the meantime,” she says, “what do we do about people being evicted, about the mother living with her son and the son was the one working, about the people who were working three jobs and now can't work any of them?” Four days after the shooting, Aly founded Pulse of Orlando, to get cash to people as quickly as possible. Not a lot, $750 each at most, but a cushion, enough to keep people fed and housed in the short term. “It was just an instinctual ‘What can I do to help?’ ” she says. “Literally, a knee-jerk reaction: I have to do something.” “In our world, in Orlando right now, every person you turn to is in the same boat, “ Blue says. “And what a beautiful way to lead the country. We led with love. And honesty. And hope.” It's a small operation (and also one of several funds established to help victims, including Pulse employees), run by only five volunteers, including Aly's friend Robin Maynard. But Pulse of Orlando was able to distribute $28,500 on June 30, less than three weeks after the shooting. By mid-October, it had raised a quarter-million dollars and given out $200,000. Robin is in charge of vetting the people who apply to the fund. She's well suited to the job, considering her background investigating crime scenes. Logistically, verifying whether someone was there is not especially difficult: Nobody went to Pulse alone, so time lines can be checked against friends' and Instagram feeds and text messages and Facebook pages. But no one simply says: I was there. They tell Robin what happened while they were there. One girl tells Robin how she hid in a bathroom stall with six other people and then the gunman sprayed the stalls and all six fell on her and she waited there for three hours, under bodies bleeding out, until the police killed the bad guy. One young man, 22 years old, told her he had just signed a lease on an apartment, invited nine friends to a housewarming party, suggested they all go to Pulse about eleven o'clock. Five of those nine are dead. And his back is wrecked because he crouched in a closet, too scared to move, for one hour and 47 minutes, texting good-byes, and even though he was prescribed Lidocaine patches, he can't afford them. Javier told Robin how he hid under a desk, a stranger's knee pressing on his belly, afraid bullets would come through the wall, the floor, kill everyone. Adrian told her about the fear of waiting, of not knowing where his husband was or if he was dead, the impotence of not being able to save him. In early August, when they each received a check from the fund, a few dollars in their pockets meant they could stop worrying if they would have a roof, at least for a while. Even the heroic stories ended badly: A woman watched a man take a bullet for her, save her life, and while she hid under a table, she watched that same man crawl toward her, watched him die. There was the kid who wrote “mom” next to the phone number for his emergency contact. Robin needed a real name, but the kid didn't have one. She was his friend's mom. His own mother disowned him when she found out he was gay. “It's like an onion, all these different layers,” Robin says. Many of the victims were Latin, from Puerto Rico, Mexico, Venezuela, the Dominican Republic. But did they speak English? Were they documented or not? And if they were gay, were they out to anyone but their closest friends? Were they forced out simply for having the miserable misfortune of getting shot on Latin Night at a predominantly gay nightclub? Latin culture, broadly speaking, has not historically embraced gay culture; people heard about the Puerto Rican father who refused to accept his dead son's body. Robin listened to those stories all summer long, 200 variations on a horrifying theme. She held people while they wept. “Robin,” Adrian says, “she's one of those angels.” And then, in September, she dropped her phone. The screen cracked. “I had a meltdown,” she says. “Like, you-kicked-my-dog-and-threw-him-in-the-lake meltdown.” There was screaming and wailing, stomping and raging, and none of it was about her stupid phone. Javier's mother flew up from Mexico City. So did Javier's son and the mother of his son; she was the only person in Mexico who knew he was gay. He left in 2005, slipped over the border, made his way to North Carolina. He was there—Kinston, Wilmington, Fayetteville—for a decade, until he went to Orlando's gay-pride celebration in October 2014. (Orlando does Pride in October, because June is too damned hot.) “I just fell in love with Orlando city,” he tells me. “The weather is good, and it's safe, you know? You compare it to Mexico City, to…everywhere, I think. Here is safe.” “That first night, people would come in with these looks on their faces,” Blue says. “And all we knew how to do was huge each other…. There’s no handbook for this."" Then he got shot in a nightclub and the Mexican media swarmed him—he was the only one of four Mexican natives at Pulse to survive—and his mother and son and old girlfriend came to nurse him. His mother thought he had a roommate, not a husband. She shrugged at the revelation. “She was really good,” Adrian says. “She didn't say, ‘But…’ or ‘What if…’ or ‘How about…?’ She was just, ‘Okay, it's your life.’ ” It helped, having Javier's family there. The weeks went by, and the days didn't seem quite as empty or the nights as long. Adrian and Javier made it through the Fourth of July fireworks at Eola Lake, telling each other they'd be all right, in a crowd at night with a lot of loud bangs. They had those few dollars from the Pulse of Orlando fund, kept themselves afloat financially. Adrian finally went back to work in August. Two weeks later, a piece of bacon got stuck on the oven exhaust fan and tripped the smoke alarm. Startled by the sound behind him, Adrian jerked his head over his left shoulder. And he remembered, for the first time, that he'd done the same thing when he heard the initial bang at Pulse. He still couldn't piece together the rest, the minute or minutes before he looked up from the floor. He tries, but a head jerk is the only fragment. “If I go into my mind,” he says, “it's a blank.” He considers that. Maybe he doesn't want to remember. There is no standardized schedule for recovering from trauma, no checklist of what should be remembered or rationalized or processed or in what order, no assigned path for stumbling through grief. Everybody has her own pace, his own process. In late September, Blue hosted a support group at The Venue for Pulse employees. “Some of them, they're just—just—starting to come out of that fog,” she says. “Just starting. And that fog is dense, it's thick, and it's a mile long. And they're just starting to push it away.” Cases of water are stacked under the stairs, leftovers from the first days. Everybody sends water. Still, Blue and the others were able to organize a practical inventory: If they needed, say, toilet paper, they put out the word and toilet paper would start coming in. Whatever was needed appeared: The Venue was the overflow site for the main depot, and eventually there was an overflow for The Venue. At one point, it was simpler to ask for gift cards, and $30,000 worth came through Blue's theater alone. No one worried much about fraud or theft. Orlando is tight, most people aren't despicable. “In our world, in Orlando right now, every person you turn to is in the same boat,” Blue says. “And what a beautiful way to lead the country. We led with love. And honesty. And hope.” Staying busy, being useful, also helped keep the emotional enormity at bay. She knows a time will come when the full magnitude, all the grief and horror, will rear up like a rogue wave. It almost did, at the very beginning, when thousands of people gathered for a vigil that following Monday and bells tolled for each of the dead. “And it was like it went on forever,” she says. “It just kept going and going and all you wanted was for it to be over.” And there was a second time, when she was arranging the music for the fireworks at the fall's Pride celebration. She opened with Prince—dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to get through this thing called life…—put “Over the Rainbow” in the middle, closed with Estelle singing “One Love.” “It was like a counseling session for me,” she says. She cried a lot. The original thought, Aly Benitez and Robin Maynard say, was to close the Pulse of Orlando fund in October. Four months, a stopgap, a temporary bridge until OneOrlando divvied up the $29.5 million in donations. They knew in September, though, that that wasn't going to happen. Money is tangible, a physical thing that can be deposited into an account. The amount won't change anyone's life, but it can make it easier, keep the collectors at bay, eliminate, for a while, one practical worry. But what about everything else? What about jobs, getting people employed and strong enough to go to work? Or even out of their houses? How does that happen? “That first night, people would come in with these looks on their faces,” Blue says. “And all we knew how to do was hug each other.” She lets that hang for a moment. “There's no handbook for this,” she says. Months later, she sees individual triggers just starting to manifest themselves. The people who flinch at strobe lights and sirens, the ones who startle at the tumble of Jenga blocks. The men who hear a sound on the radio. Javier saw a counselor after he was shot. Saw him just twice. He answered all the questions he was asked, and he was told he seemed to be doing pretty well, that maybe he could even help some of the other survivors. “I felt like I was going up,” he says, slowly raising his hand along an imaginary slope. He stops, flips his fingers toward the table. Javier didn't get therapy. He passed a quiz. “And then I was going down.” He didn't tell Adrian at first, but he found a new therapist, a woman who speaks Spanish. The first time he talked to her, she explained the fight-or-flight response, how adrenaline floods the body and the brain. And she gave him a helpful analogy: The shock of June 12 had, in a sense, anesthetized his brain. It took a while for that anesthesia to wear off. And that's why it hurts so much now, all these months later. She told him, too, that it's okay to cry. Sean Flynn is a GQ correspondent.

He&#8217;s a White Nationalist.,https://theintercept.com/2017/01/30/suspect-in-quebec-mosque-attack-quickly-depicted-as-a-moroccan-muslim-hes-a-white-nationalist/,en,False,,269138,Intercept,https://theintercept.com/,"© First Look Institute. All rights reserved First Look Institute is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. A mass shooting at a Quebec City mosque last night left six people dead and eight wounded. The targeted mosque, the Cultural Islamic Center of Quebec, was the same one at which a severed pig’s head was left during Ramadan last June. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the episode a “terrorist attack on Muslims.” Almost immediately, various news outlets and political figures depicted the shooter as Muslim. Right-wing nationalist tabloids in the U.K. instantly linked it to Islamic violence. Fox News claimed that “witnesses said at least one gunman shouted ‘Allahu akbar!’” and then added this about the shooter’s national origin: Suspect in Quebec mosque terror attack was of Moroccan origin, reports show https://t.co/oRzxGHEXDm pic.twitter.com/aEsEtccMvi White House press secretary Sean Spicer exploited the attack to justify President Trump’s ban on immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries. “It’s a terrible reminder of why we must remain vigilant and why the president is taking steps to be proactive rather than reactive when it comes to our nation’s safety and security,” Spicer said at this afternoon’s briefing when speaking of the Quebec City attack. But these assertions are utterly false. The suspect is neither Moroccan nor Muslim. The Moroccan individual, Mohamed Belkhadir, was actually one of the worshippers at the mosque and called 911 to summon the police, playing no role whatsoever in the shooting. The actual shooting suspect is 27-year-old Alexandre Bissonnette, a white French Canadian who is, by all appearances, a rabid anti-immigrant nationalist. A leader of a local immigration rights group, François Deschamps, told a local paper he recognized his photo as an anti-immigrant far-right “troll” who has been hostile to the group online. The Globe and Mail added that he “was known in the city’s activist circles as a right-wing troll who frequently took anti-foreigner and anti-feminist positions and stood up for U.S. President Donald Trump.” And Bissonnette’s Facebook page — now taken down but still archived — lists among its “likes” the far-right French nationalist Marine Le Pen, Islam critics Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens, the Israeli Defense Forces, and Donald J. Trump (he also “likes” the liberal Canadian Party NDP along with more neutral “likes” such as Tom Hanks, the Sopranos, and Katy Perry). It is usually the case that there is significant confusion in the wake of attacks of this sort. And local police did apparently arrest two suspects at first: Bissonnette along with Belkhadir. And until the investigation is complete, one cannot know for certain what the motives here were. One should be careful about trying to infer too much from a hodgepodge of Facebook “likes” and, this early, even anecdotal claims about Bissonnette’s political views. As for reports that someone yelled “Allahu akbar,” it is perfectly natural that someone in a mosque would say that upon seeing a homicidal killer randomly shooting people, or it’s possible that the shooter said it mockingly. But this is exactly why no responsible news organization, let alone the White House, should rush to depict the shooter as Muslim and of Moroccan descent when so little is known about what happened. Yet not only did Fox and the Trump White House do exactly that, but worse, neither has retracted or corrected their claims long after it became clear that they were false: Hour & a half after tweeting out false info on #QuebecMosqueAttack Fox News has still not corrected or retracted. @ggreenwald https://t.co/IppNZrXxHH The inflammatory effect of this sort of reckless, biased “reporting” is as predictable as it is toxic. All day long, people around the world cited these reports to justify Trump’s ban as well as their own ugly views of Muslims: Quebec gunman 'is Muslim Moroccan' https://t.co/UxI42LAY1X via @MailOnline  I fully condemn the shooting in Quebec City. But remember the shooters weren't yelling ""Trump"" they were yelling ""Allahu akbar"" #MsuslimBan The only part of any of this that’s true is that it was an act of terrorism: terrorism aimed, yet again, at Muslims by someone who has apparently been indoctrinated with a great deal of hate toward them. Media outlets and the White House led people all over the world today to believe exactly the opposite.

575986453,2017-02-02 16:52:28,House votes to strike rule banning guns for some deemed mentally impaired,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/266388356/0/phoenix/nation~House-votes-to-strike-rule-banning-guns-for-some-deemed-mentally-impaired/,en,False,,25128,AZCentral,http://www.azcentral.com,"WASHINGTON —The House of Representatives approved its first effort of the new Congress to roll back gun regulations, voting to overturn a rule that would bar gun ownership by some who have been deemed mentally impaired by the Social Security Administration. The House voted 235-180 largely along party lines Thursday to repeal an Obama-era rule requiring the Social Security Administration to send records of some beneficiaries to the federal firearms background check system after they’ve been deemed mentally incapable of managing their financial affairs. The rule, when implemented, would affect about 75,000 recipients of disability insurance and supplemental insurance income who require a representative to manage their benefits because of a disabling mental disorder, ranging from anxiety to schizophrenia. It applies to those between age 18 and full retirement age. Republicans argued the rule, which was vigorously opposed by gun-rights and disability groups, would unfairly stigmatize people with disabilities and strip them of their Second Amendment rights without due process. “This is a slap in the face for those in the disabled community because it paints all those who suffer from mental disorders with the same broad brush,” said House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va. “It assumes that simply because an individual suffers from a mental condition, that individual is unfit to exercise his or her Second Amendment rights.” Democrats agreed the government must not stigmatize those with disabilities but said this rule affects a small group with severe, long-term mental disorders preventing them from doing any work. Passage of the resolution puts others at risk, they said. “These are not just people having a bad day,” said Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif. “These are not people simply suffering from depression or anxiety. These are people with a severe mental illness who can’t hold any kind of job or make any decisions about their affairs. So the law says very clearly they shouldn’t have a firearm.” The regulation is among a host that Republicans aim to repeal under the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to dismiss an outgoing administration’s recently enacted regulations. It requires only a simple majority vote in the Senate. Earlier Thursday, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said House efforts to block five Obama regulations by the end of this week are “just the start.” The House has also voted to overturn a rule to protect streams from coal mining debris, a rule requiring federal contractors to disclose labor and worker safety violations, and another rule requiring oil, gas and minerals companies to disclose payments to foreign governments. “In the weeks ahead, we will act on more resolutions to deliver relief from excessive regulations,” Ryan said. “When you think about the fact that the Obama administration was issuing major regulations at a rate of one every three days, this is real sea change.” Read more: USA TODAY Congress to challenge gun ban for some mentally impaired USA TODAY Congress and guns: Key moments in 26 years of death and debate USA TODAY Congress passes first rollback of Obama environmental rule Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, called the Social Security regulation “reckless, overly broad and an affront to the Second Amendment rights of people with disabilities."" He introduced an identical resolution to reverse it in the Senate on Thursday with 25 Republican co-sponsors, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. “Whenever the government acts to limit the fundamental constitutional rights of citizens, it must do so carefully, lawfully and in a way that doesn’t unduly impact law-abiding Americans,” Grassley said in a statement. The rule, which took effect Jan. 18 and sets a December compliance date, requires the agency to notify individuals of their possible prohibition from possessing or receiving firearms and their rights to appeal. The National Rifle Association argues that the Social Security Administration’s process for determining disability payments is a bureaucratic process and not an adjudication that should end in someone losing the right to bear arms. Restoration of those rights requires a person to affirmatively prove that they’re not a danger to public safety. “Under this flawed system, the individual bears the burden against the government,” Goodlatte said. “This is not what due process looks like.” The gun rule was issued in December in response to the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting. It was designed to implement a 2007 law requiring federal agencies to provide records for inclusion in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which prevents gun sales to convicted criminals, people adjudicated with mental health disorders and others prohibited from owning a gun. The 2007 law passed after the Virginia Tech shooting in which a gunman who had been declared mentally ill by a Virginia special judge killed 32 people. Follow @ngaudiano on Twitter."

DeVos, who conceded that her billionaire family had donated about $200 million to the Republican Party, parried questions about her family's prominent role in killing oversight of Michigan charter schools, her past disparaging remarks about public education and government, and her family's support for so-called gay conversion therapy, suggesting she herself never supported such therapy and believes every school should be ""a safe and discrimination-free place to become educated."" DeVos declined to support Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) call for free college tuition, conceded to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) that nobody in her family has ever taken out a student loan and said she would ""review"" rules requiring career colleges (like Trump University) to offer salable skills to students, and would not commit to keeping in place rules that require colleges and universities to more actively crack down on sexual assaults. When Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) asked her if she believed guns belong in school, DeVos noted a story from rural Wyoming, saying, ""I would imagine there's probably a gun in the school to protect from potential grizzlies."" When Murphy pressed her on if she supported Trump's proposal to ban gun-free zones around schools, DeVos said she would support ""what the president-elect does,"" but assured him: ""My heart bleeds and is broken for those families that have lost any individual due to gun violence."" Murphy invited her to visit Sandy Hook Elementary School in his state, the site of an infamous mass shooting of young children in 2012. DeVos also seemed unsure about some of the big discussions in public education — she and all her children attended only private schools. You can watch Sen.

Over seven years, 92% of mass shootings have occurred on gun-free zones, and some of these locations have been schools. It's an occurrence that some schools, like one elementary school in Texas, are looking to put a stop to by arming themselves with both firearms and the knowledge on how to use them efficiently and tactically. Yet, the problem of gun-free zones in schools remains. That's why Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky) is looking to put a stop to them in the state of Kentucky by introducing a bill he calls the ""Safe Students Act.""  In a press release from his office, Massie explained that he has introduced H.R. 34 because our children are consistently in danger due to gunmen walking into schools unopposed, and murdering innocents.  The Safe Students Act has garnered the support of three major gun organizations: National Association for Gun Rights, Gun Owners of America, and the National Rifle Association...  Cosponsors include: Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX), Rep. James Comer (R-KY), Rep. Jody Hice (R-GA), and Rep. Brian Babin (R-TX). Common sense says that anyone looking to shoot up a place may think twice, or fail miserably, when the intended victims have the capability to shoot back. So does history, as John Lott wrote in National Review in October 2015.   With these facts in mind, eliminating gun-free zones on schools is a no brainer.

The response was overwhelming. Within weeks, Moms Demand Action moved from an online idea to an offline movement with volunteers showing up on Capitol Hill and in statehouses and corporate boardrooms. Today, as part of Everytown for Gun Safety, we're a national grassroots movement with chapters in every state and more than three million supporters.  How did we grow so quickly and become so effective? The answer is simple: the power of women. Women are unparalleled multi-taskers with relentless energy and stubborn drive - especially when it comes to protecting our children and families. Harness that momentum into a women-led movement and it's unstoppable.  That's why I was so heartened when I saw on Facebook that a women's march in Washington, D.C., was forming just hours after Donald Trump was elected president. Like Moms Demand Action, the battle cry for a national demonstration was started online by a few women and was quickly answered by women en masse.  Now hundreds of thousands of women and supporters will come together this weekend at the Women's March on Washington - as well as hundreds of sister marches across the country - to oppose policies and rhetoric that denigrate and endanger women, and to demonstrate our strength in numbers and diversity.  This is nothing new: women have always been on the front lines of activism in America, from opposing child labor to fighting for civil rights to creating laws against drunk driving. Some of the women who fought these battles were disbelieved, harassed, attacked and even imprisoned, but they did not stand down. And neither will we.  I'll be marching alongside hundreds of Moms Demand Action volunteers because gun violence is a women's issue: · American women are 16 times more likely to be killed with a gun than in other high-income countries; · In an average month, 50 women are shot to death by a current or former partner in the United States; · Approximately 4.5 million American women have been threatened with guns, and guns are the weapon of choice in domestic violence murders. I'm also marching because the lobbying organization that donated more than $30 million to Donald Trump's campaign - the National Rifle Association - is a direct threat to women everywhere. Their leadership has a history of misogyny - from describing women as ""b*tches"" and ""c*nts"" to downplaying rape. And the policies they lobby for make it easy for domestic abusers to get their hands on guns. As the largest outside donor to Trump's presidential campaign, the NRA has been emboldened to push their deadly agenda now more than ever.  Our volunteers and survivors won't fall in line - we'll hold the line. We've become the David to the NRA's Goliath, loosening the gun lobby's stranglehold by passing gun safety laws, defeating dangerous bills, and getting businesses to adopt policies that protect customers and employees.   And while America's gun violence crisis turned me into a single-issue voter, women do not and cannot lead single-issue lives. Using our voices and votes, we also have to push back against the misogyny, racism, homophobia, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, and anti-immigrant rhetoric that shaped the 2016 election.  Women are the majority in America, and there is strength in numbers. But showing up on Saturday is only half the battle. The other half is keeping the march momentum going back at home and in our communities until the next election, and the election after that.  The Women's March on Washington isn't about one day or one event: it's about the future of our nation. As Martin Luther King, Jr., said in 1963 at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, ""We cannot walk alone. And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back.""  After the Women's March on Washington, I pledge to keep walking with an army of Americans who want to live in a nation free of senseless gun violence, and who want equal rights, protections and equality for all Americans - regardless of their gender. Saturday is just the beginning, and there's no turning back. Guest Writer"
564594134,2017-01-09 13:31:44,FBI: We Have Not Found Jihadi Content on Ft. Lauderdale Shooter’s Social Media,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/cb3DZ80DawQ/,en,False,,19334,Breitbart,http://www.breitbart.com,"Law enforcement officials have yet to confirm that Esteban Santiago Ruiz, the shooter allegedly responsible for killing five people and injuring another six at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport last week, posted any content linked to radical Islam or jihad on his social media platforms. Officials have not dismissed radical Islamic terrorism as a potential motive for the mass murder, however, as Santiago had previously reached out to the FBI, insisting that the CIA was forcing him to join the Islamic State (ISIS) and watch propaganda videos. “It’s way too early in the investigation. We’re looking over all of his social media, things like that. It’s giving us a picture of the individual, but it’s way too early for us to rule out anything,” George Piro, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Miami field office, told reporters on Saturday. The Associated Press notes that Piro’s illustrious FBI career includes interrogating late Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein following his capture. Santiago was deployed to Iraq in 2010, reportedly working to diffuse improvised explosive devices. He received a Meritorious Unit Commendation award following his deployment, though he was subsequently discharged from the Alaska National Guard for “unsatisfactory performance.” A Miami Herald report reiterates that law enforcement officials “have discovered no information on Facebook and other online sites to suggest the Iraq war veteran was radicalized by the Islamic State or any other terrorist organization,” despite a wide array of Internet rumors linking Santiago to jihadist sentiments online. The report notes that officials have since shut down his known social media accounts and have not completed their review of the available material. What his social media did reveal, however, is that Santiago had some ties to Florida, despite being born in New Jersey, raised in Puerto Rico, and currently living in Alaska. Local affiliate Fox 4 reports that his Instagram account featured photos of himself in Naples, Florida – an hour-and-a-half drive from Fort Lauderdale – visiting cousins. Authorities have interviewed 175 people and counting about Santiago’s behavior and mental state, including a number of family members and Santiago himself. The Associated Press describes Santiago as “cooperative” with authorities, revealing that he bought a one-way ticket to Fort Lauderdale specifically to commit the mass shooting. The most prominent bit of evidence linking Santiago to the global jihad movement is his own confession to the FBI that he had been hearing voices encouraging him to commit acts of terrorism in the name of the Islamic State. He walked into an FBI office in Alaska, where he had been living, and told agents that the American government was forcing him to watch the signature gruesome propaganda videos for which the Islamic State is known. The FBI then confiscated his gun and scheduled him to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. While the details of that evaluation remain unknown, Santiago was allowed to remain free, and officials returned his gun to him. “Officials told a news conference the gun was returned to the suspect because the Iraq war veteran had not committed a crime,” Fox News reports. Law enforcement officials have not confirmed whether the gun returned to him following that evaluation is the same weapon he used in the Fort Lauderdale attack. The claim that he had not committed a crime also raises some questions. Santiago had been arrested in January and charged with “misdemeanor counts of property damage and assault” for allegedly strangling his girlfriend and breaking down her bathroom door. Santiago has since had a son, currently believed to be in Alaska. The Associated Press notes that he had brought his infant to the FBI offices when he turned himself in for watching ISIS videos: “He was a walk-in complaint. This is something that happens at FBI offices around the country every day,” FBI agent Marlin Ritzman said. Santiago had a loaded magazine on him, but had left a gun in his vehicle, along with his newborn child, authorities said. Officers seized the weapon and local officers took him to get a mental health evaluation. His girlfriend picked up the child. On Dec. 8, the gun was returned to Santiago. Authorities wouldn’t say if it was the same gun used in the airport attack. Santiago may face the death penalty if found guilty of a premeditated mass homicide at the airport.

666787481,2017-01-26 16:48:03,Florida airport shooting suspect indicted on 22 criminal counts,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-florida-shooting-idUSKBN15A2VP,en,False,,4442,Reuters,http://www.reuters.com,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Reuters Staff 3 Min Read TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - A federal grand jury has indicted on 22 criminal counts an Iraq war veteran suspected of killing five people in a mass shooting at a Florida airport this month, U.S. prosecutors said on Thursday. Esteban Santiago, 26, is accused of opening fire in the baggage claim area of the Fort Lauderdale airport on Jan. 6. The charges against him include multiple counts of violence at an airport resulting in death and injury, as well as firearms crimes. If convicted, he could be punished by life imprisonment or death. The U.S. Attorney General has not decided whether to seek a death sentence, the prosecutors office said. The indictment was returned by a federal grand jury in Broward County, Florida, where the attack occurred, prosecutors in the U.S. Southern District of Florida said in a news release. Authorities said Santiago aimed at victims’ heads and bodies until he ran out of ammunition and was taken into custody. Five people were killed in the attack and six others wounded. The indictment accuses Santiago of “substantial planning and premeditation to cause the death of a person.” The attack was the latest in a series of deadly U.S. mass shootings, some inspired by Islamist militants, others carried out by loners or the mentally disturbed. Santiago had a history of erratic behavior. Authorities have said they were investigating whether mental illness played a role in the shooting. Court records show he is being represented by a public defender. A representative answering calls for the office said it had no immediate comment. An arraignment hearing in Santiago’s case is scheduled in federal court in Fort Lauderdale on Monday. A private first class in the National Guard who served in Iraq from 2010 to 2011, Santiago traveled from Alaska to Florida on a one-way airline ticket with a handgun and ammunition in his checked luggage, according to authorities. Upon arrival, he claimed his gun case and loaded the weapon in a men’s bathroom, investigators said in a criminal complaint. He opened fire on the first people he saw after leaving the restroom, it said. Santiago told investigators he was inspired by Islamic State and had previously chatted online with Islamist extremists, according to FBI testimony presented in court.

                since  Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper served as a representative of the Democratic Party's future here, just as outgoing Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry represented the past. If this gathering is any indication, Hickenlooper may be on the verge of building buzz as a 2020 hopeful. Several attendees pointed to him as someone who could rescue the party after its disastrous 2016 losses. One former Obama administration official suggested he could be a Democratic version of Trump — both because of his quirky, off-the-cuff nature (as seen in a campaign ad during which he takes a shower) and a laser focus on middle-class jobs and economic growth. Hickenlooper has experience in both the private and the public sectors. He opened Colorado's first brewpub and served as a popular mayor of Denver, Colorado's largest city. As governor, he has overseen the state's challenge of federal law on the legalization of marijuana for recreational use (an initiative he was at first against but on which he has since changed his views) and spearheaded a push for significant gun reforms after the deadly 2012 mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora. Business Insider spoke with Hickenlooper at Davos. This interview has been edited for clarity and length. Brett LoGiurato: What's the mood here at Davos this year, given the inauguration of Donald Trump? John Hickenlooper: It's definitely a different energy. It's a little more somber. LoGiurato: As a prominent Democratic governor, what are you looking for from the president? Do you see areas where you can work with him? Where are areas where you want your state legislature to try to insulate yourself from things he might try to do? Hickenlooper: Well, I may not have voted for the president, but I'm an American first. My entire administration is going to do everything we can to make him as successful as we can. We're going to try to be active, strong partners with the federal government. That being said, we went through a great deal of work to expand Medicaid to a large number of people in Colorado. We cut our percentage of people who had no insurance — we cut it in half. We're going to work really hard to protect that as much as we can, make sure that we have the support from the federal government to continue making sure people have basic rights, basic elemental healthcare. Also, I look at some of the things that the president will do around cutting red tape, reducing bureaucracy, helping entrepreneurs, helping businesses grow more rapidly, more access to capital — I'm all for it. That's all stuff that I've been trying to do in Colorado. LoGiurato One area in particular that seems ripe for a clash is on marijuana legalization. Have you spoken with Trump's pick for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions? Do you have a read on how he'll approach the issue, both with your state and moving forward more broadly? Hickenlooper: I have not talked to Sen. Sessions. I know that our two US senators, Michael Bennet and Cory Gardner — we have a Republican [Gardner] and a Democrat — are both very focused on this. We look at it as one of the ways in which states are laboratories of democracy. People don't realize that almost two-thirds of the population in the United States lives in a state where either medical or recreational marijuana are now legal. Two-thirds of the country. We're looking at it as kind of a 10th Amendment, states'-rights issue. Although marijuana might be the wrong example for that. Medicaid is a better example. It's one of the rare times where Democratic governors are saying, ""Hey, states' rights."" We don't want the federal government coming in and telling us how to do our environmental remediation or how we're going to do our healthcare. LoGiurato: Do you think marijuana will at least be decriminalized on a federal level? Hickenlooper: Well, we'll see. We've made a tremendous amount of progress in terms of creating a regulatory system from scratch [in Colorado]. If I had a magic wand when it first passed three years ago, I would've reversed it. You don't want to be in conflict with federal law. That being said, we've now gone three years, and our voters passed it by 55-45. We've made a lot of headway. And if I had that magic wand now, I'd wait a year or two. If we do this well enough, we should see a dramatic reduction in the number of drug dealers out there. You take away a big chunk of the product flow, you're going to need fewer salesmen. And there's been no spike in usage. There's been no spike in young people, of teenagers, using it. We now have — again, in a $27 billion budget, $125 million of tax revenue isn't that significant, but it is money that we can use for people with drug addictions and for rehabilitating people that slipped off the tracks. Those are programs that are hard to find money for outside of the marijuana-tax revenue. LoGiurato: Marijuana prices are tumbling amid a growing legal supply. Do you have plans to address that on a taxation level? Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper.
                            

                                AP
                              

Hickenlooper: We'd like to get the tax level to the point — we want the price to go down, because that's how you get rid of the black market. And we still have — some of the laws in the state of Colorado, at least, people had the ability to grow up to 99 plants as caregivers. It's crazy. How do you tell the gray market from the black market? So we're tightening up a lot of those rules to make sure we can control and regulate the whole system much more tightly. LoGiurato: I want to talk about the future of the Democratic Party. I keep hearing your name come up as a savior in 2020. What's your read on what went wrong in 2016 and the early steps the party has taken to rectify its losses? And are you supporting anyone to be chair of the Democratic National Committee? Hickenlooper: [Laughs at 2020 mention.] We had a very strong relationship with the Department of Labor, so [Tom Perez] was a pretty easy choice for me [to be DNC chair]. We're doing an apprenticeship program that I think is one of the most exciting things we've ever worked on. I just came from a meeting with Microsoft and LinkedIn — Allen Blue and Brad Smith — and they're both going to help finance this. We're also using LinkedIn to partner with. How do you get people who've lost their professions into new professions? It's its own story someday! But I think the political reality for the Democratic Party is, you know, there are two sides. There's one side saying that we weren't liberal enough and another side saying we're too liberal. I think they're both right. The Democratic Party is always going to be the party of civil rights and fairness — everybody gets an equal, fair shot at the American dream. And we're going to be the party that really fights to protect planet Earth — enjoy whatever time we're going to get! But at the same time, there's nothing wrong with the Democratic Party that talks more about — and more loudly about — jobs, and cutting red tape, and bureaucracy, making it easier for entrepreneurs to start jobs, making it easier for businesses to grow and create more jobs. That has historically been the wheelhouse of the Democratic Party. Even as we continue to carry the banner of civil rights and environmental justice, we've also got to focus on many, many people — for them, life starts with a good job. LoGiurato: I assume you want to continue to be a loud voice in the future of the Democratic Party. Do you have any plans as we head into the 2018 and 2020 cycles? Hickenlooper: Nope. I'm not starting a PAC. I'm not going out there and putting together a phantom campaign. In two years, I think the workforce stuff we're working on in Colorado really has the potential to be a national model, so I want to put a lot of energy into that. We're trying to make — have for the last four or five years — trying to make Colorado the healthiest state. So we're rolling out a lot — we'll have an interactive map of every single hiking trail in the state of Colorado. Everything there is. You'll be able to go out and, while you're hiking, you can meet up with other people on the trail, you can see other people's photographs. You can come back 20 years later and click on the map and see all the pictures you took. It's a pretty exciting thing that hopefully will get people out walking. We're trying to put together kind of a governor's fitness council to get every single kid walking at least once a day. Colorado Gov.

LoGiurato: On that note, you've been the mayor of a large city. A lot of the issues you talk about, and that the Democratic Party cares about, start at the local level. The party has suffered massive losses, however, on state and local levels recently. Do you think that is important start for the party's future leaders? Hickenlooper: Almost all government starts at a very local level at some point. And so I look at that experience as some of the hardest but some of the most exciting stuff I've done in public life. I think it's valuable. Now, does that mean everybody has to be a mayor? I don't know. You talk to Cory Booker — I'll bet you anything that he'll go back and say that when he was mayor of Newark, [he had] some of the most challenging times, but also some of the most rewarding times. Mayors of big cities — we cherish it, but it's a steep hill. We love it. For you For you"

Police captured Alexandre Bissonnette shortly after the terror attack and hauled him into court later in the evening:   Who is Alexandre Bissonnette? The Washington Post reports that he’s a far-right extremist, and also a “socially awkward” loner: Canadian authorities on Monday charged a 27-year-old university student known for his far-right sympathies with six counts of first-degree murder in a mass shooting the day before at a local mosque. Alexandre Bissonnette, described by neighbors and acquaintances as a socially awkward introvert who had recently adopted virulent political views, was also charged late Monday afternoon with five counts of attempted murder with a restricted firearm. The five surviving victims were still in the hospital, with two of them in critical condition, although hospital officials said their injuries were not life-threatening. What about the second man initially arrested with Bissonnette? Mohamed Belkhadir was the witness who called 911, but panicked as police arrived: The suspect was captured by police about 15 miles from the scene of the attack after he called 911 and offered to surrender. The police initially said they had also arrested a 29-year-old engineering student at the Quebec Islamic Cultural Center. By Monday afternoon, they released him and called him a witness to the event. It turned out the witness, Mohamed Belkhadir, had left the mosque at the end of prayers and was near the building when he heard shots. Returning inside, he called 911 and began helping a friend who had been shot. When he saw armed police arrive, he panicked and ran off and was quickly stopped. He said the police had treated him well. These developments demonstrate the wisdom of withholding conclusions until all evidence has come in. People across the political spectrum began leaping to wildly different conclusions as each tidbit emerged from the chaos over the last 36 hours or so. That impulse comes from a very human attempt to fit events into how we see the world, but also in some cases in an attempt to fit our own political agendas into current events. So far, the evidence suggests that Bissonnette might be more like a Dylann Roof than a Timothy McVeigh, but that still remains to be seen. Police will want to make sure that Bissonnette wasn’t part of a larger terror conspiracy, especially since this particular mosque had been the target of anti-Muslim vandalism over the past couple of years. The Post’s profile fits more in with the typical loner mass shooter, but that’s only based on what we know now. Clearly, though, opening fire on a defenseless group of worshipers is at the very least a terrorist act, regardless of the specific motive. This will be a case worth following, but it’s better to follow it than get ahead of it. Copyright ©2021 HotAir.com/Salem Media. All Rights Reserved."

Liberty University president weighs in on 'Fox & Friends' Liberty University won approval this week to build a $3 million state-of-the-art shooting range on its Virginia campus over opposition from some neighbors. The private Christian university submitted its plans to the Campbell County Board of Supervisors and got unanimous approval Tuesday. “I’m very excited about it,” university president Jerry Falwell Jr. told Fox & Friends Friday. “This is a separate 500-acre tract that is completely protected from the surrounding residential areas, and it was a perfect spot for a shooting range,” he said. “We’re going to start some shooting competition teams like many universities have, and it’s going to have rifle ranges, shotgun ranges, and local law enforcement is going to use it for training,” Falwell added. The Washington Post quoted Falwell in an article in December as saying the university has a “very pro-Second Amendment student body” and wants students to be prepared in the event of an “active shooter” scenario. The 2007 Virginia Tech mass shooting occurred in Blacksburg, 85 miles west of Liberty. Liberty has 14,500 residential students and allows those with a concealed-carry permit to keep a weapon on campus. The Lynchburg News & Advance reports that people opposed to the shooting range were worried about traffic and noise. “If I have to hear 25,000 gunshots a day, how is that going to sound?” one woman who lives near the site asked at a hearing before the supervisors voted. About 50 people attended the hearing, the paper reported. A civil engineer hired by Liberty told the paper that the project includes money to plant trees to muffle noise. The target date for finishing the shooting range is Labor Day.

567305004,2017-01-13 22:02:33,Turkey&apos;s Radical Islamization Process Accelerating,http://pjmedia.com/blog/turkeys-radical-islamization-process-accelerating/,en,False,,19082,PJ Media,http://pjmedia.com,"A primary school in Istanbul’s Umraniye neighborhood has recently prepared a “corner” remembering those who lost their lives during the abortive coup on July 15. A model of Sergeant Omer Halisdemir (who died that day), photos of armed soldiers describing the coup night, as well as models of tanks and people standing in front of tanks were put in the corner, with a caption that reads: Whatever you do, you will not stop the rise of the Turkish nation. Whatever you do, the victory will be of Islam. Journalists with the Turkish newspaper Evrensel called the principal of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce Primary School (Istanbul Ticaret Odasý Ilkokulu) to ask about the banner. The principal hung up the phone after saying they “do not give information to journalists.” Ironically, the Gulen movement — which the Turkish government now calls the “Fethullah Gulen Terror Organization” and accuses of masterminding the attempted coup on July 15 — is also an Islamic movement. Even if the accusations by the government against Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen were correct, it would not be rational to claim that it was the defeat or weakening of Islam that the Islamic Gulen movement targeted by organizing the coup attempt. Evrensel also reported that last year the board in one of the classrooms of the same school was filled with Koranic verses and hadith — sayings attributed to Islam’s founder, Muhammad, which encouraged dying, killing, and jihad in the name of Islam. One was the Turkish version of the Koran’s verse 4 of “Surah Muhammad,” which reads: So when you meet those who disbelieve in battle, strike their necks until, when you have inflicted slaughter upon them, then secure their bonds, and either confer favor afterwards or ransom them until the war lays down its burdens. That is the command. And if Allah had willed, He could have taken vengeance upon them Himself, but He ordered armed struggle to test some of you by means of others. And those who are killed in the cause of Allah — never will He waste their deeds. Anti-IS students attacked at university campus in Istanbul A group at Istanbul University attacked a group of secular students who were protesting the Islamic State presence at the faculty of letters of the university, and were disseminating anti-IS leaflets titled “murderous IS.” The attackers tried to destroy the leaflets, according to the Turkish newspaper Birgun. IS has threatened Istanbul University on social media. In one of the photos IS supporters disseminated on social media, an armed IS militant is standing before the entrance of the university’s campus. In another photo, an armed IS militant is seen before the Bosphorus Bridge, where the Reina night club, site of a mass shooting on January 1st, is located. At least 39 people were killed and at least 70 were injured in the terror attack. IS officially claimed responsibility, and released a statement claiming the attacker was a soldier of IS who had “struck one of the most famous nightclubs where the Christians celebrate their apostate holiday.” See both photos here. Secular university students arrested in Izmir Seven members of the secular “Student Collectives” (Ogrenci Kolektifleri) at Izmir ‘s Dokuz Eylul University were detained on January 4 by Turkish police while they were trying to protest the detention of their friends, Aysegul Basar and Hamit Diskaya, members of the secular group “People’s Houses” (Halk Evleri). The two students were arrested as they attempted to read what they called “a declaration of secularism” at university’s cafeteria on January 3. Turkish school principal: “Caliphate will be reintroduced in 2024” On the night of the terror attack at Reina night club in Istanbul, Iskender Cinar, the principal of the Yunus Emre Imam Hatip Middle School in the city of Nevsehir, declared on his social media account: The first secularist is Satan. Secularism is saying that “I accept the existence of Allah but I reject his laws”. Secularism is being a kafir. All of the thieves and pimps in the world are secular. According to the newspaper Cumhuriyet, Cinar also claimed that a caliphate, an Islamic state ruled according to the Islamic law, will be established in 2024. Secularists attacked, detained over call to protect secularism Three people from the main opposition Republican People’s Party’s (CHP) youth branch in Sakarya’s Serdivan district were battered by an angry mob that chanted “La Ilaha Illallah” (There is no God but Allah) near banners they hung inside a shopping mall on January 9. The banners reportedly read: “Turkey is secular and will remain secular.” Security guards at the mall rounded up the three CHP members and handed them over to the police. They were later detained, according to media. Meanwhile, an AKP mayor declared that defending secularism is supporting terrorism. Yusuf Alemdar, the mayor of the district, referred to the incident from his Twitter account, writing: Nobody has the right to spoil the peace of our citizens. Saying things like Turkey is secular and will remain secular only supports terrorism. The successor of the Ottoman Empire, which was also the last Sunni Islamic caliphate from the 14th century to 1924, Turkey already has a great potential for radical Islamization and jihad. The history textbooks at Turkish schools have for decades glorified the history of the Ottoman Empire, including all of its wars and conquests. Islam also plays a large role in the sociology of Turkish society, even though the country’s constitution is officially secular. According to a 2014 survey, for example, 89% of the Turkish population said that what defines a nation is belonging to a certain religion. Among the 38 countries that participated in the question, Turkey ranked number one in the world. “So according to [Turkish] citizens in the streets, a Turk is the one who is a Muslim,” said Professor Ersin Kalaycioglu of Sabanci University, one of the academics who conducted the survey. Moreover, as a result of Turkey’s several massacres, pogroms, and threats against Christians and Jews — such as the 1915 Armenian genocide and the 1934 anti-Jewish pogrom in eastern Thrace — less than 0.2 percent of the country’s current population is now Christian and Jewish. There is no strong political opposition to stop or at least effectively challenge the authoritarian policies of the ruling Justice and Development (AKP) government. Sadly, the situation appears to be getting grimmer by the day. Further Islamization of the Turkish educational system, proud declarations of sympathy for jihad and the caliphate, as well as increasing pressures against secularists and dissidents do not provide one with a bright and promising picture about the future of the country.

Joseph Schreiber, dressed in a burnt orange jumpsuit, his wrists and ankles shackled, pleaded no during Monday's hearing before Circuit Judge Steven Levin. Schreiber answered Levin's questions in a clear, unwavering voice. A no contest plea is treated the same as a guilty plea. He had confessed to detectives that he set fire to the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce last Sept. 11, the 15th anniversary of the 2001 terrorist attacks. The damage to the mosque was so extensive that the leaders recently announced that it will move.

A closer look at FBI statistics, however, indicates that both of these claims are highly questionable. The report does show an increase in hate crimes against Muslims from 154 in 2014 to 257 in 2015. It is important, however, to examine how these data compare to hate crimes against other groups. Pew estimates that the Muslim population in the United States is 3.3 million; this indicates that anti-Muslim hate crimes increased from 46.7 to 77.9 per million Muslims. Table 1 shows how this per capita measure compares to hate crimes against other groups, based on population estimates of 5.7 million Jews, 46.5 million black people, and 6 million gay men. It also includes the 2002–2008 rates for comparison purposes. While the anti-Muslim hate crime rate rose substantially in 2015, it remained well below rates of anti-Jewish and anti-gay crimes. Also note how low the anti-Muslim hate crime rate was in 2014 relative to these two other groups. The most dramatic change from 2002 to 2015 was the drop in the anti-black hate crime rate. FBI statistics also specify the type of hate crime. Table 2 looks at the hate crime assault rate. It shows that in 2014, the anti-Muslim assault rate was below that of the three other groups. We can also see that anti-gay violence was dramatically higher than violence against the other groups. The anti-Muslim assault rate for 2014 was actually lower than the rate between 2002 and 2008, dispelling the case for growing Islamophobia prior to 2015. Once again, the most significant change over time was the dramatic drop in the anti-black assault rate. The 2015 assault statistics tell a different story. Anti-Muslim assaults per million are substantially higher than the assault rate on Jews, but continue to be dramatically lower than the anti-gay assault rate. This spike is serious and must be watched. It is not obvious, however, that organized anti-Muslim incitements are responsible for this uptick in assaults. One might think that these incitements would be most effective in harnessing anger just after a terrorist act committed by Muslims. This is what happened, for instance, after 9/11 when incidents against Muslims increased more than 10-fold. However, the two major terrorist acts perpetrated by Muslims in America during this period — the Boston Marathon bombing and San Bernardino mass-shooting — cannot explain the 2015 spike since the first attack happened in 2013 and the second in December of 2015. Furthermore, it is a mistake to associate hate crimes exclusively with white Americans who are the target group for alleged right-wing incitement. FBI statistics do not isolate the racial distribution of the perpetrators of assaults against Muslims. However, the FBI does identify the racial distribution for all hate crime assaults. In 2015, 53.2, 28.7 and 9.2 percent of hate crimes were committed by white, black, and multi-racial individuals, respectively. Most striking, however, is the dramatic 60 percent decline in anti-black hate crimes over the last decade. These data counter the narrative, promoted by writers such as The Atlantic’s Ta-Nehisi Coates, who laments: “To be black in a white supremacist society is to live in constant fear of disembodiment.” What is more, before 2015, anti-Jewish hate-crimes and assault rates were higher than anti-Muslim or anti-black rates. The implication? We should not be so quick to associate the spike in anti-Muslim hate crimes with widespread Islamophobia just as we should not associate high anti-Jewish hate crime rates with widespread anti-Semitism. We should also be careful not to leap to any single explanation for 2015’s serious, one-year anti-Muslim spike. Nevertheless, as there is substantial evidence that Trump’s election has led to another similar spike, we should demand that the president-elect take aggressive actions to stem this hateful behavior.

(Martin Leissl/Bloomberg) As Mark Twain famously popularized in the public consciousness, “There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.” Whether through malice, poor training or simple ignorance, “bad statistics” has a rich and storied legacy stretching back as long as humans have been counting things. Countless books, papers and blogs chronicle the myriad ways in which data and statistics are abused to lend false support to arguments in fields ranging from the academic world to public policy. As data-driven journalism is on the rise and calls continue to grow for increased evidence-based “fact checking,” it is worth stepping back to ask how much of the “fake news” that surrounds us today is based at least in part on bad statistics. Not a day goes by without a flurry of data-driven memes passing through my Facebook news feed, sailing by on my Twitter stream or landing as alerts in my email inbox that cite what appear to be reputable datasets and using them to offer surprising conclusions, typically wrapped up in a mesmerizing infographic. Yet, when I pick any of these memes at random and delve into it, I find that it is the rare meme indeed that stands up to statistical scrutiny. Some memes I come across are easy to discard as outright fabrications, citing non-existent datasets, non-existent authors, non-existent journals or citing real (typically very prominent) researchers and institutes in the field, but who when contacted say they’ve never heard of the research they are claimed to be the author of. Textual memes are the most common in this category, since it requires so little effort to send out a tweet along the lines of “A recent Gallup poll states that 80% of Americans believe that climate change is false.” Such memes can be made to look more authoritative by whipping up a quick graph in Excel. For such visual memes, sometimes just right-clicking on the graph in the Google Chrome browser and selecting “Search Google for image” will turn up fact checking sites or academic blogs who have researched the graph and confirmed it to be a fabrication. I’ve even seen a few memes that have taken a legitimate “science-y looking” graph from a paper in one field and use it as an illustration for a claim in a different field. Just recently I saw a meme go by in my Facebook feed that featured a graph of an exponential curve with all sorts of statistical measures in the background that was used to illustrate a claim about global warming trends over the past 50 years. The odd part is that X and Y axes were cut off and some of the annotations on the graph related to the medical field. In fact, after a bit of searching I was able to find that the author of the meme had apparently just grabbed a nice exponential-looking graph from a completely unrelated medical paper (perhaps found via a quick Google Scholar search). The rise of preprints, postprints and academic publishing through blogs has had a dangerous effect on scientific trust, accustoming the general public to seeing a news article discussing a new scientific advance that links to a preprint of the article on the faculty member’s personal blog, rather than on the journal’s website. This means that when a member of the public sees a meme that cites an academic paper supposedly published in the latest issue of Nature, but the link goes to a PDF on a random website that purports to be a Harvard professor’s personal blog, many readers won’t blink an eye and simply trust that the paper really is a preprint of a new Nature article by a Harvard professor. Muddying the waters even further, the rise of predatory publishers and fly-by-night journals means that a meme could link to a paper on an actual professional-looking journal website with a prestigious-sounding name and listing many prominent faculty on its editorial board (who may not even be aware their names are being used). Peer review standards are often essentially non-existent at such journals, meaning nearly any submission is accepted. It thus takes little more than a quick Google search these days to locate an academic paper published in a prestigious-sounding journal that makes any argument you want and claims to have the data, statistics and citations to support that argument rigorously and without question. To the average member of the public, ""peer review"" is an unknown concept and a paper published in Nature is not any more reputable than one published in The Journal Of Prestigious And World Changing Research. However, the greatest single contributor to data-driven “fake news” are the myriad statistical fallacies that so easily befall even academics in fields that do not emphasize rigorous statistical training (though even stats-heavy fields are not immune to statistical arguments). Beyond the obvious candidates like suggestions of correlation implying causation and improper use of statistical techniques, perhaps one of the greatest enablers of fake news in the memes I come across is sampling bias and selective definitions. As but one example, definitions of what precisely constitutes a “terror attack” are notoriously controversial. Was something a “mass shooting,” a “terrorist attack,” or an “act of mental illness?” I recently saw one meme that argued that there had never been another act of terrorism on US soil since 9/11 because all subsequent US attacks were the result of mentally ill individuals, rather than terrorism. Another recent meme I saw claimed that no American had been injured or killed by a foreign-born attacker on US soil and only in tiny print in a small footnote was there a statement limiting the time frame of analysis so as to not include the 9/11 attacks, the San Bernardino attack and other cases. One national poll I saw during the presidential campaign season made bold claims about national support for Clinton, but in its methodology revealed that more than 80% of its sample size were Democrats and Independents. This raises the critical question – would we label these as “fake news,” as “factually accurate but misleading” or as “absolutely true?” Therein lies one of the great challenges of the “fake news” debate – many of the data-driven memes (and news articles) swirling about are, on purely technical merits, factually accurate based on the carefully-constructed population sample they use. The question is whether something that is factually accurate can also be labeled as “fake news” when it comes to misleading the public, given that the results of even the best-run experiments are all too quickly separated from the myriad caveats that temper those conclusions. A surprising poll that clearly indicates an overwhelming sampling bias towards Democrats is eventually transformed into a headline devoid of any mention of partisan skew. A claim that there has never been a terror attack on US soil since 9/11 spreads through social media and sheds its footnote clarifying that it refers to only a small portion of that 15-year period. How do we handle statistical fallacies in a world in which few citizens (and even academics) have even a basic understanding of statistics or data? Even more troubling, how do we handle factually true statements that utilize such a carefully constructed population sample that their argument is almost meaningless? They can’t technically be flagged as “fake news” since they are factually correct, but it is also likely that as they spread those footnotes will be lost. If a factoid is shared without its original caveats does that then make it false? If a meme simply states “There has never been a terror attack on US soil since 9/11” and the footnotes clarifying the time periods and definition of “terror attack” it refers to have long since been lost, does that make the meme false or is the meme still true since it is factually correct under the specific assumptions and population construction used by its original author? These are fascinating questions as we confront the duality of vastly increased access to data and a data-illiterate population that lacks the statistical training to understand how to properly use that data to draw conclusions. Adding to this volatile mix, social media ensures that even the most skewed factoid can be extracted from a dataset and go viral, quickly losing connection to the myriad definitional caveats that enabled it to cling to truthfulness. Even when using simple techniques like counts over time, issues like data normalization and the unique nuances of dataset construction are particularly perplexing even to those with deep statistical backgrounds, meaning that even seasoned data journalists regularly publish findings that are deeply flawed and lead to further false and misleading headlines and interpretations.

We've received your submission. A French-Canadian university student was identified Monday as the “lone wolf” shooter who killed six people and wounded 19 others as they prayed in a Quebec City mosque — then called 911 to give himself up because he “felt bad,” authorities said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard labeled the shooting a “terrorist attack,” which came amid heightened tensions worldwide over President Trump’s travel ban on several Muslim countries. The suspect, Alexandre Bissonnette, 27, was an anthropology and political science student at the University of Laval, the oldest French-language university in North America, a source told Reuters. Authorities declined to discuss possible motives for the shooting at the Centre Culturel Islamique de Québec. Police said they were confident no other suspects were involved in the attack. “They consider this a lone-wolf situation,” a source told Reuters. A possible motive for the Sunday night attack was not released. Bissonnette — who was not previously known to police — lived with his parents in a single-family home in the Cap-Rouge district, where police conducted a search Monday. His father is listed in the sales deed as an investigator, the Montreal Gazette reported. Authorities earlier named two suspects, but one of them — a Canadian of Moroccan descent — was later released after it was determined he was only a witness to the bloodbath at the Centre Culturel Islamique de Québec in Ste-Foy. Bissonnette fled in his Mitsubishi but was caught about 12 miles away near l’île d’Orleans after he called 911, police Inspector Denis Turcotte said. Two rifles and an AK-47 assault rifle were found in the car. “He was armed and spoke to us about his acts,” Turcotte said, the National Post of Canada reported. “He seemed to want to cooperate….The suspect said he was waiting for the police to arrive.” Authorities said he “felt bad” and was threatening to kill himself, the French-language newspaper Le Soleil reported. Witnesses said the gunman shouted “Allahu akbar!” – or “God is great!” – during the rampage, Radio-Canada reported. Both police and witnesses had initially described two masked men open fire about 7:30 p.m. inside the mosque, where about 50 people were praying. The terrified worshipers fled barefoot in the snow as bullets flew. The victims — all men — ranged in age from 35 to 60 and were dual nationals, police said. Thirty-nine people were unharmed. Five people were in critical condition and 14 others suffered minor injuries, according to the Centre Hospitalier Universite Laval, the National Post reported. “‘It’s a very, very big tragedy for us,” mosque Vice President Mohamed Labidi said. “Security at our mosque was our major, major concern, but we were caught off guard.” Trudeau said Muslim-Canadians are “an important part of our national fabric.” “We condemn this terrorist attack on Muslims in a center of worship and refuge,” he said in a statement. “It is heart-wrenching to see such senseless violence.” Trump called Trudeau Monday to offer his condolences and to offer assistance, the prime minister’s office said. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer called the attack “another senseless act of violence that cannot be tolerated.” “It’s a terrible reminder of why we must remain vigilant, and why the president is taking steps to be proactive, rather than reactive, when it comes to our nation’s safety and security,” Spicer told reporers. Ali Hamadi said one of his good friends, father-of-three Abdelkrim Hassen, was killed. “He was my friend, my colleague. We worked together in the civil service for the Quebec government. Had I not left early I could have among the victims,” Hamadi told the Toronto-based Globe and Mail. “Such a tragic event. How can his children ever come to grasp how their father could have been murdered while praying in a mosque?” Hamadi said. A witness said the attacker walked in and started spraying bullets at “everything that was moving.” “It was someone who mastered weapons because it was calm,” the man, who did not give his name, told the paper. “He killed and he killed. It was really horrible.” He said he lay on his stomach as the man emptied his weapon. Then, he said, the gunman just stopped and left. Mosque President Mohammed Yangui, who was not inside when the shooting erupted, said he got desperate calls from people at evening prayers. “A mass shooting. In Quebec City. I can’t believe it,” he told the Globe and Mail. “We’ve never done anything to provoke anyone, and we’ve never cultivated hatred for anyone. I’m just beside myself.” The mosque has already been the target of hate. In June 2016, a pig’s head was left on the doorstep during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Practicing Muslims do not eat pork. Meanwhile, the New York Police Department said it was stepping up patrols at mosques and other houses of worship. “NYPD is providing additional protection for mosques in the city. All New Yorkers should be vigilant. If you see something, say something,” Mayor de Blasio said on Twitter. “Our prayers tonight are with the people of Quebec City as they deal with a terrible attack on a mosque. We must stand together,” Hizzoner said in another tweet. Hours after the shooting, concerned residents gathered at the Centre sportif de Sainte Foy, where Gazi Hamrouni spent six hours looking for a friend of 20 years. “He was the first I called when I heard the news,” Hamrouni told The Globe and Mail. “His phone didn’t pick up, now it’s dead and I’ve been to every hospital in the city, several times.” With Post Wires Share Selection"

Salman, wife of Omar Mateen, who was killed in a shootout with police during the 12 June 2016 attack at the popular LGBT night club in Florida, was arrested in northern California on Monday and appeared in court in Oakland on Tuesday morning.  Salman, who has claimed she had no knowledge of her husband’s plans, is accused of engaging in “misleading conduct” toward local officers and FBI agents, according to a federal indictment unsealed on Tuesday. The grand jury charges, filed in US district court in Florida, said she knowingly aided and abetted Mateen in his provision of “material support or resources” to Isis, “knowing that the organization was designated as a terrorist organization”. Linda Moreno, Salman’s lawyer, disputed the charges in a statement on Monday, saying she “had no foreknowledge nor could she predict what Omar Mateen intended to do that tragic night”. Moreno added, “Noor has told her story of abuse at his hands. We believe it is misguided and wrong to prosecute her and that it dishonors the memories of the victims to punish an innocent person.” Salman said little during her appearance in Oakland, and outside of the courtroom, her uncle told reporters, “She’s a very soft, sweet girl” who cared deeply about her son, adding: “I know she’s innocent.” The FBI questioned Salman after the shooting, but did not file any charges. It’s unclear what new information officials have gathered seven months later. Salman and Mateen, who were both born in the US, met on a dating website in 2011, and Salman has said her husband was violent toward her. After the shooting, she told a reporter that Mateen had pulled her hair, choked her and threatened to kill her. Immediately after the tragedy, considered the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, there were questions about whether Salman knew anything of Mateen’s plans to target Pulse, a club her husband had allegedly visited before. Mateen’s father said his son had strong anti-gay feelings, recounting an incident in which he became angry when he saw two men kissing in Miami while out with his wife and son. Salman is the child of Palestinian immigrants and was born in San Pablo, a city in the Bay Area just north of Oakland. In 911 calls recorded during the attack, Mateen, a security guard in Fort Pierce, said he was an “Islamic soldier”, but the CIA said it did not find any direct link between the gunman and the terror organization. Mateen’s previous wife, Sitora Yusifiy, divorced him after four months and told reporters after the shooting that he beat her and held her hostage. She also said he had mental health issues and was “obviously disturbed, deeply, and traumatized”. The shooting, which killed many queer people of color and left 53 people injured, reignited debates about firearms and national security in America, though subsequent efforts to pass stricter gun laws were unsuccessful."

Witnesses said the mosque gunman fired indiscriminately into the crowd of worshipers, which included men, women and children. When news first broke of the shooting, right-wing outlets erroneously depicted the shooter as Muslim. Fox News wrote in a now-deleted tweet: “Suspect in Quebec mosque terror attack was of Moroccan origin, reports show.” The tweet was one of many uncorrected media reports about the suspected shooter’s ethnic origins. Many outlets simply did not cover the shooting at all. 6 Muslims praying in a mosque murdered in terror attack by man known for right-wing online posts: which paper covers it on their front page? pic.twitter.com/IpS7ka6t7s A Muslim man, Mohamed Belkhadir, initially mistaken for a second suspect turned out to have been a witness who ran back into the mosque to save lives. A spokeswoman for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau immediately criticized Fox News and said the coverage was “perpetuating fear and division” and “dishonour(ed) the memory of the six victims and their families by spreading misinformation.” Fox later said they corrected their tweet and story. Trudeau called the mass shooting a terrorist attack on Muslims, yet after the details of the shooting had become clear and thousands gathered across Canada at vigils, the silence from the White House was deafening. Two days after the shooting and less than a week after President Donald Trump signed an executive order targeting Muslims and refugees, the White House offered no public condolences to its Canadian ally or to Muslims in the U.S. The only immediate reaction came from Press Secretary Sean Spicer’s troubling comments calling the Quebec City mosque attack “a terrible reminder of why we must remain vigilant and why the president is taking steps to be proactive instead of reactive when it comes to our nation’s safety and security.” But it’s deeply unusual for a world leader to not offer public condolences. President Barack Obama rejected the discrimination against Muslims in his farewell speech. And after Sept. 11, President George W. Bush gave one of his most famous speeches of his presidency: “Islam Is Peace.” In his speech, he acknowledged that the attacks “against innocents violate the fundamental tenets of the Islamic faith. And it’s important for my fellow Americans to understand that.” Trump, by contrast, only privately called Trudeau and did not reach out to Muslims in his own country. His continued silence on the targeted killing in Canada reinforces a fear many Muslims have: Things can get worse. Tarek Ismail, a senior staff attorney with the Creating Law Enforcement Accountability & Responsibility project at CUNY Law School, also known as CLEAR, has similar concerns. “The disregard for Muslims is so evident,” Ismail said to The Huffington Post in a phone call. “Without a strong effort to organize and mobilize, to expect anything else other than complete dismissal of our community, is wishful thinking.” Ismail said he worries in particular about Trump’s future policies and emphasized how the current language of the immigration ban leaves room to add more countries and have it extended beyond the current 90-day plan. Sam, a 23-year-old Muslim student at McGill University in Montreal, said she follows American news closely and is particularly worried for her country. The Huffington Post is withholding her last name for safety purposes as her father is an Iranian Canadian currently working in the U.S. “People here are trying to pretend that American politics and Canadian politics are not connected,” Sam told HuffPost. “At the same time there are a lot of xenophobic policies and Islamophobia that influences Canadian politics.” She said she’s worried her father won’t be able to come back to Canada for fear of deportation. But the news of the Quebec mosque shooting nearly broke her, she said. “I was just feeling so burned out from the whole weekend. Then the anger dissipated to heartbreak.” Reporter, HuffPost"

          / CBS/AP In the early hours of Sunday, June 12, Omar Mateen opened fire at a gay nightclub in Orlando. The shooting and hostage situation at Pulse left 50 people dead, including Mateen, and more than 50 injured. Officials are still investigating the exact motives for the shooting, but Mateen pledged allegiance to ISIS during the standoff with police. His family has also suggested he felt anger specifically toward gay people. A picture of the gunman has begun to emerge. Mateen, 29, was a U.S. citizen and has Afghan parents. He was born in New York, according to the FBI. He was married, and had a young son. He worked as a security guard, and had been investigated by the FBI before. But there is much more to learn about the man accused of murdering dozens, and his motive behind it. The investigation into the massacre at Pulse, and Mateen, could take months.

          / CBS News With the help of a grand jury, investigators are stepping up their search for evidence showing that Orlando shooter Omar Mateen's wife, Noor Salman, may have played a role in the planning of the attack, reports CBS News correspondent Jeff Pegues. Law enforcement sources said she purchased ammunition with her husband, and they believe she drove with him as he cased the Pulse nightclub. If it is determined that she had prior knowledge of the attack, she could face criminal charges. CBS News has learned that other family members are being looked at by investigators as well. On the heels of the mass shooting that left claimed the lives of 49 victims, the Department of Homeland Security has extended a bulletin it released late last year, saying it is concerned about homegrown violent extremists who could strike with little or no notice. The bulletin, first issued late last year, warns that ""terrorists will consider a diverse and wide selection of targets for attacks"" and ""inspire individuals to violence."" Investigators believe Mateen was radicalized in recent years, and they point to the Facebook message the killer posted before the massacre as evidence. ""You kill innocent women and children by doing us airstrikes..now taste the Islamic state vengeance [sic],"" Mateen wrote. The message was a precursor for what was to come inside Pulse nightclub. Margaret Barone was Mateen's supervisor at the GNC in Jensen Beach, Florida, from February 2006 to November 2006. Barone told CBS News investigative producer Laura Strickler, that Mateen was a good employee, and had no conflicts with other employees or customers, but she claimed he had started doing steroids. Barone said that Mateen left the position at GNC to pursue law enforcement jobs. After he left, Barone said, Mateen started taking steroids and ""he blew up"" and became ""huge."" Barone said during the alleged steroid use Mateen's arms went from 20 inches around to 40 inches around. She said he talked about doing steroids and was ""doing too much,"" and continued to come into the store to buy supplements. Barone told Strickler that another employee who was Muslim went out with Mateen. The employee told Barone that Mateen drank so much he would often black out. This former employee said that Mateen did not treat girls well, and became ""crazy and violent"" when he drank. The employee also allegedly told Barone that she thought Mateen was gay. Barone told Strickler that while she allowed Mateen to do his prayers in the back of the store, she said he never said anything about 9/11 or sympathizing with radical Muslims. The FBI continues to dig into Mateen's background. What they are uncovering is the 29-year-old's erratic behavior. The St. Lucie County sheriff's office has confirmed that it wanted Mateen transferred out of a Florida courthouse in 2013 after they said he made inflammatory remarks about women and Jews and then praised the Fort Hood shooter. Mateen worked for G4S as an armed security guard. They said he had a Florida security officer license which was renewed four times. Each renewal required a criminal background and FBI check. Records show he'd had extensive firearms training and was a good shot. In a 2012 documentary about the BP oil spill, he was seen telling producers that he was skeptical of the clean-up effort. ""They're like hoping for more oil to come out and more people to complain so they'll have jobs,"" Mateen said on camera. ""He was just a very agitated type of individual,"" Mateen's former co-worker David Gilroy said. Gilroy quit when he said he felt harassed by Mateen. ""He was on the verge of violence all the time,"" Gilroy said. President Obama and Vice President Biden will travel to Orlando Thursday to meet with families of those killed at the nightclub, as well as first responders.

But does the rest of America care enough to support them? Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.16 BST From a distance, the United States can look like the wild west: a country of broad civilian gun ownership, frequent shootings, and stubborn resistance to stricter gun control laws. But lots of Americans know that’s not right. Many parts of the country – even many parts of cities that struggle with gun violence, like Chicago, Oakland and Baltimore – are almost completely safe. Local residents know that the devastation of gun violence is clustered in particular areas, often racially segregated neighborhoods that have been shut out from a wide range of different resources, from good schools to grocery stores.  What Americans didn’t know was what this local concentration of gun violence looks like at the national level. How much of the toll of the nation’s gun violence is clustered in the small neighborhoods that suffer the most? And what does that mean for devising policies that might address it? For many years, the data to answer these questions did not exist. Undermined in part by the political debate over guns, even basic statistics on the toll of gun murders and non-fatal shootings in the United States are lacking. After the mass shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school in 2012, small organizations stepped in to fill this government data gap, providing everything from new counts of mass shootings to new estimates of gun ownership across the United States. The nonprofit Gun Violence Archive, which began tracking shootings and gun deaths using media reports, began to collect geolocation data for each incident – allowing, for the first time, a nationwide look at the precise geographic concentration of gun homicides. The Guardian spent months analyzing the Gun Violence Archive’s 2015 data – matching the locations of more than 13,000 gun homicide incidents to the demographic data of particular census tracts, and analyzing the patterns of violence from single streets to neighborhoods to cities to the country as a whole. We found that the toll of gun violence in America is dramatically concentrated. Thousands of cities and towns in the United States saw gun homicides in 2015. But the majority of them suffered only a single incident. Half of America’s gun homicide victims died in just 127 cities that represent less than a quarter of the nation’s population. Within those cities, gun homicides were further concentrated in tiny neighborhood census tracts that had seen multiple gun homicide incidents. Nationwide, neighborhoods that contained just 1.5% of America’s population saw 26% of the nation’s total gun homicides. This intense and predictable concentration of gun violence points the way to new solutions – local strategies whose success could have a dramatic impact on America’s overall toll of violence. Republicans and the Trump White House are likely to block any federal gun control measures for the next four years, even as they advance legislation to expand gun rights. But that doesn’t mean that the fight to reduce gun violence has to be put on hold for the next four years. At the local level, the path to saving lives is wide open. The majority of gun violence in America is a profoundly local problem – one in which local police chiefs, prosecutors and mayors have much more control over what happens than Congress, or the White House. For the past 20 years, research on policing strategies has shown that extremely targeted strategies – ones that focus a city’s resources on the people and places where violence clusters – can have dramatic success in reducing gun violence. The best-known of these strategies are the Boston Ceasefire, or “focused deterrence” model, which reduced youth homicides by 63% in the mid-1990s by coordinating police, prosecutors, social workers and black ministers to talk directly to the groups of young men driving the shootings, and the Cure Violence model, which uses former gang members and other outreach workers to defuse local conflicts and broker truces between feuding groups. But the emerging body of research on what works to prevent local gun violence simply hasn’t translated into widespread success in making neighborhoods safe. The National Rifle Association isn’t stopping cities and states from devoting more resources to the tiny neighborhoods burdened by violence. The biggest barrier is the lack of interest – and financial support – from the Americans outside the hardest-hit neighborhoods. In St Louis, home to some of the nation’s deadliest blocks, residents described the devastating toll of this concentrated gun violence. Fearful for their lives, young men escalate small conflicts into deadly confrontations. Children grow up struggling with the traumatic loss of their parents. One St Louis resident said he was afraid to honk his horn at another car, worried that even that interaction might spark a shooting. These patterns of intense gun violence are rooted in decades of economic struggle and racist policies. The same St Louis blocks burdened with the most violence were forged out of racially exclusionary housing policies and on the receiving end of systematic disinvestment in favor of whiter, more affluent city regions. But you don’t have to end poverty or eliminate racism to to reduce, if not erase, the toll of shootings. Few St Louis residents hang their hopes on the passage of legislation that makes it harder to get a gun, but many believe it should be possible to de-escalate petty conflicts before they trigger cascades of needless death, retribution and suffering. James Clark is one of the most trusted gun violence prevention advocates in St Louis – someone respected by both community members and some in the police department. He’s been working to prevent violence for nearly a quarter-century. Early this fall, his organization had just three outreach workers and no case managers trying to work with high-risk men to defuse conflicts across America’s most dangerous gun violence blocks. Since then, he’s expanded slightly, to seven outreach workers and two case managers. To “change the trajectory in the St Louis metro area”, he said, the city needs a total of 50 outreach workers and 20 case managers. With that level of support, he believes, “St Louis would be more like Boston and less like Chicago.” Instead, the ongoing violence has dragged down even some of the local residents trying to stop the shootings. Darren Seals, a controversial but beloved local activist and Ferguson protester, was found shot to death in a burning car this September, just days before he was planning to meet with Guardian reporters to talk about his violence prevention work. Rather than making the problem easier to fix, the intense concentration of gun violence has simply made it easier for many Americans to ignore the ongoing devastation. “The places that need the most help generate the least tax. Nobody wants to pay additional money to help their neighbor a few miles away,” said Jerry Ratcliffe, a policing expert at Temple University in Philadelphia. A national survey of 600 African Americans conducted in early 2016 found that 80% considered gun violence an “extremely serious” problem, but the majority believed that “most people in America don’t care about the gun violence that is affecting communities of color”. For the past eight years, Barack Obama’s justice department pushed to support proven local violence prevention programs, and to help cities across the country replicate them. But it has done so with little financial backing from Congress and little bully pulpit support from Obama, who has remained focused on stricter gun control laws. The justice department’s flagship violence reduction program, which focuses on helping cities with the highest rates of violence, has worked with only 15 of America’s 127 highest gun homicide cities. For local advocates, the constant reinvestigation of the question “What can be done to prevent urban violence?” is exhausting and frustrating. They know what can be done. They just don’t have the support to scale it. “We’ve reached the point of what I’m calling analysis paralysis,” Clark said. “What we’ve got to be able to do now is come out of our comfort zone and go into the belly of the crisis.”"

Bullet-resistant vests.,http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/fire/the-newest-gear-for-pinellas-fire-and-medical-responders-bullet-resistant/2311721,en,False,,22,Tampa Bay Times,http://www.tampabay.com/,"The firefighters, paramedics and emergency medical technicians hoisted the new gear over their heads, gathered together in a classroom to learn how to use it. It wasn't the bunker gear they wear to dash into fires or the uniform to respond to medical emergencies. It was bullet-resistant vests and helmets more commonly associated with police and the military. Pinellas County spent about $720,000 on the new equipment in a move officials say allows them to respond sooner and closer to the scene of a shooting, narrowing a window of time officials say could make the difference between life and death. The county is the first agency in the Tampa Bay area to provide the equipment. The move is a response to a string of high-profile mass shootings in recent years and federal guidelines urging first responders to have a unified plan to address active-shooter situations. ""If we're really going to save lives, then we've got to move in as close as we can be,"" said Craig Hare, director of Pinellas County EMS & Fire Administration. ""We want to be right behind the police officers as soon as they clear the scene."" The bulk of the cost — about $685,000 — went toward 484 sets of helmets and 42-pound vests. The rest paid for what the county is calling ""major trauma bags,"" which include first aid supplies such as tourniquets and gauze with a clotting agent, both designed to stop blood hemorrhages. The equipment is for every on-duty position in the county, including for Sunstar, the private ambulance company the county contracts with. It is standard practice for the county to pay for Sunstar's medical equipment, Hare said. An active shooting scene is split into several areas by law enforcement to help organize response, said the Dunedin Fire Department's chief of training, Erich Thiemann, who led the recent session in Oldsmar on the new equipment. A hot zone is where the shooter is still active. A cold zone is far away from the danger, such as in a church down the street. The area in between is the warm zone, which hasn't been secured by police and therefore still has a risk. Fire and medical responders will still stay away from the hot zone, but the bullet-resistant equipment gives them a layer of protection to go into the warm zone with police and start helping and removing victims. ""That's all we're doing: handling immediate life threats,"" said Ross Pinney, a tactical medic with Oldsmar Fire Rescue who taught a portion of the training to practice dragging and carrying victims from a scene. There are about 60 tactical medics like Pinney in the county who are trained with law enforcement to go into dangerous situations. While the purchase has been in the works for several years, last summer's Pulse nightclub shooting stepped up the urgency. Orlando paramedics and ambulance technicians didn't have bullet-resistant vests and treated patients across the street in the parking lot of a bagel shop where police officers took the wounded. About a dozen victims died at or on the way to hospitals. A district chief told the Associated Press it was difficult to know whether more could have been saved had paramedics gotten to them sooner. The training in Pinellas took on a foreboding tone as instructors emphasized that a similar mass shooting could happen this afternoon, tomorrow, next week at Westfield Countryside mall, perhaps, or a nearby high school. That line of thinking — that it's not if, but when — is what sparked the idea for bullet-resistant equipment in the first place, said Lealman Special Control Fire District Chief Richard Graham, president of the Pinellas County Fire Chiefs' Association. The county is the most densely populated in the state and a tourist destination. It became clear to Graham and, eventually, other chiefs that the equipment should be a priority. ""I understand there's only so much money to spend, but this is a good thing,"" he said. ""I promise you if this happens … the question is going to be, 'Well, why aren't you prepared?' "" The county is in the process of drafting a policy for active-shooter response. Graham added that the equipment can be used for other calls, too, such as domestic violence or stabbings. The county is leaving it to the discretion of each department to decide when to wear the helmets and vests in addition to the rest of their bulky, heavy gear. Clearwater Fire & Rescue has already set a written policy, which says personnel must put on the body armor ""prior to entering any hostile environment,"" including active-shooter incidents, fights and civil disturbances. But, in response to concerns from firefighters, the department has made entering a warm zone voluntary, said Marvin Pettingill, operations chief. A few have opted out, but the majority have said they're willing to participate. ""We went to fire school knowing that we would have to put out fires, but … most of us never knew we would have to be wearing ballistic gear to respond to calls,"" said Sean Becker, president of the Clearwater Fire Fighters Association, the union representing Clearwater Fire & Rescue staff. Becker said the union has other reservations about use of the equipment, such as the fact that it was bought per position, not fitted for every individual, which he said could make it less safe. Clearwater wrote into its policy that everyone must try on and adjust the equipment at the start of each shift, and Pettingill said the vests fit from a 28-inch waist up to a 61-inch waist. Outfitting every individual in a vest would have cost about $2.4 million, Hare said. That high price tag is what has held back Pasco and Hernando counties from purchasing the gear, officials said. Both departments know they'll have to buy the vests and helmets in the near future to align with national standards and are looking for grant funding in the meantime. Officials from Hillsborough County Fire Rescue said they are not planning to buy the gear. ""Our county and our fire chief are pretty frugal,"" said Shawn Whited, Pasco's training chief. ""You can't put a price on anybody's life, but if we don't use it …"" In Pinellas, officials hope they never have to. But just before the group at the north county training last week slid the gear over their heads, Thiemann made sure they knew what was at stake. ""This is not the way of the future,"" he said. ""This is now. This is the world in which we live."" Times researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report, which uses information from the Associated press.

The mass shooting in Las Vegas on Sunday night has revived an issue that has divided Americans for decades: What can be done do stop such massacres? President Trump has promised to roll back gun restrictions. The most prominent gun measure currently before Congress is one that would allow people with concealed-weapon permits from one state to carry their weapons to other states. The concealed carry legislation is one of many gun measures that policy makers have debated in recent years. Backers of those ideas, whether the emphasis is gun rights or gun control, often say the intent is to make Americans safer. We've wondered whether the various ideas politicians talk about would work, and whether the public would support them. In June 2016, we asked Morning Consult, a media and polling firm, to survey two groups: some of the country’s leading experts on gun violence, and a representative sample of the American electorate. Our expert survey asked dozens of social scientists, lawyers and public health officials how effective each of 29 policies would be in reducing firearm homicide deaths, regardless of their political feasibility or cost. Policies deemed both effective and popular appear in the upper-right corner of the matrix. Less popular, less effective measures fall lower down and to the left. The two policies ranked most effective were those requiring all sellers to run background checks on anyone who buys a gun, and barring gun sales to people convicted of violent misdemeanors, including domestic assaults. The experts were more skeptical of other much-debated proposals, including a national gun registry and an assault weapons ban. The idea of requiring states to honor out-of-state concealed weapon permits was ranked low. The academics in our panel — many of the country’s best empirical researchers on gun policy — were far more likely than the general public to support gun control. But nearly all of the policies that experts think could work have widespread support from the general public. While Americans remain sharply divided in their overall view of the tension between gun control and gun rights, individual proposals are widely favored. The most popular measures in our survey — policies like universal background checks and keeping guns from convicted stalkers — were supported by more than 85 percent of registered voters. Even the least popular idea, a law that would limit gun sales to people who had to demonstrate a “genuine need” for the weapon, was favored by nearly 50 percent. “We think of guns being an incredibly controversial topic, but what your polling shows and ours has shown is there’s a whole lot of gun policies that really aren’t controversial,” said Daniel Webster, a professor and director of the Johns Hopkins center for gun policy and research. Public support, of course, doesn’t always translate into legislative action. The Republican Congress, like Mr. Trump, has shown little appetite for measures that would curb gun rights. 100% OF Americans Support Expand mental health treatment Honor out-of-state conceal and carry permits 0% OF Americans Support 100% of Americans Support Expand mental health treatment Honor out-of-state conceal and carry permits 0% of Americans Support Historically, Mr. Trump has expressed support for some of the more popular measures on our matrix. But once he entered the presidential race, he came out strongly against changes that might limit gun rights for most Americans. He has said that he supports nationalizing concealed carry permits, and that he wants to lift restrictions on carrying guns in places like schools or military bases. The concealed carry bill was one of the first introduced in the new Congress. The bill, filed by Richard Hudson, a Republican representative from North Carolina, would require states to honor out-of-state permits to carry a concealed weapon even if the standards for obtaining them differ, just as states honor driver’s licenses from other states. On our matrix, it is one of the worst-performing ideas. Our panel of experts did not think it would be effective in reducing gun homicides, though a majority of Americans said they’d support it. Mr Trump has also advocated more treatment for people with mental illness. That idea fared better among the public and the experts in our surveys. 100% OF Americans Support Universal checks for gun buyers Expand mental health treatment Bar sales to all violent criminals Assault weapons ban High-capacity magazine ban 0% of Americans Support 100% of Americans Support Universal checks for gun buyers Expand mental health treatment Bar sales to all violent criminals Assault weapons ban High-capacity magazine ban 0% of Americans Support In addition to asking experts about all firearm homicides, we asked them to rate the same set of policies according to their effectiveness in reducing mass shootings, which make up around 1 percent of gun homicide deaths. Many of their favored policies stayed the same, but a few changed. Bans on assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines, or limitations on ammunition purchases, would have a greater effect on mass shootings than on routine gun violence, according to the survey. Those rules wouldn’t necessarily reduce the number of mass shootings, the experts said, but could lower the death toll when they occur. 100% OF Americans Support Expand mental health treatment Bar sales to convicted stalkers Bar sales to all violent criminals Honor out-of-state conceal and carry permits National stand- your-ground law 0% OF Americans Support 100% OF Americans Support Bar sales to convicted stalkers Expand mental health treatment Bar sales to all violent criminals Honor out-of-state conceal and carry permits National stand- your-ground law 0% of Americans Support Most of our experts generally favor gun control policies. Only five said they oppose them, and these five rated nearly every policy option as less effective than their colleagues did. But there were still some policies they thought would reduce gun homicides, including expanded screening and treatment of mental illness, and restrictions on gun sales to people convicted of stalking. Our gun experts who were opposed to gun control tended to particularly oppose blanket policies. “The essence of a ban is it applies to everyone equally, at least theoretically,” said Gary Kleck, an emeritus professor of criminology and criminal justice at Florida State University. “But in practice, criminals, being criminals, don’t obey the law.” We also asked the National Rifle Association for its favored gun control policies and its thoughts on our results, but the group declined to comment. 100% OF Americans Support Bar sales to mentally ill Stronger sentences for illegal gun Honor out-of-state conceal and carry permits Expand mental health treatment 0% OF Americans Support 100% OF Americans Support Bar sales to mentally ill Stronger sentences for illegal guns Honor out-of-state conceal and carry permits Expand mental health treatment 0% OF Americans Support We asked the membership of two groups of law enforcement professionals to answer our survey (their responses were not combined with those of the academic experts). Just under 100 police officers and chiefs responded, representing only a small percentage of the law enforcement community. In general, the participating law enforcement professionals expressed more support than the academics for measures that would encourage the use of guns by civilians to defend themselves against crime. They gave higher ratings on stand-your-ground laws and the concealed carry measure, for example. They were far more wary than the academics of measures that involved banning categories of firearms or restricting where individuals can carry guns. Our sample mixes the two groups of law enforcement professionals, which may obscure differences among them. Previous research has shown that police chiefs tend to be more supportive of policies that restrict gun access, while rank-and-file police officers tend to favor more gun rights. In interviews, we asked some of our experts for safety ideas that weren’t included in our survey. A few pointed to strategies that wouldn’t involve new legislation or regulation, particularly for gang-related gun homicides, which are far more common than mass shootings. Studies have shown that a few programs that focus on community outreach can reduce gun violence in cities. Expanding such programs wouldn’t require new laws, just more funding. There were also some policies that we didn’t ask about. We didn’t ask about a ban on all handguns, which Washington, D.C., and Chicago have tried. Nor did we ask about barring gun sales to people with a history of alcohol-related offenses, like D.U.I.s. We didn’t ask about lifting restrictions on carrying guns on military bases or near schools, which Mr. Trump has endorsed. And we didn’t ask about a measure, recently passed in a few states, that would allow law enforcement officials or family members to seek a kind of restraining order from a judge to temporarily confiscate guns from a person who appears to be in crisis. To build a list of possible policies, we consulted the academic literature on laws from American states and foreign countries and spoke with advocates for gun rights and gun control. Both surveys were conducted in June of last year. For our measure of popularity, Morning Consult conducted an internet survey of 1,975 voters, who were asked whether they approved of the possible laws. For our effectiveness survey, we asked experts in gun policy to evaluate each idea on a scale of 1 to 10, according to how effective they thought it would be in reducing fatalities. We asked the experts to ignore considerations of political or legal feasibility. Our expert panel consisted of 32 current or retired academics in criminology, public health and law, who have published extensively in peer-reviewed academic journals on gun policy. We know our sample is small and may not include every expert that readers would like consulted. But we feel it represents a useful, if imperfect, measure of what people steeped in the research think might save lives. The panel of academics included: Cathy Barber, Magdalena Cerdá, Jay Corzine, John Donohue, Laura Dugan, Liza H. Gold, David Hemenway, David Kennedy, Louis Klarevas, Gary Kleck, David Kopel, Tomislav Kovandzic, Adam Lankford, John Lott, Jonathan Metzl, Matthew Miller, Carlisle E. Moody, Andrew Papachristos, Charles Ransford, Peter Reuter, Mark Rosenberg, Robert J. Sampson, Michael Siegel, Gary Slutkin, Robert Spitzer, Stephen P. Teret, George E. Tita, Eugene Volokh, Daniel Webster, April Zeoli and others. Special thanks to the Fraternal Order of Police and the Major Cities Chiefs Association for distributing the survey to their membership.

The same day The Daily Beast wrote an article on journalism’s gullibility, they get duped into writing a report based on a tweet from the parody twitter account, “Reuter News Braek” (yes, even with the incorrect spelling of “break,” they still used this as their source of information), where they wrongly identified the Quebec Mosque killers. In his Sunday article, ""What is Hiding Behind Donald Trump’s Lies,"" Clive Irving pontificated on the gullibility of journalism during the Bush years: The disasters of the Bush years are prologue to the urgent and severe test we face now:  whether journalism, our democracy’s last line of defense against abuses of power is up to the job. In the case of Bush, journalism was fatally gullible when it needed to be vigilant, pliant when it needed to be ineluctable… Well, it certainly seems like the media, in this case at least, The Daily Beast, is still gullible considering they actually based their information on a dummy Twitter account, falsely reporting that it was two white supremacists --  David M.J. Aurine and Mathieu Fournier -- who carried out the mass shooting at a Quebec City mosque on Sunday. The Daily Beast was quick to change the error of their ways, issuing the following statement: This piece originally stated that Reuters reported the names of the assailants. However, the information came from a Reuters parody social-media account. We regret the error and have deleted the information. There’s something to be said about the fact The Daily Beast was the ONLY “news” outlet to actually write a story based on the hoax account. It kind of makes you wonder what other sources The Daily Beast uses to dish out dishonest information in the form of “news.” The parody account seemed to have gotten wind of the Daily Beast’s story, later tweeting: “It’s not my fault modern journalists are all gullible morons.” Perhaps Mr. Irving should do a follow-up story on just how gullible and pliant the media is when reporting news, beginning with the very publication he writes for – the Daily Beast. It's not uncommon for the early reporting on crimes to get the suspects wrong. The problem here was using a parody site for information.

                since  Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper served as a representative of the Democratic Party's future here, just as outgoing Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry represented the past. If this gathering is any indication, Hickenlooper may be on the verge of building buzz as a 2020 hopeful. Several attendees pointed to him as someone who could rescue the party after its disastrous 2016 losses. One former Obama administration official suggested he could be a Democratic version of Trump — both because of his quirky, off-the-cuff nature (as seen in a campaign ad during which he takes a shower) and a laser focus on middle-class jobs and economic growth. Hickenlooper has experience in both the private and the public sectors. He opened Colorado's first brewpub and served as a popular mayor of Denver, Colorado's largest city. As governor, he has overseen the state's challenge of federal law on the legalization of marijuana for recreational use (an initiative he was at first against but on which he has since changed his views) and spearheaded a push for significant gun reforms after the deadly 2012 mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora. Business Insider spoke with Hickenlooper at Davos. This interview has been edited for clarity and length. Brett LoGiurato: What's the mood here at Davos this year, given the inauguration of Donald Trump? John Hickenlooper: It's definitely a different energy. It's a little more somber. LoGiurato: As a prominent Democratic governor, what are you looking for from the president? Do you see areas where you can work with him? Where are areas where you want your state legislature to try to insulate yourself from things he might try to do? Hickenlooper: Well, I may not have voted for the president, but I'm an American first. My entire administration is going to do everything we can to make him as successful as we can. We're going to try to be active, strong partners with the federal government. That being said, we went through a great deal of work to expand Medicaid to a large number of people in Colorado. We cut our percentage of people who had no insurance — we cut it in half. We're going to work really hard to protect that as much as we can, make sure that we have the support from the federal government to continue making sure people have basic rights, basic elemental healthcare. Also, I look at some of the things that the president will do around cutting red tape, reducing bureaucracy, helping entrepreneurs, helping businesses grow more rapidly, more access to capital — I'm all for it. That's all stuff that I've been trying to do in Colorado. LoGiurato One area in particular that seems ripe for a clash is on marijuana legalization. Have you spoken with Trump's pick for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions? Do you have a read on how he'll approach the issue, both with your state and moving forward more broadly? Hickenlooper: I have not talked to Sen. Sessions. I know that our two US senators, Michael Bennet and Cory Gardner — we have a Republican [Gardner] and a Democrat — are both very focused on this. We look at it as one of the ways in which states are laboratories of democracy. People don't realize that almost two-thirds of the population in the United States lives in a state where either medical or recreational marijuana are now legal. Two-thirds of the country. We're looking at it as kind of a 10th Amendment, states'-rights issue. Although marijuana might be the wrong example for that. Medicaid is a better example. It's one of the rare times where Democratic governors are saying, ""Hey, states' rights."" We don't want the federal government coming in and telling us how to do our environmental remediation or how we're going to do our healthcare. LoGiurato: Do you think marijuana will at least be decriminalized on a federal level? Hickenlooper: Well, we'll see. We've made a tremendous amount of progress in terms of creating a regulatory system from scratch [in Colorado]. If I had a magic wand when it first passed three years ago, I would've reversed it. You don't want to be in conflict with federal law. That being said, we've now gone three years, and our voters passed it by 55-45. We've made a lot of headway. And if I had that magic wand now, I'd wait a year or two. If we do this well enough, we should see a dramatic reduction in the number of drug dealers out there. You take away a big chunk of the product flow, you're going to need fewer salesmen. And there's been no spike in usage. There's been no spike in young people, of teenagers, using it. We now have — again, in a $27 billion budget, $125 million of tax revenue isn't that significant, but it is money that we can use for people with drug addictions and for rehabilitating people that slipped off the tracks. Those are programs that are hard to find money for outside of the marijuana-tax revenue. LoGiurato: Marijuana prices are tumbling amid a growing legal supply. Do you have plans to address that on a taxation level? Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper.

Hickenlooper: We'd like to get the tax level to the point — we want the price to go down, because that's how you get rid of the black market. And we still have — some of the laws in the state of Colorado, at least, people had the ability to grow up to 99 plants as caregivers. It's crazy. How do you tell the gray market from the black market? So we're tightening up a lot of those rules to make sure we can control and regulate the whole system much more tightly. LoGiurato: I want to talk about the future of the Democratic Party. I keep hearing your name come up as a savior in 2020. What's your read on what went wrong in 2016 and the early steps the party has taken to rectify its losses? And are you supporting anyone to be chair of the Democratic National Committee? Hickenlooper: [Laughs at 2020 mention.] We had a very strong relationship with the Department of Labor, so [Tom Perez] was a pretty easy choice for me [to be DNC chair]. We're doing an apprenticeship program that I think is one of the most exciting things we've ever worked on. I just came from a meeting with Microsoft and LinkedIn — Allen Blue and Brad Smith — and they're both going to help finance this. We're also using LinkedIn to partner with. How do you get people who've lost their professions into new professions? It's its own story someday! But I think the political reality for the Democratic Party is, you know, there are two sides. There's one side saying that we weren't liberal enough and another side saying we're too liberal. I think they're both right. The Democratic Party is always going to be the party of civil rights and fairness — everybody gets an equal, fair shot at the American dream. And we're going to be the party that really fights to protect planet Earth — enjoy whatever time we're going to get! But at the same time, there's nothing wrong with the Democratic Party that talks more about — and more loudly about — jobs, and cutting red tape, and bureaucracy, making it easier for entrepreneurs to start jobs, making it easier for businesses to grow and create more jobs. That has historically been the wheelhouse of the Democratic Party. Even as we continue to carry the banner of civil rights and environmental justice, we've also got to focus on many, many people — for them, life starts with a good job. LoGiurato: I assume you want to continue to be a loud voice in the future of the Democratic Party. Do you have any plans as we head into the 2018 and 2020 cycles? Hickenlooper: Nope. I'm not starting a PAC. I'm not going out there and putting together a phantom campaign. In two years, I think the workforce stuff we're working on in Colorado really has the potential to be a national model, so I want to put a lot of energy into that. We're trying to make — have for the last four or five years — trying to make Colorado the healthiest state. So we're rolling out a lot — we'll have an interactive map of every single hiking trail in the state of Colorado. Everything there is. You'll be able to go out and, while you're hiking, you can meet up with other people on the trail, you can see other people's photographs. You can come back 20 years later and click on the map and see all the pictures you took. It's a pretty exciting thing that hopefully will get people out walking. We're trying to put together kind of a governor's fitness council to get every single kid walking at least once a day. Colorado Gov.

LoGiurato: On that note, you've been the mayor of a large city. A lot of the issues you talk about, and that the Democratic Party cares about, start at the local level. The party has suffered massive losses, however, on state and local levels recently. Do you think that is important start for the party's future leaders? Hickenlooper: Almost all government starts at a very local level at some point. And so I look at that experience as some of the hardest but some of the most exciting stuff I've done in public life. I think it's valuable. Now, does that mean everybody has to be a mayor? I don't know. You talk to Cory Booker — I'll bet you anything that he'll go back and say that when he was mayor of Newark, [he had] some of the most challenging times, but also some of the most rewarding times. Mayors of big cities — we cherish it, but it's a steep hill. We love it. For you For you"

          / CBS News Footage from a 2012 award-winning documentary, ""The Big Fix,"" has emerged showing Orlando gunman Omar Mateen working as a security guard contracted to the security company G4S following the 2010 BP oil spill. He seems skeptical of the cleanup efforts. ""No one gives a s*** here. Everybody's just, get out to get paid. They're like hoping for more oil to come out and more people to complain so they'll have jobs,"" Mateen tells a reporter. ""They want more disaster to happen."" A G4S spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that Mateen is indeed the man featured in the documentary. Six years later, Omar Mateen went to work as a guard in a gated community in Florida. He then went home, only to go back out. Investigators now believe that Mateen was in the general area of the Pulse nightclub for several hours before launching the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history at about 2 a.m, reports CBS News correspondent Jeff Pegues. Sunday's shooting rampage wasn't Omar Mateen's only objective during the three-hour attack. He was also on Facebook, declaring his allegiance to ISIS. He repeated his pledge in a phone call to 911 and to a television producer, according to a local cable news station. ""Then he started saying he did it for the Islamic State, he did it for ISIS and he started speaking in Arabic,"" said Matthew Gentili, a News 13 TV producer who received a call from Mateen. A law enforcement source said Omar Mateen's wife, Noor, is telling FBI investigators she tried to stop her husband from committing the attack. Investigators have interviewed her twice and given her a polygraph test. She told them the couple had been to the club at least once before. Club patron Jim van Horn said Mateen was a regular. ""Everybody knew his name. Omar,"" van Horn said. ""He used to come in the bar on the weekends sometimes, he would be there, sometimes he would miss a couple of weeks and then be in again."" The FBI has been speaking with the owners of other clubs in the area, including Michael Bass, who operates the gay club ""Revere."" He said he received a Facebook friend request from Mateen three days before the shooting. ""I saw that picture that morning of the incident. I swallowed my tongue. It was Omar Mateen,"" Bass said.

The American Military Experience in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria Russian President Vladimir Putin intervened militarily in Syria in September 2015 by launching what the Russian media dubbed Operation Vozmezdie (Retribution). He did so under the guise of joining the global effort to defeat terrorism. His chief of staff Sergei Ivanov stated at the time ""The military goal of the operation is strictly to provide air support for the [Syrian] government forces in their fight against Islamic State."" Putin himself claimed his intervention was intended to prevent ""these criminals who already tasted blood"" from returning ""back home and continue their evil doings."" But the Russian president's real aim was to bolster the beleaguered Bashar al-Assad regime in the western corridor where most Syrians live. His intervention was essentially a counter insurgency operation against an array of Sunni rebel forces fighting against the government in Damascus, not a counter terrorism campaign against ISIS forces located primarily to the east. Russian forces deployed advanced ""Vladimir"" tanks, cruise missiles, aircraft, including long range strategic bombers, and their only aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov, to repulse an alliance of Sunni rebels that was advancing on the coastal strongholds of the Alawite-dominated Assad regime. In furtherance of this policy, the Russians also carried out an indiscriminate bombing campaign in Sunni rebel-controlled eastern Aleppo that has been blamed for vast numbers of civilian deaths. But Putin's actions have not made his citizens safer, on the contrary they have put them squarely in the crosshairs of the terrorists. By intervening in Syria on behalf of a bloody dictator whose forces have killed far more people than ISIS, Moscow has incurred the wrath of Sunni jihadist groups, including ISIS and former Nusra Front now known as Jabhat Fateh al Sham. ISIS threatened Moscow for its actions and stated ""You will not find peace in your homes. We will kill your sons ... for each son you killed here. And we will destroy your homes for each home you destroyed here."" Such threats were soon translated into action and Russia has increasingly been made a primary target of global jihad with a rising number of Islamist terrorist plots and attacks focusing on Russian targets at home and abroad. The most notable example of this terrorist blowback has been the downing of a Russian civilian airliner over the Sinai Desert last October leading to the death of 224 people on October 31, 2015. The Metrojet airliner was downed by a bomb planted on board by an ISIS affiliate in Egypt and was Russia's worst aviation disaster. There have been other attacks as well, most notably a series of ISIS inspired bombings in the southern Russian province of Dagestan as well as the beheading of a Russian child by an Uzbek nanny, the shootings of police officers in Moscow and Nizhni Novgorod a foiled attempt in November to carry out a Paris style mass shooting attack at malls in Moscow and St. Petersburg and a series of attacks on security forces in Grozny, the capital of the Chechen Republic on December 19th. The killing of the Russian ambassador to Turkey, Andrey Karlov on Monday by a gunman who shouted ""Aleppo"" and ""revenge"" shows that terrorists who blame Russia for mass civilian deaths and for helping prop up the hated Alawite dictator Assad certainly have their own plans of retribution to punish Putin for his incursion in Syria. With thousands of foreign fighters from Russia fighting in Syria and Iraq, there is significant risk this terrorist blowback will get much worse as ISIS's ""Caliphate"" begins to collapse. The net result of Putin's adventurism in the Middle East would sadly seem to be less security at home for citizens of a country who originally vote him in to power based on his promises to protect them from Chechen terrorism.

But then a Trump aide quickly dismissed Perkins’ mid-December demand. According to The Washington Blade, Trump spokesman Jason Miller said: “To think that discrimination of any kind will be condoned or tolerated in a Trump administration is simply absurd.” Miller’s comment was so definitive that the State Department itself highlighted it. In the weeks since, LGBT members of the Foreign Service have clung to Miller’s words as a sign that they will not see the extraordinary gains they’ve made under President Barack Obama completely vanish once Trump takes office. On Monday, in the latest manifestation of the Obama approach, Secretary of State John Kerry issued an official apology to past State Department employees fired or discriminated against due to their sexual orientation. But despite Miller's seemingly unequivocal statement, many LGBT employees worry that the State Department will scale back its overseas work on gay rights issues under Trump. The concern stems partly from the fact that although Trump himself appeared to be generally gay friendly during his presidential run, Vice President-elect Mike Pence is a staunch Christian conservative with a record of opposing gay rights. “It seemed like sometimes the candidate and his running mate were not singing from same sheet of music,” a gay State Department employee said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to press. By SEUNG MIN KIM and JOHN BRESNAHAN Trump’s choice of Rex Tillerson, the former CEO of ExxonMobil, as secretary of state, has added to the uncertainty. Tillerson is a devout Christian who helped the Boy Scouts of America open their ranks to gays. But his former company’s approach to LGBT issues has not impressed activists; it wasn’t until 2015 that ExxonMobil included sexual orientation in its non-discrimination policy, and critics contend that was because the company was reacting to Obama’s executive order requiring federal contractors to protect gays and lesbians. “Tillerson is no profile in courage,” said David Stacy, government affairs director for the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT advocacy group. He added: “Republican administrations have generally de-prioritized human rights and have been focused more on security issues and economic issues. And of course we’re worried about what the LGBT piece of that is.” Under Obama, protecting the LGBT community has been a priority across the federal government. (Obama's tenure also will be remembered in part for the Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage.) However, the Obama administration went beyond U.S. borders with its LGBT policies even at the risk of offending some countries, such as Saudi Arabia and certain African states, where gays and lesbians face draconian laws. Family Research Council leader Tony Perkins recently urged Donald Trump to expel State Department “activists” promoting LGBT rights overseas. | Getty Obama issued a presidential memorandum directing that all U.S. agencies that work overseas promote and protect the rights of gays and lesbians. His administration also has supported gay-friendly resolutions and other public statements in forums such as the United Nations. Along with other countries, the State Department helped launch the Global Equality Fund, which provides money to civil society groups to help gays, lesbians and others. Thanks to Obama, same-sex couples can now obtain U.S. passports under the names recognized by their individual states. In 2015, the State Department named a special envoy to help promote the human rights of the LGBT community around the world. The envoy, Randy Berry, has stressed that his priority isn't to convince every country to allow same-sex marriage. Rather, it's been more about lobbying other governments to stop the harassment and killing of gays, lesbians and others who fall under the LGBT umbrella. Thus the emphasis on ""human rights"" as opposed to just ""gay rights."" Trump transition aides did not respond to a request for comment about their plans on LGBT issues — whether, for instance, they will keep the special envoy position. But they have not indicated they plan a roll-back of LGBT initiatives. LGBT activists acknowledged that it's possible such issues might get a lower profile, not least because of the outrage of people such as Perkins and other conservatives important to Trump's base. Still, they hope that the Trump administration understands how important the U.S. example is for gays and lesbians struggling overseas. ""People around the world are looking to us for that leadership,"" said Bryan Dalton, a retired diplomat who 25 years ago helped start GLIFAA, an organization representing LGBT employees of U.S. foreign affairs agencies. By NOLAN D. MCCASKILL The president-elect has said that same-sex marriage is ""settled law,"" meaning he doesn't want to fight that battle all over again. For that alone, he's earned some fans in the LGBT community. ""The American people are just tired of politicians who just say what they think people want to hear but never follow through. With Trump I think you’re going to have the follow through,"" said Joseph Murray, an administrator of LGBTrump, a social media-based group of LGBT activists backing the real estate mogul. He and others dismissed concerns about Pence, insisting that it is Trump who will set foreign policy, not the veep. Some observers, meanwhile, have been struck by Trump’s linking of gay rights to the fight against Islamist extremism. During his speech at the Republican National Convention, Trump mentioned the deadly mass shooting in June at an Orlando gay nightclub. The attack was carried out by a Muslim man apparently inspired by the Islamic State terrorist group. “As your president, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBT citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology,” the president-elect said. While members of the LGBT community on the one hand were pleased that Trump would call out extremist ideology that threatens them, they also are aware that Trump has terrified many ordinary Muslims who view him as anti-Islam, not just anti-extremism. Some pointed out that Trump’s call to stop the resettlement in the U.S. of Syrian refugees, whom he has cast as potential terrorists, will also mean barring LGBT Syrians who face extreme danger. By ANNIE KARNI Michael Guest, a gay former diplomat who served as ambassador to Romania during the George W. Bush administration, stressed that it's still too soon to tell what exactly Trump will do. Still, he added, ""None of the people that I know would want to see our community pitted against any other community."" Kerry's apology on Monday underscored how far the LGBT community has come. Although he didn't mention it using the term, the outgoing secretary of state's statement referred in part to the so-called Lavender Scare, an effort in the 1950s and 1960s to purge federal employees believed to be gay. Hundreds of State Department employees lost their jobs as a result, with some being told they were security risks because their perceived sexual orientation made them vulnerable to blackmail. ""In the past — as far back as the 1940s, but continuing for decades — the Department of State was among many public and private employers that discriminated against employees and job applicants on the basis of perceived sexual orientation, forcing some employees to resign or refusing to hire certain applicants in the first place. These actions were wrong then, just as they would be wrong today,"" Kerry said. ""On behalf of the department, I apologize to those who were impacted by the practices of the past.""

This is how I want my children to remember Ft. Lauderdale. Airports were always happy places for me. They contained the expectation of adventure and were filled with people going somewhere, and I was one of those people, too. Every summer, my brother and I boarded a plane in Rochester, NY, and followed a daisy chain of connecting flights to end in Anchorage, Alaska, over 4,000 miles away. Moving walkways, subways, escalators... airports were the only place where I saw grownups walk with the same fast, excited steps as children. I tried to pass on this feeling of excitement to my two sons, but we live in a grimmer age. I told them that TSA was looking for hamsters in their pockets when we went through security. That worked for a few years, but eventually they caught on. They learned about 9/11. They’ve heard about hijackings and plane crashes unrelated to terrorists. And now, they’ll learn about the Ft. Lauderdale shooting. We’ve been through that airport, my children and I. It is the first place they have been that has had a mass shooting. We know those airport halls. We remember the occasional birds that found their way inside the terminal. I don’t want my children to be afraid. I wish I could beg the world to be kinder. I wish someone had found every would-be shooter back when they were children and hugged them and give them what they needed to not grow up to think this was their answer. I don’t understand violence, especially violence toward strangers. No, the word especially isn’t right, because I don’t understand violence towards people you know, either. I don’t know how to explain it to my children. I don’t know how to interject thoughts of people running and dying into memories of what was once our happy place. Obviously, I can refuse to say anything. I can block them from the news. But children notice things, and my children and I fly often. We flew this month, and we will fly again next month. I’m not going to stop flying with my children, but I hope to God that I don’t come to regret it. I can’t say that I wish the world was more like the world I grew up in. There were 30 aircraft hijackings in the 1980s, which was when I flew several times a year, often unaccompanied. The world has never been safe, and never will be. What I had then that I don’t have now is ignorance about how horrible the world was. Although I’d like to keep my kids in an information bubble, that ship sailed as soon as I sent them to school. I can no longer hide them from the evils of the world. But I can show them that although bad things happen, I am not going to let them stop me. I am not going to let our world become smaller until we are too afraid to leave the house. And I can tell them that I am afraid, too, but courage is being afraid and acting anyway. Not being afraid is too much to ask of any of us. Mother, writer, off-key singer and occasionally inappropriate dancer."

One of the ways President Trump intends to go about it would be ineffective and ridiculous. According to the Wall Street Journal, among the executive actions Trump is contemplating is a ban on people from “countries deemed a terror risk from entering the U.S.” [How do you ‘tell if they’re a terrorist or friendly’?] During the campaign, candidate Trump used every terrorist attack to bellow proposals that were unconstitutional and immoral. A total ban on Muslims from entering the United States until we “can figure out what is going on” was the most egregious. It came in the wake of the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., in December 2015. But it would not be the last time. After the terrorist attacks in Brussels last March, Trump said in one television interview, “We have to be very, very vigilant as to who we allow into this country.” And in response to the massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando in June, Trump delivered a speech where he reiterated his proposal to ban Muslims from coming to this country. The lunacy and impracticality of what President Trump proposes becomes crystal clear when you know this one glaring fact: Belgium and France are not among Trump’s “countries deemed a terror risk.” A BBC report of the terrorists involved in the Brussels and Paris attacks notes that all but one or two of them were born in Belgium or France. Omar Mateen, the Orlando murderer, was born in New York. Syed Farook, the San Bernardino murderer, was born in Illinois. His wife and accomplice was born in Pakistan. [Dylann Roof is a terrorist] Meanwhile, I’d love to know how the president plans to keep us safe from other homegrown terrorists like avowed racist Dylann Roof and religious zealot Robert Dear, who is accused of killing three people at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado in November 2015. With the exception of calling Dear “a sick person,” Trump has been uncharacteristically mute.

(City of Orlando via AP) (The Associated Press) ORLANDO, Fla. – New photos released by the city of Orlando show where officers breached one of Pulse nightclub's walls to free people trapped inside during the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The photos released Tuesday show large punctures to an exterior cinderblock wall of the nightclub. On the other side is a bathroom where patrons were trapped for more than three hours. Forty-nine people were killed and dozens were injured after gunman Omar Mateen entered the gay nightclub and opened fire last June. Mateen's wife, Noor Salman, appeared Tuesday in federal court in Oakland, California, on charges of aiding and abetting her husband, who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group during the standoff. Mateen was killed in a shootout with officers after the bathroom wall was breached.

568301218,2017-01-17 08:09:47,"Travel firm told Sousse survivors Tunisia was 100% safe, inquest hears",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/17/travel-firm-told-sousse-survivors-tunisia-was-100-safe-inquest-hears,en,False,,1751,Guardian US,https://www.theguardian.com/us,"Another survivor claims Tui did not show her official travel advice warning terror threat in country was high First published on Tue 17 Jan 2017 13.09 GMT Some of the survivors of a mass shooting in Tunisia say they were told by Tui travel agents before they travelled that the north African country was “100% safe” and were not shown official travel advice warning that the threat from terrorism was high, an inquest has heard. Hundreds of tourists were sunbathing on the beach at Sousse in June 2015 when Seifeddine Rezgui opened fire with a Kalashnikov assault rifle, killing 38 tourists, including 30 Britons, in a rampage that lasted nearly 40 minutes.  The inquest at the Royal Courts of Justice in London into the British deaths heard that Paul Thompson and his daughter visited a Tui branch in May 2015 and raised concerns about security in Tunisia following a terrorist attack on the Bardo national museum in the capital, Tunis, in March that year. The pair were told by the branch in Ilkeston, Derbyshire, that Tunisia was “100% safe”, Andrew Ritchie QC, who is representing 20 victims’ families, told the inquest. He also said Cheryl Stollery, whose husband, John, was killed in the Sousse attack, claimed not to have been shown Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) travel advice when she went to a Tui travel agent branch in February 2015 to book their holiday. Ritchie was questioning an FCO official, Jane Marriott, about travel advice. Marriott told the inquest that as part of a scheme between the FCO and tour operators, called Know Before You Go, travel agents would be “expected to promote” the travel advice. Travel firms were also expected to display a “prominent Know Before You Go” logo and link to the travel advice on their websites. Asked whether the claimed experiences of Stollery and Thompson would make her feel “comfortable”, Marriott, who was FCO director of Middle East and north Africa at the time of the Sousse attack, said: “We would expect our partners to fulfil that requirement [to promote the advice].” Later in Tuesday’s hearing, the inquest heard that a British embassy official in Tunisia had warned the government in a report written months before the Sousse killings that security at hotels in the resort town was not good enough to prevent a terror attack. The unnamed British trade representative, who was also in Mumbai, India, at the time of the 2008 terrorist massacre, conducted a “recce” of nine beachfront hotels in Sousse, including the Imperial Marhaba and nearby Port El Kantaoui, between January and March 2015. Reading extracts from the heavily redacted report, Ritchie said: “It said ‘despite some good security infrastructure around the hotels and resorts there seems to be little in the way of effective security to prevent or respond to an attack’.” Ritchie told the inquest the government was aware that Islamic State-linked extremists had warned that the terror group would target tourists in a video posted on YouTube in December 2014. Earlier, the inquest heard that at the time of the Sousse attack the official travel advice from the FCO stated: “There is a threat from terrorism including kidnapping.” It made reference to the Bardo national museum attack and added “terrorists have threatened to carry out attacks in Tunisia”, while noting a failed suicide bomb attack in Sousse in 2013. Tui, which owns Thomson holidays, through which all 30 of the British victims booked their trip, is expected to come under significant scrutiny over its handling of travel advice for Tunisia from the FCO. Lawyers representing some of the families will accuse Tui of “practically hiding and keeping out of the limelight” FCO warnings about terrorism in Tunisia, according to papers submitted in advance of the resumption of the inquest. Tui representatives are to give evidence later in the inquest, which is set to run to the end of February. In the attack on the Bardo museum, three Islamist fundamentalists killed 21 people, mostly European tourists, including one Briton. A cross-Whitehall meeting was held 12 days after the attack during which it was decided that the travel advice would not be tightened to advise against all but essential travel. Marriott told the inquest that in order to change the advice to all but essential travel, the terrorist threat had to be “specific, large and endemic”. She said: “We didn’t have anything to indicate the threshold had been met. The Bardo attack was clearly something different. It fitted a rising picture, but at the time we were at the start of what would become a rising trend.” On the day before the Sousse attack, a meeting was held between FCO and UK government officials and the embassy in Tunis to discuss security issues in Tunisia. The timing of the meeting was coincidental, the inquest heard. The meeting discussed “reaching out” to tour operators to ensure they brought travel advice to customers’ attention. A counter-terrorism assessment for the FCO days after the Sousse attack questioned the security at the beach resorts, the inquest heard. The review by the Tunisian security assessment team found “security at the hotels to be generally of a low standard”. Howard Stevens QC, representing Tui, took the inquest through a booking page for Tunisia, highlighting links to the FCO advice."

Many involved allegations of domestic violence, including two reports of strangulation that don’t appear to have been taken seriously. In January 2016, Santiago was arrested after his girlfriend told Anchorage police he attacked her while she was in the bathroom. He broke the door, forced his way in and began to strangle her, she said. “She stated that he continued to yell at her to ‘get the fuck out bitch’ while strangling her and smacking her in the side of the head,” the responding police officer wrote. Strangling his girlfriend ― impeding her ability to breathe ― shows a capacity to kill, experts say. Years of research has established that the act of strangulation is an important predictor of future lethal violence: If a woman has been choked by an intimate partner, she is seven times more likely to become a homicide victim in the future. Strangulation, defined as cutting off air supply or blood circulation by applying pressure to the neck, can lead to neurological damage within seconds and death in under five minutes. Despite its danger, strangulation often leaves no visible injuries, making it particularly difficult to prosecute. Because of that, experts say, the offense has historically been treated as minor, akin to a slap or a punch. But over the past 10 years, most states, including Alaska, have passed laws to treat strangulation as a serious, felony-level offense ― even in cases where there are no observable injuries. That didn’t happen to Santiago. He was charged with criminal mischief for damaging the bathroom door, and fourth-degree assault ― both misdemeanors ― and ordered to stay away from his girlfriend. A month later, he was rearrested for violating the conditions of the no-contact order when cops spotted him with his girlfriend. Prosecutors gave him a second chance. In March, they offered to drop the domestic violence charges if he attended anger-management classes and stayed out of trouble for a year ― a process called deferred prosecution. Experts contacted by The Huffington Post questioned the decision to defer prosecution in a case involving strangulation, and said Santiago’s history of domestic violence allegations should have been a red flag that he was a potential danger to others. “I don’t believe any case involving strangulation should be deferred, ever,” said Gael Strack, a former domestic violence prosecutor and one of the country’s leading experts on strangulation. “We now know that strangulation involves a high level of violence and lethal violence. Much like when someone points a gun or holds a knife to a victim’s neck ― those cases also don’t have visible injury, but they are life-threatening acts of violence.” Casey Gwinn, who headed the prosecutor’s office in San Diego, California, and now runs trainings across the country on strangulation with Strack, noted that if Santiago had been convicted of a misdemeanor domestic violence offense, he would have been barred under federal law from owning or purchasing firearms. “The handling of this case has all the earmarks of poorly investigating a strangulation case and minimizing its significance at every turn,” Gwinn said. “Where was the follow-up investigation? Where was the forensic exam?” Gwinn added that Alaska has a manual on how to investigate and prosecute strangulation cases. “There is no indication that the prosecutors followed any of the best practices guidance of their manual,” he said. It’s unclear if Santiago attended anger-management classes, as he was required to do. Police responded to his residence on three occasions for “physical disturbances” from March to October, according to Anchorage Police Chief Chris Tolley, including for a second allegation of strangulation. Police wouldn’t release details on those disturbance calls. In a press conference on Sunday, Tolley said there was no probable cause for an arrest in any of the three calls. Anchorage municipal prosecutor Seneca Theno told The Huffington Post her office takes allegations of strangulation very seriously, but a successful prosecution requires evidence. Theno said that in her experience, it was rare for a strangulation to occur without injuries. “Usually, you are going to see something,” she said. “Those things tend to be observable and would serve as corroboration of the report.” The handling of Santiago’s domestic violence case raises questions, experts say. “Why was this even a deferred prosecution? Why did they charge it as the lesser crime?” said Dawn Dalton, executive director of the Domestic Violence Legal Empowerment and Appeals Project. “When you look at the escalation of violence in the research that has been done, strangulation is one of the final acts before homicide takes place in intimate-partner relationships.” Dalton said she was especially concerned about the decision to offer deferred prosecution after Santiago broke the no-contact order barring him from seeing his girlfriend, and wondered why authorities didn’t regard the domestic disturbances in October as violations of the deferred-prosecution conditions. “To me, that is a system failure,” Dalton said. Santiago’s alleged history of domestic violence adds him to the long list of suspected mass shooters who physically assaulted those close to them before going on to attack the public. As The Huffington Post has previously reported: This story is tragically familiar. In the past few years, many of the men who have committed heinous, unthinkable acts of violence against the public have had a history of abusing the women in their lives. Prior to unleashing their deranged violence onto the world, they practiced it against the most vulnerable and accessible targets ― those living inside their homes. Micah Johnson. Omar Mateen. Robert Dear. Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Cedric Ford. Man Haron Monis. And others. Domestic violence and mass shootings are intricately linked in the United States. Many mass shootings actually target intimate partners or family members, though those incidents rarely make the news. According to data collected by Everytown for Gun Safety, of the 16 mass shooting incidents in 2016, seven ― 43 percent ― involved a male shooter targeting a family member or intimate partner. In those shootings, women and children made up 81 percent of the victims. “As a practical policy matter, society needs to recognize that by intervening in family violence, we are protecting the larger society as well,” said Joan Meier, a law professor at George Washington University. “The same people who attack members of their family are people who attack total strangers.” This article has been updated to include a comment from the Anchorage municipal prosecutor. ______ Melissa Jeltsen covers domestic violence and other issues related to women’s health, safety and security.

          / CBS News SUMTER COUNTY, Fla. -- Two teenagers were arrested Thursday for their involvement in a plan to carry out a mass shooting at the Villages Charter Middle School, the Sumter County Sheriff’s Office said. Deputies told CBS Orlando affiliate WKMG-TV school officials became aware of a rumor circulating about a mass shooting to take place on Friday. Authorities intercepted a 13-year-old boy Wednesday morning as he arrived for school. They said he acknowledged conversations involving the plot and referenced the shooting at Columbine High School. Deputies said that, during a conversation with the 13-year-old, they learned a 14-year-old boy was potentially involved. The 14-year-old also acknowledged his involvement, referencing the Columbine shooting, too. Deputies said the two admitted they planned an attack in which they would use a signal to open fire. Sumter County officials said no weapons were found on either of the students, or in their bags or lockers. They were both arrested at their homes on Thursday during the execution of search warrants. Deputies said firearms were recovered at both their homes during the search. Both students are charged with conspiracy to commit murder. They were placed into the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice. School officials released a statement to parents Thursday night, writing in part, “Please trust that we have taken care of the situation and the safety of your child is always our first priority.” Officials said there would be an increased deputy presence at the school Friday.

          / CBS/AP EVERETT, Wash. -- A young man who shot and killed three people at a house party in July near Seattle has been sentenced to life in prison without parole. Allen Ivanov pleaded guilty last month to three counts of aggravated first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder for wounding two other victims. He did so one day before a prosecutor was to announce his decision on whether to seek the death penalty. Ivanov was charged with the killings of Anna Bui, Jacob Long and Jordan Ebner, who were all 19. Investigators say Ivanov attacked the July 30 gathering in the small city of Mukilteo because he was upset that his former girlfriend Bui, who he referred to as his “dream girl,” seemed to be moving on after their breakup. The two were both students at the University of Washington, reported KIRO. Ivanov apologized before Snohomish County Superior Court Judge Janice Ellis as she sentenced him Thursday, but blamed the shootings on “Satan,” the station reported. “Satan was in control,” Ivanov said. “I’ve replayed the events over and over. How could I have done this?” Ivanov had bought the assault-style weapon about a week before the attack, and court documents say he was so unfamiliar with the weapon he read the instruction manual before the killings. Court documents indicate Ivanov gave a few indications of his troubling intent: He texted someone a week before the attack “regarding committing a mass shooting.” Relatives of the victims expressed anger and sorrow in the courtroom. “There is no way to undo the irreparable harm and to bring back the precious lives,” Paul Kramer, the father of a victim who survived, said in court, according to KIRO. “To add insult to injury he shows no remorse. In fact he takes pride in his crime.” For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app First published on January 13, 2017 / 10:30 AM © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

574641869,2017-01-31 08:32:22, The Recent U.S. Terror Plots You Won't Hear Donald Trump Talking About,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2017/01/30/rightwing-terror-plots-trump_n_14524384.html,en,False,"politics and government,immigration and refugees,terrorism",27502,HuffPost,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/#,"Senior Reporter, HuffPost As President Donald Trump struggles to defend his decision to halt refugee resettlement and immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations, it’s become increasingly clear that the executive order he signed on Friday is a solution in search of a problem. Islamophobia may sell in the White House, but many Americans find it hard to buy his argument that the order will keep out “radical Islamic terrorists” but is “not about religion.” No refugee from any country targeted in Trump’s ban has carried out a fatal U.S. terror attack. This fact is inconvenient for Trump. He first proposed what critics ― and reportedly, Trump himself ― referred to as a “Muslim ban” in December 2015, after a Muslim couple killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California. Syed Rizwan Farook, the husband, was an American born in Chicago. And Tashfeen Malik, the wife, was a legal permanent resident of the U.S. whose native country, Pakistan, is not included in Trump’s order. Yet those facts didn’t stop White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer from citing the San Bernardino shooting as a justification for Trump’s ban on immigrants and travelers from other Muslim-majority countries this week. There’s little factual basis for this anti-immigrant fear-mongering, but it does enable the Trump administration to scapegoat people from a set of countries that have a combined population of 218 million. Only four nations in the world are that populous. To understand the inconsistencies at work, it’s helpful to consider the terror threats the White House isn’t talking about ― the ones that are part of a wider trend of domestic terrorism motivated by white supremacy and other forms of right-wing extremism. First, let’s talk about the fatal attacks carried out by foreigners in the U.S. Between 1975 and 2015, foreign-born terrorists ― including immigrants and tourists ― killed a total of 3,024 people on U.S. soil, according to a 2016 Cato Institute report. All but 41 of those deaths came on Sept. 11, 2001 and the following days. Three deaths came at the hands of refugees: a pair of political attacks by anti-Castro Cubans in the 1970s. A number of non-fatal terrorist attacks ― including three by refugees from Iran and Somalia, both nations on Trump’s list ― also took place over that time. Not only is the “death by refugee terrorist” phenomenon extremely rare, but dying in an attack by a foreign-born terrorist is among the least likely causes of death in America over the past four decades. According to the Cato Institute, there’s a 1 in 3.64 billion chance each year of dying in a terror attack carried out by a refugee. These astronomical odds speak to the incredible rarity of death by terrorism in the U.S., especially when compared to more common causes, like routine gun violence and even shark attacks. Studies have also shown that new immigrants are generally equally or less likely to commit crimes than their natural-born counterparts. Some supporters of Trump’s immigration ban have pointed to terror plots in Europe in the past few years, claiming the new policy is the only way to ensure a refugee never carries out an attack on U.S. soil. Beside the obvious differences between the U.S. and Europe, these arguments often fail to acknowledge the strict vetting system that currently governs refugee resettlement into the United States. The current screening process takes between 18 and 24 months on average, and includes biometric and biographic tests, interviews and database checks carried out by both United Nations and U.S. security agencies. But Trump has successfully exploited Islamophobia and irrational paranoia to temporarily close off U.S. borders to people from certain countries. He defended his hasty and chaos-provoking decision by claiming that “bad dudes” would “rush” into the country if he waited (as if there were no national security apparatus to prevent this from happening). Security experts say the terror threat from refugees and immigrants from the seven countries named in Trump’s ban ― Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen ― isn’t significantly higher than it’s been in the past, and they believe the order is only likely to make threats worse. The president has effectively cast aside the proverbial scalpel in favor of a sledgehammer. Now we’re watching him use it to perform an entirely unnecessary, far-from-surgical procedure. This approach has created a desperate need for additional context. Between 9/11 and the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando last year, right-wing terror attacks actually claimed more lives than those reportedly motivated by Islamic extremism, according to one frequently cited study. The government defines right-wing terror as activity often motivated by principles of racial supremacy and the embrace of anti-government, anti-regulatory or anti-abortion beliefs. Recent acts of right-wing terror include the fatal 2012 shooting of 6 people at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, the 2015 killing of 9 people at a historically black church in Charleston, South Carolina, and another 2015 shooting that killed 3 people at a Colorado Planned Parenthood clinic. Authorities disrupted many more plots that the public may have overlooked because they didn’t involve Muslims. Republicans have played a role in deflecting attention away from far-right terror. In 2009, when former President Barack Obama’s Department of Homeland Security issued a report on right-wing extremist radicalization, GOP leaders blasted language identifying “disgruntled military veterans” as potential targets for terrorist recruitment. Then-DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano eventually apologized to veterans and retracted the report. The cases below certainly don’t serve as a comprehensive list of every right-wing terror plot uncovered in the past few years, and calling attention to them is not an attempt to paint all men with right-wing beliefs as terrorists intent on killing Muslims or people of color. Yet as long as the White House continues to focus exclusively on terrorist acts by people who claim to be acting in the name of Islam ― and on the least likely sources of such terrorism, like refugees ― Muslims in the U.S. and around the world will continue to be unfairly demonized. Critics say this is likely to complicate the fight against legitimate terror threats and inspire more terrorism, both foreign and domestic. In October, Patrick Stein, Gavin Wright and Curtis Allen were arrested and charged with conspiring to detonate a truck bomb in a Kansas apartment complex where more than 100 Somali immigrants lived. All three were members of a white supremacist group called “The Crusaders.” The group espoused “sovereign citizen, anti-government, anti-Muslim, and anti-immigrant extremist beliefs,” according to an FBI agent’s affidavit. Authorities have since filed additional firearms charges against the defendants, who have all pleaded not guilty. Federal authorities arrested Ronald Chaney III, Robert Curtis Doyle and Charles Halderman in November 2015 after they allegedly tried to buy an automatic weapon, explosives and a pistol with a silencer from undercover agents. The men had discussed a plot to attack black churches and Jewish synagogues, which they justified as a necessary assault in “an impending race war.” All three suspects later pleaded guilty. Federal agents arrested Walter Eugene Litteral, Christopher James Barker and Christopher Todd Campbell in August 2015, after discovering a plot to manufacture explosives and purchase weapons and body armor to kill members of law enforcement and the U.S. military. The men believed “the federal government intended to use the armed forces to impose martial law in the United States, which they and others would resist with violent force,” according to court documents. They believed this as part of a popular conspiracy theory regarding a multi-state military exercise known as Jade Helm. All three defendants later pleaded guilty and were sentenced to less than two years in prison. Police and FBI agents raided a home in St. Louis in March 2015 after informants revealed that its owner, David Michael Hagler, had discussed plans to go on a killing spree targeting members of law enforcement at funerals and fundraisers. Informants said Hagler held “extreme anti-government and anti-law enforcement views,” and had recently hardened his rhetoric against minorities and Muslims. Police were concerned they’d find explosives, booby traps and assault rifles at Hagler’s home, but an extensive search only turned up other firearms. Hagler later pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a year in prison in February 2016. Robert Doggart, of Sequatchie County, Tennessee, was charged in 2015 for allegedly plotting with associates to lay siege to Islamberg, an Islamic community in upstate New York. Doggart, a former congressional candidate, allegedly planned to use assault rifles, firebombs and even machetes to “inflict horrible numbers of casualties upon the enemies of our Nation and World Peace,” according to court documents. His trial is set to begin next month. In July 2014, Pennsylvania police found approximately 20 improvised explosive devices at the house of Eric Charles Smith, a man with white supremacist ties whom authorities had previously arrested. Federal officials also discovered Nazi paraphernalia and literature suggesting Smith had been hosting meeting for a group called the “White Church Supremacists.” One of the bombs included a message reading “(Expletive) the government — down with Obama (racial slur) Muslim Pig,” according to police. Smith pleaded guilty and was later sentenced to more than 7 years in prison. Shane Robert Smith was arrested in August 2015 after allegedly amassing an arsenal of machine guns, semi-automatics, armor-piercing ammunition and silencers to form a “hit squad” to murder minorities and Jewish people. Officials said that the teen’s social media accounts were littered with hate speech against the groups he may have intended to target. Smith pleaded guilty in 2016 and has been sentenced to 3 years in prison. Violence and radicalism are complicated forces, often driven by complex social and political conditions and inflamed by personal factors. No single radical, or even group of them, can define a race, religion or belief system. But extremism in any form can be a threat to U.S. security, and Trump says he’s simply pursuing the impossibly ambitious goal of keeping all Americans safe. If he truly wants to do that, he should be more consistent in acknowledging all potential sources of terror. Most importantly, he must not encourage further extremism, whether carried out in the name of Islam or in opposition to it.

Details of the case against Noor Salman were revealed for the first time Wednesday in an Oakland courtroom, more than two weeks after federal agents arrested the 30-year-old woman at her family’s home in the East Bay city of Rodeo, where she grew up. But Salman’s attorneys said the government had no basis for its charges that she aided and abetted her husband by providing material support to a terrorist organization and obstructed the ensuing investigation. Charles Swift said Salman has a diminished mental capacity, was the victim of prolonged abuse by her husband, and was interrogated for 18 hours without a lawyer one day after the June 12 massacre of 49 people. “She’s not religious, she had not had any contact with (the Islamic State), watched anything, done anything herself,” Swift said after the hearing in U.S. District Court. “You know what she is? She’s alive and Omar Mateen is dead, so she is the only person they can charge.” The arguments played out during a bond hearing to determine whether Salman is a threat to the public, or a flight risk, if she is released before trial. Salman spent the hour-long hearing writing vigorously on a yellow legal pad, occasionally handing notes to one of her attorneys, Linda Moreno, and looking over to eight family members in the gallery. She wiped away tears when Swift described the domestic abuse she suffered. Magistrate Judge Donna Ryu must decide whether to set a bond amount for Salman. That could allow her to be released from Santa Rita Jail in Dublin, where she is on suicide watch, and into the custody of her family after undergoing a psychological evaluation that the judge ordered Wednesday. Salman grew up in a four-bedroom home on Donald Drive in Rodeo before marrying her first husband in an arranged ceremony in the West Bank and moving to Chicago. When that marriage ended, Salman moved back to the Bay Area and, in 2011, connected with Mateen through an online dating site. The couple married in Hercules months later and moved to Fort Pierce, Fla., where they had a son. Salman returned to Rodeo after the attack and was arrested Jan 16. Assistant U.S. Attorney Sara Sweeney said during Wednesday’s hearing that Salman should not be granted bond because her involvement in the rampage at the Pulse nightclub makes her a risk to the public. After repeatedly lying to investigators, Sweeney said, Salman admitted knowing Mateen was plotting an attack. “She was aware he was watching (Islamic State) recruitment videos, and she knew he had been watching jihad videos at least two years before the attack, and said it upset her because her son was in the room,” Sweeney said. In the 10 days leading up to the attack, the prosecutor said, the couple burned through $30,000, including $8,000 for a diamond ring for Salman. Laying out what may be the centerpiece of the government’s case, Sweeney said Salman joined her husband while he cased possible locations for a shooting. Besides the Pulse nightclub, the couple allegedly visited CityPlace, an upscale entertainment area in Palm Beach, Fla., and Downtown Disney in Orlando, a promenade of shops, restaurants and movie theaters. “When leaving, Mateen asked, ‘What would make people more upset, an attack at Downtown Disney or at a nightclub?’” Sweeney said. Then on June 1, prosecutors said, the couple went to a bank to add Salman to Mateen’s account as his “payable-on-death” beneficiary, meaning she could access the account if she had a death certificate. The day after the mass shooting, Salman contacted the bank, Sweeney said, and also asked the FBI about obtaining a death certificate. In interviews with investigators, Salman said she made up a cover story for her husband, telling his family he was out to dinner with a friend after she watched him leave the house with an AR-15-style rifle and ammunition, prosecutors said. “She said she knew when he left that he was going to commit an attack,” Sweeney said. “She showed herself to be a calculated and callous person. ... Her actions contributed to the death of 49 people. This is a level of danger that is very high.” Salman’s attorneys, though, suggested their client’s alleged admissions were the unreliable product of a coercive interrogation. They said she was picked up at 4 a.m. the morning after the attack and questioned for the next 18 hours. The interviews started in a police car, moved to a conference room and ended in a small file room at a Florida FBI office, Swift said. “They said, ‘We’re not getting what we want,’” he said. “She is a special education student and a battered spouse and the government led her down a path. They said, ‘You must have known. You must have known. You must have known.’” Instead of looking at Salman’s alleged confession, Swift said, the court should review her actions on the night of the attack. He said she bought and wrote out a Father’s Day card, purchased a “World’s Greatest Dad” shirt and went to bed. Salman, he said, likely believed her husband had gone out to dinner with a friend that night. Salman was not Mateen’s partner but his longtime victim, Swift said. Mateen, he said, “had prolonged abusive steroid use, gained 60 pounds and became the Incredible Hulk” during their 5-year marriage. “We were surprised at the presentation of the government’s case. We frankly expected more,” Moreno said outside court. “We now know there is no more to their case.” After Ryu’s ruling, the case will be moved to Florida.

Part 1The Regulator in Chief Part 2The Threat to the Planet Part 3The “Good War” Part 4The Health Care Revolution Part 5Breaking the Racial Barrier Part 6A Changed Man Text by JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS Photographs by STEPHEN CROWLEY and DOUG MILLS January 17, 2017 In the beginning, there was hope. A racial barrier shattered. An anxious nation eager to turn the page on foreign war and economic hardship. And the audacious plans of a new president. President Obama stood on the West Front of the Capitol on Jan. 20, 2009, and dismissed as small-minded those who would question his grand ambitions. “They have forgotten what this country has already done,” Mr. Obama said, “what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, and necessity to courage.” Days before, Mr. Obama — the African-American son of a Kenya-born father and a Kansas-born mother — had stood in the Oval Office, in a White House built in part by slaves, flanked by four white men who were the only others on the planet who understood the burden of the job he was about to take on. Mr. Obama began with bold strokes. He signed executive orders to close what remained of the secret Central Intelligence Agency prisons. He ordered the closing of Guantánamo Bay. He pushed through a $787 billion economic stimulus bill, and began the work to provide health coverage to 46 million Americans. To Republicans hoping to temper his agenda, Mr. Obama had a curt message. “Elections have consequences,” he told Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House Republican leader. His presidency could be transformational, Mr. Obama believed. He quizzed historians on how past commanders in chief had harnessed Congress to achieve great things. “He had a mind-set of getting big things done the way Lyndon Johnson was able to in the 1960s, and to be part of the pantheon of great progressive presidents,” said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian who has spoken regularly with Mr. Obama. “He truly believed that he could unify the country.” He found instead that it was as divided as ever. “It feels bad,” he said in 2010, licking wounds from a midterm electoral loss he called a “shellacking.” The agent of change had become a symbol of the status quo he had vowed to upend. Mr. Obama had his health care bill, but the triumph had come at a heavy cost. “This is something that I think every president needs to go through,” he told reporters. “In the rush of activity, sometimes we lose track of, you know, the ways that we connected with voters that got us here in the first place.” Tea Party-fueled Republicans, energized by their virulent opposition to what they derisively branded “Obamacare,” vowed not to let Mr. Obama’s agenda advance. And so his aspirations shifted with the political tide. “I guess in my second term, I’ll be doing a lot of foreign policy,” he ruefully told a group of historians at a 2011 dinner at the White House. David Kennedy of Stanford University was there. “He just felt checked and blocked and that he couldn’t get any further,” he said. “He went from a place of being just full of enthusiasm and hope and expectation and hope and aspiration to a real sense of disappointment, of being stymied.” It never got easier. Time and again, Mr. Obama had to comfort a nation stunned by repeated shooting rampages across the country. Spending time with families who lost young children in the gun massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in December 2012, was the “hardest day of my presidency,” he said afterward. “And I’ve had some hard days.” Mr. Obama’s voice crackled with anger in 2013 after the Senate defeated measures to expand gun restrictions. Three years later, while announcing a set of modest executive actions to curb gun violence, he shed tears in the East Room as he remembered the Newtown children. “Every time I think about those kids,” he said as he wept openly, “it gets me mad.” No matter how hard he tried to avoid defining his presidency through the prism of race, it was always a powerful subtext, and sometimes a potent flash point. His victory was heralded as the dawn of a post-racial America, but the first African-American president never really saw it that way. “At the inauguration, I think that there was justifiable pride on the part of the country that we had taken a step to move us beyond some of the searing legacies of racial discrimination in this country,” Mr. Obama said several weeks after being sworn in. “But that lasted about a day.” There is more work to be done, he always said. “We just need to open our eyes and our ears and our hearts to know that this nation’s racial history still casts its long shadow upon us,” he said when he walked across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act — and of “Bloody Sunday,” when black civil rights activists were brutally beaten by state troopers. Articles in this series will explore the sweeping change that President Obama has brought to the nation, and how the presidency has changed him.

            when we publish the next stories in this series. The deaths of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Michael Brown and nine black parishioners in South Carolina forced Mr. Obama to speak out, and yet try to balance both sides. “Maybe we now realize the way racial bias can infect us even when we don’t realize it,” Mr. Obama said at the funeral for Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, a victim of the mass shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C. “So that we’re guarding against not just racial slurs, but we’re also guarding against the subtle impulse to call Johnny back for a job interview, but not Jamal.” But when he opened the White House to Black Lives Matter activists, who told him their voices were not being heard, he admonished them: “You are sitting in the Oval Office, talking to the president of the United States.” His foreign policy was one of contradictions. Nine days after announcing that he would send 30,000 more American troops to Afghanistan, Mr. Obama accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo. Even he did not believe that he had earned it yet. Six years later, Mr. Obama had to concede that the war in Afghanistan would not end before he left office. But he basked in international adulation for other breakthroughs: a broad climate change agreement, the most significant in history, forged in Paris; a nuclear deal with Iran; a surprise opening with Cuba. “I didn’t make any big mistakes,” the Nobel Prize winner told historians in 2014 of his foreign policy legacy. That was before the Islamic State began a brutal offensive in Iraq, a ruthless new adversary on the rise. In the end, the victories were hard fought. “Yes, we can,” was his inspirational campaign mantra in 2008, but in 2016, traveling the country to promote his rival-turned-ally Hillary Clinton, he often resorted to, “C’mon, man!” He watched incredulously as voters contemplated replacing him with a man who owed his political rise to a false conspiracy theory that Mr. Obama was born in Kenya. He smiled tightly for the cameras after the election, shaking hands with the president-elect in the Oval Office only days after telling Americans that Donald J. Trump could never be trusted with the nuclear codes. “You don’t need hope when things are going well,” he said to heartbroken young aides. “You need it when things are not going well.” Ever rational and restrained, he insisted on an orderly passing of the baton. It was jarring to aides who wanted the fiery Barack Obama of the 2008 campaign. But he, and the country, had changed. Hope had been tempered by volatile politics, the art of the possible and the slowness of societies to evolve. “America is not a fragile thing,” Mr. Obama said in a farewell address in Chicago. “But the gains of our long journey to freedom are not assured.” Produced by Tanner Curtis and Josh Williams Advertisement"

In the grand sweep of American gunfire in the 21st century, all we can say about Friday’s Fort Lauderdale tragedy was that it’s the worst mass shooting so far in 2017. But there have already been six incidents with more than three dead or wounded victims. On Wednesday, three family members in Fontana, Calif., were killed in their home and another critically wounded. A 73-year-old relative was charged. Never even entered the national conversation. But the Fort Lauderdale case was personal — almost everybody travels through airports. “You just can’t imagine how this could ever happen in a state like ours,” said Florida Gov. Rick Scott at a press conference. A few minutes later he did remember to refer to the fact that last year 49 people were shot to death in a gay nightclub in Orlando. Officials were still unsorting the history of the suspect, identified as Esteban Santiago, and trying to determine whether he was inspired, even in a totally deranged way, by ISIS. Whenever these tragedies happen, the nation holds its breath until there’s an assurance that it did not involve terrorism. If we get the word, there’s a sigh of relief and we go back to living in a country where a random guy will suddenly open fire in a mall or theater or school just because he’s nuts and has a gun. In theory, when a horrific tragedy occurs, the nation is supposed to join hands and come together. It’s hard to do that in mass shooting cases because America is a land divided between gun places and non-gun places. The immediate reaction of many folks from gun places to the Fort Lauderdale shooting was that — aha! — Florida is one of the few states where it’s illegal to carry a gun anywhere in an airline terminal. Meanwhile, many people in non-gun places wondered why airline passengers were allowed to have firearms in their luggage. It’s hard to have a rational gun conversation in a country with such a cultural chasm. It’s the job of our national officials to bridge the gap. And it ought to be possible, since there are some important issues on which almost everybody agrees. One is that gun purchases should be run through background checks to make sure the buyer doesn’t have a record of lawbreaking or serious mental problems. We will be arguing for a while about whether background checks could have stopped the Florida airport shooting. But either way, sensible regulation of gun sales will still be sensible regulation of gun sales. This is the moment where I tell you that our president-elect does not believe in sensible regulation of gun sales. Donald Trump’s position on gun laws has gone through a rather familiar evolution. Back in the day he was a sort of indifferent moderate. Then came the campaign and a love affair with the National Rifle Association, which dumped about $30 million into the effort to get Trump elected president. Soon, he was fantasizing about packing heat during the Paris terrorist shootings. (“I can tell you that if I had been in the Bataclan or in the cafes, I would have opened fire. I may have been killed, but I would have drawn.”) He appeared, during one rally, to suggest that if Hillary Clinton was elected president, gun lovers might want to take her out. (“If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people — maybe there is, I don’t know.”) And he has consistently endorsed the theory that if more people were carrying around guns, the nation would be a much safer place. Donald Trump Jr., a chairman of his dad’s new Second Amendment Coalition, declared, “My father defends the Second Amendment so that you and I and your spouse and your children can take care of themselves when someone much stronger, much meaner, and much more vicious than them tries to break into their home.” In the real world, the chances that having a weapon in the house will translate into protecting the family from a vicious housebreaker are infinitesimal, and far, far smaller than the chances that someone in the family will wind up shot by the very same weapon. But about the background checks: The N.R.A. lobbyists hate them. And Trump has promised that as soon as he’s sworn in, he’ll “unsign” Barack Obama’s executive order closing a big loophole involving online sales and gun shows. Trump could make a really good start this month by just — not doing anything divisive. Give the country a hint that the guy who terrified so many Americans during the campaign will be more measured in office. Leave the background checks alone. We’ve been through a lot. Advertisement"

576184964,2017-02-03 15:57:21,"Sen. Jeff Sessions Blamed Culture, Not Guns, For Columbine Massacre",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2017/02/03/jeff-sessions-guns-columbine_n_14602528.html,en,False,"politics and government,united states politics and government,medicine and health,gun control,firearms",27502,HuffPost,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/#,"Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― During the Obama presidency, conservative politicians came up with a standard response to any mass shooting. Within hours of a tragedy, whether in a school at Newtown or a church in South Carolina, Republicans would issue statements saying they were praying for victims. It became so commonplace that last year, Slate published “Thoughts & Prayers: The Game” that allowed readers to offer up thoughts and prayers ― and fake empathy ― after a mass shooting. To talk about gun-control measures that may prevent mass shootings is to risk angering the National Rifle Association. To address the complex role that a mental health crisis plays in many mass shootings would require a meaningful examination of our underfunded and poorly resourced mental health system. To send thoughts and prayers is an easy way to express sympathy for victims and their families without actually having to do anything. By the end of President Barack Obama’s term, thoughts and prayers felt like a cop-out that fooled no one. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), soon to be confirmed as President Donald Trump’s attorney general, may have helped invent this grief response to mass shootings. Eight days after 12 students and one teacher were killed at Colorado’s Columbine High School in 1999, Sessions joined a chorus of conservative cultural warriors who argued that the horrifying shooting didn’t require new gun laws, but a deeper examination of Hollywood. The senator didn’t stop there. In a speech on the Senate floor, Sessions suggested that the real cause of the massacre was the faith ― or lack of faith ― of the teenage perpetrators. In a remarkable turn, he suggested maybe it was their parents’ fault, too: “As chairman the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Youth Violence, I have given an awful lot of thought to it. But I am perplexed. A few things occur to me. There is what appears to me a pattern here that would suggest how we have gotten to this point. It strikes me that an extremely small number of young people today have gotten on a very destructive path. They have headed down the road of anger and violence. They have not been acculturated with the kind of gentlemanliness and gentlewomanliness, not inculcated with religious faith and discipline, maybe a lack of values or whatever ― somehow it did not take. Maybe their parents tried. Maybe they did not.” Maybe. Maybe not. What drove Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold to commit such violence would consume law enforcement and mental health experts for years. Both Harris and Klebold were deeply troubled, and the setting of their high school for the shooting was most likely incidental. Harris was the mastermind, and was no “wayward boy who could have been rescued,” experts came to believe. Last year, Sue Klebold published a much-admired memoir about her son. She recalled that Dylan was outgoing and smart. He’d attended prom with his fellow students three days before massacring them. It was only after the shooting that Sue Klebold began to realize that her son had been severely depressed and expert in concealing it. “This wasn’t a kid we worried and prayed over, hoping he would eventually find his way and lead a productive life,” Klebold wrote. “We called him ‘The Sunshine Boy’—not just because of his halo of blond hair, but because everything seemed to come easily to him.” Klebold has become a suicide-prevention advocate. Sessions is about to become the nation’s top lawman. Most likely, he will face a mass shooting early in his tenure. If his response to Columbine is any indication, he will offer a pious remedy and launch a salvo from his side of the never-ending culture war. Sessions, unable to wait until law enforcement authorities had completed their investigation into Columbine, found his culprits: the Internet, violent video games and movies, an androgynous singer. That day on the Senate floor, he offered that the two teen killers “are alienated and angry,” then turned to his bigger, easier targets: “They are able to hook into the Internet and play video games that are extraordinarily violent, that cause the blood pressure to rise and the adrenaline level to go up, games that cause people to be killed and the players to die themselves. It is a very intense experience. They are able to get into Internet chat rooms and, if there are no nuts or people of the same mentality in their hometown, hook up with people around the country. They are able to rent from the video store ― not just go down and see “Natural Born Killers” or “The Basketball Diaries” ― but they are able to bring it home and watch it repeatedly. In this case, even maybe make their own violent film. Many have said this murder was very much akin to “The Basketball Diaries,” in which a student goes in and shoots others in the classroom. I have seen a video of that, and many others may have. In music, there is Marilyn Manson, an individual who chooses the name of a mass murderer as part of his name. The lyrics of his music are consistent with his choice of name. They are violent and nihilistic, and there are groups all over the world who do this, some German groups and others. I guess what I am saying is, a person already troubled in this modern high-tech world can be in their car and hear the music, they can be in their room and see the video, they can go into the chat rooms and act out these video games and even take it to real life. Something there is very much of a problem.” You can read Sessions’ full floor speech here. Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how."

The only surviving democracy spawned by the 2011 Arab spring, Tunisia is heavily dependent on tourism to keep its economy afloat. The six-week coroner’s inquest has thrown a harsh light on its security apparatus, with testimony that police officers slowed down on their way to the terrorist mass shooting.  Sabri Bachtobji, the foreign affairs secretary, said: “It is right that the families of English tourists know what happened that day.” He told the Guardian: “The police service was not well prepared for this kind of terrorism. This country does not have a lot of resources and ... after the revolution in 2011, so much was happening it was difficult to locate the greatest challenge. “But after the terrorist attacks of 2015, we had to change our way of thinking, change our laws, attack money laundering, change our policing and increase our co-operation. We must keep learning lessons every day, and increase co-operation. If we do not try to learn lessons, we will not improve.”Previously the country’s ambassador to Brazil, Bachtobji recalls convening an ecumenical prayer service after the deaths of 22 people in the shooting attack on the Bardo museum in Tunis in March 2015. “Bardo was catastrophic, so I got all the ambassadors from all the countries affected, as well as the ambassador of the Holy See and imam and we had a collective prayer. We prayed together, and just said we were not going to be divided.” Tunisia is on its fourth government since the revolution of 2010-11 overthrew Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali. The challenge is formidable, for many historical reasons. Tunisia has one of the highest per capita number of militant Islamists, a problem linked to widespread radicalisation among disillusioned youth, a loosening of security controls after the uprising, and a conservative Salafist strain of teaching that has reacted against democracy and freedom. The interior ministry claims more than 3,000 Tunisians are known to have travelled abroad to wage jihad. It believes 800 have already returned to the country. There have been street protests in Tunis and Germany is pressing the Tunisian government to take back its failed asylum seekers following the Christmas terrorist attack in Berlin carried out by the Tunisian Anis Amri. The Tunisian government knows it cannot deny the right of return. At the same time, the fall of the Islamic State stronghold of Sirte in neighbouring Libya led to fears that jihadis would seek to cross the relatively open border into Tunisia. A ditch to strengthen the border was built, and American-supplied drones have been deployed to monitor the movements of jihadis. Bachtobji said: “It’s not easy because of our resources but we are reforming the administration, the budget. We need greater equality in society. Above all, we need great equality between the inner parts of Tunisia where the revolution started and the coastal region. We are a very open country, a gathering place of cultures, and the historic problem is that the interior of Tunisia has never developed in the same way as the towns in the coastal areas. “The lack of development, the unemployment, led to the revolution in the inner areas, in towns such as Sidi Bouzid, and our aim in 2016-20 is to develop 50 infrastructure projects in these regions.” The scale of the imbalance is striking. A recent study by the European Council on Foreign Relations found that approximately 56% of the population and 92% of industrial companies are located within an hour’s drive of Tunisia’s three largest cities, Tunis, Sfax and Sousse. Economic activity in these three coastal cities accounts for 85% of Tunisia’s GDP, the report said. On the eve of the fall of Ben Ali, poverty was estimated at 42% in the centre andwest of the country and 36% in the north-west, whereas it was at 11% in Tunis and the centre-east. Terrorism is both holding back growth, and acting as the spur to the government to speed up economic reform, Bachtobji argues. “The terrorists, they are the enemies of civilisation, and know now that by attacking the economy they are trying to make our democracy collapse so the best response is greater solidarity, and to say it is a good time for Europeans to return to Tunisia. The more people, the more British people that return to Tunisia the better,” he said. “[Either way] there will be no going back and liberty will remain. I used never to read the newspapers in Tunisia because they were all the same. In fact, if I did read them I knew the opposite of what was written was the truth. Now they hold up a mirror to ourselves. It is not always a perfect sight, but it is the truth.” This article was amended on 23 January 2017 to correct the identity of the interviewee, Sabri Bachtobji"

657790874,2017-01-16 07:00:00,F.B.I. Arrests Wife of Killer in Orlando Mass Shooting,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/16/us/politics/noor-salman-arrested-orlando-shooting-omar-mateen.html,en,False,"terrorism,crime and criminals,murders and attempted murders",1,New York Times,http://nytimes.com,"Advertisement Supported by By Adam Goldman and Alan Blinder WASHINGTON — The F.B.I. arrested the wife of the man who carried out a deadly terrorist attack in Orlando, Fla., and charged her with obstructing the investigation of the mass shooting, law enforcement officials said on Monday. Noor Salman, whose husband, Omar Mateen, killed 49 people and wounded dozens in an Orlando nightclub that was popular with gays, was also charged with aiding and abetting by providing material support, the officials said. She was taken into custody by F.B.I. agents at her home outside San Francisco, where she had been living with her young son. Prosecutors had been weighing charges against her for months in the aftermath of the attack by her husband on June 12, 2016. Investigators interviewed Ms. Salman for hours after the attack and came to believe she was not telling the truth about her husband’s plans to carry out the rampage. A Justice Department spokesman said Ms. Salman would make her initial appearance on Tuesday morning in federal court in Oakland, Calif. The Justice Department’s decision to prosecute Ms. Salman, 30, ends part of the mystery that has surrounded her since the first days after the attack, when she became a central subject of the wide-ranging investigation into her husband. “Noor Salman had no foreknowledge nor could she predict what Omar Mateen intended to do that tragic night,” said her lawyer, Linda Moreno. “Noor has told her story of abuse at his hands. We believe it is misguided and wrong to prosecute her and that it dishonors the memories of the victims to punish an innocent person.” Accounts of what happened from officials and witnesses. The aiding and abetting, a terrorism charge, suggests that prosecutors believe that Ms. Salman helped him in some way — either before or after the terrorist attack. The decision to charge her is not without risks for prosecutors. If the case goes to trial, prosecutors will have to contend with a jury that could be sympathetic to Ms. Salman, who said she was in an abusive relationship and living in fear. In an interview last year with The New York Times, Ms. Salman said she was “unaware of everything” in connection with the attack. Ms. Salman said she had accompanied her husband to Orlando with their child once when he scouted the club but did not know the purpose of the trip. On the day her husband drove to Orlando, she claimed he said he was going to visit a friend, named Nemo, who lived in Florida. But Nemo was not living in Florida at the time, a fact Ms. Salman said she did not know. She also said she had no reason to suspect that ammunition he bought in the days leading up to the attack was to be used in the shooting, given that her husband was a security guard who frequently purchased ammunition. On the day of the shooting, she bought her husband a Father’s Day card, expecting him to return that evening. Her lawyers believe that supports her story that she did not know about the attack. During his rampage, Mr. Mateen used Facebook to pledge his allegiance to the Islamic State. President Obama has said that Mr. Mateen “took in extremist information and propaganda over the internet and became radicalized.” Federal investigators do not believe that Mr. Mateen, who was 29 and who was killed by the police after the shooting, received any specific training or support from the Islamic State. Part of their inquiry has focused on whether anyone in the United States assisted in his plans for the attack. There has perhaps been no figure more central to those questions than Ms. Salman, who grew up in an avocado-colored home in Rodeo, Calif., near San Francisco. In Rodeo, on a diverse block populated by Chinese, Indian, Korean and Mexican families, neighbors recalled a younger Ms. Salman as warm and kind. Ms. Salman married Mr. Mateen in a ceremony near her childhood home in Northern California, a second marriage for both. After the wedding, Ms. Salman moved to Fort Pierce, Fla., where she and Mr. Mateen lived in a condominium complex. Their marriage in 2011 caused consternation among some of Ms. Salman’s relatives, mostly because of her Palestinian heritage and Mr. Mateen’s ancestral ties to Afghanistan. Ms. Salman said in the interview with The Times that her husband beat her repeatedly and verbally abused her. Members of Mr. Mateen’s family, who have tried to shield Ms. Salman from public scrutiny, have said they believe she did nothing improper. “She is shocked, that poor lady,” Seddique Mateen, Mr. Mateen’s father, said in June 2016. “And she doesn’t know anything.” The Orlando police chief, John W. Mina, said in a statement that he was “glad to see” that Ms. Salman had been arrested. “Nothing can erase the pain we all feel about the senseless and brutal murders of 49 of our neighbors, friends, family members and loved ones,” the chief said. “But today, there is some relief in knowing that someone will be held accountable for that horrific crime.” In two recent mass shootings, prosecutors have brought charges against people with ties to the attackers. In South Carolina, a friend of Dylann S. Roof, who was convicted of killing nine people on June 17, 2015, in a Charleston church, pleaded guilty in April to lying to federal investigators and misprision of a felony, or failing to inform authorities that a felony had been committed. The friend did not testify against Mr. Roof, who was sentenced to death last week. In 2015, the federal authorities in California brought charges against a neighbor of the husband and wife who killed 14 people and wounded 22 others in San Bernardino. The man, who bought the rifles used in the attack on Dec. 2, 2015, was accused of lying on forms filled out in connection with the purchase. Although he was also accused of planning a terrorist attack several years ago, the man was not charged with having a direct role in the San Bernardino rampage. However, federal prosecutors in the summer of 2014 declined to prosecute Katherine Russell, the wife of one of the assailants in the Boston Marathon bombing on April 15, 2013. F.B.I. agents believed she had made false statements to investigators and concealed knowledge of a crime. Advertisement"

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Markers litter the sidewalk as FBI investigators look over the crime scene in Dallas, Texas, U.S. July 8, 2016 following a Thursday night shooting incident that killed five police officers.  REUTERS/Carlo Allegri - RTX2KE0D Lawyers for a Dallas police officer filed a federal civil suit late Tuesday against Twitter, Facebook and Google for allegedly providing “material support” to the Palestinian militant group Hamas and purportedly helping radicalize Micah Johnson, the Army veteran who killed five police officers and wounded nine others in an ambush last July. In a complaint filed in the Northern District of California, Dallas Police Sgt. Demetrick Pennie argued that the three social media platforms “knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group HAMAS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda.” “We want to hold these companies accountable for allowing terrorists to use their sites as an instrument to conduct terrorist operations,” Pennie’s lawyer, Keith Altman, told FoxNews.com. “Google, Facebook and Twitter profit from terrorist postings and create new content when they combine postings with advertisements targeted at specific viewers.” Johnson, a 25-year-old Army Reserve Afghan War veteran and Black Nationalist, carried out an “ambush-style” attack on Dallas law enforcement during a protest in Texas over the recent police-related killings of two African-American men. Johnson was eventually killed by a robot-delivered bomb. “It was unreal,” Pennie, who was good friends with two of the officers killed, told FoxNews.com. “Seeing guys shot like that, I just can’t shake it.” While he has not been linked to any foreign terror organization, Johnson did visit and like numerous websites dedicated to the Black Lives Matter movement, the Nation of Islam and the New Black Panther Party – all of whom have sympathized with the Palestinian cause. “The New Black Panther Party and other black separatist groups are directly linking themselves to Palestian groups and they are sharing this stuff on Facebook,” Pennie, who is also the president of the Dallas Fallen Officer Foundation and a 17-year law enforcement veteran, told FoxNews.com. Pennie added that any money he is awarded from the lawsuit – or a similar one he has filed against Black Lives Matter - would go directly to his foundation. The question of whether or not Hamas’ social media feeds had any influence on Johnson – either directly or indirectly – is something that the federal court will have to decide, but what is not in question is the frequency that companies like Twitter, Facebook and Google have been hit with lawsuits from survivors or families of the victims of domestic and international terror attacks. “There seems to be a spate of these cases recently and it’s probably because there have been recently a spate of these tragedies,” Matt Bartholomew, a professor at the University of Buffalo School of Law, told FoxNews.com. Hamas, along with terror groups like the Islamic State and Al Qaeda, maintain an active presence on both Facebook and Twitter as a way to recruit and radicalize followers and also rely heavily on the Google-owned YouTube to post propaganda, press releases and even executions. At the heart of Pennie’s lawsuit – and a similar one filed by the families of victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting in June – is the interpretation of a provision tucked deep inside the Communications Decency Act (CDA) of 1996 called Section 230. The language of Section 230 states that “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider."" In layman’s terms, this basically means that sites like Facebook or YouTube are not liable for what their users post on their sites. Section 230 of the CDA has protected social media sites in the past, but some lawyers and social media experts have begun to argue sites like Facebook may be violating the provision with their heavily-guarded algorithms. Despite these algorithms having come under fire before – from how Facebook curated its Trending Topics to accusations that YouTube was censoring people – these recent lawsuits allege something much more nefarious behind one of the tech world’s most secretive processes. “There are so many questions that need be answered by these social media companies,” Eric Feinberg of the cyber security and intelligence firm GIPEC told FoxNews.com. “How good are they at vetting their content? Why aren’t they sharing this information with law enforcement? They need to either fix these problems internally or hire a third party to do it for them.” Facebook and Twitter argue that they are doing everything they can to prevent terror groups from using their sites, but experts contend the companies are caught between a rock and a hard place when it comes to the issue as the web giants have voiced willingness to aid in the fight but have been less than transparent when it comes to sharing proprietary information like their algorithms. When asked to comment on this story, a representative from Twitter emailed FoxNews.com the company’s policy prohibiting the promotion of terrorism. A spokesperson from Facebook said the company is “committed to providing a service where people feel safe when using Facebook.” “Our Community Standards make clear that there is no place on Facebook for groups that engage in terrorist activity or for content that expresses support for such activity, and we take swift action to remove this content when it’s reported to us,” the spokesperson said in an email to FoxNews.com. A spokesman for Google cited a statement last month saying that Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and You Tube were coming together to curb the spread of terrorist content. This included creating a shared industry database of unique digital ""fingerprints"" related to terrorism. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg also sat down with the Dallas Police Department Monday night to discuss the role of social media and how it’s changing the dynamics of law enforcement following the mass shooting. Experts say, however, that until a judge sides with the plaintiffs in one of these cases, social media companies will not have to pay a dime, but they also warn that should the interpretation of Section 230 change, there could be a windfall of lawsuits against these companies. “We’re now seeing some of these cases all at once but until a court says under Section 230 these companies are liable then nothing will happen,” Bartholomew said. “But once there is a chink in the armor, there will be an avalanche.” Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox Subscribed You've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!

The mass shooting in Las Vegas on Sunday night has revived an issue that has divided Americans for decades: What can be done do stop such massacres? President Trump has promised to roll back gun restrictions. The most prominent gun measure currently before Congress is one that would allow people with concealed-weapon permits from one state to carry their weapons to other states. The concealed carry legislation is one of many gun measures that policy makers have debated in recent years. Backers of those ideas, whether the emphasis is gun rights or gun control, often say the intent is to make Americans safer. We've wondered whether the various ideas politicians talk about would work, and whether the public would support them. In June 2016, we asked Morning Consult, a media and polling firm, to survey two groups: some of the country’s leading experts on gun violence, and a representative sample of the American electorate. Our expert survey asked dozens of social scientists, lawyers and public health officials how effective each of 29 policies would be in reducing firearm homicide deaths, regardless of their political feasibility or cost. Policies deemed both effective and popular appear in the upper-right corner of the matrix. Less popular, less effective measures fall lower down and to the left. The two policies ranked most effective were those requiring all sellers to run background checks on anyone who buys a gun, and barring gun sales to people convicted of violent misdemeanors, including domestic assaults. The experts were more skeptical of other much-debated proposals, including a national gun registry and an assault weapons ban. The idea of requiring states to honor out-of-state concealed weapon permits was ranked low. The academics in our panel — many of the country’s best empirical researchers on gun policy — were far more likely than the general public to support gun control. But nearly all of the policies that experts think could work have widespread support from the general public. While Americans remain sharply divided in their overall view of the tension between gun control and gun rights, individual proposals are widely favored. The most popular measures in our survey — policies like universal background checks and keeping guns from convicted stalkers — were supported by more than 85 percent of registered voters. Even the least popular idea, a law that would limit gun sales to people who had to demonstrate a “genuine need” for the weapon, was favored by nearly 50 percent. “We think of guns being an incredibly controversial topic, but what your polling shows and ours has shown is there’s a whole lot of gun policies that really aren’t controversial,” said Daniel Webster, a professor and director of the Johns Hopkins center for gun policy and research. Public support, of course, doesn’t always translate into legislative action. The Republican Congress, like Mr. Trump, has shown little appetite for measures that would curb gun rights. 100% OF Americans Support Expand mental health treatment Honor out-of-state conceal and carry permits 0% OF Americans Support 100% of Americans Support Expand mental health treatment Honor out-of-state conceal and carry permits 0% of Americans Support Historically, Mr. Trump has expressed support for some of the more popular measures on our matrix. But once he entered the presidential race, he came out strongly against changes that might limit gun rights for most Americans. He has said that he supports nationalizing concealed carry permits, and that he wants to lift restrictions on carrying guns in places like schools or military bases. The concealed carry bill was one of the first introduced in the new Congress. The bill, filed by Richard Hudson, a Republican representative from North Carolina, would require states to honor out-of-state permits to carry a concealed weapon even if the standards for obtaining them differ, just as states honor driver’s licenses from other states. On our matrix, it is one of the worst-performing ideas. Our panel of experts did not think it would be effective in reducing gun homicides, though a majority of Americans said they’d support it. Mr Trump has also advocated more treatment for people with mental illness. That idea fared better among the public and the experts in our surveys. 100% OF Americans Support Universal checks for gun buyers Expand mental health treatment Bar sales to all violent criminals Assault weapons ban High-capacity magazine ban 0% of Americans Support 100% of Americans Support Universal checks for gun buyers Expand mental health treatment Bar sales to all violent criminals Assault weapons ban High-capacity magazine ban 0% of Americans Support In addition to asking experts about all firearm homicides, we asked them to rate the same set of policies according to their effectiveness in reducing mass shootings, which make up around 1 percent of gun homicide deaths. Many of their favored policies stayed the same, but a few changed. Bans on assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines, or limitations on ammunition purchases, would have a greater effect on mass shootings than on routine gun violence, according to the survey. Those rules wouldn’t necessarily reduce the number of mass shootings, the experts said, but could lower the death toll when they occur. 100% OF Americans Support Expand mental health treatment Bar sales to convicted stalkers Bar sales to all violent criminals Honor out-of-state conceal and carry permits National stand- your-ground law 0% OF Americans Support 100% OF Americans Support Bar sales to convicted stalkers Expand mental health treatment Bar sales to all violent criminals Honor out-of-state conceal and carry permits National stand- your-ground law 0% of Americans Support Most of our experts generally favor gun control policies. Only five said they oppose them, and these five rated nearly every policy option as less effective than their colleagues did. But there were still some policies they thought would reduce gun homicides, including expanded screening and treatment of mental illness, and restrictions on gun sales to people convicted of stalking. Our gun experts who were opposed to gun control tended to particularly oppose blanket policies. “The essence of a ban is it applies to everyone equally, at least theoretically,” said Gary Kleck, an emeritus professor of criminology and criminal justice at Florida State University. “But in practice, criminals, being criminals, don’t obey the law.” We also asked the National Rifle Association for its favored gun control policies and its thoughts on our results, but the group declined to comment. 100% OF Americans Support Bar sales to mentally ill Stronger sentences for illegal gun Honor out-of-state conceal and carry permits Expand mental health treatment 0% OF Americans Support 100% OF Americans Support Bar sales to mentally ill Stronger sentences for illegal guns Honor out-of-state conceal and carry permits Expand mental health treatment 0% OF Americans Support We asked the membership of two groups of law enforcement professionals to answer our survey (their responses were not combined with those of the academic experts). Just under 100 police officers and chiefs responded, representing only a small percentage of the law enforcement community. In general, the participating law enforcement professionals expressed more support than the academics for measures that would encourage the use of guns by civilians to defend themselves against crime. They gave higher ratings on stand-your-ground laws and the concealed carry measure, for example. They were far more wary than the academics of measures that involved banning categories of firearms or restricting where individuals can carry guns. Our sample mixes the two groups of law enforcement professionals, which may obscure differences among them. Previous research has shown that police chiefs tend to be more supportive of policies that restrict gun access, while rank-and-file police officers tend to favor more gun rights. In interviews, we asked some of our experts for safety ideas that weren’t included in our survey. A few pointed to strategies that wouldn’t involve new legislation or regulation, particularly for gang-related gun homicides, which are far more common than mass shootings. Studies have shown that a few programs that focus on community outreach can reduce gun violence in cities. Expanding such programs wouldn’t require new laws, just more funding. There were also some policies that we didn’t ask about. We didn’t ask about a ban on all handguns, which Washington, D.C., and Chicago have tried. Nor did we ask about barring gun sales to people with a history of alcohol-related offenses, like D.U.I.s. We didn’t ask about lifting restrictions on carrying guns on military bases or near schools, which Mr. Trump has endorsed. And we didn’t ask about a measure, recently passed in a few states, that would allow law enforcement officials or family members to seek a kind of restraining order from a judge to temporarily confiscate guns from a person who appears to be in crisis. To build a list of possible policies, we consulted the academic literature on laws from American states and foreign countries and spoke with advocates for gun rights and gun control. Both surveys were conducted in June of last year. For our measure of popularity, Morning Consult conducted an internet survey of 1,975 voters, who were asked whether they approved of the possible laws. For our effectiveness survey, we asked experts in gun policy to evaluate each idea on a scale of 1 to 10, according to how effective they thought it would be in reducing fatalities. We asked the experts to ignore considerations of political or legal feasibility. Our expert panel consisted of 32 current or retired academics in criminology, public health and law, who have published extensively in peer-reviewed academic journals on gun policy. We know our sample is small and may not include every expert that readers would like consulted. But we feel it represents a useful, if imperfect, measure of what people steeped in the research think might save lives. The panel of academics included: Cathy Barber, Magdalena Cerdá, Jay Corzine, John Donohue, Laura Dugan, Liza H. Gold, David Hemenway, David Kennedy, Louis Klarevas, Gary Kleck, David Kopel, Tomislav Kovandzic, Adam Lankford, John Lott, Jonathan Metzl, Matthew Miller, Carlisle E. Moody, Andrew Papachristos, Charles Ransford, Peter Reuter, Mark Rosenberg, Robert J. Sampson, Michael Siegel, Gary Slutkin, Robert Spitzer, Stephen P. Teret, George E. Tita, Eugene Volokh, Daniel Webster, April Zeoli and others. Special thanks to the Fraternal Order of Police and the Major Cities Chiefs Association for distributing the survey to their membership.

The assaults, carried out over a three-week period beginning in December, were a stark reminder of Turkey’s dangerous proximity to the war next door in Syria, and the ways in which that conflict has steadily consumed Turkish domestic and foreign affairs. Kurdish separatists attacked the Istanbul stadium, while the Islamic State asserted responsibility for the nightclub massacre, warning Turkey against military action in Syria. In Ankara, a police officer invoking the carnage in the Syrian city of Aleppo — but apparently working alone — gunned down the Russian ambassador on Dec. 19. The turmoil in Syria has deepened Turkey’s political and social fault lines, brought violence to its cities and isolated it from traditional allies. Turkish troops are fighting and dying in battles with the Islamic State in Syria, and its relations with a number of countries, including the United States, are noticeably strained. “Any efforts to address the conflict in Syria will boomerang back into Turkey’s domestic politics,” said Aaron Stein, senior resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East. Turkey shares a 500-mile-long border with Syria. But the absence of any political solution “means we’re in for more cycles of violence,” he said, adding that “Turkey has no answers” for how to solve the myriad conflicts at home or in the region. [How the Syrian revolt went so horribly, tragically wrong] Turkey was one of the first countries affected by the Syrian conflict, taking in nearly 3 million refugees and leading calls for an international safe zone for civilians. Turkey initially urged President Bashar al-Assad to refrain from cracking down on peaceful protests in 2011. But Assad’s heavy-handed response to the demonstrations prompted Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was prime minister at the time, to cut ties with the regime, and he soon threw his weight behind the Syrian opposition. His decision further polarized Turkey, with his Sunni Muslim base rallying to the cause of the rebellion. His left-wing opponents objected to what they said was an adventurist foreign policy and called on Erdogan and his ruling Justice and Development Party to halt support for Syria’s Islamist rebels. “Our position on Bashar al-Assad is clear: We don’t believe that a united and peaceful Syria is possible with him,” said a Turkish official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss government matters. But years later, Assad is still in power and Turkey is a regional outlier, spurned for its bullish diplomacy and alleged support for Syrian Islamic militants — a claim Turkish officials have strongly denied. “The war in Syria has become Turkey’s greatest foreign policy challenge since the end of the Cold War,” said Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “As a result of its failed attempt to oust the Assad regime, Ankara has the distinction of being hated by all major parties in the Syrian conflict, from the Kurds to [the Islamic State] to the Assad regime.” [Slain partyers came to Istanbul from near and far to celebrate the New Year] In an attempt to break its isolation, Turkey has recently softened its rhetoric on Syria, and is now partnered with Russia — Assad’s ally — to restart peace talks and maintain a cease-fire. “Turkey, in cooperation with Russia, brokered the evacuation of eastern Aleppo and a cease-fire in Syria,” the Turkish official said. The planned peace talks, which will be held in the Kazakh capital, Astana, “are intended to make progress toward a political solution in the country,” the official said. “Turkey will attend the talks as a guarantor.” But in a rare public admission, Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus told the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet Daily News that Turkey should “correct its mistakes in Syria.” “I am one of those who believes our policy on Syria made big mistakes,” Kurtulmus said in the interview this month. While Turkey has pledged to roll back some of its more hard-line policies, its relations with the United States remain fraught with tension over Syria. Turkey has openly opposed U.S. cooperation with Syrian-Kurdish militias in the fight against the Islamic State. The Syrian-Kurdish People’s Protection Units, or YPG, have carved out territory in northern Syria for a future Kurdish state, alarming Turkey, which is worried about the aspirations of its own Kurdish population. Turkish officials say the YPG is indistinguishable from the Kurdish groups launching attacks inside Turkey, and to which security forces have responded with a devastating crackdown. The United States says the YPG is the most effective fighting force against the Islamist militants. “We are your NATO ally,” Erdogan said, addressing the United States in a speech last month. “How on earth can you support terrorist organizations and not us?” [U.S. military aid is fueling big ambitions for Syria’s leftist Kurdish militia] Turkey and the United States are NATO allies and strategic partners, the Turkish official said, but there are two sticking points. First, the two countries disagree over the extradition of Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen to Turkey, where he is suspected of having masterminded a failed coup attempt last summer. “The second issue is Washington’s support for YPG, the PKK’s Syrian franchise,” the official said. The PKK, or Kurdistan Workers’ Party, has been locked in a decades-long conflict with Turkey and has recently stepped up its attacks. The shaky relations with the United States will probably force Turkey “to transition to a new model of security,” said Selim Koru, analyst at the Economic Policy Research Foundation of Turkey, an Ankara-based think tank. “Such a transition cannot be smooth.” Turkey’s security has for decades been anchored in its alliance with NATO. But today, Turkey’s military, which helped the country weather previous national crises “is weakening,” Cagaptay said. In the failed coup last summer, a faction in the military “tried to overthrow Erdogan, suggesting that even the military cannot be trusted as a unifying national institution in the current crisis,” he said. In August, Turkish troops launched an offensive on the Islamic State-held town of Jarabulus in Syria. That offensive, named Operation Euphrates Shield, was backed by the United States. But Turkey has since moved unilaterally to battle the Islamic militants in the border town of al-Bab, where Turkish troops have met stiff resistance and scores of soldiers have been killed. Turkey’s occupation of al-Bab would break the Islamic State presence on Turkey’s border but would also cut through territory claimed by Syrian Kurds. “Operation Euphrates Shield is a milestone in [Turkey’s] foreign policy,” Koru said, adding that Turkey has only rarely occupied and held territory on its own. But in al-Bab, “my understanding is that [the Islamic State] was better prepared for Turkish tanks than planners in Ankara expected,” he said.

Families who lost relatives hope the inquiry, resuming on Monday, will uncover whether more could have been done to prevent the tragedy on the beach outside the Imperial Marhaba hotel in Sousse on 26 June 2015.  Hundreds of tourists were sunbathing in 30C heat when jihadi Seifeddine Rezgui opened fire with a Kalashnikov assault rifle, killing 38 tourists, 30 of whom were British, in arampage that lasted nearly 40 minutes. Rezgui was shot dead by Tunisian authorities as he ran from the hotel. The attack came three months after Islamist militants attacked the Bardo National Museum in the Tunisian capital city of Tunis. They killed 21 people – mostly European tourists – on the spot, and another victim died 10 days later. Travel company Tui, which owns Thomson holidays, through which all 30 of the Britons booked their trip, is expected to come under significant scrutiny over its handling of travel advice for Tunisia from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Lawyers representing families of 20 of the deceased Britons are to accuse Tui of “practically hiding and keeping out of the limelight” FCO warnings about terrorism in Tunisia, according to papers submitted in advance of the resumption of inquests. The travel firm, which in the year to September made an underlying profit of €1bn (£866m), is also said to have sold customers travel insurance that excluded cancellation cover caused by terrorism risks. Before the Sousse attack, Tui is said in submissions by the families to have discouraged cancellation by penalising customers up to the full cost of their booked holidays if they chose to cancel as a result of learning of terrorist activities or risks. Tui is to argue that the measures it had in place at the time for forwarding travel advice were appropriate but the Sousse attack changed the climate and they responded accordingly. The coroner, Nicholas Loraine-Smith, is to hear evidence on these issues, as well as details on the events of the day, the security in the hotel and Rezgui’s background. Andrew Ritchie QC, who has been appointed by Irwin Mitchell to represent 20 families at the inquests, said: “These inquests will seek to answer important questions for the families, in particular: how their loved ones came to be exposed to terrorism at the five-star hotel; whether Tui communicated Foreign and Commonwealth Office terrorism warnings to their customers before or after bookings; the security arrangements – if any – in place at the Imperial Hotel; and whether the holiday insurance sold by Tui to customers covered terrorism. “The families seek the truth and respect the coronial system and the hard work put into the preparation of the evidence by the UK police. They wish to see a better warning system in place to prevent future deaths and so that holidaymakers can make better-informed decisions when purchasing holidays abroad.” Some evidence may be considered behind closed doors due to its sensitivity in preventing future terrorist attacks, following an application by the FCO. Rezgui was a 23-year-old electrical engineering student at the University of Kairouan, from Gaafour in north-west Tunisia. It emerged he had received military training in Libya. Some of his associates went on to launch the Bardo Museum attack. The ringleader behind the Sousse and Bardo attack – and Rezgui’s recruiter – was identified by a BBC Panorama investigation broadcast on Tuesday as Chamseddine al-Sandi. Panorama said Sandi was believed to be on the run in Libya. The Guardian has not been able to verify his role. Two weeks after the Sousse attack, the FCO altered its travel advice to advise against all travel to four areas of Tunisia and advise against all but essential travel to the rest of the country. This advice remains in place. Tourism in Tunisia, which had accounted for 8% in gross domestic product – a broad measure for the size of a country’s economy – has suffered considerably since the attacks. According to the Tunisian ministry of tourism, tourist receipts plunged 50% year-on-year in 2016, while the number of border arrivals was down 18%. A Tui spokeswoman said: “Tui UK is taking a full and active role in the inquests into the deaths of the 30 British nationals killed during the terrorist attack in Sousse, Tunisia in June 2015. “Like others, we want to understand the specific circumstances that led to this atrocity. We are cooperating with the coroner and will continue to do so, in order to help ensure that the tragic deaths of those killed can be thoroughly investigated, the relevant facts determined and any lessons learned. With the inquests about to be heard, we consider that it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.”"

The shooting, which was quickly labeled an act of terrorism, left six people dead and numerous others wounded. Alexandre Bissonnette was charged with six counts of murder and five counts of attempted murder, according to officials. The Sûreté du Québec, the Quebec provincial police, said two men were arrested Sunday night, though authorities said Monday that only one of the men is now a suspect in the mass shooting at the Quebec Islamic Cultural Center. Police provided no possible motive as they began their investigation of the attack in one of Canada’s safest cities. But government officials wasted no time in calling it terrorism. “This was a group of innocents targeted for practicing their faith,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in an address at the House of Commons, hours after condemning the attack in a statement. “Make no mistake: This was a terrorist attack.” “These were people of faith and of community,” Trudeau added, “and in the blink of an eye, they were robbed of their lives in an act of brutal violence.” Five victims remained hospitalized Monday morning, hospital officials said, noting that 14 others had been treated and released from area hospitals. Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard also called the shooting a “terrorist act,” saying at an overnight news conference that he reacted with “horror and incredulity” when he learned about the attack. He promised increased police protection for mosques and Islamic centers across the province of Quebec. “We are with you,” Couillard said, addressing the province’s Muslim community. “You are at home. You are Quebecois.” Quebec mosque saw itself ‘in harmony’ with Canadian society At a subsequent news conference with Muslim leaders, Couillard said he could not theorize why members of the mosque were gunned down — but he acknowledged that they were the targets. “This community was targeted, that’s true,” he told reporters. “The individuals who were attacked were attacked because they were part of this community.” But, he added: “All Quebecers have been the victims of this attack.” While mosques in Canada and the United States have been the targets of numerous acts of vandalism and other hate crimes in recent years, the Quebec City attack appears to be one of the first mass shootings at an Islamic house of worship in North America. Witnesses said a gunman in a hood or ski mask opened fire on congregants at the mosque shortly before 8 p.m. Police said the six people killed were between 35 and 60 years old, all men. Mosque officials said the victims were all Canadian citizens, and included men of Tunisian, Moroccan and Algerian descent. One man was arrested close to the mosque, according to police. ‘It will be a bloodbath’: Inside the Kansas militia plot to ignite a religious war A second man called 911 about 20 minutes later, police said, and told a dispatcher that he wanted to talk. That person gave the dispatcher his location and waited for police about 14 miles east of the mosque along the shore of the St. Lawrence River on the approach to a bridge leading to the Island of Orleans. He surrendered without incident and has been cooperating with investigators, police said. Authorities have not publicly identified either of the two men who were arrested — and police said midday Monday that one of them is now considered a witness, not a suspect. Authorities have not described the ethnicity or religious identity of the perpetrator. Neither of the two men who were detained was previously known to police, authorities said. Charges are still being sorted out, police said at the news conference Monday morning. Authorities did not provide information about the type of firearms used in the attack. Mohamed Belkhadir, a 29-year-old man who had been identified by local news sources first as a suspect and then merely as a witness, told La Presse that he was at the scene of the shooting Sunday night trying to help a friend who had been injured when he saw someone with a firearm. He said he assumed it was a gunman returning to shoot more people so he ran away. But it was a police officer, and Belkhadir was arrested when he fled from the area, he said. “I understand; I respect that they caught me,” Belkhadir told the Canadian newspaper, in French. “They saw me flee. They thought I was suspicious. That’s normal. For them, someone who flees is a suspect.” Bissonnette, the suspect, was charged early Monday evening. The long history of terror and violence in Canada Officials at the mosque urged followers not to spread rumors about Sunday’s mass shooting. Still, the context of the attack was inescapable, coming after a rise in anti-Muslim rhetoric, behavior and vandalism in the United States and Canada, amid a heated debate about President Trump’s executive order temporarily shutting U.S. borders to refugees and migrants from seven mostly Muslim countries. While debate has raged in the United States over whether to accept refugees from war-torn Syria and elsewhere, the Canadian government has become more open to people fleeing conflict in the Middle East. Trudeau has personally greeted some refugees who have entered the country, and on Sunday said he welcomed people who were rejected from the United States under Trump’s order. Ahmed Hussen, Canada’s minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship, announced Sunday that he would grant temporary residence permits to people there who were affected by Trump’s travel ban. “Canada is a country of immigrants,” Hussen said, according to the Globe and Mail. “Canadians are proud of our long history of acting with compassion and humanitarianism to those seeking refuge for themselves and their families.” Trudeau called Canada’s diversity “our strength,” and noted that “religious tolerance is a value that we, as Canadians, hold dear.” Still, Muslims in both Canada and the United States have reported a surging number of hate crimes in recent years, including vandalism, assault and arson at their places of worship. The Quebec Islamic Cultural Center, one of several mosques in the area, was the target of an apparent hate crime in June, when someone left a bloody pig’s head wrapped in cellophane at the front door, along with a note reading, “Bonne appétit.” The consumption of pork is banned by Islam. Concerned about that kind of incident, the mosque installed several closed-circuit cameras around the building. “All our thoughts are with the children, whom we must tell about the death of their fathers,” the mosque said Sunday on its Facebook page. “May Allah give them patience and endurance.” Through tears, Mohamed Labibi of the Quebec Islamic Cultural Center called the mass shooting a “very, very big tragedy,” and pleaded with reporters to “personify” those who had lost their lives — businessmen, shopkeepers and a university professor, though he did not name them. “We cannot express our sadness,” he said. The president of Laval University confirmed Monday afternoon that Khaled Belkacemi, a professor at the school of agriculture and food sciences, was among the dead. There are more than 1 million Muslims in Canada. About 6,000 live in Quebec City, according to Canada’s 2011 National Household Survey. Addressing the nation’s Muslims, Trudeau said in his televised House of Commons speech: “I want to say directly: We are with you. Thirty-six million hearts are breaking with yours. And know that we value you. You enrich our country in immeasurable ways. It is your home. “Last night’s horrible crime against the Muslim community was an act of terror committed against Canada and against all Canadians. We will grieve with you, we will defend you, we will love you and we will stand with you.” Interim Conservative Leader Rona Ambrose called the attack “a sad reminder that our country is not immune to terrorism” and said it violated one of the country’s most cherished freedoms: “to worship without fear.” Imam Sikander Hashmi, of Ottawa, said there has been a rise in the number of reported anti-Muslim hate crimes in Canada, which the National Council of Canadian Muslims has documented. “Unfortunately,” Hashmi said in an interview with The Washington Post, “it has come to this — to what we saw last night.” The imam, who said he grew up in Canada, said the idea that an attack such as this could occur in Canada has crossed his mind, but the chances seemed slim to him. In recent years, however, he said Muslims in Canada have been paying close attention to the political climate both in Canada and the United States. Specifically, he said, many were concerned about Quebec’s proposed “Charter of Values” bill that would have prohibited government employees from wearing religious symbols, such as head coverings. He said Muslims in Canada watched the U.S. presidential campaign, Trump’s inauguration and the controversial executive orders that the president pushed during his first few days in office. “Muslims — we live in a global village,” Hashmi said. The imam said that although he cannot say whether there is a link between the current political climate and the attack Sunday night in Quebec City, many Muslims might make that connection. “Canadians and people around the world won’t be seeing this in isolation,” he said. “They’ll be seeing it in this context.” But, he said, the Muslim community will stand firm. “We’re going to get through this together, and stand against anyone who tries to spread hatred and fear,” Hashmi said. Couillard, the Quebec premier, told reporters: “We are obviously in a world where people tend to divide themselves rather than unite themselves. This is why our country … has to remain a beacon, a landmark of tolerance and openness in this troubled world.” Police said a joint task force of terrorist specialists from the Quebec provincial police, the City of Montreal Police and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police was deployed to the site, with explosives experts and canine teams among them. The Quebec Islamic Cultural Center is located near Laval University, which has a large community of international students, many from French-speaking Africa and the Maghreb. The mass shooting was a particular shock for Quebec City, a quiet white-collar community that has one of the lowest violent crime rates in Canada. The city, whose metropolitan area is home to about 806,000 people, reported just two killings in all of 2015. Samer Majzoub, the president of the Canadian Muslim Forum, a Muslim advocacy group in Quebec, said that he knows people who attend the Quebec City mosque, but that he and other area Muslim leaders were still trying frantically to find out who had been shot. “People that we know, we are not sure if they’re alive right now,” he told The Post. “It is shocking. It never came to our mind that we’d have a terrorist act as such, especially in Canada.” “This act of wanton murder must be punished to the fullest extent of the law,” Ihsaan Gardee, director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims, said in a statement. “We are heartened by the overwhelming support from fellow Canadians in this time of deep crisis,” he added. “We must unite together against divisive forces that seek to harm our communities.” Majzoub, Canadian Muslim Forum president, said Canada has seen increasing anti-Muslim hostility over the past year, but still nowhere near the level witnessed in the United States and Europe. He said the area near the mosque has appeared to be particularly prone to anti-Muslim sentiments. “This masjid has witnessed a lot of issues before — threats and vandalism, and some Islamophobic graffiti,” he said, using the Arabic word for mosque. “It’s not the first time.” Majzoub said the mosque has a small congregation of about a hundred people and attracts a lot of students because it’s near a university. He said many of its attendees are of North African descent. “We never thought it could happen,” he said. “It was a slaughter.” Trump called Trudeau to express his condolences, according to the prime minister’s office — the first condolence call Trump has made for a terror attack since taking office on Jan. 20. In an afternoon news briefing, White House spokesman Sean Spicer confirmed that the president had offered his support to the Canadian prime minister. “This is another senseless act of violence that can not be tolerated,” Spicer told reporters. Spicer called the attack “a terrible reminder of why we must remain vigilant, and why the president is taking steps to be proactive rather than reactive when it comes to our nation’s safety and security.” Russian President Vladimir Putin offered his condolences, as well, sending a telegram to Trudeau. “This murder of people who had gathered at a mosque to pray is staggering in its cruelty and cynicism,” Putin said, according to the Kremlin. French President François Hollande denounced the attack, and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo announced Monday that the lights on the Eiffel Tower will be turned off to send a message of solidarity. Pope Francis met Monday with Quebec Archbishop Cardinal Gerald Cyprien Lacroix and said he was praying for the victims and their families, explaining “the importance of remaining united in prayer, Christians and Muslims,” according to the Vatican. Said Couillard, the premier: “Today if you see someone from the Islam community, stop and say hello.” Bever and Hawkins reported from Washington. Marissa Miller in Quebec City, David Filipov in Moscow and Ben Guarino, Abigail Hauslohner and Bastien Inzaurralde in Washington contributed to this report, which has been updated numerous times.

This time, five people were killed and six others injured, some grievously. This time, those senselessly gunned down were picking up their luggage before going to board cruise ships for eagerly anticipated vacations. This time, once again, the all-too-easy availability of firearms allowed a gun to get into the hands of the wrong person. Esteban Santiago, a 26-year-old Iraq War veteran who has been described by family members and authorities as having mental-health issues, made his first court appearance Monday on federal charges stemming from Friday’s shooting rampage in the baggage-claim area of the Fort Lauderdale airport. Investigation is continuing as authorities try to sort out what prompted him to travel, a semiautomatic legally checked in his luggage, from Alaska to Florida, and whether terrorism was a motive. Prior to Friday’s rampage, Mr. Santiago had shown signs of violence and what authorities characterized as “erratic behavior.” There had been frequent run-ins with law enforcement, allegations of domestic violence and a visit in November to the Anchorage FBI office in which he made disturbing remarks about his mind being controlled by a U.S. intelligence agency. Local authorities were contacted, and he was transported to a local mental-health facility for evaluation. A gun, the same one authorities say was used in the airport shooting, was taken for “safekeeping” but returned to him a month later because there was no legal justification to withhold it. There is, of course, no way of knowing whether the attack could have been prevented. But there are obvious questions that need to be addressed. What kind of mental-health treatment was offered to Mr. Santiago? Was there a failure of the system? Could the family have taken action? Was the FBI response adequate? And, given this is the third instance in which an alleged mass killer had previously come to the attention of the agency, is a review of their threat assessments in order? We also can’t help wondering what the outcome might have been had Mr. Santiago’s family and law enforcement authorities had the benefit of laws that allow the removal of guns from people who have been deemed to be a high risk. Four states — California, Connecticut, Indiana and, most recently, Washington — allow law enforcement and family members to petition a court for a protective order to temporarily suspend a person’s access to guns if the person poses a danger to himself or others. Studies show promising results, particularly in preventing suicides, and there have been no reports of misuse. It is a common-sense measure that other states should adopt. Unfortunately, there seems to be a push in statehouses across the country to go in the opposite direction by loosening, not tightening, what controls do exist. Florida, the scene of two recent mass shootings, is considering changes that would eliminate gun-free zones in schools, colleges — and, yes, airports. As if more guns would have helped Friday when five people were killed in some 80 seconds.

568831100,2017-01-18 09:36:21,"I taught those special snowflake millennials, and I have something to say",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/parenting/wp/2017/01/18/i-taught-those-special-snowflake-millennials-and-i-have-something-to-say/,en,False,"education and schools,colleges and universities",2,Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,"This article is more than 1 year old There was a popular myth post-election that a Yale professor had offered an optional midterm for students upset over Trump’s victory, and it lit up social media quickly. I counted about a dozen Facebook shares from friends on both sides of the political aisle. Comments typed fast and furious spoke of this snowflake generation, these spoiled, entitled babies who were raised so dreadfully and coddled by their parents. More than once I read, “This is what happens when you give everyone a trophy!” That the truth behind the rumors revealed an entirely opposite story made no difference: This was another opportunity to make fun of those insufferable millennials and their need for safe spaces. My students aren’t snowflakes, and they don’t melt I am a work-at-home parent now, but before I gave birth to my children, I taught hundreds of millennials, this supposed generation of special snowflakes. I myself was raised in an upper-middle-class home with two parents. I went to summer camps, I went to college, and while there were some difficult times, I was sheltered from the realities that so many of my students lived with on a daily basis. Issues ranging from neglect, abuse, hunger, deportation worries, and parents struggling with addictions. But while my students were weighed down by matters I thought only existed in novels, they got themselves to school every day and worked hard. During my second year of teaching, I sat in my third-period class with two-dozen millennials as we watched the twin towers fall. The following year, my students zigged and zagged each morning as they hurried toward the safe haven of the school building to avoid being gunned down by the Beltway sniper. They did not hide in their rooms under the covers, but instead they persevered. This generation has never attended school without the dark cloud of school shootings hanging over their heads. Whether it would be fear of fellow students or fear of outsider attackers, these millennials went to school knowing that it was a place where someone might do them harm. When I was young, the mass shooting in a Luby’s restaurant in Texas made international news and shocked the nation. For millennials, a similar event might last only a day or so on CNN. This is the reality of the world in which they came of age: Their classrooms and their dorm rooms are potential targets of gun violence. As long as this allegedly-coddled generation can remember, our country has been embroiled in military conflicts. A good number of them are veterans themselves, with wounds both visible and invisible. These millennials who are mocked for being self-absorbed are the ones putting their lives at risk for the security of this country. When I attended college, the Internet was in its infancy, so rumors and gossip were spread the old-fashioned way, through word-of-mouth. If a girl had too much to drink at a party and flashed a crowd of people, the worst that might happen would be someone taking a poorly lit photo. Even then, the negatives could be destroyed. Should the same incident occur at any university today, a high-resolution photo could be mass-distributed within seconds. One error in judgment could mean permanent damage to any one of these millennials. My children have these supposedly-entitled millennials as their teachers and caregivers. These millennials work with me to make my children feel safe. They model empathy and patience daily as they educate my children. This world in which my children are growing up with all of its uncertainties is the world in which these millennials were raised. They understand much that I do not, and I rely on them for their invaluable contributions. That these young people continue to not only show up but to thrive in spite of all that they have seen and endured is a testament to their character and strength of spirit. I cannot attempt to quantify the suffering of the previous generations. That people walk among us with numbers tattooed on their arms by Nazis, that children woke up during the early 1950s wondering if their legs would still work because so many of their classmates had fallen sick with polio might give one the impression that the millennial generation need not complain. But instead of drawing comparisons that will inevitably fall short — none of us lived through the bubonic plague, if you really want to compare suffering — the generations that have come before the millennials might consider exercising some perspective. Thanks to this age of information, not only is every foolish thought or action of a millennial prone to immortalization via social media, but the overabundance of commentary available means a constant stream of criticism directed at this generation. The suggested searches on Google when one types the phrase, “Why are millennials so” are “lazy, weak, selfish, and immature.” In contrast, Generation X is simply expensive, and my parents’ generation is referred to as “the Greatest Generation.” I’d like to revisit the idea of participation trophies for this generation. Setting aside the fact that they had zero responsibility in that phenomenom anyway (their parents created it), I think that millennials deserve an outward symbol of all they have survived and that we have put them through. While all other generations have also experienced tragedies, this generation has done what no other generation has had to do, which is live each day as if someone is always watching, waiting, and criticizing. Moving through this life with grace isn’t easy. Perhaps if we all had a small statuette on our nightstands to remind us of our unique worth, it might help. Nothing outlandish or expensive, just a small reminder that there is no one else like us nor will there be. Kind of like a snowflake, come to think of it.

Bush, had just stumbled into a mass shooting at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. Authorities say 26-year-old Esteban Santiago pulled a gun from his bag and opened fire in a baggage claim area. Five people were killed and six were injured by his bullets, investigators said, with dozens more injured in the chaotic scramble to escape. Suspect in Fort Lauderdale shooting ‘lost his mind’ in Iraq, family says Around the same time, Fleischer had just gotten off a flight from New York. He only had a carry-on bag, but was headed down to baggage claim to meet a driver. He says nature’s call may have saved his life. “Just as I was leaving the bathroom, I heard tap-tap-tap, tap-tap, tap. Multiple gunshots ringing out,” he told The Washington Post. “And there was a small group of guys, we all stopped at the opening leading out to the area right above the escalator. We all realized it was gunfire and it was coming from the level below us at the escalator.” “… I would have been in the middle of it. It was right below me.” Fleischer and the other men didn’t think they were out of danger yet. In fact, they were near one of the worst places for an active shooter situation — a bathroom with only one way out. If the gunman came up the escalator, they could be trapped. The area between the bathroom and an airport exit appeared clear. Fleischer said he told the group “‘that’s where we all need to go. …And that way you can be out on the street and have multiple choices of which way to go.” So he and the other men dashed across the open area. Abandoned luggage was strewn about. People were running away from the gunfire or huddled in a doorway. Fleischer had a view of the lower level, where the gunshots came from. “There was a trail of blood,” he said. “You could follow the path of it,” he said. “I looked down and I could see one of the victims and he was bleeding profusely.” Fleischer passed two police officers who were discussing details of the shooting: one shooter, five dead. We’ve had a massive decline in gun violence in the United States. Here’s why. Around that time, Fleischer whipped out his phone and fired off three tweets over 24 minutes. He made contact with his driver, but the man was one of the witnesses being interviewed by police. So Fleischer left the terminal and tried to find a cab or another way out of the airport. Charleston church shooter: ‘I would like to make it crystal clear, I do not regret what I did’ He fired off more tweets before a reporter from the Daily Beast approached him and gave him a ride to his meeting. Fleischer worked for the Bush administrations from 2001 until 2003. He was Bush’s spokesman during the Florida recount in 2000 and the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. He told The Post he was fine after Friday’s near miss, although after he was safe, there was a reminder of how close he was to danger. “A young father with two toddlers came up to me and said he was walking right behind me earlier and he saw me veer off to go to the bathroom,” Fleischer said. “He went down the escalator and he got halfway down when he heard the shots. He said he grabbed his two toddlers under both his arms, turned around and ran up the down escalator. I had been 5 to 10 seconds in front of him before I veered off.” This post has been updated.

A Syrian woman who landed in Chicago to visit her cancer-stricken mother was forced to turn around and fly back. An Iraq-born doctor coming home to California was held nine hours before reuniting with her husband. After President Trump signed a sprawling executive order Friday, closing the borders to refugees and other travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries, such stories surfaced at airports across the country. It’s still unclear how many people were detained or sent away this weekend, though estimates peak at about 375. According to a senior Department of Homeland Security official, about 109 travelers were denied entry to the U.S. and 173 were not allowed to board planes to the country. After protests erupted around the country over the weekend in opposition to Trump's order, the president clarified his intent in an early Monday tweet: He wanted to block what he referred to as bad “dudes.” In the U.S., “dudes” colloquially refers to men. The Trump administration would not respond to requests for additional information, but the president has previously specified men when speaking about “extreme vetting.” “You look at the migration, it’s young, strong men,” Trump told Yahoo News last year. “We cannot take a chance that the people coming over here are going to be ISIS-affiliated.” While it’s true men carry out the majority of mass murders and terrorist attacks, Trump’s measure could largely affect women and children. Of the roughly 4.9 million registered Syrian refugees, for example — people who are indefinitely banned from entering the U.S., under Trump’s order — just 25.6 percent [that's about proportional to their numbers in the general population] are men between the ages of 18 and 59, according to United Nations data. (A federal judge blocked part of the order Saturday night, asserting refugees held at airports in the U.S. cannot be pushed back to their home countries.) Among all immigrants to the U.S., 37.5 percent were men between the ages of 15 and 59 in 2015, according to the Migration Policy Institute. Women and girls make up the majority — about 51 percent. The order places a 120-day ban on refugees from countries other than Syria from resettling in the U.S. Citizens of Iraq, Iran, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya and Yemen, meanwhile, are also prohibited from entering the country, regardless of visa status, for 90 days. A July report on the experiences of 90 Libyan refugees from Amnesty International, a human rights group, found that girls and women in conflict zones faced a heightened risk of sexual violence. “Many said rape was so commonplace that they took contraceptive pills before traveling to avoid becoming pregnant as a result of it,” the authors wrote. Since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, 12 Islamic militant attackers have committed murder on American soil, said David Sterman, a security policy analyst at New American, a left-leaning Washington think tank. The gender breakdown: 11 men and one woman (Tashfeen Malik, who carried out the 2015 San Bernadino, Calif., mass shooting with her husband.) “None emigrated or came from families that emigrated from countries covered by the ban,” Sterman added.

There, he pulled bullets and a 9 mm pistol from his baggage, loaded the weapon and returned to fire randomly at his fellow travelers, authorities said Friday. A minute later, they said, he had killed five people, injured six and raised questions about how a person bent on harming people could legally fly across the country with a gun, then use it to attack unsuspecting passengers. The answer: very easily. The Transportation Security Administration allows passengers to carry guns and ammunition in their checked luggage, provided they follow the rules. Suspect in Fort Lauderdale shooting ‘lost his mind’ in Iraq, family says The gun has to be locked in a hard-sided case. Usually, there’s a form to fill out. The gun can’t be loaded, but the rules allow passengers to also carry ammunition, sometimes in the same case. The TSA has a helpful video with cheery music detailing the process. Santiago, an Army veteran from Alaska who complained that the government was controlling his mind, was arrested following the mass shooting and remained jailed Saturday in Broward County, Fla. Under Florida law, people can’t carry guns in airport terminals unless they’re still in the case, although a bill before the legislature would allow people to openly carry guns in public places, including airports. Passengers routinely check their weapons at the Ted Stevens International Airport in Anchorage, where Santiago initially departed from, Jesse Davis, the chief of police, told The Washington Post. “We’re a big hunting state, so we get quite a lot of that,” he said, adding that for Santiago’s check-in procedure, “everything appeared normal.” Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), whose district includes the airport where the mass shooting occurred, said she plans to revisit rules for flying with firearms when she returns to Washington this week. “While we take a look at balancing the public’s need to be able to freely travel, at the same time we need to protect the traveling public who is traveling alongside someone who may decide to do them harm,” she said. “Federal rules do allow for firearms to be carried in checked baggage not in carry on baggage and there were procedures that were followed in this case.” She said that she also plans to examine policies on unsecured areas in airports and other places frequented by the traveling public. “We need to take a hard look at the security around baggage claim areas.” Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer was nearly caught in shooting According to the TSA, guns are allowed in checked baggage, but lighters shaped like guns aren’t. Also prohibited in checked bags: many aerosol cans, electronic cigarettes, liquid bleach, recreational oxygen, safety matches and most spillable batteries. While carrying guns in checked baggage in generally allowed, passengers who attempt to carry firearms into the seating areas of planes can face stiff penalties and prison time. That doesn’t stop many people from attempting to tote guns onto airplanes anyway. In 2015, TSA officers discovered a record 2,653 guns in carry-on bags at airport security checkpoints, a 20 percent jump from 2014. Numbers for 2016 aren’t available yet, but in one week last year, officers discovered a record 78 guns in carry-on bags, according to the TSA’s blog. Sixty-eight were loaded.

1036004340,2017-01-08 00:00:00,"After Fort Lauderdale Shooting, Rumor of Second Gunman Created Chaos - The New York Times",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/08/us/fort-lauderdale-airport-shooting-rumor-second-gunman.html,en,False,"terrorism,crime and criminals,airlines and airplanes,murders and attempted murders",1,New York Times,http://nytimes.com,"Advertisement Supported by By Lizette Alvarez MIAMI — By the time Donald Robertson, a retired architect, arrived at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport’s Terminal 1 on Friday afternoon, the mass shooting in Terminal 2, which left five people dead, had been over for at least an hour. The accused gunman, Esteban Santiago, was in police custody and the airport had largely returned to its normal rhythm — passengers were noshing, charging their phones, watching television. Things were so sedate that Mr. Robertson did not even realize there had been a shooting. But as he made his way past the gate, Mr. Robertson looked up and saw a “stampede” of people, including what looked like law enforcement agents, racing toward him. “It was tremendous,” he said. “It was like a herd reacting. Everyone around me was diving under chairs.” A rumor about a possible second gunman had spread across the airport, via social media, news sites and word of mouth. People panicked and the airport was shut down, a turn of events that upended what had seemed like an orderly finale to a tragic afternoon. What followed that single rumor was a rush of terror for travelers and airport workers as they fled to the tarmac, were separated from loved ones, injured themselves in the tumult, hid in kitchens and storage rooms and hunkered down behind luggage trucks. Chaos and uncertainty unfolded over the next 12 hours. Through it all, travelers said, they were frustrated every step of the way by the dearth of information about whether they were safe, where to go once the airport was shut down and how they could retrieve the thousands of items — 23,000 according to a tally by airport officials — that were scattered across terminals. For the thousands who fled the terminals, seeking refuge on the tarmac or hiding wherever they could, food and water quickly became scarce. Bathrooms were nonexistent. Passengers on some planes that were either preparing to take off or trying to reach a gate were stuck on board for up to seven hours. Travelers said that some level of pandemonium is to be expected after a shooting, and they praised law enforcement for the swift response. But it was the aftermath of the rumor, which was debunked relatively quickly, that left them bewildered and angry. “Nobody gave us information, and as time went on, we were treated more and more like suspects,” Mr. Robertson said, referring to the pat-downs by law enforcement and orders for people to raise their hands as they walked from the airport down side roads. “When they decided to clear the terminal — that created terror. And it was real terror. People were really, really, really terrified and crying.” Sheriff Scott Israel of Broward County, Fla., said he issued the order to close the entire airport as a safety precaution after he received information that “perhaps gunfire had happened and an active shooter was in another terminal.” At that point, he said, the safety of the people at the airport was paramount. “I made a decision to clear the airport,” Sheriff Israel said in an interview. “I worked with our SWAT team and other SWAT teams to clear the entire airport and the parking garage to make sure we didn’t have any other active shooter. It was a voluminous undertaking and we did it, as horrific and horrible as this scene was.” Until that point, he said, the plan was by the book. “Had the misinformation of the active shooter not surfaced,” he said, “we would have had buses to the airport within 30 minutes.” Sheriff Israel said he could not remember how long it took to confirm there was no second gunman. The authorities debunked the rumor about 30 to 45 minutes after it had started to spread, raising questions about whether the airport could have been reopened right away. By then, law enforcement was already sweeping the airport and garages. It is still unclear how the rumor began. Several travelers said in interviews that they heard what they believed to be gunshots in Terminal 3, something that sounded like loud pops. Sheriff Israel said that he was told somebody saw a bloody person and assumed a second gunman was loose. Providing accurate information to passengers and airport and airline staff members also proved challenging. Law enforcement typically can access wireless emergency alerts — the system that sends Amber Alerts — but alerts were not used to inform people that the danger had passed or instruct them on what to do next. Some airports have internal communication systems for employees to send important messages. It is unknown whether this was in place at the Fort Lauderdale airport. Instead, news, accurate and otherwise, traveled through word of mouth or was gleaned from cellphones. “Airports can put out messages to employees, and that is important because passengers will tend to follow directions from uniformed employees in the know,” said Douglas Mansel, the aviation security manager at Oakland International Airport in Oakland, Calif. All airports have emergency plans approved by the Federal Aviation Administration, including for active-shooter scenarios. The Fort Lauderdale airport’s director, Mark E. Gale, was not available to comment on airport protocols or on how events unfolded on Friday. Sheriff Israel said that communication proved tricky. With so many people spread out across different areas, including on the tarmac and in garages, it was hard to get information out. “I tried to tell as many people verbally,” he said. “Communication is critical, but there is no way to communicate to thousands.” Anne Buongiorno, 56, who was visiting from Canada, had to evacuate Terminal 2 twice. The first time, after the shooting, she and her 15-year-old daughter jumped under a seat, their hands over their heads. Her husband was in the bathroom. Terrified, they followed a surge of people down a staircase, but people were shoving one another. She fell down and broke her rib. She and her daughter ended up on the tarmac and were told to lie on the ground near a luggage truck. A while later, they were told to go back inside. A similar scenario played out as the report spread of the possible second gunman. Ms. Buongiorno said she again wound up among thousands of people on the tarmac. Clusters of people ran back and forth, fleeing what they feared was a threat as the rumor took hold. Ms. Buongiorno hid behind a truck and waited nearly for five hours before being led to a hangar and later put on a bus for the cruise port. Nobody gave her information about where to go, so she used to iPad to find a hotel, got in a long line for a cab and went there. The next day, she was back at the airport waiting for word about how to get her belongings and fly back to Canada. “It was the first time in my life I was so afraid,” she said, her voice quavering at the memory. “I’m afraid still. When I heard somebody talk over there, I’m afraid.” Others joined the long line of people who were told to walk out of the airport along a set of railroad tracks, which skirted a marshy area. A few who had tried to avoid the mayhem by jumping a fence were confronted by law enforcement officers with pointed guns. Those who had luggage dragged it along. Officers sometimes issued contradictory orders — people directed to one location were told by officers there to go back where they came from. Along the way, law enforcement personnel ordered people to raise their arms and sometimes frisked them as they filed by — a common precaution, security experts said, but one that alarmed some. “They were patting us down like there was another shooter,” said Melody Dorward, 22, of Ohio, who walked the railroad tracks. “I felt traumatized. Not safe.” Advertisement"

The Senate on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved the Republican governor's nomination as the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, as Democrats put up little of the resistance they have to some of President Donald Trump’s other Cabinet picks. Haley was approved on a 96-4 vote. The daughter of Indian immigrants will be one of the few women and minorities in Trump’s Cabinet, and some on the left hope she will be a moderating force in the new administration. Haley impressed lawmakers from both parties by taking a tough stance toward Russia, praising international alliances such as NATO, and calling out human rights violations in countries such as the Philippines. Some of these stances, however, put her at odds with the new Republican president, and it remains unclear how she will square her positions with what Trump will demand she do while at the United Nations. Haley has little foreign policy experience, but she argued during her confirmation hearing earlier this month that her executive experience as South Carolina's governor gave her deal-making and coalition-building skills that will come in handy in dealing with the more than 190 member states at the United Nations. She also stressed that she will ensure that U.N. priorities are aligned with U.S. priorities, including by defending Israel when it is singled out for condemnation. In making her pitch to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which approved her nomination on a voice vote earlier Tuesday, Haley avoided the stumbles that had plagued Rex Tillerson, the former ExxonMobil CEO whom Trump has nominated as secretary of state. Tillerson took a softer line on Russia than many senators were comfortable with, and he appeared lukewarm on pushing for human rights. Unlike Haley, Tillerson would not say he believed that Russia was committing war crimes in the Syrian city of Aleppo. Tillerson squeaked by the Foreign Relations committee on a party line 11-10 vote on Monday, but it's not yet clear when the full Senate will take up his nomination. In announcing that he would vote against Tillerson, Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, the committee’s ranking Democrat, negatively compared Tillerson’s performance to Haley’s. Defense By JEREMY HERB On Tuesday, Cardin praised Haley on a number of fronts, including her insistence that she did not support a ""slash and burn"" approach to cutting U.S. funding to the United Nations over its perceived mistakes. He and others also expressed admiration for how Haley handled the tragic 2015 mass shooting deaths of nine African Americans at a Charleston church and the decision afterward to remove the Confederate flag from the state Capitol grounds. ""I was extremely impressed about her competency as governor of South Carolina,"" Cardin said as the full Senate prepared to vote. Only a handful of Democrats opposed Haley's nomination. Among them was Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, who said he was concerned about Haley's lack of experience. ""The position of U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations requires a high level of expertise on international affairs, not someone who will be learning on the job,"" the senator said in a statement.

1.20.2017 6:30 AM Donald Trump becomes the 45th president of the United States today. Yet despite his no-filter rhetorical style, no one is really sure how he will govern—perhaps even Trump himself. He's a Republican turned Democrat turned Republican again (with stints in the Independence Party and as an independent thrown into the mix) who has been alternatively hawkish and non-interventionist, a free marketeer who adores politicians that help facilitate his construction projects, and a socially tolerant proponent of ""New York values"" who as a candidate pandered to xenophobes and winked at white nationalists. He's also the author, or at least the person credited on the cover, of numerous books. In an attempt to glean some indication of Trump's true political identity, I read his three memoirs and three political books. They reveal both remarkably consistent personality traits and an ever-mutating set of political ideals. In his first book, the best-selling Trump: The Art of the Deal (1987), the man demonstrates traits still recognizable today. His world is already divided between winners and losers, great guys and jerks, classy ladies and phonies. His braggadocio over his many successes is matched only by his paranoia that ""bullies"" like then-New York City Mayor Ed Koch are out to stop him from receiving his due credit for restoring Central Park's Wollman Rink or to keep him from obtaining the necessary civic support to build ""Television City,"" a commercial and residential real estate project which subsequent books will reveal as Trump's white whale: an obsession always just out of reach. Then-New York Governor Mario Cuomo (and long-time Koch rival) is hailed as a ""winner and a good guy,"" former President Jimmy Carter is ripped as ""unqualified"" but credited for having ""balls"" when he asked for what Trump considered an absurdly large donation to his charity foundation. Much as he fumes over China today, late-1980s Trump feels Japan is ""screwing"" the U.S. with a ""self-serving"" trade policy. By the time Trump: Surviving at the Top (1990) was published, Trump's business model was spread thin, his first marriage imploding in very public fashion, and the sheen of his ""go-go eighties"" invincibility had completely worn off. But, as Trump writes, ""Anyone who thinks he's going to win them all is going to wind up a big loser."" He spends a great deal of the book laying out his battles with the singer-talk show host-media magnate Merv Griffin over a piece of property in Atlantic City that would become the Trump Taj Mahal, the largest casino in the downtrodden New Jersey beach city that went bankrupt only a year after opening and was finally put of its considerable misery last year. Trump also loves to cloak himself in the macho glory of the military and law enforcement, writing that he would ""rather address a meeting of fifty FBI agents or Vietnam veterans than do a TV show."" All of his books will re-iterate his love of military parades, something he's promised will become a feature of his presidency. While Trump dotes on his first wife Ivana's business acumen and personal character in The Art of the Deal, and blames himself for their marriage going stale in Surviving at the Top, by the time of Trump: The Art of the Comeback (1997), he characterizes her as a spurned opportunist out to squeeze him for every penny. He even quotes her as saying, with a Czech accent, ""I vant my money now."" He also admits to a disquieting tendency to emotionally commit to major life decisions based on his reaction to unrelated tragedies, writing that he decided to separate from Ivana after the death of three close associates in a helicopter crash, and that he proposed marriage to his long-time on-and-off paramour Marla Maples following the mass shooting on the Long Island Railroad in 1993. It should be noted that the lavish Trump/Maples nuptials took place just 13 days after the massacre, casting some reasonable doubt on Trump's claim that grief motivated him to propose. As ever, ""get even,"" ""be paranoid,"" and ""go with your gut"" are mantras repeated ad nauseum, and his loathing of ""journalism—if you even want to call it that these days"" is documented in a nasty letter written to then-New Yorker editor Tina Brown and an extended rant about Wall Street Journal reporter Neil Barsky's coverage of him. Trump's admiration of ""Top Men"" like Henry Kissinger—who he claims hung on Trump's every word during their meetings—and the generals he encountered at a private meeting at the Pentagon have him convinced ""with these guys and our military capability, anybody wanting to mess around with us would be in serious trouble."" Around the time The America We Deserve (2000) was written, Trump was flirting with a Reform Party bid for president, which might explain why he spends so much time in the book repeatedly bashing paleoconservative commentator and eventual Reform Party presidential candidate Pat Buchanan for what Trump sees as his Nazi apologia, his ""intolerance"" against ""Blacks, Mexicans, and Gays,"" as well as the many ""inflammatory, outrageous"" statements that Trump thinks should disqualify Buchanan as a serious candidate for the presidency (Trump also mocks David Duke, the former Klansman who supported Trump in 2016, but who Trump claimed to have never heard of). Notably, Trump promises as president he would focus on ""one term, two-fisted policies, and no excuses."" Interestingly, Trump claims to be ""conservative on most issues,"" but a liberal when it comes to health care. He also says he's for the right to bear arms but supports the ban on assault weapons and longer waiting periods to buy guns. He calls then-Vice President Al Gore ""underrated"" and excoriates ""the moralists in Congress and in the media"" for making too much of Bill Clinton's sexual transgressions—some of which he would highlight in great detail during the 2016 campaign. He also has kind words for then-Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (who he would mercilessly rip as ""low energy"" during the 2016 campaign) for advocating school choice, as well as Bush's father, former President George H.W. Bush, who Trump describes as a good president who should have ""spent three more days and properly finished the job"" after leading an international coalition to expel Saddam Hussein's Iraqi forces from Kuwait in 1991. Also regarding foreign policy, Trump warns that ""Within five years Iran is expected to have nuclear missiles capable of reaching the continental United States"" and thus as president, he would unilaterally bomb their nuclear reactors. He proposes a ""Trump National Security Lottery"" to fund the nation's ""anti-terrorism campaign,"" and argues against ""bogus"" arguments that economic liberalization would help Cuba free itself from the shackles of the Castros, claiming ""Cuba will be freed by ideas, not by rapacious businessmen lining Castro's pockets and propping up his oppressive regime."" He also extends some saber-rattling to the East, writing ""Russia has become the world's leading exporter of weapons of mass destruction to America's enemies"" and calls for ""a preemptive strike on North Korea."" In Time to Get Tough: Make America Great Again! (2015), Trump writes ""I'm a lifelong Republican""—a claim he contradicts in his next book Great Again: How to Fix Our Crippled America (2016), where he admits he was a long-time New York Democrat primarily because everyone around him was. He also switches positions on guns, calling the federal ban on assault weapons ""dumb,"" but never disavowing or even mentioning his previous stance. His tendencies toward strong-man authoritarianism are on full display in Time to Get Tough's chapter ""Strengthen American Muscle,"" which he opens with ""Your civil liberties mean nothing if you're dead."" Trump offers ""Hats off to the Russians"" when praising Vladimir Putin's ""big plans"" to ""edge out [Russia's] neighbors so that Russia can dominate oil supplies to all of Europe"" and create a ""Eurasian nation"" of former Soviet republics. Refreshingly, Trump rips President Barack Obama for launching an ""illegal war"" with no congressional approval in Libya, but mostly focuses on the cost of the NATO operation rather than the moral or ethical issues of a president unilaterally deciding to commit American forces to a battlefield which poses no direct threat to the United States. Trump offers a variation on the ""Take the Oil!"" mantra he frequently deployed during the campaign, arguing ""Our policy should be: no oil. no military support. No exceptions."" No modern Trump tome would be complete without a bit about Mexico, and in Time to Get Tough, Trump reiterates his ""theory that Mexico is sending their absolute worst"" to make the U.S. ""an annex of Mexico's prison system,"" which he argues without any data accounts ""for the fact that there is so much crime and violence."" What are some of the big takeaways revealed by reading books by Trump and about Trump? Other than the quintessentially 1980s time capsule The Art of the Deal, all of these books were likely to be forgotten. Indeed, both Surviving at the Top and The Art of the Comeback are out of print and can only be found on the resale market or in libraries. The books show just how long some of his particular quirks have been a part of his personality—for instance, he's been using the phrase ""big league"" (frequently misheard as ""bigly"" during the debates) since as early as 1997 in The Art of the Comeback, which is also around the time he began regularly referring to himself in the third person as ""Trump."" But now Trump is a part of American history, and though his books read like he talks—frenetic, constantly boastful, and fast and loose with many facts—there are hints to how he will govern. For instance, Trump is an unrepentant crony capitalist and job protectionist. He likes gaming the system, but is threatened by true competition. He's also a criminal justice refom denialist who believes in harsher sentencing, and on foreign policy, he's alternately non-interventionist one moment and apocalyptically hawkish the next. His authoritarian streak—and admiration for certain dictatorships—was as plain as day from as early as The Art of the Deal. Trump's model of capitalism has relied on special considerations from city and state governments for nearly all of his major skyscraper and casino projects. That's why he loved Mario Cuomo (for ""exerting his influence"" during Trump's takeover of the Eastern Shuttle airline) and hated Ed Koch (who he called a ""bully,"" largely for not providing sufficiently favorable tax abatements for Trump properties). He also lays much of the blame for the failure of his Atlantic City casinos on city managers for not coming up with the financing to make the otherwise disastrously depressed city more attractive for tourism. Relatedly, Trump's nationalism and economic populism aren't late-coming additions to his political persona; they've always been there. China has replaced Japan as economic enemy #1 in his eyes, and he doesn't appear to have supported any of the free trade agreements the U.S. has adopted since the publishing of his first book. He also has some contradictory ideas about corporations and the legal system. For instance, in Time to Get Tough he argues for tort reform and a $100,000 cap on ""so-called pain and suffering"" awards in lawsuits, but in The Art of the Comeback, the lifelong teetotaler who lost his older brother to alcoholism writes that lawyers should go after the alcohol industry with lawsuits the way they have with the tobacco industry. When it comes to criminal justice much of Trump's belief—despite facts to the contrary—that America is enduring a record crime wave appears to stem from his late mother's purse being snatched by a 16-year-old in 1991. Before that, he responded to the infamous rape and beating of a jogger in Central Park by taking out a full-page ad in The New York Times calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty and for politicians to ""BRING BACK OUR POLICE…MAKE NEW YORK CITY SAFE AGAIN!"" He cites the Old Testament in The Art of the Comeback, writing ""I believe in an eye for an eye."" But he possesses inability to admit a mistake or acknowledge facts—such as the fact that violent crime has dropped precipitously since the early 1990s or that the five youths who served prison time for the Central Park jogger rape were in fact, exonerated. He has no time for the ""know nothings"" of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and unlike a growing number of Republicans, denies mass incarceration is a problem worth considering. If anything, Trump thinks we have an under-incarceration problem. Trump's foreign policy worldview is all over the place. In The America We Deserve he promises ""No more Clintonesque apologizing"" when the U.S. intervenes militarily, but also no more of what he sees as half-measures like the first Gulf War or the bombings of Serbia and Kosovo. Just when he appears to be fairly non-interventionist, arguing only for the use of military force when the U.S. is threatened, he plainly states he would stage pre-emptive strikes on both North Korea and Iran's nuclear reactors and military installations. As stated on the campaign trail, he thinks pretty much all of our allies except for Israel (far and away the largest beneficiary of U.S. military aid) have been freeloading when it comes to providing for their own defenses, and Trump would happily do away with using our armed forces to protect places such as Europe, South Korea, and Japan unless they started paying us for such services. He also has a consistent record of aggressive talk about trade. In Surviving at the Top—more than two and a half decades before he declared ""only I can fix it"" at last year's Republican National Convention—Trump proposed a blue-ribbon panel of ""corporate leaders, independent dealmakers, and other non political figures…to help us forge a new relationship with the world."" His proposed nine-member panel—who he assured ""if given free rein…could reverse America's eroding economic status and enhance our country's stature as a role model for the rest of the world in a matter of months""—included General Electric CEO Jack Welch, Ted Turner, Carl Icahn, and former Disney CEO Michael Eisner. Trump writes that the very first thing he'd propose is a 20 percent tariff on imports on ""countries that don't play by the rules,"" such as Japan and Germany. Essentially, if given ""free rein,"" he and other Top Men would immediately start a trade war with any number of countries, for the good of America. Trump has been accused of having authoritarian tendencies and a temperment unsuitable for commander-in-chief, and his books present a man who has always believed in the ""great leader"" model, hates decisions made by committee, and considers any pushback against his will to be a personal affront. He always demonstrates total confidence in himself. The updated Kindle edition of Great Again (formerly titled Crippled America) includes a foreword from Trump where he writes ""… [T]he fact that I won the election for the President of the United States is not a great surprise to me. Believe me, I never took this outcome for granted."" Throughout all six books, Trump constantly repeats the phrase ""believe me."" And while there are many unexplained inconsistencies (his paternal grandfather is Swedish in The Art of the Deal, but by the time of The Art of the Comeback, he's German), one thing is for certain, Trump is a creature of emotion. Far from being a cool, calm, and collected negotiator, he wears his emotions on his sleeve, never admits fault, and believes in sweeping top-down government edicts. In six books, he rarely misses an opportunity to tout his patriotism, but other than the occasional hat tip to the 2nd Amendment, never expresses any affinity for the constitution. It's Day One of the Trump era, the beginning of presidential memoirs which promise to be unlike any others.

Because you know, no evidence, is the best evidence. The absence of evidence is proof that Trump is every thing we say he is. You know who else… …didn’t finish their sentences? Trump? Oscar Lopez Rivera? Donald O’Brien? South Africa’s PW Botha? GHWB “should have “spent three more days and properly finished the job” after leading an international coalition to expel Saddam Hussein’s Iraqi forces from Kuwait in 1991.” I can’t argue with that, though it might have taken more than three days. Bush shouldn’t have left 100,000+ Shiites twisting in the wind without US support. He should have told the Saudis that he was sorry, but he changed his mind and wanted to finish the job. The KKK likes no one more than loud mouth billionaire real estate developers from New York. It’s basically their bread and butter. And your point is… what exactly? Just because those losers in bed linens like the dude, doesn’t mean he’s just like them or that he’s going to do the things they like. Wearing that ad-hominem is not a good look for you. While Trump dotes on his first wife Ivana’s business acumen and personal character in The Art of the Deal, and blames himself for their marriage going stale in Surviving at the Top, by the time of Trump: The Art of the Comeback (1997), he characterizes her as a spurned opportunist out to squeeze him for every penny. He even quotes her as saying, with a Czech accent, “I vant my money now.” And? It’s not possible that this is true? I mean, I know that she’d be the first ever ex- that tried to fuck their previous spouse out of money but it’s possible. That relationship trajectory does not seem at all unrealistic or contradictory. My thought too. Sounds about typical for an ex-wife. If I wrote a few books that spanned my adulthood, I would reckon the trajectory of how I portray my except-wife would follow Trump’s. And I’m sure Mr Fisher would decry it even in light of her taking me to court every time she found out I got a raise of a bonus to have the support order recalculated even though she had remarried a guy that made more than I ever did and she moved across the country to mke my relationship with my kids more difficult to maintain. Has Fisher ever had a relationship with a woman end unpleasantly? Has he ever had a relationship with a woman? except-wife Is an “except-wife” the kind of wife that’s cool with you fucking every woman except her? Why not trade in for a younger model if you can afford it? Compare Melania (would definitely) with present-day Ivana (not with your dick). Like his speeches, he has taken every political position and then taken the opposite position. I wouldn’t call it changing his mind. More like just saying what ever he felt like at one moment and then saying something else later without much thought behind it. He may say something I agree with, but I will always doubt that is what he actually thinks or plans to do. I wouldn’t be shocked if he decided to build Trump Tunnels under the Mexican border to help immigrants arrive in style. “They’re gonna be the yugest, most classiest tunnels ever. The spics are gonna love ’em! Believe me!” I know for a fact that both paprika and cinnamon are into structural engineering. who as a candidate pandered to xenophobes and winked at white nationalists. Except he completely disavowed any endorsement by white nationalists. And as for his pandering to xenophobes, what do you consider a xenophobe? Is it Someone that wants us to enforce the immigration laws on the books rather than arbitrarily enforce them BECAUSE WE SHOULD HAVE THE RULE OF LAW RATHER THAN THE RULE OF MAN. I expect the pants-shitting from reason writers today to show their true colors. I further predict a complete misrepresentation of Trump’s speech, his policy proposals and the motives of those who either support or voted for him (those groups do not overlap 100%). We live in a new world where “racism” now means refusing to tolerate aggressively violent religion and “xenophobia” means desiring that laws be equally and fairly applied. It’s just the world we live in now. Well, thanks for saving me the effort of having to read 6 books of crap somebody else wrote, but couldn’t the whole thing have been summed up as “Trump talks a lot of shit”? And didn’t we always know that? Trump’s a stereotypical New Yorker. There’s the line about a tourist in New York asking a passer-by “Excuse me, sir, can you tell me where the Empire State Building is, or should I just go fuck myself?” and there’s a reason the joke is about New York rather than a tourist in San Francisco looking for the Golden Gate Bridge or in St. Louis looking for the Gateway Arch or in Dallas looking for the Alamo (that’s a different joke) – New Yorkers are dicks and everybody knows it. New Yorkers consider New York to be the center of the Universe, they think this because they’re pig-ignorant about the rest of the world and somehow take great pride in their ignorance. They think they know everything because they don’t know of a single thing they don’t know and they’re too incurious to reflect for a moment that this is a sign of great ignorance rather than great knowledge. Trump, as they say, is frequently mistaken but never in doubt. The one thing he’s least in doubt about is the idea that he’s never mistaken. Trump thinks he’s the smartest guy in the room because he doesn’t know anybody who’s smarter than him and he’s too fat-headed to realize that that’s a reflection on his ignorance and not on his intelligence. *sigh* Upstaters are less assholish as a rule. Probably because there is space to get away from other people for a while. When people say “New Yorker”, 99.9% of the time they’re referring to someone from NYC, or at least the metro area. New Yorkers consider New York to be the center of the Universe Well, it is literally the capital of the global confederation, which is close enough since civilization is never leaving earth. and argues against “bogus” arguments that economic liberalization would help Cuba free itself from the shackles of the Castros, claiming “Cuba will be freed by ideas, not by rapacious businessmen lining Castro’s pockets and propping up his oppressive regime.” Um, you dispute this? The Cuban regime is still rolling strong even though everybody but the US has allowed people to travel to Cuba for some time and the money has flowed into the nation…virtually all of it ending in the regime’s pockets while regular Cubans are no more free than two decades ago. You’d think the author knows nothing about the embargo being basically a US-only thing for a generation. It seems you are saying the embargo has not hurt the Cuban regime because they have plenty of other trading partners. So what would be the point of continuing the embargo? If a US company built a luxury tourist hotel in Cuba, wouldn’t the employees of that hotel benefit from the wages and tips they earn working there? Instead of Cuba being freed by ideas, couldn’t ordinary Cubans be freed by earning more money and having a better standard of living? No. Because they don’t get paid compeditive wages, they get paid socialist wages – the same scraps they’d make in any other role. True, but he said “wages and tips.” Even just a few bucks will go a long way to improving their standards of living. “If you put some nice garnish on a shit sandwich, it’s still a shit sandwich.” – Thomas Jefferson European companies have been doing that for years. And Cuba is still a shithole where the average person lives in abject poverty. American companies pumping money into investments there under the direct control of the Castro regime will do nothing but continue to centralize power. We need to offer sanctuary to any Cuban that wants to leave that hellhole and we need to pump radio and tv broadcasts telling the Cuban people we will open investments there when they eject the Castros and their cronies. What we do not need to do is prop up their government by making investments that are completely controlled by the commie government. Ideal climate for growing pot. Legalize it in Cuba and see the tourist cash pour in. Plus excellent rum, tobacco, and beaches (and probably cocaine, gambling, prostitution, and lack of prescription laws). Cuba needs another Batista to turn it into another Las Vegas. WAITAMINNIT!!! Trump DOESN’T mean everything he says?!?!?!?!?! DEPLORABLE!!!!! Does it come with a basket? Donald Trump’s memoirs and political tomes provide a glimpse into his arrogant, paranoid, status-obsessed history and personality. I sure hope this writer never reads The Audacity Of Hope or It Takes A Village. His case of the vapors would be incurable. While I see your comments and understand your concern, just remember this. Hillary was worse….. Better than Hillary is cold comfort. According to Bill, Hilary is cold comfort Its cold comfort but it is also fucking miraculous Unless he takes actions to avoid allowing people to give him or his family money Donald Trump will be guilty of the same type of corruption that sent former New Orleans Mayor Ray Negan to federal prison. Anyone who argues in favor of the now-ended embargo: I am 53 years old. The Cuba embargo started two years before I was born and ended a couple of weeks before my 52nd birthday. If a policy has no measurable effect for more than half a century, should we continue that policy? FWIW, the Castros were bog-standard dictators, indistinguishable from any of the rest of the 3rd world fans of gold braid, prison camps, and summary executions for writing poems that continue to disfigure history. Their philosophy was incidental to their horribleness. Also, they used the embargo to maintain power for years after the Soviet Union collapsed. Raul is past 80. Time is our strongest ally, so let’s not fuck it up by rattling the sabers anymore. The embargo was due more to the political influence of Cubans in Florida than any reasonable chance that it might bring about the downfall of the Castros. Trump has been accused of having authoritarian tendencies and a temperment unsuitable for commander-in-chief, and his books present a man who has always believed in the “great leader” model, hates decisions made by committee, and considers any pushback against his will to be a personal affront. … Far from being a cool, calm, and collected negotiator, he wears his emotions on his sleeve, never admits fault, and believes in sweeping top-down government edicts. So… “libertarian moment?” The funny thing is i have seen this described of Trump by liberal journos and pundits…yet it seems lost on them that obama who has actually been president fits that model exactly but he is just so dreamy “In an attempt to glean some indication of Trump’s true political identity, I read his three memoirs and three political books.” Holy shit, sounds like Fisher earned his salary. I only got halfway through Art of the Trump. Didn’t anybody learn this lesson from the last one? *Don’t read presidential candidate autobiographies!* Just lifting up a book titled ‘Dreams of my Father’ or ‘Art of the Deal’ should instantly qualify you for mulch. ” In Surviving at the Top…Trump proposed a blue-ribbon panel… “His proposed nine-member panel?who he assured ‘if given free rein…could reverse America’s eroding economic status and enhance our country’s stature as a role model for the rest of the world in a matter of months’… “…his books present a man who…hates decisions made by committee” Wait, what? Meet the new boss, same as the old boss From this article I could tell that the author knows how to lift a brief quote and copy stories, but has no idea how to synthesize what he read. He laid it out in The Art of the Deal, if Fisher had been bright enough to get it. All his bragging and stories were just examples. The core is THE DEAL. He is a negotiator par excellence. He uses any and all negotiating tactics to get what he wants in THE DEAL. Re-read his speeches with this in mind and you might learn something. He lays out negotiating positions, not policies. That’s why his thoughts are all over the map – they are fashioned for the specific circumstance, not as ideals. Far from being a cool, calm, and collected negotiator No one with half a brain ever said that. He is a loud, brash, arrogant, bossy, bully of a negotiator. See Election, 2016. Where does Reason come up with this parade of imbeciles that they pass off as writers? “Parade of imbeciles” *records into lexicon* Facebook gives you a great opportunity to earn 98652$ at your home.If you are some intelligent you makemany more Dollars.I am also earning many more, my relatives wondered to see how i settle my Life in few days thank GOD to you for this…You can also make cash i never tell alie you should check this I am sure you shocked to see this amazing offer…I’m Loving it!!!! ????????> http://www.homejobs7.com Instead of reading Trump books or playing the Trump board game, instead I walk around his closed casinos in Atlantic City. Then after gaping in awe at the size of the Taj I can get a few stiff drinks and let the bartenders explain what this idiot did. He’s also the author, or at least the person credited on the cover, of numerous books. In an attempt to glean some indication of Trump’s true political identity, I read his three memoirs and three political books. They reveal both remarkably consistent personality traits and an ever-mutating set of political ideals. ???? ????? ?????????? In his first book, the best-selling Trump: The Art of the Deal (1987), the man demonstrates traits still recognizable today. His world is already divided between winners and losers, great guys and jerks, classy ladies and phonies. His braggadocio over his many successes is matched only by his paranoia that “bullies” like then-New York City Mayor Ed Koch are out to stop him from receiving his due credit for restoring Central Park’s Wollman Rink or to keep him from obtaining the necessary civic support to build “Television City,” a commercial and residential real estate project which subsequent books will reveal as Trump’s white whale: an obsession always just out of reach.

An elliptical quasi-documentary, the film brings to mind Gus Van Sant’s “Elephant” (and, for that matter, Alan Clarke’s “Elephant”) as it explores the day leading up to a tragedy that’s modeled in part after the mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado of 2012. Find the film’s trailer and poster below.

Hélène Louvart (“Pina,” “The Beaches of Agnes”) shot “Dark Night,” and her cinematography is its most distinctive, arresting element — all mood and atmosphere, the film relies on its visuals to communicate what its tight-lipped characters can’t or won’t.

On Monday authorities in California arrested Noor Salman, whose husband, Omar Mateen, was killed in a shootout with police that ended the June 12 attack at the popular gay-friendly club. Salman, 30, is scheduled to appear today in federal court in Oakland, California, near where she was arrested at her home outside of San Francisco, where reports say she has been living with the couple’s young son after relocating from Florida. • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

Her attorney denied allegations in federal charging documents obtained by PEOPLE. Authorities allege Salman “did knowingly aid and abet Omar Mateen’s attempted provision and provision of ‘material support or resources’ … to a designated foreign terrorist organization, namely, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, knowing that the organization was designated as a terrorist organization, and that the organization had engaged and was engaging in terrorist activity and terrorism, and the death of multiple victims resulted.” A federal official told PEOPLE that Mateen had called 911 during the shooting and pledged allegiance to ISIS. “Noor Salman had no foreknowledge nor could she predict what Omar Mateen intended to of that tragic night,” attorney Linda Moreno said in a statement reported by multiple outlets. “Noor has told her story of abuse at his hands,” Moreno said. “We believe it is misguided and wrong to prosecute her and that it dishonors the memories of the victims to punish an innocent person.” The two-count federal charges, formally filed on January 12, accuse Salman of Aiding and Abetting by providing material support to a terrorist organization, along with Obstruction of Justice,” the documents state. The latter accuses Salman of “knowingly … misleading conduct” toward the FBI and local police in Fort Pierce, Florida, where the couple lived, “with the intent to hinder, delay and prevent” the communication of information related to the attack. • Pick up PEOPLE’s special edition True Crime Stories: Cases That Shocked America, on sale now, for the latest on Casey Anthony, JonBenét Ramsey and more.

Noor Salman is the widow of Omar Mateen, who died in a shootout with police after the 12 June 2016 terror attack at an LGBT night club in Orlando, Florida, in which 53 people were wounded. “I can confirm she was arrested this morning in the Bay Area,” a local FBI official told the Guardian. The official was unable to confirm the exact charges against Salman, explaining that Florida’s middle district FBI office, which covers Orlando, was handling the case and therefore made the charges. Messages left for the middle district office were not immediately returned. Linda Moreno, Salman’s lawyer, whose website describes her as an expert in the criminal defense of “national security and terrorism cases”, confirmed Salman had been charged with obstruction. In a statement, Moreno said: “Noor Salman had no foreknowledge nor could she predict what Omar Mateen intended to do that tragic night. “Noor has told her story of abuse at his hands. We believe it is misguided and wrong to prosecute her and that it dishonors the memories of the victims to punish an innocent person.” A Twitter post from the US attorney’s office in Orlando said Salman would make her initial appearance on Tuesday morning in Oakland, California on federal charges filed in Florida. Salman was interviewed by FBI officials immediately after the attack and has said she was “unaware” of her husband’s plans to embark on a mass shooting. She described her husband, who she met on a dating website in 2011, as abusive, often choking her or pulling her hair. It was the second marriage for both of them. The shooting took place in the early hours of a summer Sunday, during Latin night at the popular gay nightclub. Many of those killed were young, gay people of color. Mateen described himself as an “Islamic soldier” in 911 calls recorded during the Pulse attack. The CIA said it found no direct link between Mateen and the terror organization. Reports at the time indicated that Mateen may have been motivated by struggles with his own sexuality and that Pulse regulars said they had seen him before. The 29-year-old was a security guard living in Fort Pierce, Florida, with his wife and son, about two hours’ drive from Orlando. He was born in New York City but his family moved to Florida when he was a child. After the Orlando attack, the Senate tried and failed to pass laws regarding background checks and gun control restrictions. The scene of the deadliest mass shooting in US history has been purchased by the City of Orlando and will become a permanent monument to those killed.","First published on Mon 16 Jan 2017 17.21 GMT The wife of the gunman who killed 49 people in the Pulse nightclub shooting was arrested on Monday near the Bay Area, an FBI official said.

We believe it is misguided and wrong to prosecute her and that it dishonors the memories of the victims to punish an innocent person.” A Twitter post from the US attorney’s office in Orlando said Salman would make her initial appearance on Tuesday morning in Oakland, California on federal charges filed in Florida. Salman was interviewed by FBI officials immediately after the attack and has said she was “unaware” of her husband’s plans to embark on a mass shooting. She described her husband, who she met on a dating website in 2011, as abusive, often choking her or pulling her hair. It was the second marriage for both of them. The shooting took place in the early hours of a summer Sunday, during Latin night at the popular gay nightclub. Many of those killed were young, gay people of color. Mateen described himself as an “Islamic soldier” in 911 calls recorded during the Pulse attack. The CIA said it found no direct link between Mateen and the terror organization. Reports at the time indicated that Mateen may have been motivated by struggles with his own sexuality and that Pulse regulars said they had seen him before. The 29-year-old was a security guard living in Fort Pierce, Florida, with his wife and son, about two hours’ drive from Orlando. He was born in New York City but his family moved to Florida when he was a child. After the Orlando attack, the Senate tried and failed to pass laws regarding background checks and gun control restrictions. The scene of the deadliest mass shooting in US history has been purchased by the City of Orlando and will become a permanent monument to those killed."

Olga Woltering, a great-grandmother who was in her 80s, has been identified as one of those killed in the mass shooting in Fort Lauderdale on Friday night. Woltering, reportedly originally from Ipswich, Suffolk, lived in Atlanta with her husband Ralph, a former US airman. The couple are believed to have been travelling from their home in Georgia to go on a cruise. The Catholic Church of the Transfiguration in Cobb county, Georgia, of which Woltering had been a member since 1978, said she was “so charming, calling everybody ‘Lovey’ or ‘Love’ in her unmistakable British accent”. Father Fernando Molina-Restrepo said: “Olga was one of the most joyful, loving, caring and committed people I have ever met. This is a horrible tragedy for everyone here at Transfiguration, especially because Olga was so loved. “Olga and Ralph have been members of our Transfiguration family since October 1978. May God give consolation to all of the victims of this tragedy and may God give eternal rest to those who died. Especially to our beloved Olga. Peace.” Esteban Santiago, 26, a former member of the National Guard from Alaska and an Iraq war veteran, is accused of carrying out the killings, which also left six people injured."

A report by a Tunisian judge contains testimony that law enforcement units in the resort town of Sousse purposefully delayed their arrival at the Imperial Marhaba hotel on 26 June 2015 as a gunman opened fire and killed 38 tourists, 30 of whom were British.  Resuming the inquests into the deaths at the beach resort of Sousse, Samantha Leek QC, the counsel to the inquests, said the holidaymakers had “needlessly lost their lives” in the mass shooting. Leek’s remarks came after the coroner, Nicholas Loraine-Smith, asked interested parties, the public and press at the hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice to stand in memory of those killed following a rollcall of their names. Hundreds of tourists were sunbathing in 30C heat when jihadi Seifeddine Rezgui opened fire with a Kalashnikov assault rifle, which he had concealed within a parasol, in a rampage that lasted nearly 40 minutes. The Tunisian authorities shot Rezgui dead as he ran from the hotel. Summarising the evidence to be heard, Leek said the inquest, which is set to last seven weeks, will hear from a report on a Tunisian investigation into the attack, compiled by the judge Lazhar Akremi. An unnamed interior minister claimed police units delayed their response as the attack unfolded, the inquest heard. Leek said according to that witness “the police units, which should have intervened to stop the attack, deliberately and unjustifiably slowed down to delay their arrival at the hotel”. She said: “They had the ability to put an end to the attack before the police arrived but wasted a considerable amount of time in getting to the hotel.” No further context was given during Monday’s proceedings to explain why the police officers are alleged to have slowed down. Leek said the inquest would also hear testimony that would explain why some witnesses believed a second gunman was on the beach. A speedboat driver claims he picked up a gun dropped by a marine who lost consciousness when Rezgui detonated a grenade. Rezgui detonated a number of explosives as he moved through the hotel, Leek said. He killed 20 people on the beach, eight in the hotel and 10 in the hotel grounds. The attack came three months after Islamist militants attacked the Bardo National Museum in the Tunisian capital, Tunis. They killed 21 people – mostly European tourists – at the scene, and another victim died 10 days later. Rezgui was a 23-year-old electrical engineering student at the University of Kairouan, from Gaafour in north-west Tunisia. It emerged he had received military training in Libya. DS Mark Gower, of the Metropolitan police counter-terrorismcommand, took the inquest through maps and video footage gathered toassist the coroner. A graphic CCTV clip from within the Imperial Marhaba hotel was shown of panicked holidaymakers rushing into the building with Rezgui in pursuit. The grainy footage shows at least one tourist falling to the ground as he is shot. The inquest was told the clip showed the victim Bruce Wilkinson being fatally shot. Wilkinson, a 72-year-old father and grandfather, was on holiday with his wife, Rita. Video footage was shown of the gunman being dropped off in a street near the hotel by a white Peugeot van before he sets off on foot clutching a parasol under his arm. It is now known the parasol was concealing his automatic weapon. The inquest was then shown clips of Rezgui walking along the shoreline past moored boats before images of sunbathers fleeing the beach were shown. Some holidaymakers stumbled and fell as they struggled to run across the sand away from Rezgui. Travel company Tui, which owns Thomson Holidays, through which all 30 of the Britons booked their trip, is expected to come under significant scrutiny over its handling of travel advice for Tunisia from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). Lawyers representing families of 20 of the deceased Britons are to accuse Tui of “practically hiding and keeping out of the limelight” FCO warnings about terrorism in Tunisia, according to papers submitted in advance of the resumption of inquests. The travel firm, which in the year to September made an underlying profit of €1bn (£866m), is also said to have sold customers travel insurance that excluded cancellation cover caused by terrorism risks. Jane Marriott, an FCO official who at the time of the Sousse attacks was director of the Middle East and North Africa directorate, told the inquest that in the years before the Bardo and Sousse attacks the security situation in Tunisia was “getting worse”. The Bardo killings were seen as an atrocity that could inspire copycat attacks and radicalise others, Marriott said. The day after the Bardo attacks a meeting was held with then foreign office minister Tobias Ellwood, to discuss the travel advice, in which the department said it wanted to see improvements in security in tourist areas. Ellwood concluded that the advice did not need to be changed. However, the inquest heard that after the Bardo attacks travel advice was altered to include “more robust” language and a warning was added that further attacks were “a possibility”. Ambassadors met representatives from tourist areas including Sousse who reassured them that security around hotels and beaches had been increased. Marriott told the inquest that the FCO had a dialogue with travel firms and tour operators, and travel firms could inform the FCO on security and safety trends they noticed on the ground in countries. Before the Sousse attack, Tui is said in submissions by the families to have discouraged cancellation by penalising customers up to the full cost of their booked holidays if they chose to cancel as a result of learning of terrorist activities or risks. Tui is to argue that the measures it had in place at the time for forwarding travel advice were appropriate but the Sousse attack changed the climate and it responded accordingly. Some evidence may be considered behind closed doors due to sensitivity for the prevention of future terrorist attacks, following an application by the FCO. The inquests continue."

Two close relatives of the suspect, Esteban Santiago, suggested he had been hard hit psychologically by his military service overseas. Santiago's mother, who lives in Puerto Rico, said her son saw a bomb explode next to two of his friends in Iraq. ""Only thing I could tell you was when he came out of Iraq, he wasn't feeling too good,"" his uncle, Hernan Rivera, told The Record newspaper in New Jersey. Esteban's brother in Puerto Rico, Bryan Santiago, said Saturday that he advised him to seek treatment but that his brother was only able to receive minimal assistance. In August, Bryan said his brother began saying he was hearing voices. He told the Associated Press that Esteban's girlfriend in Alaska called his family in recent months to alert them to his mental state. USA TODAY Florida airport shooting: Charges, victim info, more on what we know now The FBI said that in November, Santiago walked into an FBI office in Anchorage, saying the Islamic State terrorist group had gained control of his mind and was urging him to fight on its behalf. ""During the interview, Santiago appeared agitated and incoherent, and made disjointed statements,'' the FBI said in a statement Friday night. “Although Santiago stated that he did not wish to harm anyone, as a result of his erratic behavior, interviewing agents contacted local authorities who took custody of Santiago and transported him to a local medical facility for evaluation."" Two federal law enforcement officials said Saturday that Santiago was carrying a handgun when he arrived at the Anchorage office. The officials, who were not authorized to comment publicly, said the troubled 26-year-old went through standard security checks where the handgun was surrendered before he was directed to federal agents for questioning. The Anchorage police chief gave a slightly different account, saying Santiago had ammunition and the gun was later retrieved from his vehicle. The officials said it is not unusual in that rugged part of the country for people to be armed, and it didn’t raise unusual concern because the weapon was turned over during the required security check. It was during the interview, however, that Santiago allegedly showed signs of erratic behavior and emotional distress when he claimed that U.S. intelligence agencies had gained control of his mind, urging him to align himself with the Islamic State terror group, the officials said. As part of a threat assessment, agents reviewed criminal and counter-terrorism databases and interviewed the mother of his newborn child in Anchorage who indicated that Santiago did not intend to harm anyone. The FBI said it closed the assessment after conducting database reviews, interagency checks, and interviews of his family members. The officials said he was then turned over to local police who were believed to have taken possession of the weapon that had been turned over at the security checkpoint. Police then referred Santiago for medical evaluation. It wasn’t until Friday, the officials said, that Santiago surfaced again on the FBI’s radar following his arrest in connection with the mass shooting that left five dead. ""The FBI failed there. ... We're not talking about someone who emerged from anonymity to do something like this,'' Bryan Santiago told the AP, speaking in Spanish outside his family's house in Puerto Rico's southern coastal town of Penuelas. ""The federal government already knew about this for months, they had been evaluating him for a while, but they didn't do anything.'' Although authorities were still scouring his communications for a specific motive beyond his emotional struggles, one of the officials said they believe the handgun used in the Friday attack was acquired legally. Santiago, the official said, agreed to speak with investigators following his arrest, but at least some of his exchanges with investigators were incoherent. The official characterized the interview as a mixed bag of information, much of which would require corroboration Esteban Santiago, who was born in New Jersey, moved to Puerto Rico when he was 2, his brother said. He grew up in Penuelas before joining the Puerto Rico National Guard in 2007. He served in Iraq from April 23, 2010, to Feb. 19, 2011, a military spokeswoman said. Santiago's job was to clear roads of improvised explosive devices, and at least two members of his company were killed, Lt. Col. Candis Olmstead, director of public affairs for the Alaska National Guard, told The New York Times. The suspect's military record lists him as a ""combat engineer"" whose postings also included Fort Dix, N.J., and Fort Leonard Wood, Mo. He received an Army Commendation Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal and a Combat Action Badge. Santiago's aunt, Maria Luisa Ruiz of Union City, N.J., said in an interview on Friday that after Iraq, her nephew went back to live in Puerto Rico. He studied there, she said, but was unable to find work and decided to move to Alaska, where he joined the Alaska National Guard in 2014. Olmstead described Santiago as a “traditional soldier” in the Headquarters & Headquarters Troop 297th Cavalry in Fairbanks, Alaska, but had received a general discharge from the military in August for “unsatisfactory performance,” said Olmstead. She did not elaborate on the circumstances of his discharge. Ruiz said Friday that her nephew found work in security in Alaska and seemed happy after the birth of his son in September. She showed reporters a photo of him at a hospital holding his newborn son. His dark hair is closely cropped, and he’s wearing a T-shirt from the band Disturbed. But, says Ruiz, his demeanor changed about a month ago. “It was like he lost his mind,” she said in Spanish. “He said he saw things.” She said Santiago recently was hospitalized for two weeks after suffering from an unspecified condition. “I don’t know why this happened,” she told reporters at her home on Friday before FBI agents arrived and authorities closed off the street. “Right now, my family and I are suffering,"" she said. ""My family and I are in shock right now. We don't know what is going to happen. It's sad but we have to confront the situation. … This hurts me as if he was my own son. I hope God is with him.” USA TODAY Florida airport shooting suspect charged; could face death penalty Senator-elect Nelson Cruz, a friend of the family who represents the town in Puerto Rico where they live, said he had been talking regularly with Bryan Santiago since the shooting. ""They're very humble and very Christian people,"" Cruz said of Esteban's brother and mother. ""They want to tell the families of the victims that they're extremely saddened and extremely upset by what happened.""

Seems like that big hump in December 2012 could have used a Sandy Hook shooting data point. “Barack Obama, Gun Salesman” You forgot his kemo sabe, DiFi. He is deceased now, but I had a buddy that owned a gun shop. He had an 11×14 color portrait of Obama prominently displayed in his showroom. All of us that showed up there to drink coffee and shoot the shit would regularly hang a napkin over the front of it as a curtain because we couldn’t stand looking at that moron’s face. My buddy, when he noticed it, would yank it off of the frame and declare “Best damned gun salesman in history!” And raise the price of ammunition. Seems like that has been getting a little better although i doubt we’ll see 10.99 boxes of .45 again anytime soon. At least we can get it now. I’ve also complained about the overcrowded ranges but seems like more being built slowly so that should catch up as well. Isn’t capitalism great? End of day, the more funds in private hands, the stronger the 2A, whether the government recognizes that right or not. Not sure how guns turned into funds. Beat your swords into stock shares. Load your own. About 2/3 of the cost of a round of ammo is the brass case, and that’s re-usable. I just loaded up 500 rounds of .45 Colt with hard-cast Keith-type semi-wadcutters for about $100. Background checks are more a measure of interest than sales. Interest in guns is a valid thing to study by itself, but it’s not a perfect substitute for sales. Neither is web searches for gun dealers. This graph makes it a bit clearer that there were two huge spikes for gun sales right after his elections. Otherwise, the growth trend stretches back before he was elected. This is also shown in the background searches and web searches for gun dealers. So, I like the graph, but it could be interpreted as just seasonality unless there’s more taken into account. First link. The time is coming soon when ammo sales, then gun sales will be quickly restricted with an eye on rapid elimination of private possession, followed by confiscation via buy-back, I think. Keep your arms in a safe at the range, or lose them. Get caught with a weapon or ammo outside the range (or managed hunting preserve) and you will lose them, no appeals. No need to imprison a bunch of people, as long as you get the guns. This effort will fail miserably,but it will provide some comic relief. Some of it bloody, but humorous nonetheless. There’s a little spike after Aurora, and maybe one after Orlando, though it looks like that spike may have predated the event. Other than that, there’s not much in these data to argue for a causal relationship between the data and any of the discrete events highlighted in that graph. All I’m seeing is a linear trend with a yearly sales cycle on top of it. The shape of the yearly cycle is neat. I should fire up MATLAB and make a wavelet to match the shape and play with analyzing the signal. Pretty much what I was thinking. Fitting an ARIMA model with seasonality to the 2005-2008 data may provide a good projection for the rest. Variations from that projection would potentially be anomalous. Better yet, use some kind of nowcasting technique like BSTS. This is a nearly-ideal application of the linked method. Is the daily data available? All I can find is monthly, and all the interesting variations in the signal are lost at that low of a frequency. Remember your fucking Nyquist-Shannon, you fucks. *Appear* to be lost.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Sheriff: 5 dead, 8 wounded in mass shooting Five people are dead and a shooting suspect is in custody Friday after a lone gunman opened fire at a baggage claim area in Florida's Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, shooting some people in the head without saying a word, witnesses and investigators said. OBAMA BRIEFED ON FLORIDA SHOOTING, TRUMP SPEAKS WITH GOVERNOR The suspect, identified as Esteban Santiago, had served in the Alaska Army National Guard until August 2016 when he was given a ""general discharge,"" the Guard's public affairs director Candis Olmsted confirmed to Fox News. The suspect brought a gun in a checked bag on an Air Canada flight, officials said. ""He claimed his bag and took the gun from baggage and went into the bathroom to load it. Came out shooting people in baggage claim,"" Broward County Commissioner Chip LaMarca wrote on Facebook. AIRLINES ANNOUNCE TRAVEL WAIVERS AFTER SHOOTING A Canadian embassy spokeswoman clarified that the flight originated in Anchorage, Alaska, and continued to Ft. Lauderdale via Minneapolis, never landing in Canada. The TSA allows firearms in checked bags, but they must be unloaded, locked in a rigid container and declared before traveling. Shots fired at Ft Lauderdale Airport, suspect reportedly in custody pic.twitter.com/o0zVdI91Um Santiago was taken into custody without incident and was unhurt. Law enforcement never fired any shots, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said. ""This scene is considered fluid and active."" The shooting unfolded in Terminal 2, which serves serves Delta Air Lines and Air Canada. It was unclear why the suspect may have chosen to open fire, the sheriff added. ""The citizens of Florida will not tolerate senseless acts of evil,"" Gov. Rick Scott responded. ""Whoever is responsible will be held accountable to the full extent of the law."" In the ensuing panic, the TSA received two separate, unconfirmed reports of a separate active shooter, a law enforcement official close to the investigation told Fox News. However, Israel said Friday afternoon there was no indication any additional shots were fired. Paramedics rushed eight people to hospitals. ""It was very surreal,"" John Schlicher, a witness, told Fox News. ""He did not say a word."" He described the shooter as a slender man with dark hair, wearing a Star Wars T-shirt. ""He was shooting people that were down on the ground, too,"" Schlicher said. While speaking to Shepard Smith live on Fox News, Schlicher said he heard crews ordering passengers to take cover amid the unconfirmed reports of more shots fired. He spoke over the phone while ducked down on the floor. The gunman apparently got down on the ground and waited for police to arrive after he ran out of bullets, a witness told CBS News. The governor said he spoke to President-elect Donald Trump with updates, but did not speak to President Obama. The president was briefed on the shooting by his Homeland Security adviser, the White House said. Video posted on Instagram appeared to show several people wounded in the baggage claim area of the terminal. One person appeared to be lying in a pool of blood with a head wound. Paramedics could be seen treating a bleeding victim outside the airport. Hundreds of people stood on the tarmac as an ambulance drove by. Ari Fleischer, a former White House spokesman, was at the airport at the time of the shooting and tweeted that ""everyone is running."" Jillian Saunders, from Palm Beach, Florida, told The Associated Press in direct Twitter messages that she was watching the activity from the tarmac in a plane scheduled to fly to Los Angeles. ""Everything you see on the news is happening outside my window,"" she said. ""I am luckily on the plane and they said we are right now the safest people at the airport."" The office of Florida Gov. Rick Scott said state law enforcement have not confirmed a motive behind the shooting. Scott is traveling to the scene to be briefed by law enforcement. The ATF was responding to the scene. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson was monitoring the shooting and getting regular updates -- part of standard practice, a federal law enforcement source told Fox News. The airport is the 21st busiest in the United States and serves 21 different airlines. Nearly 2.5 million people passed through the airport in November, according to a county government report.

Two Students Arrested for Alleged High School Shooting Plot — -- Police in Southern California have detained two 16-year-old high school students for allegedly planning a mass school shooting they bragged would be ""bigger than Columbine,"" police said Wednesday. The Fullerton Police Department in Orange County, located south of Los Angeles County, said in a statement that the two students ""have been detained for making criminal threats and conspiracy to commit a felony.""  They have been released to the custody of Orange County Juvenile Hall. Their names have been withheld as California law prevents law enforcement from releasing the identities of juvenile suspects. Officials learned of the alleged plot on Wednesday after a Fullerton Police Department Resource Office assigned to Troy High School ""received information regarding a possible 'school shooting' plot."" The statement adds, ""the School Resource Officer was told that the previous evening, two students were attending a Troy High School athletic event and during the event, the reporting party overheard the two students discussing their plans to 'shoot up' the school in a manner 'bigger than Columbine.'"" The two students were also overheard discussing the types of firearms they would use, and the effectiveness of various firearms. The individual who overheard the two students' conversation took a photo of them, which allowed them to be identified to police. ""The reporting party in this incident may have saved countless lives, and untold heartache for an unknown number of families, simply by reporting to police what was overheard,"" police said in the statement. After obtaining the photos of the students and identifying them, officers contacted the students at school, where an ""initial investigation indicates the students did make statements similar to the statements reported to police,"" the statement continued. After obtaining search warrants for ""multiple locations in Anaheim,"" police say they found evidence that the students had conducted online research of mass shootings. The evidence indicated that the students were researching ""weaponry and prior school shootings (including Columbine) as recently as yesterday, in preparation for their plot,"" according to police. They said the investigation is ongoing. The Fullerton School District said in a statement today that it was ""aware of the reported threat at Troy High School"" and has been in communication with police. The district added that there were no known threats to any other FSD schools and all the district's campuses were open today. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Gunman Omar Mateen's wife, Noor Salman, who was arrested by the FBI on Monday in the San Francisco area, entered a courtroom this morning slightly hunched over and with her head down.

For this count, she could face up to life in prison and a $250,000 fine. ""She knew he was going to conduct the attack,"" Handberg said. On count two, she was charged with obstruction of justice.

The unidentified students -- ages 13 and 14 -- were charged with conspiracy to commit murder and placed into the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice, the Sumter County Sheriff's Department said in a press release. Law enforcement and school officials were initially tipped off of the pair's plans on Tuesday, police said. The arrests came after ""officials learned of, and intervened in a plot to initiate a mass shooting at their school,"" the release said. On Tuesday, after classes had finished for the day, ""school officials and the schools resource officer became aware of rumors circulating between students at the school,"" the release explains. ""The rumors indicated that a student was planning a mass shooting on Friday January 27th. Witnesses indicated that some students had been warned not to come to school on Friday."" The following day, the two students told officials that they had indeed discussed a mass shooting at The Villages Charter Middle School in Lady Lake, a town located about an hour northwest of Orlando. Police said in the release, ""The 13-year-old student alleged to be planning the attack was intercepted by authorities as he attempted to arrive for school. At that time, he acknowledged conversations involving the plot and referenced the mass shooting at Columbine High School."" During the conversation with the 13-year-old, ""officials learned of a second student's potential involvement and quickly located the 14-year-old-male student on campus,"" according the release. ""The 14-year-old student acknowledged his involvement in conversations with the 13-year-old student again referencing the Columbine shooting. The student informed officials that the two students had planned an attack which included what they would use as a signal to open fire."" No weapons were found on either of the students or in their bags or lockers, police said. Then on Thursday, the teens were arrested at their homes during the service of search warrants. The 13-year-old was arrested by the Lake County Sheriff's Office on a juvenile order at his home in Fruitland Park. The 14-year-old was arrested by the Sumter County Sheriff's Office at his home in Wildwood. No additional arrests are expected, police said. Firearms were recovered from both suspects' homes during the search warrant service. An increased deputy presence will be at the school on Friday. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

""Far too much planning"" went into the alleged mass shooting plan for The Villages Charter Middle School in Lady Lake, Florida, said Sumter County Sheriff's Capt. James ""Chris"" Haworth. Two boys -- ages 13 and 14 -- came up with the alleged plan after they researched the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado, Haworth told ABC News. Haworth described the amount of detail the students put into the alleged plot, which was planned for today, as ""very specific"" and ""serious enough to the point that the other children were scared -- scared enough to come forward and say something."" The teens allegedly told fellow students to wear white on Friday if they didn't want to get shot, Haworth said. But, in subsequent interviews with the teens, that request was revealed to be a ruse, Haworth said. ""They wanted them to wear white because the blood shows better on a white shirt,"" Haworth said. The teens told investigators that ""they were going to drop a pencil, and that would be the initiating of the shooting,"" Haworth said. Witnesses also indicated that some students were warned to not attend school on Friday, according to a police press release. After school ended on Tuesday, it was reported to a school resource officer that rumors had been circulating among students about a planned mass shooting at the school for Friday, Haworth said. On Tuesday, the 13-year-old student was allegedly overheard saying he was going to ""shoot up the school on Friday,"" according to a police affidavit released by the sheriff's office. Police intercepted one of the accused teens on their way into school on Wednesday, and after preliminary interviews, ""It was quickly divulged that they had been, in fact, planning a school shooting,"" Haworth said. The accused 13-year-old confirmed to the school resource officer Wednesday that he and another 14-year-old student were plotting the shooting, Haworth said. During the interview with the school principal and resource officer, he said that he had made a dumb statement about the Columbine shooting the previous day, telling the 14-year-old, ""Imagine if that was me shooting,"" according to the police affidavit. He then told students around him not to come to school on Friday. The 13-year-old also told the school resource officer that he had been suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts, saying, ""I just want to die."" The 14-year-old said he discussed the details of the alleged plan with the 13-year-old because he thought it was a joke, according to the police affidavit. Haworth said the threat was not a joke and that police are taking it seriously because of how much detail went into the alleged plot and because the students had allegedly conducted research on the Columbine shooting. ""This was real,"" Haworth said of the alleged plot. After being questioned on Wednesday, the two students were taken into custody to be evaluated, Michelle Keszey, media manager at the Sumter County Sheriff’s Office, told ABC News. It is her understanding that the students went home following the evaluation, she said. The two students were then arrested Thursday at their homes, Haworth said. Multiple firearms were found at the 14-year-old's house in Wildwood, Florida, including a loaded semi-automatic handgun in the nightstand in his parent's bedroom, a loaded semi-automatic gun in a family vehicle and an assortment of other guns in a safe, Haworth said. A loaded semi-automatic rifle was also found in the 13-year-old's home in Fruitland Park, Florida. No weapons were found on either of the students or in their bags or lockers when they were apprehended at school on Wednesday, police said in a release. In an interview, the 14-year-old said that his father owns a gun, but added that it was locked up, according to the police affidavit. The teen also said that the two never discussed what guns they were going to use in the alleged plot. A student told police that the 13-year-old had recently attended a tribute to the Holocaust and had showed up to school with swastikas on his hands and Nazi logos on his arms, according to the police affidavit. Both teens are charged with conspiracy to commit murder and are currently at a juvenile assessment center in Ocala, Florida, Haworth said. The Florida State Attorney’s Office will determine whether they will be tried in juvenile or adult court, Keszey said. They have not yet entered a plea. While it is still early in the investigation, there is nothing to indicate that the teens' parents will be charged as well, Haworth said. More than half of the school's students were not in attendance Friday, Haworth said.

575093632,2017-02-01 11:51:06, Wife of Pulse Nightclub Gunman Seeks to Be Released on Bond,http://abcnews.go.com/US/jailed-widow-pulse-nightclub-gunman-omar-mateen-seeks/story?id=45190386,,False,"terrorism,crime and criminals,murders and attempted murders",39000,ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/,"She has been in custody since she was arrested in January. Wife of Pulse Nightclub Gunman to Remain in Custody — -- Noor Salman, the jailed widow of Orlando nightclub gunman Omar Mateen, will remain in custody and undergo a psychological evaluation, a judge ruled today after her lawyers appeared in federal court in California fighting for her release on bond. Salman, who appeared in court wearing a red jumpsuit with an orange T-shirt underneath, looked back at her family members who were in attendance. She and her family members cried when they saw each other. Salman wrote notes to her lawyers during the hearing. Salman, who has been in custody since she was arrested by the FBI in the San Francisco area last month, has pleaded not guilty to the federal charges against her. The U.S. attorney's office claims Salman aided and abetted Mateen's ""provision of material support"" to the terrorist group ISIS, also known as ISIL, for which she could face life in prison if convicted. Salman is also accused in the indictment of misleading federal agents and Fort Pierce, Florida, police officers who questioned her about Mateen's attack at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando on June 12, 2016. The mass shooting killed 49 people. Mateen was killed in a police shootout after the attack. The government today claimed Salman knew her husband watched ISIS recruitment videos. Prosecutors said she engaged in scouting activity by going to Pulse with Mateen. They also said she saw him leave the house the night of the massacre with a gun and a backpack filled with ammunition. Salman knew her husband was going to commit an attack and said she had a false cover story for that night, according to prosecutors. Prosecutors also said Salman poses a danger to the community and is capable of fleeing with her son. Defense attorney Linda Moreno said at a news conference after the hearing that what the government presented today was a case against Mateen, not Salman. Moreno said the government's statements were based on ""speculation"" and statements prosecutors ""claim she made during an 18-hour interrogation"" conducted without counsel. Salman's defense attorneys had hoped for her release on bond into the custody of her mother or uncle, both of whom say they are willing to put up their houses as collateral. Salman's attorneys said in court papers that she ""poses no danger"" and is only connected to the crime through what they called ""her tragic marriage"" to Mateen. She was, the defense argued, ""only present as a wife and an abused wife at that."" The defense said it was also prepared to challenge the substance of the charges and what it describes as the public narrative of Salman’s purported involvement. Defense attorney Charles Swift cited what he called erroneous reports that Salman drove Mateen to Pulse nightclub for Mateen's ""purported scouting trip."" “The defense proffers that the evidence will show that the purported scouting trip occurred while the family was on their way home from babysitting the children of a relative, that Mateen chose to drive into Orlando and to pass by the Pulse Night Club, and that Noor, who did not possess a driver’s license at the time, was at most a reluctant passenger who wanted to go home,"" the defense said in court papers. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

File/Brooks Brunson/Staff  Dylann Roof appears in court in July 2015. Mary Helm, visiting from Pinehurst, N.C. pauses for a moment at Emanuel AME church Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2017, in Charleston,S.C. waiting for the verdict to be heard in the Dylann Roof trial. Grace Beahm/Staff The Emanuel AME Church shooting victims are Cynthia Hurd, Susie Jackson, Ethel Lance, DePayne Middleton-Doctor, Clementa Pinckney, Tywanza Sanders, Daniel Simmons, Sharonda Coleman-Singleton and Myra Thompson. Melvin Graham, brother of shooting victim Cynthia Hurd, spoke with reporters after a jury sentenced shooter Dylann Roof to death in January. File/Brooks Brunson/Staff Just a few hours after he told a crowded courtroom, “I still feel like I had to do it,” Dylann Roof was sentenced to death by a federal jury Tuesday for carrying out the mass shooting inside Charleston's Emanuel AME Church in a bid to spark a race war. The 12-member panel – three black jurors, nine white – deliberated for a little less than three hours before unanimously deciding the 22-year-old self-avowed white supremacist should die for his crimes rather than spend his life in prison without the possibility of parole. U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel has scheduled a hearing for 9:30 a.m. Wednesday to formally impose that sentence and hear from loved ones who wish to address the killer. Roof, who sat stone-faced and silent through most of his hate crimes trial, showed no emotion as the jury’s verdict was read. During his closing argument earlier in the day, he passed on the chance to argue for his life, saying “I’m not sure what good that will do anyway.” The decision capped an anxious month and a half in Charleston as families of the dead and the community at-large waited to see how justice would be delivered in a case that shook the city to its core. The same jury that voted for death found Roof guilty in December of 33 federal offenses stemming from the mass shooting. Praise for their work was swift in coming Tuesday from several quarters. Outgoing U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who wrestled with the decision to seek the death penalty for 10 months before authorizing prosecutors to proceed, said the jury rendered a just verdict that holds Roof accountable for his actions. “No verdict can bring back the nine we lost that day at Mother Emanuel,"" she said. ""And no verdict can heal the wounds of the five church members who survived the attack or the souls of those who lost loved ones to Roof’s callous hand. But we hope that the completion of the prosecution provides the people of Charleston – and the people of our nation – with a measure of closure."" Melvin Graham, who lost his sister Cynthia Hurd in the shooting, echoed Lynch's sentiments and said his family felt justice had been served. “This is a very hollow victory because my sister is still gone,” he said. “I wish that this verdict could have brought her back, but it can’t. What it can do is send a message to those who feel the way he (Roof) feels that this community will not tolerate it.” Kevin Singleton, whose mother Myra Thompson was killed, said about the verdict: ""I would like for that to marinate and travel to the nervous system of that coward. Justice was served. "" Roof's legal team issued a statement expressing sympathy for the families ""so grievously hurt by Dylann Roof’s actions"" and expressing regret that with potential appeals, the case could could drag on for ""a very long time."" Roof's family also weighed in, saying they will always love him but share grief over his actions and pray for the church and the families he hurt. ""We will struggle as long as we live to understand why he committed this horrible attack, which caused so much pain to so many good people,"" they stated. Roof, who chose to represent himself during the penalty phase, had been an enigma through most of the trial. He spent most of his days staring at the table in front of him or shuffling papers. He didn't cross-examine any of the government's witnesses and chose to put on no defense of his own. He rested his case on Monday without calling a single witness or offering a shred of evidence in his behalf. He indicated at the outset that he had taken the reins of his defense to prevent his accomplished legal team from introducing evidence about his psychological history, though he insisted he has no mental illness or anything to hide. He did little in his closing argument to cast a different light on his actions, opting to address the jury with a disjointed and convoluted statement that lasted less than five minutes. He followed a federal prosecutor who had just delivered a two-hour discourse on why Roof deserved the ultimate punishment for his crimes. If that rattled Roof at all, he didn't show it. Dressed in a blue sweater and slacks, he walked to the podium with a single sheet of yellow notebook paper and proceeded to tell the jury that the prosecution didn't understand him or the meaning of hate. “Anyone, including the prosecution, who thinks I am filled with hate has no idea what real hate is,” Roof said in a hollow voice, speaking from a podium about 8 feet away from the jury box. He insisted he wasn't lying when he told FBI agents that he doesn't hate black people. In his confession, he said, he made the distinction that he just doesn't like what black people do. Nor was he lying when he said he felt he had to act as he did, he said. “I think it’s safe to say that someone in their right mind wouldn’t go into a church and kill people,” he said. “You might remember in my confession to the FBI, I told them I had to do it. Obviously, that isn’t true because I didn’t have to do it. I didn’t have to do anything. But what I meant when I said that was I felt like I had to do that. And I still feel like I had to do it.” Loved ones of the nine people Roof killed crammed every seat in one side of the courtroom and listened with quiet but intense focus as he spoke. None of Roof's family members attended. Roof went on to say that the prosecution and people who hate him have been misled, but he didn't say how. He said people hate for a reason. Sometimes that means they have been misled, other times not. “Wouldn’t it be fair to say that the prosecution hates me since they are the ones trying to give me the death penalty?” he said. “You could say, ‘Of course they hate you. Everyone hates you. They have good reason to hate you.’ I’m not denying that. My point is that anyone who hates anything, in their mind, has a good reason.” Roof's brief statement contrasted with the government's lengthy and thorough closing in which Assistant U.S. Attorney Jay Richardson argued that Roof's hate-fueled massacre more than justified the death penalty in his case. Among other things, the attack involved substantial planning, targeted vulnerable people and killed multiple people, he said. After soaking up online hate, Roof plotted for months to carry out the attack, Richardson said. He scouted out his target, stockpiled ammunition and practiced shooting the pistol he bought for his mission. He then walked into the church and methodically executed black parishioners who had welcomed him into the weekly Bible study and offered him a seat right next to their pastor. ""They learned with the sounds of gunfire that the defendant had not come to learn or receive The Word,"" Richardson said. ""He came with a hate-filled heart and a Glock .45."" Richardson said Roof has shown a complete lack of remorse for his actions and has continued to write ""racist filth"" since his arrest, bragging in a jailhouse journal that he hadn't shed a single tear for those he killed. He also continued to decorate his shoes with white supremacist symbols while in jail, wearing the shoes to the very courtroom where his victims' families sat awaiting justice, Richardson said. ""You have seen nothing to indicate this defendant shows the possibility of meaningful change or redemption,"" he said. Richardson also reminded the jury of what Charleston lost. He recounted for the jury who the victims were to their families, the community and their beloved Emanuel AME Church. He offered touching tributes, accompanied by family photos of each of the nine that flashed on courtroom screens. The victims were Cynthia Hurd, 54, a library manager who stayed that night to support a friend; Susie Jackson, 87, a family matriarch who sang in the choir; Ethel Lance, 70, the church's sexton who found strength in gospel songs; DePayne Middleton Doctor, 49, a minister licensed to preach on the night of the shooting; Clementa Pinckney, 41, the church's pastor and a state senator; Tywanza Sanders, 26, a barber, poet and aspiring entrepreneur; Daniel Simmons Sr., 74, a sharp-dressing retired pastor who led the Bible study most nights; Sharonda Coleman Singleton, 45, a minister and beloved track coach; and Myra Thompson, 59, a church trustee and licensed minister who led the study lesson for the first time that night.

Almost? Almost running a story on a tweet from a fake account is just like going on national television and inventing a massacre to justify an actual policy that the White House has implemented, to the actual destruction of people’s lives? And let’s talk about the media’s role here. On the one hand, you have the “prominent editor of a liberal site” apologizing for something they almost did. On the other hand, you have Kellyanne Conway on television virtually every day despite the fact that she is a known liar. Despite the fact that she tries to pass off blatant lies as “alternative facts.” Yes, she’s a top White House aide … but anyone booking her for a television news spot knows that it’s overwhelmingly likely she will use their show to peddle lies. Why would you book her under those circumstances? The one legitimate reason to do so would be to call out her lies aggressively, to push her to the limit of her ability to lie and to expose falsehood as the Trump communications policy. But that’s not what Chris Matthews did Thursday night. Conway made up a “massacre” and attacked the media for not having covered this thing that did not exist, and Matthews just moved on. He didn’t even stop to ask her what she was talking about. Or to ask why the concern for a fake “massacre” while Trump is silent on a mass shooting at a mosque. News shows that book Kellyanne Conway do so knowing that she will use their platform to spread falsehoods. She has a proven track record on that front and shows no signs of changing. At this point, it’s on the producers and interviewers. Either they confront her lies or they own responsibility for them. Which will it be?"
567533666,2017-01-15 10:35:24,"Obama's last goodbye: Yes, we did, and yes, we still can",http://feeds.dailykos.com/~r/dailykos/index/~3/BfrOpJhw1dk/-Obama-s-last-goodbye-Yes-we-did-and-yes-we-still-can,en,False,"politics and government,united states politics and government,religion and churches,blacks,discrimination",115,Daily Kos,http://www.dailykos.com,"So President Obama has given his last speech to the nation. And he’s left a hole in my heart. We were lucky enough to get tickets to attend his farewell address. We were among those standing in line for hours to get into the huge convention center hall at Chicago’s McCormick Place where Obama would bid us all goodbye and remind us to live up to the country’s democratic ideals. But he did something even more important: He challenged those in attendance and the 24 million watching on television not to let the accomplishments of his administration be the end of a movement, but a beginning. That’s what we did. That’s what you did. You were the change. You answered people’s hopes. And because of you, by almost every measure, America is a better, stronger place than it was when we started. The huge, multi-racial crowd at McCormick Place was made up of many campaign veterans from 2008 and 2012. Many carried American flags; one woman even had three adorning her updo. The place was awash with Obama shirts, hats, jackets, stickers, and pins. Many T-shirts proudly proclaimed that the wearer was with one of the many groups affiliated with the campaign: Teachers for Obama. Pennsylvanians for Obama. One woman held her infant daughter—who was obviously not around eight years ago—wearing a pink “My Mama’s for Obama” T-shirt, perhaps passed down from an older sibling, relative, or neighbor. A woman I phone-banked with in 2008—she must have gotten there an hour or two ahead of us and was far ahead of me as the line snaked around four times the entire length of the convention hall floor—called my name and waved. Our older daughter, who worked on the 2008 campaign and (full disclosure here) has worked for the White House for six years, saw many campaign buddies and current and former co-workers. There was even an “OFAmily” party afterward for anyone who had ever worked on any of the campaigns. Many had saved and were wearing Obama campaign buttons. Many wore buttons that proudly proclaimed, “I WAS THERE,” sending the message that they were among the million-plus crowd who braved the cold in January 2009 for the inauguration of the first black president. I remember seeing so many of those buttons on the lapels of Chicagoans’ down coats in 2009. They were there then, and they were there for the farewell address. And now the Obama presidency is over, and the country is better off for it, even as many of us grimly anticipate what lies ahead. You may have watched the speech on TV or read the transcript online. You actually got a better view of it than we did; we didn’t have the VIP tickets of those sitting in front of the stage. We stood off to the side in the huge crowd and watched on a giant screen. The sound quality was so-so in such a big hall, and Obama’s words often were drowned out by sustained applause and cheers. I had to read the speech online later to see all the words and watch clips to get the full emotional impact. If you missed the address for some reason, you can read the transcript here or watch it online: Rather than repeat everything Obama said—that has been well covered by now—I want to share what we felt and what those feelings might mean going forward. The crowd was diverse in race, age, and ethnicity. It came as no surprise that many African Americans wanted to see the farewell address from the nation’s first black president. But there were Latinos, Muslims (head scarves adorned many heads), and Asians as well. Somehow, I doubt you’d see the same mix at an event for Donald Trump. The crowd also was primarily young. The majority were in their 20s and 30s—prime ages for campaign workers eight years ago and for current White House staffers. But others were high school students who were too young to vote or campaign in 2008. Why were they there? What made this speech so important? “I just felt like I had to be here,” said one high school student near me in the crowd who was there with several classmates from Collins Academy High School in North Lawndale, a poor Chicago neighborhood with high crime rates. All were wearing sweatshirts that read, “MY BLOCK. MY HOOD. MY CITY” and are with a program that takes teens from various inner-city neighborhoods on day trips to expose them to other parts of the greater community, always ending with a service project by the kids themselves. Program founder Jahmal Cole and volunteers waited in line in single-digit temperatures the previous Saturday to pick up tickets for his group, but he struck out; the tickets were gone. After a public plea, many Chicagoans donated their tickets to the teenagers. ""It would be like seeing Martin Luther King Jr. or John Kennedy speak. It's history in the making,"" Cole said in a story reporting the generosity of the city’s residents. Many former campaign colleagues hugged each other and traded stories about what they were doing now, showing pictures of spouses and children on cell phones. One young man pushed his mother in a wheelchair so she could be present. She kept telling him how much she appreciated his taking time off work to bring her to the speech. “I don’t mind,” he told her. “I’m glad to share the experience.” When you’re in line for so many hours, there’s a lot you can share with those around you. Chicago is rightly proud of its native son, even if Obama isn’t really a native and even if he ends up living elsewhere when the family leaves Washington in a few years after his sophomore daughter Sasha finishes high school. (During the speech, as the camera panned the family, many in the crowd wondered aloud why Sasha was missing. I mentioned to a guy next to me that she probably had a test the next morning, which turned out to be correct. But I did like the Twitter suggestions that she was part of a SEAL Team 6 group hunting for Trump’s tax returns.) Obama got emotional toward the end of his address, thanking his White House staff, the military, Vice President Joe Biden, his daughters, and especially Michelle Obama. Many in the crowd wiped away tears along with the first family. All that was bittersweet, as it was when he introduced what he called his “final point” about democracy being taken for granted. “NO!” the crowd shouted, not ready for him to leave the stage yet, not ready for anything final. The most gut-wrenching image for me was Obama walking off the stage. That’s when it really hit me: No more Obama. No more soaring rhetoric. No more speeches to soothe the nation after a mass shooting. No more mic-dropping humor at a White House Correspondents’ Dinner. No more calling out Republicans in campaigns. No more outlining the country’s needed priorities during the State of the Union address. No more being the only adult in a room of political children. No more standing up for what’s right. The speech demonstrated the stark difference between the outgoing and incoming presidents. Obama gave an emotional goodbye with grace and inspiration while Trump exploded in a childish tantrum both on Twitter and a train wreck of a news conference. Talk about going from class to crass, or from the sublime to slime. Even as much as we dread Trump coming into power, that’s made worse when we’re reminded of what we’re losing. On a Chicago radio talk show the morning after the speech, one caller, after admitting to quite a few tears during the farewell address, said it “felt like your big brother and his family have moved out of the house.” “You knew they wouldn’t stay forever,” she said. “But you hoped this day would never come.” The day has come. But if Barack Obama inspired anyone in our audience—or those listening around the country—to “grab a clipboard, gather some signatures, and run for office yourself,” there’s hope. I know three people, never politically active before, who are now running for office on library and school boards. Obama ran on hope, and hope was his final message to us. Show up. Dive in. Stay at it. Sometimes you’ll win. Sometimes you’ll lose. Presuming a reservoir of goodness in other people, that can be a risk, and there will be times when the process will disappoint you. But for those of us fortunate enough to have been a part of this work, and to see it up close, let me tell you, it can energize and inspire. And more often than not, your faith in America — and in Americans — will be confirmed. I am asking you to believe. Not in my ability to bring about change — but in yours."

By choosing I Accept, you consent to our use of cookies and other tracking technologies. At least five people were killed and 45 people were injured during and after a shooting Friday at the airport in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Police have identified the suspect as Esteban Santiago, a 26-year-old National Guard veteran. He most recently lived in Anchorage, Alaska — where, the Alaska Dispatch News reports, he was charged with domestic violence in January 2016. Santiago’s girlfriend told police that he had bashed in her bathroom door and tried to strangle her. He was later accused of violating his conditions of release on the January charges; police checking up on him found him at the girlfriend's house although he had been ordered to stay away. The Associated Press also reports that Santiago may have had psychological issues; he told the FBI in November that the government was controlling his mind and forced him to watch ISIS videos. But while it’s common to blame mental illness in the wake of a mass shooting, it’s incredibly misguided, as Vox’s German Lopez has explained. Mental illness just isn’t a good predictor of who will perpetrate violent behavior. But one of the best predictors of future violent behavior, researchers say, is past violent behavior. And a crucial warning sign — one too often ignored — is domestic violence against intimate partners and other family members. Not all mass shooters have a previous history of domestic violence, or of violent and erratic behavior bad enough to worry family members — but many of them do. Furthermore, most ""mass shootings"" aren't how we imagine them; they’re not school shootings or other public massacres. They’re relatively private acts of horror, preceded by red flag after red flag of abusive and violent behavior. The connection between mass shooters and allegations of domestic violence is nothing new. After Omar Mateen was identified as the perpetrator of the worst mass shooting and most deadly anti-LGBTQ hate crime in modern US history at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, his ex-wife told the media that Mateen had violently abused her during their brief marriage in 2009. There was Robert Lewis Dear, the alleged 2015 Planned Parenthood shooter in Colorado Springs, who was charged with sexually assaulting a woman at knifepoint in 1992, was accused of domestic violence by his then-wife in 1997, and had an order of protection obtained against him by a neighbor in 2002 for stalking and “unwanted advancements.” There was John Houser, who killed two and injured nine in a movie theater in Lafayette, Louisiana, in 2015, and whose wife and daughter filed an order of protection against him for domestic violence in 2008. There was James Huberty, who killed 21 people at a California McDonald’s in 1984 and whose wife reported him to police for giving her a ""messed up"" jaw. The list goes on. Mass shootings are so scary because they’re so unpredictable. They can happen anywhere and to anyone, and they are often carried out by people without criminal histories that could have prevented them from buying a gun in the first place. But in fact, most ""mass shootings"" are all too predictable. And their victims are the women and children who are entangled in the lives of violently abusive men. More than half of mass shootings (defined as a shooting in which at least four people are killed with a gun) involve a current or former intimate partner or a family member. Most of the victims of those shootings, 81 percent, are women or children. And 70 percent of all mass shootings happen inside the home, not out in public. These shootings make the local news, but they are both so private and so sadly routine that they almost never get the massive national attention that rarer public shootings do. ""Men who commit violence rehearse and perfect it against their families first,"" wrote Pamela Shifman and Salamishah Tillet in a New York Times op-ed in February. ""Women and children are target practice, and the home is the training ground for these men’s later actions."" ""We know that violence is the best predictor of future violence,"" said Shannon Frattaroli, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who researches the connection between gun violence and domestic violence. ""If someone has demonstrated past violent behavior, it's probably the best indicator we have of the risk of being violent in the future."" Domestic violence in particular is extremely predictable. It’s common for police to be called multiple times, sometimes dozens, for domestic violence incidents before a victim is ultimately murdered by her abuser. Recidivism rates for domestic abusers are high. And a substantial body of research shows that victims of domestic violence, particularly women, are put at much greater risk of being murdered when a gun is involved. So if we care about protecting victims, there’s already a lot of incentive to get guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. And indeed, there are already some laws in place  to do this. Federal law prohibits the sale or possession of guns for anyone convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor, or anyone who is subject to a domestic violence restraining order. Some states have laws that allow or require law enforcement agents to seize any guns found at the scene of a domestic violence incident. But not all states have the same laws, and federal law has significant limitations. Non-married partners who don’t live together are not protected, nor are family members other than children. It helps that federal law covers misdemeanors and restraining orders, since it’s difficult to get a felony conviction for domestic violence. But federal law only covers a full restraining order — and victims face the highest risk for violent retaliation from their abusers after an initial temporary restraining order is granted, and that comes before a full order. Implementation is also a huge barrier to taking guns away from domestic abusers, Frattaroli said. It takes a lot of action from law enforcement to actually take away someone’s gun after he has been served with a domestic violence restraining order. First, police officers have to know that an abuser owns a gun in the first place — and data on that can be spotty because not every state has a gun registry or gun sale database, and not all of those databases are complete. Then an order has to be served, which requires actually finding the offender. And then law enforcement actually has to go about seizing the firearm. “There are some places that are doing some great work to implement and enforce these laws,” Frattaroli said. “But my sense is it's not routine, it's not commonplace, it's not what is happening across the country on a systematic scale.” Plus, for new gun purchases, background checks still aren’t universal. So it’s very possible for someone who is subject to a domestic violence restraining order — temporary or otherwise — to get a gun even if he isn’t legally supposed to. Frattaroli and her colleague April Zeoli laid out a list of policy recommendations in the book Reducing Gun Violence in America. One key recommendation is universal background checks — another major proposal that congressional Democrats have been pushing in their filibusters and protests. This would help solve the implementation problems mentioned above. To further beef up implementation efforts, Zeoli and Frattaroli recommend establishing a federal training program to help state and local law enforcement agencies do a better job of enforcing the laws that already exist. They also say we should give states incentives to create gun registries, and to automatically update their background check systems as new domestic violence restraining orders and misdemeanor convictions come in. Perhaps the most intriguing suggestion Frattaroli mentioned, though, is something called a gun violence restraining order. California became the first state to pass a law like this in 2014. Much like a domestic violence restraining order, a gun violence restraining order gives a concrete, emergency legal step for victims or concerned family members to take if they know that someone close to them is dangerous. They can petition the court to prohibit the person from buying or possessing a gun for a defined period of time — a year, for instance. The basic idea behind this policy is that family members and friends of an abuser, as well as law enforcement officers who answer their distress calls, are on the front lines of abuse. They are the most likely to know if a person has a pattern of violent behavior, and they are most likely to suffer from it. Yet unless someone has committed a crime or can be involuntarily committed to a mental institution, there’s not much anyone can legally do to keep guns out of his hands. Omar Mateen was known to have a violent temper by more than one person in his life. The parents of Jared Loughner, who shot Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and killed 10 people in Tucson, Arizona, in 2011, knew he was violent and took away his shotgun but couldn’t do anything more unless he had committed a crime or unless they had decided to try to have him involuntarily committed to a mental institution. The family of Elliot Rodger, who went on a misogynistic killing spree in Santa Barbara, California, in 2014, was similarly worried about his threatening behaviors and similarly powerless to do much about it. We can’t predict who will become a mass shooter, nor can we save every potential victim of domestic violence. But it would be an unforced error not to do all we can to keep guns out of the hands of people who are known to be violent — and it’s a lot easier to predict violent behavior in general than the specific decision to commit a mass shooting.

By choosing I Accept, you consent to our use of cookies and other tracking technologies. First-person essays and interviews with unique perspectives on complicated issues. A news channel streaming the White House briefing room doesn’t normally catch my eye, but it did last Saturday as I sat at my airport gate, on the way back from vacation. I couldn’t remember the last briefing I’d seen on a weekend — my stomach started to sink as I worried that a national tragedy had happened. Instead, I watched in horror as press secretary Sean Spicer delivered a statement in which he falsely claimed that the largest audience in history witnessed Donald Trump’s inauguration. If that wasn’t unbelievable enough, the next day senior adviser Kellyanne Conway defended Spicer’s comments, saying he had provided “alternative facts.” I have never before witnessed such a disregard for facts from the White House, and I know a bit about the subject: From 2015 to 2017, I was a fact-checker for President Barack Obama. As a research associate in the Office of Communications, I quickly learned some things about the nature of facts in politics. First, that fact-checking is in-depth work. My co-workers and I pored over speech draft after speech draft, methodically verifying that every individual factual statement in any of the president’s prepared remarks was backed up by reputable sources. We worked closely with the speechwriting and policy departments to ensure that each fact the president said represented his views in an accurate, verifiable way. If we couldn’t back it up, it had to go. We thought through the possible counterarguments that people from both sides of the aisle could make to rebut our statements, and we made sure we were on as solid ground as possible. Related When I say we checked every fact, that’s not an exaggeration. Because we hunted down anything that could be debated as true or false, a page or two of remarks could take hours to comb through. Sometimes the job could feel like overkill (like when I spent half a day trying to verify the number of Bo and Sunny cookies served at the White House holiday parties). We even vetted each individual who was mentioned in remarks — even if they had been dead for a thousand years, and even if they were eighth-graders, which can really feel like overkill. But most of the time, the work of fact-checking felt like a necessary part of upholding the integrity of both President Obama and the office of the presidency as a whole. I would never claim that we were perfect, because we are human. And of course there have been times when there has been legitimate debate over our framing of a piece of information. The press played an important role in holding us to a high standard, calling out instances when the president said things that turned out to be inaccurate. But day after day, my co-workers and I came into work, sat down at our desks, and vetted the president’s words for accuracy. That’s part of what makes the institution of president of the United States strong, one that the American people can trust. The culture the Obama administration had for valuing factual accuracy doesn’t come by default — the tone is set at the top. President Obama’s respect for facts and data pervaded the entire White House, and he never made it a secret. When President Obama called on the press to fact-check his statements about the administration’s economic progress in his speech in Elkhart, Indiana, it was because he trusted what he was saying had been verified to the best of our ability, and he was proud of it. Any fact-checker knows that without widespread mutual respect for the truth, the job can feel a bit like you’re being paid to irritate writers by telling them why they’re wrong. I was lucky to work in a place where there was a culture, from the president and his speechwriters on down, that thought it was important to get things right. But this norm that we worked to uphold, which lets the American people assume by default the president is not actively trying to deceive them, is a fragile one. It only exists if our leadership believes it’s a worthwhile thing to aspire to. We were lucky in that regard, but without a leader who insists on facts, that norm can quickly crumble. In fact, the Trump administration is demonstrating that there’s pretty good incentive not to tell the truth at all. As Ezra Klein touched on recently, when Sean Spicer goes into the briefing room to tell a clear, demonstrable falsehood, he’s employing a pretty effective, apparently intentional strategy. He’s waging a war on facts that capitalizes on the strong distrust of the media that already exists in a lot of people’s minds. A lot of us heard what Spicer said and thought it was self-evidently ridiculous (just compare the photos of the two inaugurations!), but a lot of Trump voters may have heard what Spicer said and believed him. When they read headlines the next day that say Spicer used “false claims” to attack the media’s reporting of turnout, they may not be inclined to believe those claims actually were false — they may be more likely to believe the dishonest media is out to get Trump. Heightening that distrust is a useful tool for the Trump team, particularly with more significant battles ahead. In reality, there is no incentive for the Trump administration to stick to the truth, particularly when it drives a helpful wedge deeper between their base and the press. Things seem likely to stay that way unless that wedge stops being useful — if the public, especially Trump supporters, starts to doubt what they hear from the president and his administration. The Trump administration’s treatment of the truth has me thinking about another phenomenon I learned as a fact-checker: Though there is no politician who receives higher scrutiny than the president, a lot of what a president or his team announces is taken as fact. For example, a few months ago, President Obama announced the 2014-’15 high school graduation rate had increased from the year prior to 83.2 percent. When the press reported this, they didn’t say, “President Obama claimed today that the high school graduation rate increased.” They reported the graduation rate had gone up. His statement was reported as a fact, not a claim. This happens a lot, and that’s partly because many of the announcements we made were statistics that outlets could independently verify, but it also is partly because when the president of the United States announces something, and puts out a fact sheet and data about it, the tendency is to believe it’s true. On top of this, there is simply not enough bandwidth for outlets to verify every single thing the president says. However, the inclination to publish the president’s words as facts and not claims must change to adapt to a time when the White House has already shown a willingness to lie about something as silly as inaugural crowds. In a recent briefing, Spicer refused to confirm that President Trump believes the unemployment rate is 4.7 percent as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the broadly accepted measure that politicians, economists, and journalists use to track how employment is doing. How will reporters frame it if the Trump administration announces the unemployment rate is something other than what the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports — as a fact, or a claim? What happens if the Trump administration directs the bureau, a federal agency, to release data that’s altogether false — how will the media independently verify those numbers? This spans every aspect of the presidency too, not just employment announcements. If economic statistics don’t bother you, think about this: What happens when there is a national emergency, like a mass shooting, and the country looks to the president to explain what’s going on? Will the press and the public trust him to tell the truth? When Kellyanne Conway told NBC that the Trump administration was using “alternative facts,” she rightly received a lot of criticism for it. The moment was an affront to the integrity of the presidency, but it also reminded me of something else I learned as a fact-checker: Even the truth can be deceiving when cherry-picked. Pay attention to exactly what is being said, and think about why certain facts are being presented rather than other alternatives. A good example of using the truth to deceive is Spicer’s statement on Saturday. Here’s a section of what he said: “We know that 420,000 people used the DC Metro public transit yesterday, which actually compares to 317,000 that used it for President Obama's last inaugural.” Let’s take that last piece. It is true that 317,000 people did travel using Metro as of 11 am on the day of President Obama’s second inauguration. That’s not a bad way to estimate how many people attended the event; a lot of people opted to take public transportation, and admission is in the morning. To a reasonable person listening to Spicer’s remarks, this line might sound plausible and convincing, and it might even seem to prove Spicer right about President Trump’s crowd size. If you went as far as to search for that figure yourself, you could confirm that particular number was accurate. The problem is Spicer doesn’t compare that number with its logical equivalent: Metro ridership by 11 am on President Trump’s Inauguration Day, which was 193,000. And if he had really wanted to get things right, it would’ve been fairer to compare President Trump’s first inauguration with President Obama’s first inauguration, since first inaugurations often have higher attendance. As many journalists have already pointed out, President Obama’s first inauguration also has President Trump beat. Of course, the biggest problem of all is that 420,000 number, which can’t be confirmed. Spicer even admitted the next day it doesn’t come from Metro. That number is pretty close to the total number of rides taken on Metro on Inauguration Day, 570,000 entries, but even if he had correctly cited that number, it would’ve been misleading to compare it with the 11 am total for Obama. The inauguration crowd size doesn’t matter at the end of the day. But what does matter is Spicer knows how to deceive the public by using factual statements. Given a range of possible statistics about crowd size, Spicer selected a very specific one that he could highlight to advance his point and ignored the other ones, and that’s deception by telling the truth. As time goes on, it’s likely some pundits will want to praise the Trump team when they do use facts that are based in reality, like that 317,000 number. That’s a big mistake, because the Trump administration will keep using facts to mislead people. The Trump administration will also keep lying. They will keep doing it, at the expense of the trustworthiness of the office of the president, because it is helping them wage their short-term battles. The press needs to play a major part in combating this, by stating upfront in their reporting when a Trump official says something deceitful or lies outright, approaching every Trump announcement with skepticism, and continuing to push Trump officials in briefings and interviews on dishonesties. But they can’t do it alone. The press’s efforts to demand accuracy can be painted as more antics by a dishonest media if the public is not on their side. My best advice for the public is for everyone to do a little fact-checking of their own. Listen to exactly what is being said, see if it sounds right to you, and then do a Google search to see if a major piece of context has been omitted. See if you can find a primary source, like the original data source of the numbers they quote, or a transcript or video of a moment they claim happened. Compare the things President Trump says today with the things he said months ago and see where they contradict each other. See where his advisers contradict each other. Read as widely as possible, make your own conclusions, and trust your judgment. Then make sure you start telling people about it, and make sure your voice is heard.

President Donald Trump released a brief statement to commemorate International Holocaust Remembrance Day, a small, symbolic step taken by past presidents to mark one of the world’s greatest tragedies. It didn’t take long for many people to notice that a key word was missing: Jews. “It is with a heavy heart and somber mind that we remember and honor the victims, survivors, heroes of the Holocaust,” Trump’s statement began. “It is impossible to fully fathom the depravity and horror inflicted on innocent people by Nazi terror.” As critics quickly noted, there was no mention that 6 million Jews died in the Holocaust, or an acknowledgment of the virulent, state-sponsored anti-Semitism that led to their deaths — details that are crucial and commonplace in most discussions of the Holocaust. Then, on Saturday, the White House said that Jews had been omitted from the statement on purpose because other victims also suffered and died in the Holocaust, an explanation that seemed to minimize the effects of a genocide that killed two-thirds of the Jewish population of Europe. Sen. Tim Kaine called it “Holocaust denial.” The context here matters. Trump’s most fervent supporters included outspoken anti-Semites, online trolls on the “alt-right” who delighted at tormenting Jewish journalists and public figures. His campaign flirted with anti-Semitic tropes, including tweeting an image of a star of David with Hillary Clinton’s face superimposed on a pile of money. His closing ad warned of a shadowy cabal of bankers and international elites. His son casually used the phrase “warming up the gas chambers” to refer to vociferous criticism. In each case, Trump and his inner circle refused to back down or apologize, and his anti-Semitic fans interpreted those controversies as coded signals in their favor. Now that he’s president, the same dynamic is playing out around his statement on the Holocaust. Here’s Trump’s full statement on January 27, the anniversary of the liberation of the largest Nazi concentration camp, Auschwitz, which was designated as International Holocaust Remembrance Day by the United Nations in 2005: It is with a heavy heart and somber mind that we remember and honor the victims, survivors, heroes of the Holocaust. It is impossible to fully fathom the depravity and horror inflicted on innocent people by Nazi terror. Yet, we know that in the darkest hours of humanity, light shines the brightest.‎ As we remember those who died, we are deeply grateful to those who risked their lives to save the innocent. In the name of the perished, I pledge to do everything in my power throughout my Presidency, and my life, to ensure that the forces of evil never again defeat the powers of good. Together, we will make love and tolerance prevalent throughout the world. Compare that with President Barack Obama’s past statements on the same subject; “Today, with heavy hearts, we remember the six million Jews and the millions of other victims of Nazi brutality who were murdered during the Holocaust,” Obama began his statement on Yom HaShoah, the Israeli Holocaust remembrance day, in 2016. “With their example to guide us, together we must firmly and forcefully condemn the anti-Semitism that is still far too common today.” Obama’s statement is clear about the hatred and mass murder of Jews. A similar statement from President George W. Bush, in 2007, didn’t mention the death toll but did condemn anti-Semitism specifically. Trump’s statement, on the other hand, is so vague that it could apply to nearly any tragic event. Substitute the name of a terrorist attack or mass shooting for “the Holocaust,” and “terrorism” or “gun violence” for “Nazi terror,” and it wouldn’t seem out of place. Spokesperson Hope Hicks told CNN that the wording was intentional: “Despite what the media reports, we are an incredibly inclusive group and we took into account all of those who suffered,” Hicks said. In other words, the Trump administration didn’t include Jews in its statement about the Holocaust to avoid emphasizing their suffering in a genocide that targeted them directly. Over the weekend, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said he didn’t regret the wording of the statement. “I mean, everyone's suffering in the Holocaust including obviously all of the Jewish people affected, and the miserable genocide that occurred is something that we consider to be extraordinarily sad and something that can never be forgotten,” he said. Monday, communications director Sean Spicer continued to push back against the criticism, calling it “ridiculous,” “pathetic,” and “nitpicking.” “The president went out of his way to recognize the Holocaust,” he said. Both Hicks’s explanation and the original White House statement, critics argued, minimized the centrality of anti-Semitism to the Holocaust. “Holocaust denial is alive and well in the highest offices of the United States,” Deborah Lipstadt, a historian and expert on Holocaust denial, wrote for The Atlantic. Hicks cited a Huffington Post article that counted 5 million additional victims of the Holocaust, naming people with mental illnesses, priests, twins, Roma (gypsies), and gay people. But those victims, according to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, numbered in the hundreds of thousands, not the millions. It is obviously a tragedy that so many people died at the hands of the Nazi regime, and it is worth remembering those lost. But the Holocaust was the culmination of a systematic, state-sponsored campaign of anti-Semitic persecution that eliminated two-thirds of the Jewish population of Europe. “There were indeed millions of innocent people whom the Nazis killed in many horrific ways, some in the course of the war and some because the Germans perceived them—however deluded their perception—to pose a threat to their rule,” Lipstadt wrote, calling the question a matter of “historical accuracy and not of comparative pain.” “They suffered terribly. But that was not the Holocaust.” Lipstadt, who has studied and analyzed Holocaust deniers, wrote that she assumed at first the omission was an innocent mistake. But Hicks’s justification, she said, was “classic softcore denial” — not denying that the Holocaust happened but minimizing it, including by implying that Jews are stealing the attention from other victims. Ron Dermer, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, gave a speech Friday at the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, and argued against “universalizing” the Holocaust as a symbol of prejudice and intolerance globally rather than anti-Semitism specifically. “After the Holocaust took away so much from the Jews, we must not take the Holocaust itself away from the Jews,” Dermer said, calling it an “unforgivable betrayal.” “Those victims were murdered not merely because they were different. They were murdered not merely because they were an ‘other.’ They were murdered because they were Jews.” John Podhoretz, the editor of Commentary magazine, saw the statement as “the culmination of decades of ill feeling that seems to center on the idea that the Jews have somehow made unfair ‘use’ of the Holocaust and it should not ‘belong’ to them. Someone in that nascent White House thought it was time to reflect that view through the omission of the specifically Jewish quality of the Holocaust.” The Republican Jewish Coalition and the Zionist Organization of America, two Republican Jewish groups that have been generally supportive of Trump, issued statements calling his omission of Jews from the statement regrettable. “As supporters of President Trump, we know that he holds in his heart the memory of the six million victims of the Holocaust, and is committed not just to their memory, but ensuring it never happens again,” the statement from the Republican Jewish Coalition — heavily financed by the casino magnate and Republican donor Sheldon Adelson, who also donated to Trump — read. The broader context for the controversy over the Holocaust statement is that Trump’s run for office was greeted enthusiastically by the loose collection of white nationalists and anti-Semites known as the “alt-right.” Throughout the campaign, Trump was often slow to repudiate those supporters and occasionally made gestures that they read as coded messages. As Priebus noted Saturday, Trump’s daughter Ivanka has converted to Judaism, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is an Orthodox Jew and crucial White House adviser. From his life before entering politics, there was little evidence that he had personal animus toward Jews. But during the campaign, he was caught in several controversies involving anti-Semitism. Trump was slow to denounced KKK leader David Duke. He deployed a meme that imposed a Star of David and Hillary Clinton’s face on top of a pile of money and was widely perceived as anti-Semitic — then refused to back down or apologize. He adopted the phrase “America First,” associated strongly with anti-Semitic isolationism in the United States before World War II. His son, Donald Trump Jr., said that if Republicans had behaved like Hillary Clinton, the media “would be warming up the gas chambers” — an odd choice of phrase that neo-Nazi websites celebrated. The campaign ad Trump employed to make his closing argument against Hillary Clinton was a collection of anti-Semitic stereotypes, featuring image of George Soros, Janet Yellen, and Goldman Sachs chair Lloyd Blankfein — all Jews — while accusing them of being global special interests who “control the levers of power” and “don’t have your interest in mind.” Meanwhile, Trump’s campaign energized and emboldened anti-Semites, who embarked on a campaign of tweeting Holocaust references at Jewish journalists. After the election, Trump said he’d never intended to do this and that he disavowed “the group,” meaning the alt-right. But he only said that after he’s won. Now that he’s in the White House, the same groups that cheered the Star of David tweets and Donald Trump Jr.’s “gas chamber” remark are celebrating the White House proclamation. “Jews triggered into mindless rage at Trump Holocaust memorial statement,” the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer wrote, illustrated with an image of Pepe the Frog. They still think they hear a dog whistle — but this time, it’s coming not just from a campaign but from the Oval Office. Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

As Mediaite notes, Republican State Sen. Greg Steube unveiled a new piece of legislation aimed at overturning existing gun bans at airports, college campuses, and government meetings. ""If you want to kill as many people as possible before the cops arrive then you are likely to go to a place where law-abiding citizens can’t carry,"" Steube argued when introducing his bill, according to the Tallahassee Democrat. ""That’s what we’ve seen, time and time again and why I think we shouldn’t have them."" Steube, a Republican from Sarasota, has been a favorite of Florida gun advocates for years, as he was one of the fiercest opponents of gun-free zones during his time as a member of the Florida House of Representatives. A Melania Trump pal who was appointed to the prestigious Kennedy Center board by former president Donald Trump recently left Washington amid scandal, after sending a series of text messages to DC power players accusing a woman he had a relationship with of being a prostitute. Paolo Zampolli once represented Melania Trump in her modeling career, and introduced her to Donald Trump in 1998.                British soul diva Adele on Friday released comeback single ""Easy On Me"", in which she shares with the world details of the traumatic six years she has endured since last releasing a record. In that period, the 33-year-old megastar said she suffered a ""year of anxiety"" in which her marriage fell apart.            The husband of Kenyan double world championships medallist Agnes Tirop, who was stabbed to death in a killing that has shocked her home country and the world of athletics, was due in court Friday after a dramatic late-night arrest.

Lauderdale shooting suspect by police last year,http://www.rawstory.com/2017/01/gun-was-given-back-to-ft-lauderdale-shooting-suspect-last-year/,en,False,"politics and government,united states politics and government,armament, defense and military forces,terrorism,united states armament and defense",1127,Raw Story,http://rawstory.com,"Police in Alaska last year took a handgun from the man accused of killing five people at Fort Lauderdale's airport on Friday, but returned it to him last month after a medical evaluation found he was not mentally ill, authorities said. Esteban Santiago, a 26-year-old Iraq war veteran, had a history of acting erratically and investigators are probing whether mental illness played a role in America's latest mass shooting. Marlin Ritzman, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's office in Anchorage, told a news conference on Saturday that Santiago walked into the office in November and told agents his mind was being controlled by a U.S. intelligence agency. He was turned over to local police who took him to a medical facility for a mental evaluation. ""Santiago was having terroristic thoughts and believed he was being influenced by ISIS (the Islamic State militant group,)"" Anchorage Police Chief Chris Tolley told the news conference. A handgun that was taken from Santiago by police during the evaluation was returned to him early last month, Tolley told the news conference. The police chief said it was not clear if it was the same weapon used on Friday. Officials in Anchorage said the gun was returned because Santiago had not been adjudicated to be mentally ill. ""As far as I know, this is not somebody that would have been prohibited (from having a gun) based on the information they had,"" U.S. Attorney Karen Loeffler told the news conference. Investigators have not ruled out terrorism as a motive and say the suspect's recent travel is being reviewed. SIX SUFFERED GUNSHOT WOUNDS Five people were killed and six wounded in Friday's rampage, while some three dozen were taken to local hospitals with bruises or broken bones suffered in the chaos as passengers fled the crowded baggage claim area. Authorities say Santiago arrived in Ft. Lauderdale on a connecting flight from Alaska, and that he retrieved a 9mm semi-automatic handgun from his checked luggage before loading it in a bathroom and then shooting indiscriminately. Witnesses said the gunman, who was wearing a blue ""Star Wars"" T-shirt, said nothing as he fired, and that he surrendered to police only after running out of ammunition. Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel told a separate news conference it took the first deputy about 70 to 80 seconds to contact the suspect after the first shots rang out. Authorities say three of the six victims who suffered gunshot wounds are in intensive care. The others are in good condition. Those killed included a volunteer firefighter in his sixties and a retiree on holiday with her husband. Santiago served from 2007 to 2016 in the Puerto Rico National Guard and Alaska National Guard including a deployment to Iraq from 2010 to 2011, according to the Pentagon. A private first class and combat engineer, he received half a dozen medals before being transferred to the inactive ready reserve in August last year. An aunt said he came back from his deployment ""a different person,"" MSNBC reported. The attack was the latest in a series of U.S. mass shootings, some inspired by Islamist militants, others carried out by loners or the mentally disturbed. Last June, Florida was the scene of the deadliest shooting rampage in modern U.S. history, when a gunman apparently inspired by Islamic State killed 49 people and wounded 53 at the gay nightclub ""Pulse"" in Orlando.

Noor Salman, 30, aided and abetted husband Omar Mateen in his attempt to provide material support to a terrorist organization, federal prosecutors said. They also accuse her of obstructing justice by lying to authorities investigating the June 2016 massacre. Salman appeared in federal court in Oakland, California, in an orange jail uniform and remained silent. An attorney entered the not guilty pleas on her behalf. Salman, the first person charged by U.S. authorities in connection with the attack, faces up to life in prison if convicted. Her husband was killed in a shootout with police after taking hostages during a three-hour standoff at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. Salman was not present during the shooting, which also left dozens wounded and intensified fears about attacks by Americans inspired by Islamic State, the militant organization. A grand jury indictment unsealed on Tuesday accused her of criminal activity beginning as early as April, several months before the massacre, but did not give details on how she helped Mateen. Prosecutors did not disclose more information on Wednesday. Hearings will be held later regarding her legal representation, detention and expected transfer to Florida. Salman was arrested on Monday in California, where she was living with her mother in the San Francisco area. Mateen, 29, pledged allegiance to the leader of Islamic State during the shooting. He had been investigated twice by the FBI for possible connections with militant Islamist groups. Mateen, who lived in Fort Pierce, Florida, with Salman and their young son, was self-radicalized and acted alone without assistance or orders from abroad, according to U.S. authorities. Salman, a U.S. citizen and the daughter of parents who emigrated from the West Bank in 1985, was physically abused by Mateen, her uncle, Al Salman, told reporters on Tuesday. The uncle said she was innocent and had no idea of her husband's plans.

""You're in my head every day,"" Felicia Sanders told Roof, condemned by jurors on Tuesday to die for the 2015 killings at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. The same jury of nine whites and three blacks last month found him guilty of 33 federal charges, including hate crimes and obstruction of religion. Wednesday's sentencing of Roof is a formality as the judge cannot alter the jury's decision on the death penalty. Sanders, 59, was the first of those affected by the tragedy to speak at the 22-year-old white supremacist's formal sentencing hearing in federal court. Her son, 26-year-old Tywanza Sanders, died in the attack. ""I cannot shut my eyes to pray, even when I try I cannot because I have to keep my eye on everyone around me,"" she said. She showed Roof her blood-stained Bible from the evening of June 17, 2015, when he gunned down churchgoers gathered to study scripture. ""Yes I forgave you,"" she said. ""That was the easiest thing I had to do. But you can't help someone who won't help themselves."" Her words echoed Roof's first court appearance after the shooting, where some loved ones of the victims shocked the country with their merciful tone toward the suspect. But Sanders and others have learned more about Roof in the 19 months since, hearing at his trial about his hatred toward minorities, the calculated nature of the shooting and his lack of remorse. The dead included Tywanza Sanders; Clementa Pinckney, 41, the church’s pastor and a state senator; DePayne Middleton Doctor, 49; Sharonda Coleman Singleton, 45; Cynthia Hurd, 54; Susie Jackson, 87; Ethel Lance, 70; Myra Thompson, 59; and Daniel Simmons Sr., 74. On Wednesday, family members called Roof a coward and a fool and said he deserved the death penalty. Some asked him to look at them as they spoke. He did not. ""I wish they could enact another law to cut off a limb each time you go up to appeal,"" said Tyrone Sanders, husband of Felicia and father of Tywanza. Despite the hurt and anger, however, several people said they remained committed to forgiveness. ""I wanted to hate you, God, I wanted to hate you, but my faith told me no,"" said Doctor's sister, Bethane Middleton Brown. ""You didn't win.""

John Lewis' announcement that he would not attend the inauguration, a lot of people were aghast that he would accuse a civil rights icon of ""all talk, talk, talk — no action."" They couldn't believe the incoming president would so crudely caricature Lewis' district as being ""in horrible shape and falling apart not to mention crime infested"" when Lewis represents Atlanta, which Forbes recently ranked as the ninth-best place in America for businesses and career development and among the best for job growth and education. The city's crime rate has also been steadily declining since the '90s.  In other words, as usual, Trump was not telling the truth. It's important to recognize what was really going on there, however. It seems obvious to me that Trump had never heard of Lewis and had no idea where he is from. He was reflexively repeating his standard campaign talking points about the ""inner city"" in which he complained that nobody has ever done anything about the dystopian hellholes that he believes all African-Americans inhabit. Trump claimed to be the only man in the country who could fix the problem, although he never shared the details. If you look at his history, however, it's not hard to figure out what he plans. Trump's view of race in America is very simple: If the police could take the gloves off, this would fix whatever problems exist. He is particularly adamant about applying the death penalty. He famously took out a full-page ad in New York newspapers after the arrests of the young men known as the Central Park Five (four being black and one Latino) in the rape and beating of a white jogger in 1989. The five men spent years in prison before being exonerated by DNA evidence and the confession of another man, a career criminal with a long prison record. Trump has said that he still believes they are guilty. The big, bold title of the ad was ""BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY, BRING BACK OUR POLICE!"" Even then, Trump wanted to make America great again by returning to the days of his youth when the cops could crack some heads. The ad said: When I was young, I sat in a diner with my father and witnessed two young bullies cursing and threatening a very frightened waitress. Two cops rushed in, lifted up the thugs and threw them out the door, warning them never to cause trouble again. I miss the feeling of security New York's finest once gave to the citizens of this City. Let our politicians give back our police department's power to keep us safe. Unshackle them from the constant chant of ""police brutality"" which every petty criminal hurls immediately at an officer who has just risked his or her life to save another's. We must cease our continuous pandering to the criminal population of this City. Give New York back to the citizens who have earned the right to be New Yorkers. Trump has a few bedrock beliefs that he has held for decades: The world is laughing at America, Asian nations are making fools of the U.S. on trade, we must bring back the death penalty and law enforcement must be given more power. These represent the the fundamental philosophy that propelled him to the presidency. Throughout the campaign Trump reiterated his strong pro-police stance. But it wasn't until July's mass shooting of police officers in Dallas that he came out roaring out with his declaration: The attack on our Dallas police is an attack on our country. . . . It's time for our hostility against our police and against all members of law enforcement to end and end immediately right now. . . . I am the law and order candidate. He used the line repeatedly from then on, including during his angry acceptance speech at the Republican convention. Eventually he was endorsed by the National Fraternal Order of Police, the unions representing Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and numerous local police organizations throughout the country. Trump was celebrated by cops everywhere he went, and there are many pictures to prove it. He likes them and they like him. After the election, the Fraternal Order of Police issued a wish list for the first 100 days. It includes reinstituting racial profiling, deporting Dreamers (undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children and ending sanctuary-city programs. Whatever advances we may have made toward reform of the criminal justice system don't look as if they are going to hold. Trump's loyalty and reverence for the police and his racist 1970s stereotypes of African-American communities make for a dangerous brew, particularly considering a recent Pew Research center report about attitudes in law enforcement. This research painted a highly disturbing portrait of police officers who increasingly see themselves as under siege and who long for more power and authority — with important differences in attitudes between white and black police officers, particularly regarding the protests against police shootings. That points to a potentially volatile situation. Trump often brings up the distressing gun violence in Chicago as if it were emblematic of all major American cities. It's not, actually. This week the Justice Department released a new study about Chicago's finest, suggesting that the gloves are already off: Police in the Windy City routinely use whatever force they deem necessary, and there is very little accountability for it. Illinois recently repealed the death penalty after it was revealed that at least 13 men had been wrongly condemned to death row. Apparently, Trump's ""get tough"" policing doesn't work in real life. Not that he is likely to believe that. As he said during the campaign and as far back as 1990 in a Playboy interview: In order to bring law and order back into our cities, we need the death penalty and authority given back to the police. . . . It sets an example. Nobody can make the argument that the death penalty isn't a deterrent. In reality, anyone who knows anything about the subject will make precisely that argument. Trump simply won't listen. He believes what he believes, and from what we can tell, he is incapable of changing his mind about any of it.

Profiling Ivanka and Tiffany Trump, SARAH ELLISON explores the perks and perils of being Donald Trump’s daughter While one sister coolly leveraged her father’s favor into a business of her own, as well as an influential behind-the-scenes role in his campaign and on the transition team, the other, 12 years younger, is still finding her place in the family. Profiling Ivanka and Tiffany Trump, SARAH ELLISON explores the perks and perils of being Donald Trump’s daughter The whispers started in the spring of 2016, and got louder as summer began. '‘You should look into Jared—he is in over his head on the campaign.” The pitch was the same, according to multiple reporters: Look into Jared—he doesn’t know what he’s doing. Corey Lewandowski, the rough-edged early campaign manager for Donald J. Trump, allegedly was trying to plant a negative story about Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Infighting among staffers is a feature of most political campaigns, and the fighting within Trump’s campaign was, as one might expect, more public and vitriolic than most. Lewandowski was known for being aggressive—he clashed with Paul Manafort, another top Trump aide. But this time he had chosen the wrong target. Kushner was growing in influence, and would come to take a significant role in the campaign. More important, Kushner is married to Trump’s favorite child, his daughter Ivanka. Within weeks of hearing about Lewandowski’s alleged betrayal, Ivanka talked privately with her father, according to a person familiar with the exchange. It was Lewandowski who was not up to the task, Ivanka explained. Lewandowski had been fine during the Republican primaries, she said, voicing an assessment held by many in the campaign. But now, as the Republican convention and general election approached, Trump needed someone more professional, someone with more gravitas. On the morning of June 20, after the regular Trump family meeting that occurred every Monday morning at 9:30, a security detail ushered Lewandowski out of Trump Tower. Ivanka did not personally deliver the news to Lewandowski, but “she closed the coffin on him,” one former campaign staff member told me. “It was Ivanka who saved the day.” (Lewandowski e-mailed in response: “I never had any conversations about Jared Kushner’s role in the campaign.”) The episode is instructive for anyone trying to understand Ivanka Trump’s influence in her father’s coming administration. Ivanka is, like her father, capable of chameleon-like conversions and of creating a powerful public persona. And, like him, she will not condone disobedience within the ranks, particularly when it comes to someone who crosses the family. Regarding her role in Lewandowski’s ouster, Ivanka told a friend, “He wasn’t up to the task that was coming and he did not know that.” She went on to add something that should be borne in mind by everyone who engages with her: “Obviously we don’t want people around who aren’t trustworthy. We are a family. It is about trust.” As Ivanka took to the campaign trail in support of her father, she was joined by her half-sister, Tiffany, who appears to be a willing understudy to the older Ivanka’s style of family influence. Tiffany looks up to her sister. “Ivanka has such a brand and a personality and consistency in her Instagram,” a friend of Tiffany’s told me. Whereas Tiffany, who recently graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, “is jumping into this whole process with both feet. She hasn’t polished it yet.” Not only does Ivanka give her younger sister “politics advice, boy advice, and sisterly advice,” the friend told me, but she also gives advice on things like “this is the color that looks best on camera” or, when wearing a dress, “make sure when you sit down you cross your legs.” Basically, “all the things she picked up from being famous.” Recently, Tiffany, who is known as Tiff to friends, took her Secret Service detail with her to Bloomingdale’s to pick up a lipstick Ivanka had recommended. Ivanka is the most famous Trump, after her father. So much so that her younger brother, Eric, who runs his own foundation, recently offered for charity auction a coffee with Ivanka, an experience he valued at $50,000. Despite her willingness to commercialize most aspects of her life, she is also the Trump who is seen as most reasonable. She has told friends that her father’s presidency is “so much bigger” than the family, and she is eager to play a role on the policy issues she cares most about, namely child care and paid maternity leave. (The issue “is not on the Republican agenda and I have to get it there,” she told a friend recently.) The president-elect initially said that, in order to avoid conflicts of interest, his three oldest children would run his real-estate company. But at press time it looked likely that he wanted Ivanka in Washington. A person close to her explained that she will likely be taking a reduced role in the Trump Organization in order to separate herself from her father’s company and limit conflicts of interest. As Donald Trump prepares to become the 45th president of the United States, his daughter Ivanka provides a template for his most successful relationship: never challenging him in public, but providing him counsel behind the scenes, and above all making him look good. Tiffany Trump makes a single appearance in Ivanka Trump’s first book, The Trump Card: Playing to Win in Work and Life, The scene takes place about eight years ago, when Tiffany, Donald Trump’s only child from his second marriage, sheepishly approached Ivanka, the only daughter from his first marriage, about a delicate matter. Because Tiffany and her mother, Marla Maples, lived in California, Tiffany grew up a continent away from her father. She didn’t have access to him the way Ivanka and Ivanka’s two brothers did—the three of them lived with their mother only an elevator ride away from Donald Trump in Trump Tower, in Manhattan. The 15-year-old Tiffany wanted to talk to Ivanka, 12 years her senior, about how to approach their father about something sensitive. Tiffany had some “relatively simple money needs” to address, Ivanka recalled. She did not have access to a parental credit card, though many of her friends did. Ivanka noted that Tiffany’s request came “not because she was spoiled” but because she was a teenager just trying to fit in with her peers at school. Tiffany’s trepidation made Ivanka proud, she said, of the values that her father had instilled about money in “all of his children.” Donald Trump himself boasts about his money all the time. But the Trump children, Ivanka wrote, were not spoiled by boundless trust funds. It is one of the many moments in the book when Ivanka makes passing reference to her own virtue in this regard. Ivanka was sympathetic to her half-sister’s situation. While she and her brothers, Donald junior and Eric, didn’t treat their father “as an A.T.M.,” they had been the beneficiaries of his generosity and were given a “special treat” from time to time. Ivanka doesn’t specify what all those special treats were, but, to take one example, Donald Trump once arranged for Michael Jackson to watch Ivanka dance as a young girl in The Nutcracker. “I imagine Tiffany didn’t get to enjoy the same surprises, just by virtue of lack of proximity,” Ivanka wrote. “All she wanted, really, was a way to enjoy some of the privileges her friends got to enjoy, in the same way she would have enjoyed them if she’d lived under our father’s roof.” Tiffany had already worked out a strategy for how to approach their father, which she shared with her sister. Ivanka tried to quiet her nerves. In the end, though, Tiffany never had to make the ask. As Ivanka explained, “Big Sis did an end-around to save Tiffany the trouble. I didn’t tell her, of course”— well, except in the book—“but I went to our father and suggested he think about surprising Tiffany with a credit card for Christmas, with a small monthly allowance on it. Sure enough, he did just that. Tiffany was thrilled and relieved. And so appreciative.” The ostensible lesson of this story may be that the Trump children are not spoiled, but another interpretation is that Ivanka is the daughter who understands her father best—the one with all the access. In this way, we are all Tiffany Trump, reliant on Ivanka to get her father to do the right thing. Ivanka Trump was for many years the only daughter the public knew. Tiffany, for her part, has been identified as the “forgotten” Trump, which is an odd form of fame. She showed up late on the campaign trail, after her graduation. Even then she appeared mostly under the protective wing of her half-sister. Growing up in Calabasas, California, outside of Los Angeles, Tiffany knew the Kardashian children, and their mothers were friends. It’s a parallel she may now relate to more than she ever has before, though it would be a mistake to conclude that it defines Tiffany as a person. Ivanka expresses warmth for Tiffany, gushing about her to People magazine. “She’s my little sister! I’ve been close to Tiffany her whole life, and I really love her,” Ivanka told the magazine. (Ivanka pointedly noted that she is not close to Tiffany’s mother, Marla Maples.) Far more than their brothers, Ivanka and Tiffany are at home with social media. Tiffany is best known as one of the so-called Rich Kids of Instagram, where she chronicles a glitzy version of life among her wealthy friends—lounging poolside in Bora Bora, jumping waves at Mar-a-Lago, dressing up for New York Fashion Week. Ivanka has mastered the art of staying in the spotlight, from her teenage appearance in the 2003 documentary Born Rich, which chronicled the lives of heirs and heiresses, to her days as a catwalk model (she is five feet eleven inches tall), an Apprentice supporting-cast member, and a perfectly coiffed mother of three with two high-powered jobs, one of which involves selling Ivanka Trump-branded clothing and accessories. The Ivanka Trump line seeks to capture a young professional woman who is looking for an “affordable luxury”—clothing that falls somewhere between J. Crew and Zara—and offers items such as an $89 metallic knit sweater, a $69 polyester floral blouse, and a $145 pair of fringed high-heel sandals. (The sandals were the subject of a lawsuit in Manhattan federal court earlier this year, when the Italian shoe manufacturer Aquazzura alleged that Ivanka’s company and her manufacturer had knocked off Aquazzura’s own popular fringed sandal, Wild Thing, which sells for $785. Ivanka’s lawyers filed papers in August denying all allegations and arguing for the suit’s dismissal.) Many people who object to Trump the father—and to the sons—feel differently about the daughters. One of them is a well-established extension of the Trump brand; the other, still emerging from what seems a plasticine pod, has a head on her shoulders. She was reportedly spotted touring Harvard Law School. For the purposes of his campaign, Donald Trump’s daughters were his most useful children. Their presence seemed to imply that the man they knew could not have been someone who once said about women (as he did) that you had to “treat ’em like shit” in order to keep them in their place. When women lined up to accuse him of sexual harassment, Trump repeatedly asked the public to look to Ivanka, who could attest to his good character. When Tiffany graduated from college, Ivanka helped bring Tiffany into the fold, and they bonded in service of their father. Some sisters share clothing; Ivanka’s public-relations firm is at Tiffany’s disposal. On Election Day, both sisters voted for their father, along with 53 percent of white women in America. For both daughters, the Trump brand has been a defining aspect of their lives. As her parents’ marriage broke apart, Ivanka tearfully asked her mother if the divorce meant that she wouldn’t be “Ivanka Trump” anymore. Once, as a teenager, she considered getting her navel pierced. Her father called just as she was about to have it done. She elected at that moment not to go through with it—the umbilical attachment proving too strong. As she noted in The Trump Card, she had to “preserve and protect the family name and reputation, which, after all, were now my name and reputation, too.” Born into a family of some influence, Ivanka has seemed to strive to layer on a stratum of respectability as well. This posture has made her the go-to Trump for those seeking a conduit to the administration. When Nancy Pelosi called the president-elect, he handed the phone to Ivanka to talk to the House minority leader about family-leave policies. Ivanka met with Al Gore to discuss climate change before he talked to her father, and also conferred with Leonardo DiCaprio on the same subject. Her position has also opened her up to campaigns such as @DearIvanka, which uses her polished Instagram photos and juxtaposes them with pleas for her to talk some sense into her father. Each one begins with @DearIvanka, and then goes on: “I’m afraid of the swastikas spray painted on my park”; “I’ve been raped and I need to have an abortion”; “I’m an American Muslim and I was attacked on the subway.” But with Trump’s election victory, Ivanka is undeterred. “No one is more psyched about his win than she is,” a friend of hers told me. Ivanka occupies the middle position between Don junior and Eric. She passed her childhood in a lavender bedroom on the 68th floor of Trump Tower, overlooking Central Park. Their mother, Ivana, was a Czech-born competitive skier who, after she married Donald, became a Manhattan socialite and joined her husband in managing various Trump properties during their 12-year marriage. Ivana and Donald were not around much when Ivanka was growing up. The children had two nannies and a bodyguard. On one occasion the children set up a lemonade stand at the family’s country house, in Greenwich, Connecticut—but having no real neighbors because the estate was so large, the kids had to make do with selling lemonade to the bodyguard and the house staff. During Ivanka’s childhood, Ivana was the C.E.O. for Trump’s Castle casino, in Atlantic City, and spent several days a week there supervising the staff. For half the year, Ivana’s Czech parents lived with the family. Ivanka learned when she was eight that her parents would be separating. The bitter divorce played out in the tabloids. A person close to Ivanka explained to me that Don junior, 12 at the time, was the child most upset with their father. The two didn’t speak for a year, and even today there’s something about the relationship that seems to have never quite recovered. While Don and Eric say that their parents’ divorce pulled the children together as siblings, Ivanka is alone in feeling that it actually brought them all closer to their father: “Not because I was taking his side, but because I could no longer take him for granted.” If she casts any blame for the pain she experienced during that period, it is aimed at the press—specifically at a tabloid reporter who was among the throng who once accosted her as she was exiting the Chapin School and making her way to a waiting car. It was the day after the infamous New York Post headline quoting Maples, Donald’s mistress and not yet his wife, describing the affair: THE BEST SEX I’VE EVER HAD! Ivanka writes that, on that day, “one idiot reporter even had the temerity to ask me if Marla Maples’s claims were true. What type of person would ask a nine-year-old girl that kind of question?” One might also ask what kind of father would put his daughter in that kind of situation. But Ivanka’s reaction—blaming the messenger—has become an instinctive one. Years later, when an interviewer asked Ivanka whether she understood the consternation in the Jewish community after her father’s campaign tweeted an accusatory picture of Hillary Clinton next to the Star of David, Ivanka shot back that she thought the outcry was “ridiculous” because her father clearly did not think that the symbol was a Star of David. (Ivanka has told friends that her father wore a yarmulke at her wedding, and that “if my father had an anti-Semitic bone in his body, I would know about it.”) Between her parents’ separation and divorce, Ivanka’s maternal grandfather, Miloš Zelníček, whom the children called Dedo, passed away. The loss weighed heavily on all of them, particularly the boys. Soon after, one of Ivanka’s nannies, Bridget Carroll, also died. “Now it was my turn to be hardest hit,” she wrote. “She’d been like a second mother to me, my closest confidant, and now it felt as if I needed her warmth and wisdom all the more.” Understated where her father is brash, neutral where he is flash, Ivanka appears to offer the perfect foil to Donald Trump. But she has occasionally shared his penchant for hyperbole. Ivanka attended Georgetown University for two years before transferring to her father’s alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, where she could be spotted smoking between classes, according to former classmates. (She no longer smokes.) Both she and her father have boasted about her grade-point average. Donald Trump has said that Ivanka got straight A’s. Ivanka herself claimed in her book jacket biography that she graduated summa cum laude, a designation that at Penn requires a G.PA. of 3.8. In 2009, a Wall Street Journal reporter discovered that she had in fact graduated cum laude, with a G.PA. of 3.4. While the distinction has been corrected elsewhere, it remains in error on the book jacket. She went to work for her father a year after graduating, and she has been with his company ever since, serving today as the executive vice president of development and acquisitions. In 2007 she launched a fine-jewelry brand under her own name, and she has subsequently expanded the Ivanka Trump clothing brand. She will publish a second book in March, Women Who Work, promoting a mercantile feminist lifestyle brand that is designed to update a stereotypical image of “working women” that Ivanka feels is trapped in a black pantsuit. Hillary Clinton’s “pantsuit nation” aside, it’s worth noting that, for these purposes, Ivanka’s mental map of working women excludes most of them—for instance, older women and anyone in the working class. Ivanka is 35, midway in age between her sister, Tiffany, and her father’s current wife, Melania. Everyone in the family seems to acknowledge without overt rancor that Ivanka is the favorite. Donald’s affection for her has at times veered into creepy territory. In a 2006 appearance on ABC’s The View, in a discussion of how he would react if his daughter appeared on the cover of Playboy magazine, Ivanka sat calmly next to her father as he contemplated the possibility. It would depend, he noted, “on what they put inside the magazine,” meaning whether the photos of her would simply be suggestive or if she would be entirely nude. “I don’t think Ivanka would do that inside the magazine, although she does have a very nice figure. I’ve said that if Ivanka weren’t my daughter, perhaps I’d be dating her.” Last year, in Rolling Stone, Trump mused about Ivanka: “What a beauty, that one. If I weren’t happily married, and, ya know, her father...” —trailing off before he could finish the thought. (Trump has said he was just making a joke.) When I asked a person close to her father what to make of these interactions, he replied, “He has a very honest relationship with his children. They know him for what they love and what they don’t particularly admire. He treats them like adults and partners and family, but he doesn’t keep secrets from them.” Ivanka married Jared Kushner, from a prominent New York-New Jersey real-estate family, at the Trump National Golf Club, in Bedminster, New Jersey, in October 2009. To do so, she converted to Orthodox Judaism under the tutelage of Rabbi Haskel Lookstein, now 83, the spiritual leader of Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun, a Modern Orthodox temple on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Rabbi Lookstein also served as the principal of the affiliated Ramaz School, which forms its name from the initials of its founder, Rabbi Moses Zevulun Margolies, who was known as “the RaMaZ.” Ivanka and Jared have three children, Arabella, Joseph, and Teddy, the last of whom was born during the campaign. Ivanka typically rises every morning at five A.M. so that she can exercise before her children wake up, but the election season and its aftermath have been so grueling that she temporarily gave up her workouts. This past spring, as her father was preparing for the Republican convention, Ivanka asked Rabbi Lookstein, one of the most prominent rabbis in the country, if he would deliver an opening invocation. He agreed. But when the Ramaz alumni heard that their rabbi would be appearing on a stage with Trump—a man who was openly supported by white supremacist David Duke, and who declined to publicly disavow racist and anti-Semitic supporters of his candidacy—they circulated a blistering petition to protest his participation, gathering more than 800 signatures. Rabbi Lookstein backed down. One member of the Ramaz alumni group told me that the incident isolated Ivanka in the school community. “You are dropping off your daughter at Ramaz every day,” this person said, “where the alumni association says that your father is so despicable that the rabbi’s mere presence for three minutes is too much?” Referring to the relationship between Donald and Jared, this person told me, “Oh, of course! A daughter of a misogynist with ‘Page Six’ sex scandals is joining together with a guy whose father went to jail for [entrapping] his brother-in-law with a prostitute.” Antipathy toward Jared and Ivanka is by no means universal in the Ramaz community. At the same time that one petition was circulating to keep Rabbi Lookstein off the stage, another went around urging him to go ahead, according to another member I spoke with. It did not get as much support. That member added that negative feelings about her father do not extend to Ivanka. Whatever the reality, the episode has left scars. The sole offspring of Donald Trump’s relationship with Marla Maples is Tiffany Trump. Among his first discussions of Tiffany, in a radio interview with Howard Stern back in the 1990s, Trump told Stern that he had once praised Maples, who met Trump when she was 20 years old, for taking such careful precautions with birth control. When Maples, an aspiring actress not yet Trump’s wife, told him she was pregnant, he said, “What are we going to do about this?,” a statement that some commentators, including MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell, have taken as meaning that Trump was suggesting that Maples obtain an abortion. (Trump strongly denies that he meant this.) Tiffany Trump was born at 12:50 P.M. on Wednesday, October 13, 1993, at St. Mary’s Hospital, in West Palm Beach, Florida. Her mother had gone into labor more than 10 hours earlier at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort. Both her father and her maternal grandmother, Ann Ogletree, of Dalton, Georgia, were in the birthing suite with Maples for the delivery. Trump himself cut the umbilical cord. Tiffany’s name derives from that of the famous jewelry store on Fifth Avenue, adjacent to Trump Tower. Donald had bought the store’s air rights for $5 million when he was still putting together the deal to build the signature building that bears his name. Tiffany’s arrival was announced at a news conference in the lobby of the Palace Theatre, in New York, where Marla Maples had the year before played the sexy girlfriend of the wealthy showman Florenz Ziegfeld in The Will Rogers Follies. Maples has largely stayed away from show business since then, save for a recent stint as a contestant on Dancing with the Stars, where she was eliminated after four episodes. The birth of a daughter occasioned the launch of Maternity Moods, a now discontinued fashion brand at Macy’s. More recently, Maples, a longtime Kabbalist, has launched her own, “Marla Maples” lifestyle brand, dedicated to promoting a selection of products, including her own songs, a friend’s lip-gloss line, and a podcast, Awakening with Marla, which focuses on spirituality, health, environmental awareness, and personal empowerment.  After Tiffany was born, Ivana Trump spoke to her children about their new half-sister. “I sat them down and told them nothing would be changing in their lives,” she told Geraldo Rivera on his show Geraldo in 1993. Two months after Tiffany’s birth, Trump and Maples were married. Donald’s children from his marriage to Ivana did not attend the ceremony. Bizarrely, the wedding seems to have been instigated by a mass shooting on the Long Island Railroad, in which a gunman killed five people. “I figured life is short—and I want to do this now,” Trump told Maples, according to the account she gave to the New York Daily News at the time. Maples said she wanted a small, traditional ceremony. The couple wed in December 1993 in the Grand Ballroom of Trump’s Plaza hotel before a thousand of their friends, including Rosie O’Donnell, Howard Stern, and O. J. Simpson. According to a contemporaneous article in the Daily News, the investor and philanthropist Ron Perelman set the tone for the event by showing up at the last minute and making only a brief appearance before calling for his car. Of the infant Tiffany, Trump told an Entertainment Tonight crew that his new daughter had his lips, but he hoped she would “grow out of that.” In another interview, in 1994, Trump told Robin Leach, host of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, “She’s got Marla’s legs. We don’t know whether or not she’s got this part yet”—he gestured toward his chest—“but time will tell.” Trump’s marriage to Maples lasted six years, three of them consumed by a lengthy divorce negotiation. Maples always described herself as a single mother to Tiffany. In California, Tiffany attended the $30,000-a-year Viewpoint School, in Calabasas. She is best known for her Instagram feed, full of pouty friends posturing poolside and at clubs. She herself tends to appear in the pictures with more makeup than seems necessary. The friends include Andrew Warren (son of a New York real-estate investor), Harry Brant and Peter Brant Jr. (sons of Stephanie Seymour and Peter Brant), Gaia Matisse (great-great-granddaughter of Henri Matisse), and E. J. Johnson (son of Magic Johnson). Most of those friends attended Tiffany’s 21st-birthday party, in October 2014, at the Trump SoHo hotel and a club called Up & Down, in New York’s Meatpacking District. For the summer of 2011, Ivanka helped Tiffany get an internship at Vogue. Her everyday existence is less glamorous. According to friends, Tiffany is unfailingly kind. She is studious. She once arrived late for a “Rich Kids” photo shoot for Du Jour magazine because she was finishing a paper for a summer course. She has an artistic streak. She worries about her father and the hate directed toward him, as when the Mexican drug lord El Chapo purportedly tweeted to Trump: “If you keep pissing me off I’m going to make you eat your words you fucking blonde milk-shit.” Tiffany was “distraught” about that, her friend told me. “That scared her.” In 2012, Tiffany was a first-year student at the University of Pennsylvania. Her father at that moment was deep into his “birther” campaign, kicking off his rise to political prominence by alleging falsely that Barack Obama had been born not in the United States but in Kenya. It was a tough time to be a Trump. Newly arrived in Philadelphia, Tiffany was cut in the first round of rush to the all-female Tabard Society at Penn, according to two Tabard members. Tabard is a secret society that offers its members an exclusive social network. According to one, the society was fearful that the presence of a Trump might scare off the kind of presentable and connected young women that Tabard has typically attracted. (A person close to Tiffany says she was never interested in Tabard. Tiffany went on to rush at Kappa Alpha Theta and was accepted.) At Penn, Tiffany made use of the card privileges that Ivanka helped secure for her. Donald Trump provided Tiffany with a budget of $500 a month—no more, according to a friend. When she split restaurant bills, she calculated down to the penny how much she owed, the friend added. Tiffany double-majored in sociology (with a concentration in law) and urban studies. She is currently living in an apartment near Trump Tower and studying for the L.S.A.T. Her boyfriend, Ross Mechanic, a registered Democrat who voiced support for Hillary on social media, interned over the summer at Jared Kushner’s real-estate investment start-up, called Cadre. Tiffany is focused on trying to establish her own identity outside the family—one of the reasons she hopes to pursue a law degree. As Donald Trump’s quest for the presidency rolled on, his three oldest children acquired growing influence, according to all of the former campaign officials I spoke with. Tiffany, still finishing her studies, was largely a non-presence until the very last weeks. At campaign meetings with Trump, in the large boardroom on the 26th floor of Trump Tower, where The Apprentice was filmed, Ivanka seemed to mostly listen, asking an occasional question. She reserved her counsel for private moments. If something came up where a difference of opinion hung in the air, “it was clear to us by their eye contact” that they would be talking about it later, one campaign official told me. Ivanka has sometimes publicly voiced objections but she has never expressed any public disapproval of her father, save for a tepid statement following the Access Hollywood video, to the effect that she found his comments—boasting that, as a famous figure, he could grab women “by the pussy” with no repercussions— “inappropriate” and “offensive,” but not reflective of Donald at all. Ivanka was deferential in meetings, and when she and her brothers ran into campaign staff, they were always respectful. One day, staffers walked into the 26th-floor conference room only to find the children looking over blueprints for a construction project. The children cleared out, apologizing for not reserving the room in advance. Ivanka has worked mostly behind the scenes, while her brothers have taken a more public role on the stump. When she did make appearances on her father’s behalf, the impact was generally positive. “She’s a better, younger, more impressive model,” Matt Mackowiak, a Texas-based Republican consultant and Bush-administration official, told me. “She is incredibly networked, and he knows that,” another former campaign official told me. “When she goes to him with an opinion, it is based on what she thinks, but it usually includes a lot of canvassing of a lot of other people who are important, so it reflects a range of thinking, not just her own.” Ivanka is friendly with people who might hesitate to spend quality tune with her father, such as David Geffen. Ivanka has also carefully maintained her business interests. Despite calls for a boycott of her products, sales at her company are up, and the campaign turned out to be good for business. Sarah Warren, the editorial director of the Ivanka Trump brand, told Fast Company earlier this year, “You couldn’t pay for this visibility.” Ivanka’s natural caution has served the brand well. “If I said to you: Tell me a negative about Ivanka Trump,” says Jamie Salter, chairman and C.E.O. of Authentic Brands Group, which owns Juicy Couture, Judith Leiber, and Spyder, among others, “something she said or something she did or something that was inappropriate—I’m not talking about her father—it’s not so easy to find.” As noted, Ivanka and Jared sometimes differed with Corey Lewandowski. Lewandowski drew the particular attention of the children when, one night in May 2016, he was discovered in a heated argument on a Midtown sidewalk with campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks. The two were witnessed screaming at each other, an event that set off a series of tabloid headlines and uncomfortable scrutiny for the campaign. Trump himself quickly learned about the incident, which was laced with rumors of an affair between Hicks and Lewandowski (denied on all sides) and campaign infighting (between Lewandowski and another senior campaign staffer, Paul Manafort). In an e-mail, Lewandowski wrote that the argument with Hicks concerned “Manafort’s increased responsibility at the campaign.” The final blow came a month later, when Ivanka heard that Lewandowski was trying to plant negative stories about Kushner. Lewandowski joined CNN as a paid commentator (while still getting severance from Trump). Now he is back in good standing and expected to take on a significant administration role. Like her father, Ivanka has had no patience for criticism of the Trump campaign in any form. She abruptly ended an interview with Cosmopolitan magazine after the interviewer asked her about the specifics of her paid-maternity-leave policy, which benefits only women who have physically given birth to a child. No one else, such as an adoptive mother or father, can be included. When the interviewer, Prachi Gupta, pressed her about how many women and men would not be included under her plan, she brushed away the question. The interviewer asked her about her father’s documented comment that pregnancy was an “inconvenience” for employers. Ivanka replied, “You said he made those comments. I don’t know that he said those comments.” After the emergence of the Access Hollywood tape, Ivanka told her father that he had to defend himself. Apologize, yes, and say the tape did not reflect who he was—but also fight back. Ivanka’s advice is not always followed in the way she might prefer. Despite her opposition to this tactic, Trump was soon countering with stories of Bill Clinton’s alleged sexual assaults against multiple women. Ivanka has stood by her father through all of his most difficult moments. She has testified to his lack of sexism by citing her own personal experience: “I wouldn’t be the person I am... if he hadn’t encouraged me, emboldened me.” Her conversion to Judaism has served as a defense against the virulent racism and antiSemitism of some Trump supporters. For Ivanka, publicly disagreeing with her father was out of the question. In her mind, to disagree with him publicly at all would make TRUMP FAMILY DISCORD the headline, something she has been trying to avoid her entire life. What she has told friends privately shows how she thinks about the value of staying on message. About the lack of disavowals by her father of hateful and odious statements by supporters, she has said that he had to balance how much he could distance himself from those supporters without drawing more attention to them. She has also said privately that she is exasperated by how her father has been tarred by a few “careless” moments (some of them in fact quite deliberate) that the media have turned into a durable narrative about his character. Ivanka and Chelsea Clinton are friends, and that friendship undoubtedly channeled Ivanka’s behavior on the campaign trail. Ivanka did not attack Hillary Clinton, and referred to her on only one occasion, obliquely, when she claimed (wrongly) that her father was the sole candidate who had a specific maternity-leave policy. According to a person familiar with the conversation, after the election, Ivanka called Chelsea to express respect for the way Chelsea conducted herself during the campaign, and to offer her support and friendship. Tiffany Trump and her father’s youngest son, Barron, 10, his child with Melania, are the only Trump children not to be named to the transition team. You can argue that they are getting the better deal. Ivanka’s two older brothers have been tapped to run the Trump Organization during their father’s presidency. Ivanka appears headed to Washington to be closer to her father and the policy discussions she hopes to influence. Trump himself said the company would be put into a “blind trust,” which seems impossible because he knows both the people who will be running the company and exactly what is in it, and because a real-estate company cannot just be put into a box and allowed to sit there. Ivanka is in an exquisitely delicate position-invested in both her business and her father’s presidency. She knows that conflicts of interest are inescapable and can be both lucrative and destructive. She does not yet know where to draw the line, and on the evidence, her father does not seem persuaded that a meaningful line needs to be drawn. Donald Trump invited Ivanka, who has no security clearance, to join him in his meeting with Japan’s prune minister, Shinzo Abe. (As reported in The New York Times, her company was finalizing a licensing deal with Sanei-International; the largest shareholder of Sanei’s parent company is the Development Bank of Japan, a bank owned by the Japanese government.) She also joined Trump’s call with Argentina’s president, Mauricio Macri, during which Trump, now president-elect, reportedly asked Macri to speed along some approvals that Trump had been waiting for on business deals. (Maori’s spokesman has denied that Trump requested help.) A person close to Ivanka describes these missteps, perhaps charitably, as part of the learning process that Trump himself is going through as he transitions from the private sector to the public sector. (This assumes that he wants to learn.) Ivanka herself is relinquishing some branding opportunities. Ivanka Trump Line Jewelry e-mailed a “style alert” to reporters shortly after Trump’s first interview as president-elect, with CBS’s 60 Minutes. The alert advertised Ivanka’s “favorite bangle” from the company’s Metropolis Collection, a $10,800 bracelet she had conspicuously worn during the show. After the incident, Ivanka instituted a new policy not to promote items she wore if she was appearing in an official capacity as First Daughter. She also separated her personal Instagram feed from that of her company, to shield both from claims that she is using her father’s presidency to enrich herself. It remains to be seen what Tiffany will do— she is a work in progress—but Ivanka is so far the only Trump child to have established a reputation for herself outside of her father’s real-estate business. Her life with Jared appears tastefully in neutrals on her Instagram feed, a jaw-dropping contrast in aesthetic sensibility to her father’s style—as if Saddam Hussein had sired Mies van der Rohe. But in the important ways, she is her father’s daughter. Enclosed in her wedding invitation was an insert for a free golf game at a Trump golf course. It is her husband, Jared Kushner, not her brothers, who is at the center of her father’s transition team. It was reported in early December that Jared and Ivanka were house-hunting in D.C., as both prepared to take on a larger though unofficial policy role in her father’s administration. It always comes back to the brand. When Ivanka was promoting The Apprentice, back in 2007, she was asked whether it was possible her father would “fire” her, riffing on the famous line from the show itself. On two separate occasions, on NBC’s Late Night with Conan O’Brien and on CBS’s The Late Show with David Letterman, Ivanka answered the question by citing an interview her father had given to Larry King. Trump had told King that if any of his children didn’t do well at his company he would not only fire them but fire them “like a dog,” a description that puzzled O’Brien in particular, never having seen a dog fired. Ivanka noted in both appearances that her father would surely be watching the late-night shows and would give her feedback on her performance. That the father and daughter would be communicating through their respective television interviews seemed fitting in a family that has literally lived off its name. —Emily Jane Fox contributed reporting to this article.

A 13-year-old student, who told police he was inspired by the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School in Colorado, had warned certain students at The Villages Charter Middle School in Lady Lake to either stay home Friday or wear white shirts and say the safety word “Eugene” to avoid getting shot, investigators told WFTV. Students who said they overheard the teen believed he “was serious and they were bothered by his statements,” said a Sumter County charging affidavit. “They did not believe he was joking.” After authorities were alerted earlier this week, the 13-year-old was stopped on his way to school Wednesday and questioned. He implicated a 14-year-old student, who was detained at the school the same day, according to a statement from the Sumter County Sheriff’s Office. The teens had no weapons on them or in their lockers, law enforcement officers said, but firearms were found in the homes of both boys during a search the following day. One of the guns was an AR-15 assault rifle, according to police. Both teens were charged Thursday with conspiracy to commit murder. They’re being held in a juvenile detention facility. Police have not yet identified them, though they have been named by the media in central Florida. Under questioning, the suspects tearfully confessed to the plot, according to police. Investigators said the younger teen told them he had been depressed and said, “I just want to die,” NBC reported. Sumter Co. deputies say they foiled an alleged mass shooting at the Villages Charter Middle School. @news6wkmg #News6 pic.twitter.com/8TTqLg1Hbp He initially said he had been joking about the shooting, but both boys later said they had arranged to meet in the gym Friday and start shooting, police said. The signal to open fire was to be a dropped pencil, police said they were told. The 14-year-old boy also noted Columbine as an inspiration, investigators said. That shooting, by two high school friends, killed 12 students and a teacher and injured dozens of others. Officers thanked the students at The Villages Charter School who had spoken up about the threat. “The Sumter County Sheriff’s Office is grateful for those students brave enough to speak out about the plot,” the sheriff’s office said. “Their heroic actions may have prevented a deadly tragedy and loss of precious lives.” A sheriff’s spokesman told WESH-TV that school expulsion proceedings have started for both students. Several students stayed home from school Friday. “I’m kind of freaked out about leaving him here, to be honest,” one mom told the TV reporter as she dropped off her son. Police were patrolling the school Friday but said they don’t think other students were involved in the alleged plot. Trends Reporter, HuffPost"

Sunday's violence left six people dead and eight others injured. One suspect is in custody, and police are probing the motive behind what Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called a ""terrorist attack.""  Below is a list of some of the worst mass shootings that have unfolded in the country. (Note: This is a list of shootings, where the murder weapon was a gun, and does not include other mass killings, such as the Air India bombing. ) Leonard Hogue murder-suicide (1965) On April 21, 1965, former Vancouver police officer Leonard Hogue, shot his wife in the head while she slept, which woke up his six children. He then moved through his house to kill each of the kids before eventually turning the gun on himself. After his death, police reports said Hogue was a suspect in two robberies, both of which netted him huge quantities of useless currency. Shell Lake massacre (1967) In 1967, 21-year-old Victor Hoffman shot and killed nine members of the Peterson family on their farm. Known as Canada's worst random mass murder, the victims were James and Evelyn Peterson and seven of their children, who ranged in age from 2 to 17. Phyllis Peterson, 4, was the only survivor. Hoffman had been released from a mental hospital just three weeks before the attack. After his arrest, he was returned to a mental institution, where he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Ecole Polytechnique (1989)  Also known as the Montreal Massacre, the violence at Ecole Polytechnique was Canada's deadliest mass shooting in recent history. In a planned attack, Marc Lepine entered the school and killed 14 women in 20 minutes before shooting himself. He claimed he was ""fighting feminism,"" and his suicide note claimed feminists had ruined his life. Concordia University shooting spree (1992) In 1992, engineering professor Valery Fabrikant killed four of his colleagues after a pattern of tension and aggression towards fellow teaching staff at Concordia University. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. Vernon B.C. killings (1996) In April 1996, Mark Chahal shot his estranged wife and eight of her relatives at his former home in B.C., before going to a nearby motel and killing himself. His wife, Rajwar Gakhal, had previously told the RCMP she felt threatened by her husband, but police admitted at the time of the attack that nothing was done to investigate her complaint. Cruse family murders (2002) In June 2002, 30-year-old American Peter Kiss forced his way into a Grimsby, Ont. home, where he shot his ex-girlfriend Shannon Cruse, her daughter, and her parents, before killing himself. Mayerthorpe RCMP killings (2005)  In 2005, James Roszko shot and killed four RCMP officers who part of a seizure of stolen property on his farm near Mayerthorpe, Alta. After a shootout with other officers, Roszko turned the gun on himself and was pronounced dead at the scene. in It was the worst multiple-officer killing in Canadian history. Roszko had been operating a marijuana grow-op, and was under investigation for property crimes. Dawson College shooting (2006) In 2006, Kimveer Gill began shooting outside the entrance to Dawson College, and moved inside to the main floor atrium. One person died at the scene, and 19 others were hurt. Eight of them suffered serious injuries. Gill was shot in the arm by police, and then shot himself in the head. A suicide note was later found on his body.  Shedden massacre (2006) Eight people connected to the Bandidos motorcycle gang were found dead in a field north of Shedden, Ont. after an internal power struggle. Six gang members were convicted of first-degree murder for the killings. Claresholm highway killings (2011) Ten days before Christmas 2011, Derek Jensen killed three people at the side of an Alberta highway before killing himself. Jensen was reportedly angry with his ex-girlfriend, Tabitha Stepple, who was with her friend and two other men in the car. Stepple and the two men died, but Stepple's friend survived. Story continues after gallery Moncton RCMP shooting (2014) In June 2014, Justin Bourque shot and killed three Moncton RCMP officers and wounded two others. He was captured after a manhunt and shootout with Mounties, and convicted of first-degree murder and attempted murder. Bourque received the maximum sentence for his crimes — three concurrent life sentences — and will be eligible for parole after 75 years in prison.  Edmonton mass killings (2014) In December 2014, Phu Lam shot and killed eight people before committing suicide. He was reportedly angry upon finding out the eight-year-old boy he and his wife were raising was not his biological son. Lam shot the boy, his wife, and six members of her family, including her three-year-old niece. Lam was later found dead in his ex-wife's restaurant. Documents show he had money troubles, and was on stress leave from work at the time of the attack. Story continues after gallery La Loche shooting (2016) On Jan. 22, 2016, a 17-year-old boy shot and killed two teenage brothers at a house in northern Saskatchewan. The teen then went to the local school, where he shot and killed two teachers and wounded seven others. His friends described the teen as the black sheep of his family and a victim of bullying at school.   Also on HuffPost "
1895681054,2017-01-31 23:50:04,Let Me Tell You How 'The Media' Really Works...,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/let-me-tell-you-how-the-media-really-works_b_588fe174e4b04c35d58351a2,en,False,"news and news media,media",96720,HuffPost Latino Voices,http://voces.huffingtonpost.com/#spider,"Christina is a former TV reporter and anchor who now works as a TV host and owns a public relations firm, Media Maven. Whenever something major happens, all the experts come out of the woodwork. When a child falls into a gorilla exhibit at a zoo, it’s the parenting experts. When a gorilla is killed in that exhibit, it’s the animal experts. Today, it’s the political/foreign policy/religion/immigration experts. But there is one expert who is always out and about. It’s the media expert... and nine times out of 10, that person has never worked a day in the media industry. (That’s the funny thing about these self-proclaimed experts online. They don’t have any experience in their expertise.) Before I disappoint everyone with the lack of agenda setting and scheming that really happens in newsrooms, let me address the term “the media” because, well, I don’t really know who that is. Saying it’s “the medias” fault confuses me. I’m not quite sure who “the media” is (or are), but since everyone else is aware, for the sake of this post, I’ll use the term. When people say news and media coverage is slanted and there’s an agenda, I really don’t see it. This is why. In local TV news, the day starts with a morning meeting. This is when the assignment desk catches the incoming producers, reporters, editors, and others up on what happened over night and in the early morning. If there are still lingering questions about a story, we’ll keep covering it and try to find the new information. If not, we’ll move on to what else is happening, what people are calling the news desk about, what Facebook posts have the most engagement. (This is why you should stop commenting “who cares” on those Kardashian posts.) Phrases like, “Let’s spin this more liberally,” or “Make sure it has a conservative feel” or “Show this group of people in a certain way” are never uttered. Instead, it’s, “Make sure you get both sides.” Sometimes, one side doesn’t want to talk... no matter how hard you try to convince them it’s vital to tell both sides of the story. Sometimes the person who is talking to the media, isn’t as well spoken as the person telling the other side of the story. Sometimes, the person isn’t available to go on camera, so instead they send in quotes that will be used in a full screen graphic or they assign a public information officer to speak to the media instead. For example, if it takes one person to get their point across in 10 seconds, that’s all we will use. If it takes another person :45 seconds, we’ll use the :45 seconds. We may cut up the :45 so it plays in two different clips, (because a :45 sound bite is too long) but that doesn’t mean “the media” is favoring one side by giving them more air time. It just means one person is better at giving sound bites. (And remember, in TV we get one minute and 15 seconds for a package.) So, when I hear people say stories are one-sided or cater to one political belief system, it’s just not true. I’ve come to realize that people think their opinions are facts. To take it further, people will describe a news story and read so far into it that they create the bias on their own. If you look hard enough for something, you’ll find it - regardless if it’s really there or not. Just because you don’t like what’s being covered, doesn’t mean it’s “fake news.” When you see a story about Christmas shopping at the mall and the coverage is all about how busy the mall is with shoppers, some people could see that as a positive story because they love going out and being around lots of people in a busy mall around the holidays, while other people can think it’s terrible because they hate crowds and shopping. See? The bias isn’t with “the media.” It’s with you and how you digest information. Here’s another example of what happens in the field that many self-proclaimed media experts don’t understand. Once I was covering people signing up their families to receive Christmas presents from the Salvation Army. We were talking to people in line, getting video of the process, and calling the assignment desk to share what we had. There was a problem. Everyone I was talking to and getting video of was hispanic. My managers told me, “You can’t show just hispanics. You need white people. You need black people.” But there were no white or black people to talk to or show. When the story aired, guess what happened? The calls and Facebook posts were all about how we were so biased and obviously racist for only choosing to show hispanics. Surely there were other people there too, but we wanted the coverage to look a certain way, so we only used certain sound bites and video. (Side note: I’m hispanic.) I’ve had many of my live shots drop while I’m speaking. That’s not because someone in the control booth didn’t like what I was saying and cut me off. That is technology. Sometimes live shots drop. Again, if you’ve ever set one up, dialed it in, hooked up an IFB (if you’re a media expert, you know what that is), you’d understand. Once, I forgot where I was. I was on my fourth story in a matter of six hours and couldn’t remember what city I was in. I’m not stupid or uneducated or “don’t know what the hell I’m doing,” I just forgot where I was for a second because TV news happens fast. Sometimes, faster than I can think. Imagine that... for every story you do. That’s what happens when you work in news. If people don’t like what they see, for whatever reason, they will find a way to blame “the media” for using its agenda to make a point. Again, these people making these claims have never shot, written, or edited a vo/sot (there’ another news term.) And just so you know, a reporter doesn’t write something and go on-air with it because it sounds good. The photographer is involved. A producer goes through it. Then, a managing editor checks it. Sometimes even more people will sign off on something before it makes air. Trust me, there is a lot of diversity in newsrooms and that’s what helps tell a balanced story, even if it’s not what you believe. I can’t end this post without talking about breaking news because this is when all the media experts crawl out of the woodwork with their expertise on how to cover a mass shooting 15 minutes after it happens. When breaking news happens, we usually find out by someone sitting at the assignment desk who heard it on the scanner. Sometimes a viewer will call the station. When that happens, a crew is set out the door to the location. While the crew is in route, the assignment desk is making phone calls. Nine times out of 10, they don’t get a whole lot of information. Why not? Contrary to what many think, when breaking news happens, most details aren’t yet known and a person isn’t chomping at the bit to tell the local TV station everything they know. Instead, the police are doing their jobs trying to figure out what’s going on, if they are in a dangerous situation, if there are lives to save, etc. Spilling the beans isn’t at the top of their priority list. When a reporter and photographer arrive on the scene, police tell us to wait for the Public Information Office to arrive. (The PIO is the person in charge of talking the media.) This also isn’t immediate. We can’t remain silent for hours in a breaking news situation, so we talk to people nearby. Witnesses who may have heard something or seen something. Sometimes their information is right, sometimes it’s not. There is no way to know until an investigation is finished... and we can’t ignore a breaking news situation for that long. So, we go on-air and say, “A neighbor says he saw...” and follow it up with “Police are here and haven’t confirmed this, but we see...” In a perfect world, we would roll up and the PIO would be ready with every piece of correct information for us to tell the entire story right then and there. (It’s shocking to see how many people believe this is how things happen.) So yes, there is a lot of misinformation in breaking news situations. It’s called “breaking” news for a reason. After “breaking” it’s “developing.” I could go on, and on, and on... but I’d be wasting my breath (or time moving my fingers over this keyboard) because we all know you can’t possibly know all about how the media industry works... if you’ve never worked in it. I can’t sum up a decade of experience in one measly blog post or a Facebook comment, so I’ll just leave it here and have a chuckle when someone who has never worked in the industry tells me what they know (because they saw it on TV or read it online.) But if you do want to learn a little bit about your so-called expertise, you should visit a newsroom. Shadow a reporter, photographer, or producer for a few days. I guarantee you’ll be disappointed, at not only the lack of glamour, but lack of agenda “the media” is trying to portray on-air. The truth is, we don’t even have time to create an agenda if we wanted to... and if we found extra time, we’d eat!

That was the message from thousands of LGBTQ supporters who took to New York City streets Saturday afternoon to protest President Donald Trump’s now-blocked travel ban, immigration policies and other “illegal, immoral, unconstitutional and un-American” executive orders, according to the event’s Facebook page. Trump’s travel ban was temporarily halted by a federal judge Friday. The protest, sponsored by more than a dozen advocacy groups and local politicians, was held outside the historic Stonewall Inn in Manhattan’s West Village neighborhood, the symbolic heart of the LGBTQ rights movement. Today's resistance brought to you by Stonewall Inn. pic.twitter.com/fMOahz3CGZ Other protests to “Resist Trump” were scheduled across the country through the weekend. Demonstrations were planned in cities that include Denver, Houston and Buffalo, New York. Marie Carianna, a 57-year-old lesbian at the New York demonstration, told HuffPost she has spent her life fighting for the rights of the LGBTQ community. She said she won’t stop now. “Whether we’re straight, gay, immigrant, Native American ― no matter who you are, we’re all standing up to fascists,” Carianna said. #lgbt solidarity at Stonewall this afternoon. Let us be clear: we will do everything in our power to protect New Yorkers from discrimination pic.twitter.com/3faYsAewNT So what will the next four years look like for Carianna under a Trump presidency? “A hell of a lot more alcohol,” she said. “The fact is, it means I’m going to be on the streets, fighting. The idea that we are going to be handing to our kids a lack of rights that we already fought for decades ago ― it’ll be over my dead body.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) rallied the crowd with a message of moving forward, leading a chant of “Dump Trump” even as some booed him. “We are going to do everything to ensure that the Supreme Court does not turn the clock back to the 1960s or the 1920s,” Schumer said. “We are going to fight.” Many protestors chanted, “We are watching you” at Schumer, likely referring to recent complaints that the senator hadn’t done enough to stop Trump’s picks for the new administration. A good lookin group of protestors. pic.twitter.com/OjohRNZ9Ik New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer said he was starting to lose his voice from all the protesting, but that it wouldn’t stop him from shouting. He thanked protestors for braving the cold. “I have never been so cold, but so fired up in my life!” Stringer told the crowd. Stringer warned Trump that history will not look kindly on him. “He’s not going to have a party by the time we’re done with him,” Stringer said. “They’re not going to have majority Congress and majority Senate. It’s all going down, Donald, and it’s happening right now.” #Stonewall #resist rally hasn't even started, and it's ON FIRE. pic.twitter.com/lHXQY5IFDd The Stonewall Inn’s legacy began June 28, 1969, when hundreds in the LGBTQ community fought back against police attempting to arrest them. At the time, homosexuality was illegal, and Stonewall patrons had been routinely harassed by cops. It is credited with being the birthplace of the modern gay rights movement. On June 27, 2016 ― more than 40 years after the Stonewall riots ― the site was declared a national monument by President Barack Obama. The monument protects more than seven acres of land in Greenwich Village, including Christopher Park, the inn, and surrounding streets and sidewalks. More recently, thousands showed up at the inn to honor those killed at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub last summer. LGBTQ people were specifically targeted at the club in what became the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. The inn also was a hub for celebration after the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling in 2015 that all states must recognize same-sex marriage. #Stonewall pic.twitter.com/gd81rb8K3t  Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Editor, HuffPost"

ORLANDO, Fla. – Some patrons of Florida's Pulse nightclub are upset they aren't receiving money from a $29.5 million victims' compensation fund since they were outside the club when a mass shooting began. In one email sent to Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer, a patron says he and his boyfriend were in the valet area outside the gay nightclub when a gunman began shooting last June 12 at the entrance. The patron says both were traumatized but aren't getting compensation because of eligibility standards that require a patron to have been inside the club during the shooting to receive money. That email and others were obtained through a public records request. Omar Mateen was killed by police after opening fire at the Pulse nightclub on June 12 in a rampage that left 49 victims dead and 53 wounded, making it the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Mateen professed allegiance to the Islamic State group. _____ Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter: http://twitter.com/mikeschneiderap .

White House press secretary Sean Spicer later revised Trump’s criticism of the media by claiming the president was talking about terrorist attacks that have gone “underreported,” not unreported. But that’s not what the president said. Trump and Spicer were both proven wrong when the White House produced a list of “underreported” terrorist attacks that contained numerous widely covered terrorist attacks over the last two years, including the Orlando, Fla., mass shooting that left 49 people dead and the San Bernardino, Calif., attack that killed 14. The White House list also included the Nov. 13, 2015, attack in Paris that killed more than 130 people; the Bastille Day attack last year in Nice, France, that killed 84 people; and the bombing attacks at an airport and on a subway train in Brussels on March 22, 2016, that killed at least 31 people. All were, obviously, widely covered. Trump made his remarks at MacDill Air Force Base. Trump, Feb. 6: ""Radical Islamic terrorists are determined to strike our homeland as they did on 9/11; as they did from Boston to Orlando, to San Bernardino. And all across Europe, you’ve seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe it’s happening. It’s gotten to a point where it’s not even being reported and, in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report it. They have their reasons and you understand that."" Trump, Feb. 6: ""Radical Islamic terrorists are determined to strike our homeland as they did on 9/11; as they did from Boston to Orlando, to San Bernardino. And all across Europe, you’ve seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe it’s happening. It’s gotten to a point where it’s not even being reported and, in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report it. They have their reasons and you understand that."" What terrorist attacks are “not even being reported”? When asked, Spicer backtracked and said that Trump was complaining about “underreported attacks.” Spicer, Feb. 6: ""Look, I think the president’s comments were very clear at the time. He felt as though members of the media don’t always cover some of those events to the extent that other events might get covered; that a protest will get blown out of the water, and yet an attack or a foiled attack doesn’t necessarily get the same coverage."" Spicer, Feb. 6: ""Look, I think the president’s comments were very clear at the time. He felt as though members of the media don’t always cover some of those events to the extent that other events might get covered; that a protest will get blown out of the water, and yet an attack or a foiled attack doesn’t necessarily get the same coverage."" The White House then provided a list of 78 attacks that were carried out by terrorists or suspected terrorists from September 2014 to December 2016. We searched Nexis, a news database, for coverage of all 78 incidents and found tens of thousands of news articles, TV news transcripts and news wire accounts of the attacks and subsequent stories related to these attacks. Several of the suspected terrorist attacks described as “not … reported” (Trump) or “underreported” (Spicer) received so much global press coverage that Nexis could not return all search results — instead it provided just a warning that the search would yield more than 3,000 results. In addition to the five high-profile attacks we mentioned earlier — in Orlando, San Bernardino, France and Belgium — the White House list included these other incidents that yield more than 3,000 results in our Nexis search for “all English language news”: • Michael Zehaf-Bibeau shot and killed a Canadian soldier in Ottawa in October 2014. The name “Michael Zehaf-Bibeau” was mentioned in more than 500 U.S. news and wire stories, including in front page articles in the Los Angeles Times and The New York Times. • Amedy Coulibaly killed one police officer and four hostages in a shooting at a kosher supermarket in Paris. The name “Amedy Coulibaly” appeared in at least 1,400 U.S. news and wire reports, including in at least 150 front-page stories. The New York Times alone wrote 22 front-page stories on the attack. • Man Haron Monis killed two hostages in December 2014 after taking over a downtown cafe in Sydney, Australia, for more than 16 hours. Man Haron Monis, who was killed when law enforcement officers stormed the cafe, was mentioned in nearly 500 U.S. news and wire reports. The incident was on the front page of five U.S. newspapers, and carried on all the major TV networks and cable stations. All of those attacks can be found on CNN’s website, which lists 143 terrorist attacks through July 25, 2016. Extensive media coverage was not limited to attacks that resulted in the loss of innocent lives. Our search turned up heavy coverage for attacks listed by the White House that resulted in no one other than the attackers being killed: • Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi were killed after they opened fire on May 3, 2015, at an exhibit of cartoons lampooning the Prophet Muhammad in Garland, Texas. One security guard was wounded. Abdul Malik Abdul Kareem, a roommate of the gunmen, was convicted of conspiracy to support ISIL and other terrorist-related charges. We found more than 1,200 U.S. news and wire stories that mentioned Kareem and the attack, including 21 stories in The New York Times. • Usaama Rahim was shot and killed by a Boston police officer and FBI agent after Rahim approached them with a machete. A Nexis search of Rahim’s name in U.S. news and wire reports turned up 278 hits, including 12 stories in The Boston Globe and four in The New York Times. The Globe wrote four front-page stories on Rahim’s case. • Mohamed Barry was shot and killed by police a year ago in Columbus, Ohio, after he injured four people in a restaurant with a machete. We found more than 100 search results for “Mohamed Barry” and “Columbus,” including five front-page stories by the Columbus Dispatch. It was covered by CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox News. Simpson, Soofi and Rahim are listed in a federally funded report for the U.S. Department of Justice as “deceased American jihadists.” It is not clear, however, if the Ohio incident was a terrorist attack. The Columbus Dispatch reported that Barry “had been on a watch list for ‘espousing extremist views,’” but FBI agents “didn’t use the words ‘terrorism’ or ‘terrorist’” at the time to describe the attack. The White House list also includes at least two attacks that do not appear to be terrorist attacks at all: • Khaled Babouri was killed in August after injuring two female police officers in Brussels with a machete. Belgium Migration State Secretary Theo Francken said Babouri “was not known for terrorist reasons,” according to an Associated Press report. • Smail Ayad killed two people, Mia Ayliffe-Chung and Tom Jackson, at a hostel in Australia in August. The Brisbane Times reported that Ayad was “alleged to have yelled ‘Allahu Akbar’ during the attack but authorities found no evidence to suggest his motivations were terror-related and have considered whether he had an obsession with Ms Ayliffe-Chung.” Ayad “has been given a preliminary diagnosis of schizophrenia,” the paper said. Update, Feb. 8: Mia Ayliffe-Chung’s mother, Rosie Ayliffe, said the murders of her daughter and Jackson should not have appeared on the White House list of terrorist attacks. In an open letter to Trump on Facebook, Ayliffe wrote that “an Islamic terror attack was discounted in the early stages of the police investigation.” For sure, there are some suspected terrorist attacks that were not widely reported. But we found that those were generally in far-flung places that, for the most part, did not result in any deaths. The White House listed, for example, these nonfatal attacks that received little U.S. media coverage: a June 9, 2015, rocket attack targeting an airport in el Gorah, Egypt; a roadside bombing attack that injured four U.S. soldiers in el Gorah, Egypt; and the shooting of two U.S. defense contractors in Saudi Arabia in January 2015. (We note that nine of the 78 attacks listed by the White House were in Egypt, which has been struggling with “a long-running insurgency in the region that has grown since the 2011 popular uprising against longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak,” the former president of Egypt, according to U.S. News and World Report.) Trump’s criticism of the media and the reporting on terrorist attacks comes at a time when the Department of Justice is in federal court defending the president’s executive order — Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States. The order seeks to impose a 90-day travel ban on the citizens of seven predominately Muslim countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. It also would suspend the refugee program indefinitely for Syrians and for 120 days for all other refugees. A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order on Feb. 3 that for now blocks enforcement of portions of Trump’s order.

Fans were already predicting what would happen in Season 2 even though there had been no official word yet. SPOILER ALERT: This article contains information about Season 1 of Netflix's The OA. Please proceed with caution if you have not yet viewed all episodes and wish to avoid spoilers. Today, Netflix confirmed what viewers had already suspected, with the official announcement The OA would return for Season 2.    The smoke is likely a reference to the smoke infused with drugs used by Dr. Hunter Aloysius ""Hap"" Percy (Jason Isaacs) in Season 1. This could indicate viewers will see more of what happened to those Hap was experimenting on along with Prairie. According to the braille alphabet offered by Braille Authority, the letters used in the Season 2 trailer are as follows: S U R V I V E. The final letter is unclear in this alphabet. However, further research shows it as DD. This letter is very similar in form to the singular letter D in the braille alphabet, so it is unclear yet if this is an error or a cleverly disguised plot point for Season 2. The OA arrived without any fanfare on December 16, 2016. However, viewers quickly tuned in to find out what the letters ""OA"" meant (spoiler alert: it means ""original angel""). They then ended up sticking around and binge-watching all eight episodes. The final episode of Season 1 concluded with Prairie Johnson (know as the OA and played by Brit Marling), being shot by an unknown gunman who seemed intent on a mass-shooting in the school cafeteria before the OA's group performed all five movements and distracted him. This worked just long enough for the gunman to be tackled and brought down. It was not, however, quick enough to prevent the OA from getting shot. It was unclear in the Season 1 finale whether the OA survived this shooting. It is also unclear where Season 2 of The OA will pick up from.   ""The science-fiction, metafictional elements are open-ended so there can be a part two in which we can delve into those spaces,"" Marling revealed to Vulture, indicating Season 2 of The OA could head out in any direction. According to IndieWire, the show's creators, Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij, have not yet started working on Season 2. Although they are excited to be teaming up with Netflix once more. As yet, no information has been revealed as to when Season 2 of The OA will premiere, or how many episodes will be included. Season 1 of The OA is currently airing on Netflix. The synopsis is below.

As The Washington Post points out, Orlando is ""a city located 450 miles south of Atlanta in a different state"" and ""is a popular Florida tourist destination and home to Mickey Mouse. It was also, on June 12 of last year, the site of the most deadly mass shooting in U.S. history.""

578945091,2017-02-09 16:17:48,Hearing for Jason Dalton's statements in mass shooting case postponed,http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2017/02/hearing_for_jason_daltons_stat.html,en,False,,65422,mlive.com,http://mlive.com/," KALAMAZOO, MI -- A hearing set for Friday on a motion to suppress Jason Dalton's statements in the Kalamazoo mass shooting has been postponed. An evidentiary hearing had been set for Friday, Feb. 10, in Kalamazoo County Circuit Court on a motion by Dalton's attorney, Eusebio Solis, to suppress his client's statements to police. That date has been postponed, but no new date has been set, according to a press release from the Kalamazoo County Prosecuting Attorney's Office. Kalamazoo County Circuit Court Judge Alexander C. Lipsey is expected to set a trial date after ruling on the motion. It's been nearly a year since Dalton, an Uber driver, allegedly went on a shooting rampage that left six people dead and two seriously injured Feb. 20, 2016, at three locations in Kalamazoo County. Dalton, 46, of Cooper Township, is charged with six counts of murder, two counts of assault with intent to commit murder and eight felony firearm counts. He was found competent to stand trial in April and was ordered to stand trial in May. Solis in September had filed a notice notifying the court he intended to file a motion to suppress Dalton's statements. In his interviews with police the day after the shooting, Dalton told police the Uber app on his cellphone was to blame, claiming the app took over his Chevrolet Equinox - and later his body - and said ""things began to get really weird"" on Feb. 20 in the hours before the mass killing. The court will hold an evidentiary hearing on the motion to suppress Dalton's statements on Feb. 10. After ruling on the motion, Lipsey is expected to set a trial date.

                since Despite the best intentions of the list, however, the system has proven to be confusing and flawed. On numerous occassions, the watch list has failed to prevent attacks — Omar Mateen, who carried out a mass shooting at an Orlando nightclub, was previously on the list in 2013 but was removed after 10 months — or have failed at tracking potential terrorists, such as the failed 2009 underwear bomber. On the other hand, it is incredibly easy for innocent suspects to be placed on the watch list with no warning. Whereas some obvious indicators will land someone on the list, such as carrying out a violent attack at an airport, other innocuous actions such as being an acquaintance of a suspect on the watch list can also lead to being watch-listed. And being removed from the list can be as opaque as being placed on it. Most suspects on the list never know they're technically under investigation. As inclusion the list is not typically disclosed, pursuing legal challenges to be removed from the list is notoriously difficult — even though the FBI is meant to remove people from the list in a timely manner if its investigations are concluded without finding guilt. ""Instead of a watch list limited to actual, known terrorists, the government has built a vast system based on the unproven and flawed premise that it can predict if a person will commit a terrorist act in the future,"" Hina Shamsi, the head of the ACLU’s National Security Project, told The Intercept. ""On that dangerous theory, the government is secretly blacklisting people as suspected terrorists and giving them the impossible task of proving themselves innocent of a threat they haven't carried out.""

Our hearts are broken by the loss of six wonderful lives that were cruelly cut short. We will not forget them as we struggle to come to grips that such a tragedy could have occurred at an event that is the very embodiment of positivity and shared love of music in the global dance community.” The new statement adds, “As days go by, we will draw inspiration from (murdered security detail) Kirk (Wilson) and Geovanni (Francisco Ruiz Murillo)’s heroic and selfless acts. We will also continue to grieve the deaths and pray for the families of the four victims who were with us as guests.” The four murdered guests were identified as Rafael Penaloza Vega (Mexico), Alejandra Villanueva (U.S.), Daniel Pessina (Italy) and Giovanni Arturo Amparan Saragossa (Mexico).

After watching the Cubs win the World Series and California get enough rain to pull the state from a drought, it’s reassuring to see that some constants remain in our world. Related Articles

This year’s price increases weren’t as steep as in years past. The biggest jump, by percentage, was for parking, which went up from $18 to $20 a day – an 11 percent increase. One-day tickets went up $2 to $5, depending upon the time of year you visit. Multi-day tickets went up between $4 and $20, depending on the number of days you visit and whether you want the Park Hopper option or not. Annual passes went up $10 to $20, except for the highest-priced Signature and Signature Plus passes, whose prices remain unchanged from when they were introduced in October 2015. And Disney kept the monthly payment option for local annual pass holders, meaning that many fans in the Southern California won’t see their monthly payment to go to Disneyland go up by more than a buck. But that hasn’t kept some fans from feeling upset about the increase. For years, Disneyland offered one of the best entertainment values in Southern California, if not the world. A Disneyland ticket provided a great value for anyone who wanted a day of world-class entertainment at a reasonable cost. But “great value” is another way of saying “under-priced.” At some point, Disney was going to figure out that it could close that value gap, jack its prices far faster than inflation, and still hold on to its customers. So it did. Over the past decade, one-day ticket prices to Disneyland have nearly doubled, rising from $66 in 2007 to up to $124 a day now. Yet attendance has continued to climb, too, rising from 14.87 million to 18.28 million visitors a year at Disneyland between 2007 and 2015 and from 5.68 million to 9.38 million visitors annually at Disney California Adventure, according to the most recent Themed Entertainment Association’s industry attendance reports. If people were mad at Disney for raising its prices, not enough of them stopped buying tickets to make the parks’ attendance go down – until, perhaps, this past year. The Walt Disney Company recently reported a drop in annual attendance at the Disneyland and Walt Disney World Resorts. Could the value gap finally be closed? Granted, the Diamond Celebration ended and Star Wars land construction has kept several Disneyland attractions closed for the year. In Orlando, a hurricane, a fatal alligator attack and a mass shooting kept Walt Disney World’s hometown in the news for all the wrong reasons last summer. Maybe if Disney’s prices were the deal that they were more than a decade ago, enough people would have kept coming out to the parks to keep attendance rising despite those challenges. But they didn’t. If Disney really has closed its value gap, then it won’t be able to keep raising prices faster than inflation – unless, of course, it builds new attractions that people find worth that extra expense. I believe that most fans would see that as a fair trade. But would Disney have to build a lot more than a new “Star Wars” land and maybe a new Marvel land, while keeping prices steady, for fans to get back to enjoying the same value from Disney tickets that they did a generation ago? Should Disney continue to expect the same level of brand loyalty from its guests that it did back then? Closing the value gap on theme park tickets might make Disney’s bottom line look better, but it also encourages its loyal customers to start shopping around. Which brings me to this point: Universal Studios Hollywood recently said that it enjoyed record-setting attendance last year. Interesting.

The ForeverStrong Memorial Foundation was revealed by Laurie Smith at a candlelight vigil held on the one-year anniversary of the mass shooting, which took the lives of her son, husband and four other people on Feb. 20, 2016. The foundation is a non-profit organization created to strengthen the communities affected while honoring the victims and survivors of both tragedies. The memorial is a multi-year project and will consist of several unique sections including an indoor soccer/multipurpose facility, outdoor soccer fields, large remembrance panels dedicated to victims and survivors, a memorial pavilion and more. Concepts and designs were shown at Monday night's vigil. The memorial could take up a minimum of 28 acres of land and a maximum of 32, according to architect David VanderKlok. He said they have a location in mind along a ""major thoroughfare"" in Kalamazoo but did not reveal a specific location. ""I can't think of a better way to carry on the legacies of those people that we lost and those that are critically injured forever and ever,"" said Smith, whose son Tyler, one of those killed in the shootings, was an avid soccer player. ""It's (the memorial) a good way for us to have hope and dive into something that's going to make a difference."" VanderKlok worked with Smith, fellow family members of victims and survivors to create the memorial design. ""Some want to engage about this and help a lot. Some are really struggling, really struggling,"" VanderKlok said of working with those affected. In addition to those killed in the shooting rampage, the memorial will honor five bicyclists who were killed and four injured when a pickup truck struck a group of cyclists north of Kalamazoo on June 7, 2016. Neither Smith nor VanderKlok have disclosed a cost for the project, but Smith said they are just beginning to work with Hopkins Fundraising Consulting in Grand Rapids. Their first effort will be to conduct a feasibility study and once that is completed, they will start speaking to foundations and corporations in the area in search of financial support. The final step, pending how much Smith and others with the foundation are able to raise, will be to launch a public fundraising campaign. ""We'd love to have it tomorrow but in all reality, this an enormous undertaking, moreso than I think anybody could have imagined,"" VanderKlok said. ""Life's too short to spend time on things that you're not passionate about and when we all leave this earth it's about who we've impacted and whose lives we touched, not about what we had,"" Smith said. ""And I believe that the memorial that we've come up with will impact a lot more lives and will touch a lot more people than if we put up a smaller one.""

Americans for Responsible Solutions, the group co-founded by Giffords and her husband after she was severely wounded in a 2011 attack in Arizona that killed six others, announced a new statewide coalition designed to build backing for gun-safety legislation, particularly among gun owners, law enforcement officials and military veterans. “Stopping gun violence takes courage, the courage to do what is right, the courage of new ideas,” said Giffords, in brief comments at a news conference. “Now is the time to come together, be responsible. Democrats, Republicans — everyone.” Giffords joined in a public discussion at a conference room in the Capitol about efforts to reduce gun violence alongside local and state prosecutors, a county sheriff and local advocates for new gun regulations. The New Mexico Legislature is considering two high-profile initiatives designed to reduce gun violence — a unique position among states this year, according to Robin Lloyd, director of governmental affairs for Americans for Responsible Solutions. “New Mexico lawmakers have the opportunity to pass life-saving bills this session,” said Lloyd, whose group is actively meeting with legislators. One Democrat-sponsored initiative would expand background checks against a federal database to nearly all private firearms transactions, with exceptions for transfers between relatives or briefly lending a gun for hunting, sport shooting or situations of imminent danger. An unlicensed gun buyer and seller would go to a federally licensed dealer to complete a background check for a fee before a sale can be completed. Another bill would require guns to be surrendered in domestic violence situations where a protective order has been issued. Firearms would be turned over for safekeeping to law enforcement, a federally licensed gun dealer or an individual that has undergone a federal background check. Bills under both initiatives are undergoing revisions in attempts to address criticism before they reach a full House or Senate vote. Opponents of background-check legislation, including the New Mexico Sheriffs’ Association and many Republican lawmakers, say it would not deter convicted criminals from obtaining stolen weapons on the black market, while placing new obligation on legitimate gun buyers. Rep. Harry Garcia, D-Grants, who represents a sprawling rural district anchored in western New Mexico, described an outpouring of opposition to the background-check bill from his constituents. Garcia said he has made hundreds of phone calls to ensure that email complaints are authentic. “People just don’t want to have people infringe upon their rights” to access firearms, he said Wednesday. “They are so afraid that once it starts, it will never stop.” The firearms proposals in New Mexico have been the focus of intensive lobbying campaigns from the gun industry through the National Rifle Association and by the gun-safety group Everytown for Gun Safety, steered by media mogul and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

As they gathered for media day, they had some interaction with their new coach in workouts and the mini-camp, but nothing replaces practice. The Orlando Magic will open their 2021-22 home schedule one week from Friday when Evan Fournier leads the New York Knicks into the Amway Center. For the first time in seven years, the Magic will open their season on the road when the schedule tips off Wednesday against the San Antonio Spurs. When Cole Anthony arrived at Summer League, he was still buzzing from a strong finish to the season. He was in line to get Rookie of the Month in April as he took charge of a team beginning a rebuild and seemed like a sure thing for an All-Rookie team appearance. A new era in Orlando Magic history is about to begin. Jamahl Mosley takes over as head coach after the franchise made two playoff appearances in three years under Steve Clifford. The Orlando Magic are still establishing their identity and the kind of team they want to be. That is certainly partly an attitude too. They want to take on challenges and meet them. This is the Mohamed Bamba everyone always imagined. In the final moments of Sunday’s preseason game against the San Antonio Spurs, the Orlando Magic were scrambling to get back. Robin Lopez has not hidden why he is in Orlando. It is not to go to Disney all the time (although that is a good perk). He said it is to be a leader and be available for whatever the young team needs of him. The Philadelphia 76ers may be able to convince Ben Simmons to report to training camp, but that does not mean the star point guard intends to play another game for the franchise. It is hard to draw too many conclusions from the Orlando Magic’s first three preseason games. There are still far too many players missing and playing rotations are still all jumbled up — let alone what their opponents are trying to do and accomplish with the time they are given. As the preseason continues, the Orlando Magic saw bright spots in their play as they continue to work toward the regular season. The final score of Sunday’s game read: San Antonio Spurs 101, Orlando Magic 100. The Orlando Magic make their home preseason debut as they take on the San Antonio Spurs in a small preview of the team’s season opener one week away. Orlando Magic (0-2) vs. The Orlando Magic traded away three of their starters last season. Nikola Vucevic, Aaron Gordon, and Evan Fournier. They traded one of the best centers in the league after years of commitment to the organization. The Orlando Magic decided to go full rebuild last season, trading some of their more prominent players, such as Aaron Gordon, Nikola Vucevic, and Evan Fournier at the trade deadline. Orlando Magic coach Jamahl Mosley established at least the outlines of what he wanted his team to accomplish offensively early on in his tenure with the team. The Orlando Magic franchise has had some incredible players play for them over the years. The names include multiple Hall of Famers in Shaquille O’Neal, Grant Hill, and Tracy McGrady. Their presence is undoubtedly there at the end of practices at the Advent Health Practice Facility. It is hard to miss either Jonathan Isaac or Chuma Okeke when they are in the building. Here are a few takeaways following the first week of preseason The road portion of the Magic’s preseason schedule is complete. With two games in the books, and two more to go, the Magic’s performance so far probably has raised more questions than it has answered. For the public, preseason is all we get. The only chance we get to have a hint of what the Orlando Magic are going to look like before the season begins. Orlando Magic fans were excited by the potential of Mohamed Bamba when the team made him the sixth pick n the 2018 NBA Draft. Mohamed Bamba was billed then as a 3-point shooting Rudy Gobert. The Magic announced in a press release (via Twitter) that they have opted to pick up their third-year team options on second-year players Cole Anthony, Chuma Okeke and R.J. Jonathan Isaac expressed that he feels individuals should be allowed to make choices about what medications they want to put in their bodies. Isaac and Fultz are still recovering from significant ACL injuries. Isaac tore his ACL and meniscus in August 2020 and Fultz tore his ACL in January 2021. More than 90% of NBA players are vaccinated. However, several high-profile players remain unvaccinated, including Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving, Golden State Warriors swingman Andrew Wiggins and Orlando Magic forward Jonathan Isaac. Mohamed Bamba and Wendell Carter Jr are each eligible for a rookie-scale extension but the organization is unlikely to make long-term commitments to both centers. The reboot has officially begun in Orlando. After trading away Nikola Vucevic and Aaron Gordon at last season’s trade deadline, the Magic are finally embracing the long-term build compared to wallowing in no-man’s land. Moore appeared in 27 games with the Suns on a one-year contract last season, including one start. He averaged 4.9 points and 1.5 assists in 14.4 minutes The Magic confirmed Friday that Suggs won't take the court again in Las Vegas. The Orlando Magic made the headlines on Monday night when a 29-year-old player made his debut in the 2021 Summer League.  Orlando made some interesting moves this offseason, especially on draft night, landing Jalen Suggs and Franz Wagner a couple of weeks ago. Few were expecting Jalen Suggs to fall to the Orlando Magic at No. 5 overall, but it turns out that there may have been good reason for his slide.

585843949,2017-02-24 23:27:48,"Hundreds say goodbye to Amie Muller, who sounded alarm over toxic risks for Iraq veterans",http://www.startribune.com/local/414753924.html,en,False,,19,Star Tribune ,http://www.startribune.com/,"National Guard veteran Amie Muller believed deployments to Iraq caused the cancer that killed her. She worked and lived next to burn pits that billowed toxic smoke night and day at an air base in northern Iraq. After returning to Minnesota, she began experiencing health problems usually not seen in a woman in her 30s. Muller died a week ago, nine months after being diagnosed with Stage III pancreatic cancer. On Friday, more than 800 of her friends and family gathered at a memorial service in Woodbury to remember the life of the 36-year-old mother of three. A pastor noted her loss was both painful and seemingly incomprehensible. “I wish there was a simple way to explain what has happened to Amie. Why Amie is gone,” said Pastor Lisa Renlund. “Life truly isn’t that simple. It can get messy. It can feel complicated. It can seem unfair.” But others also are remembering Muller’s battle to win recognition from the U.S. government for victims of the burn pits, which have the potential of becoming the Iraq and Afghanistan wars’ equivalent of the Vietnam War’s Agent Orange. It took nearly three decades for the U.S. government to eventually link the defoliant used in Vietnam to cancer. Muller first told her story in the Star Tribune last year shortly after she was diagnosed.    






                    Elizabeth Flores - Star Tribune
                

                                            Brian Muller was comforted by daughter EmmyLu as he bid farewell to his wife at her funeral services Friday. In an interview in August, she spoke about the frustrations of a life put on hold. Fatigued from chemotherapy and complications from medical procedures, she also talked about getting the word out about what she believed is the burn pits’ toxic legacy. “It’s kind of like what you’d imagine what hospice would feel like, where you are just waiting and waiting and you don’t have any energy,” she said. “But I want to make sure other people are getting their voices heard, too.” Flames stoked with jet fuel In 2005 and in 2007, Muller was deployed to Balad, Iraq, with the Minnesota Air National Guard, embedded with a military intelligence squadron. The burn pit near her living quarters there was one of the most notorious of the more than 230 that were constructed at military bases across Iraq and Afghanistan before their use was restricted in 2009. Items ranging from Styrofoam to metals and plastics to electrical equipment to human body parts were incinerated, the flames stoked with jet fuel. Covering more than 10 acres, Balad’s burn pit operated at all hours and consumed an estimated 100 to 200 tons of waste a day. It was hastily constructed upwind from the base, and its plumes consistently drifted toward the 25,000 troops stationed there. Muller fatigued easily after returning home and began to wonder whether a host of ailments from migraines to fibromyalgia were connected to her military service at Balad. She was diagnosed with cancer last May. Julie Tomaska deployed with Muller in 2005 and 2007 and the two lived side by side. Shortly after coming home, Tomaska, too, suffered from chronic fatigue, headaches and digestive problems. Her disability claim with the VA was approved with a diagnosis of “environmental exposures.” The two became almost inseparable after Muller was diagnosed. Tomaska helped navigate the paperwork for Muller’s disability claims and attended treatments with her at the Mayo Clinic, shooting selfies in the exam room. She was at her friend’s bedside when she died. Now, Tomaska and Muller’s family hope to establish a foundation for military families affected by pancreatic cancer. Burn Pits Act “I promised her that I would make sure that everybody knew about this,” she said. “It’s hard to be so proud and happy about the military accomplishments you made when you feel like you died because of this, and because we’re having friends drop like flies. “When we came home we felt like we were lucky and it just doesn’t feel like that anymore.” The Department of Veterans Affairs’ position on burn pit exposure has not changed. It believes research has not established evidence of long-term health problems. But there has been movement. A registry for service members based on where they were stationed during deployments now includes more than 100,000 people. Earlier this month, U.S. Sens. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., introduced bipartisan legislation, the Helping Veterans Exposed to Burn Pits Act, that would create a center of excellence within the VA to better understand the health effects associated with burn pits and to treat veterans who become sick after exposure. Klobuchar said she is encouraged by work being done at the Minneapolis VA looking at links between exposure to toxic substances and the use of anti-inflammatories for treatment.    








                                            Amie Muller died a week ago, nine months after being diagnosed with Stage III pancreatic cancer. “What’s important to me is that we keep doing this research and we don’t close our eyes and pretend that it’s just a coincidence that these veterans came home with these illnesses,” she said. “It’s a sad chapter, whether it was Agent Orange or Gulf War Syndrome, that people had to wait this long. We don’t want this to happen again with burn pits.” Joseph Hickman, a veteran and author of “The Burn Pits: The Poisoning of America’s Soldiers,” sees the legislation as progress but still worries that many veterans are being stonewalled and their benefits claims delayed, often until after they have died. “When we sent these veterans to war, we didn’t have any questions for them. We just sent them off and had total faith in them,” Hickman said. “Now they are coming home and they are being questioned by the VA and the [Department of Defense] and a lot of them are being told they are not being honest about their illnesses. We had so much faith in them when they left, we’ve got to have faith in them now and believe them.” Showed ‘heart and grace’ At Muller’s memorial service Friday, honor guards stood solemnly, their heads bowed, next to a portrait and an urn containing her remains. The Patriot Guard stood outside in a growing snowstorm as mourners entered for the services at Crossroads Church in Woodbury. Photos of Muller’s life that included Caribbean family vacations and military deployments and training were projected on giant screens in the sanctuary. Retired Lt. Col. Audra Flanagan noted that Muller was trained as a military photojournalist. She created a program to honor fallen service members by providing a video and photographic record for family members. She covered services for those who were killed in action or took their own lives, documenting the dignified transfer of remains, military funerals and honor guards. She covered services for a Tuskegee airman and for a soldier killed in the Fort Hood mass shooting. As a graphic artist, she designed the state’s Gold Star license plate for spouses and parents of military members killed in active service. “No one could have honored our fallen service members with the same heart and grace as Amie,” Flanagan said. Muller will be buried Monday at Fort Snelling National Cemetery.  © 2021 StarTribune. All rights reserved."

Bilyk has been involved in all the fundraising opportunities for the families affected by the mass shootings of Feb. 20, 2016, that left six dead and Abigal and another woman injured. Turning a negative into a positive, Bilyk decided to organize a fundraiser to help the Kopf family pay for medical expenses. ""You can wish it all away or you can do something to help in the aftermath,"" Bilyk said. On Saturday morning, more than 32 vendors set up shop at Western Michigan University's Fetzer Center. Brittney Huepenbecker, a consultant for Lularoe Britt's Boutique, also came out to support the Kopf family. Huepenbecker will donate $3 for every pair of leggings she sells and $5 for every other item. Portage resident Christina Middleton crochets all her products by hand and is donating 30 percent of the sale price for each item sold. Bilyk is hoping to raise $2,000 and plans on meeting up with the Kopf family early next week to give them the money.

587951364,2017-03-01 20:13:37,Boivin: Debate about gay athletes calls for compassion,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/276390840/0/phoenix/sports~Boivin-Debate-about-gay-athletes-calls-for-compassion/,en,False,,25128,AZCentral,http://www.azcentral.com,"Fifteen years ago, when Suns rookie Amar’e Stoudemire moved into his first Phoenix home, a neighbor welcomed him with a plate of cookies. Unsure of how to respond, the 19-year-old improvised and delivered a pair of signed basketball shoes. If only Stoudemire continued to react with such tact. The former NBA player’s comments Tuesday that he would “shower across the street” if he learned a teammate was gay was further proof that we’re a society still struggling to adapt to the more-transparent face of pro sports, one that includes gay athletes, officials and administrators. It’s time to trade the vitriol for compassion, ignorance for education, hysteria for patience. Few feel comfortable discussing the reality: Gay athletes exist in professional locker rooms. If 3.8 percent of the population is gay, as a recent study by UCLA’s Williams Institute suggests, then approximately 64 NFL players, 29 baseball players, 26 NHL players and 17 NBA players are, too. Even if the numbers are lower, it still says something that no active athlete in the four major men's sports has come out. Dialogue is needed. League leadership should set the example. RELATED: Amar'e Stoudemire under fire for gay comments At least the NBA has. During last year’s LGBT Pride Parade in New York City, the NBA and WNBA became the first professional sports leagues to march in the event, with NBA commissioner Adam Silver wearing an #OrlandoUnited T-shirt in remembrance of the Orlando mass shooting at a gay nightclub that killed 49. The San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers have held special LGBT events, but they are more the exception than the rule. Locally, the Mercury annually celebrate with a Pride event and the Coyotes have held an LGBT night. In fact, the Coyotes’ Reebok Gray Rainbow Pride T-shirt is a top-seller among T-shirts on NHL.com. But many other pro teams are hesitant to do anything. One reason is personal beliefs by executives. Some have told me such events are hard to reconcile with their Christianity. An article in the Christian Post last year called for NFL players to “threaten a boycott if the NFL continues to be an aggressive tool of gay activism and an aggressive opponent of religious liberty.” That’s the ideal example of an argument that demands discussion – civil discord, not finger-pointing and pejoratives. Both sides would benefit from thoughtful debate, but as the presidential election has taught us, passion leaves little room for healthy conversation. We don’t have to agree. We just have to talk about it. And compassion should extend in all directions. BOIVIN: Bravo to trailblazing My-King Johnson Stoudemire, who is playing for Hapoel Jerusalem in the Israeli Premier League, made his comments after an Israeli Web site reporter asked him what he would do if he learned a teammate was gay. When asked if his comments were a joke, he said, “I mean, there’s always a truth within a joke.” He later issued an apology saying he was a “huge supporter of civil rights for all people.” His quick apology was important. People say dumb things all the time. It shouldn’t shape him. It’s how he moves forward that matters. Former WNBA player Candice Wiggins found herself in the headlines recently when she told the San Diego Union-Tribune she was bullied by other league players. “Me being heterosexual and straight, and being vocal in my identity as a straight woman was huge,” she said. “I would say 98 percent of the women in the WNBA are gay women. It was a conformist type of place. There was a whole different set of rules they (the other players) could apply. “There was a lot of jealousy and competition, and we’re all fighting for crumbs. The way I looked, the way I played – those things contributed to the tension.” RELATED: My-King Johnson to make NCAA history as 1st openly gay football scholarship player The good news is this is a conversation we weren’t having a decade ago. And while many are concerned Wiggins’ comments are playing into stereotypes, we shouldn’t be so quick to attack her either. She felt something, perceived or otherwise, and it should be examined. Former Mercury player Monique Currie, now with the San Antonio Stars, put it best in her personal blog when she said that if Wiggins “was bullied because she was ‘proud to be a woman,’ then these feelings are real and we cannot discount what she felt,” but also that “Wiggins needs to check her privilege at the door, and not group her very unfortunate personal experiences on an entire group of women.” She added that “in my 11 seasons in the WNBA I've never witnessed the kind of bullying Wiggins describes in her interview. This does not mean it did not happen, but I'm proud to be a part of a league that supports inclusion and celebrates all players regardless of their race, religion or sexuality. We are a family made up of players that love and respect the game of basketball.” Isn’t that ultimately what matters, that all of us – fans, players, owners – love and respect the sports we watch/play/rule? Let’s continue to talk about them. With civility. Reach Paola Boivin at paola.boivin@arizonarepublic.com and on Twitter at Twitter.com/PaolaBoivin.

588076123,2017-03-02 04:16:11,"Who&#39;s calling the shots?
",http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/mar/02/who-s-calling-the-shots-20170302/,en,False,,56,Arkansas Democrat-Gazette ,http://www2.arkansasonline.com/,"We're close to learning whether the National Rifle Association can be stood up to in Arkansas. You're thinking we already know, and that the answer is no. You're thinking Arkansas is perhaps the most gun-crazed along the wide swath of gun-crazed states. You're thinking rural Republican legislators--who have only lately taken over the state with the NRA's vital help--would in no way risk the NRA's displeasure. You're thinking rural Republican legislators will do whatever it takes to avoid NRA mailings into homes in their districts giving them bad grades on gun issues as they face primary opponents vowing never to be the gun wusses they were. But I'm here to tell you that I'm seeing actual resistance to the NRA at the state Capitol. It starts with Gov. Asa Hutchinson, once a spokesman for the gun lobby advocating firearms in schools, and extends to all but the most weirdly extreme in the Republican legislative caucus. The quick background: Rep. Charlie Collins of Fayetteville had the bill to permit faculty and staff members at colleges who had concealed-carry permits to carry their weapons on campus. The state Senate amended it to say those persons could carry on campus, but only with an additional 16-hour State Police course in active-shooter situations. Collins compromised with Hutchinson to accept the 16-hour additional training but expand the eligible campus-carry population to students above the age of 25. It was at that point that a couple of bigshots from NRA headquarters rolled into town. They did not like--and would not stand for--the idea that one of their reliable states would dare add any additional regulatory burden, meaning that 16-hour training, on citizens seeking to carry firearms. The NRA's position was that the existing concealed-carry licensing process was imposition enough on the Second Amendment. It would accept nothing less than full permission for any person with a concealed-carry license--anybody, any age, student or teacher or staff member or visitor--to carry that gun on a college campus. Rural Republican senators like Sen. Linda Collins-Smith of Pocahontas, hearing the NRA say ""jump,"" dutifully leapt. Alas, so did Charlie Collins' co-sponsor in the Senate, meaning the man carrying the bill for him in that chamber--Sen. Trent Garner of El Dorado. Garner, a freshman from the most pro-gun area of a pro-gun state, had set out merely to help Collins extend gun-carrying privileges on college and campuses. But suddenly he found himself inadvertently crossways with the NRA. He freaked. He arranged to send the bill back to the Senate Judiciary Committee to be amended in the NRA's image. In case that didn't work, he filed a shell bill titled ""constitutional carry."" That phrase, ""constitutional carry,"" generally means a right to carry a gun under the concealed-carry license anywhere guns are permitted, and it is a fresh bill into which Garner could amend text as dictated by his NRA masters glowering from the Senate gallery. To be clear to moms and dads: The NRA wants anybody with a concealed-carry permit, including any student of any age, to be allowed to run around our colleges carrying guns, and not to be inconvenienced by having to sit through any nettlesome additional State Police-provided training session in how to react if a mass shooting incident breaks out. But get a load of this: As of this writing midday Wednesday, the NRA's local lobbyist seemed to be softening, understanding the local dynamic and that he didn't need to be crossways with an old gun-totin' friend like the governor. But the NRA's national headquarters ... well, it was merely wavering, or so I was told. While in Washington earlier in the week, Asa dropped in on the national NRA folks to tell them the campus-carry fight back home was, as he put it in a press availability session Tuesday, ""an Arkansas issue, not an NRA issue."" It is a new Arkansas indeed when the left flank on gun issues--or what passes for a left flank--is manned by a former NRA spokesman like Asa Hutchinson. Has Hutchinson moderated or has Arkansas politics gone off the right-wing cliff? Yes. Some sort of compromise seems to be in the offing, depending on NRA headquarters and whether some of its legislative acolytes in Arkansas--such as Linda Collins-Smith--could be reasoned with. It might come down to whether the NRA would agree not to use votes on the issue in its calculation of legislators' report cards. Perhaps they could vote for training and keep their precious A's. Even if the NRA is stood up to, guns will be more prevalent on college campuses in September. That issue has been decided, at least until someone files suit citing the state constitutional provision that the Legislature can't tell colleges and universities how to run their business. ------------v------------ John Brummett, whose column appears regularly in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, was inducted into the Arkansas Writers' Hall of Fame in 2014.

Gabrielle Giffords inflamed the gun debate across the nation. But a memorial proposed for downtown Tucson won't touch on gun control; instead, it will celebrate how the tragic events brought together not only the Tucson community, but also a nation, supporters of the January 8th Memorial say. On Wednesday, they sought $2.5 million in support from the state Legislature to help make the planned memorial a reality. They got an initial approval, with a 12-0 vote from the House Appropriations Committee. It's the first step in a process that ultimately will become part of the state budget debate. The project seeks to give people a tangible reminder of a dark day and the unifying aftermath that are etched in Arizona history. Crystal Kasnoff, executive director of the project, said the intent of the memorial is to celebrate how people reacted to the tragic events. Backers don't want to get into a divisive, heated issue such as gun policy, she said at a state Capitol news conference. ""The gun that shot the bullets that day didn't discriminate,"" Kasnoff said. Four of those killed were Republicans, one was a Democrat and the sixth was a 9-year-old girl, she said. ""It would be a complete injustice to take a stand on any issue,"" she said. While the bill introduced by Rep. Todd Clodfleter, R-Tucson, has support across party lines, he urged lawmakers to look at it as a nonpartisan matter that does not get into political divides. At the news conference, Rep. Daniel Hernandez, D-Tucson, recalled the events of six years ago: He was five days into an internship with Giffords. He stanched the bleeding from her head wound as they waited for paramedics to take over. Pam Simon, another Giffords staff member who was wounded, said in the aftermath of the shooting, spontaneous memorials sprang up around town: at the shopping center, at Giffords' congressional office and at the University Medical Hospital where many of the victims were taken. She saw one of the memorials from her hospital window. It was a display of flowers, balloons and candles left by people of all backgrounds. ""People needed to do something,"" she said. ""They needed a place to go, a place to reflect."" The memorial is designed to provide that, and to recognize how people can rise above their differences. The plan calls for a memorial in El Presidio Park, in the heart of Tucson. ""This is where our democracy is,"" Kasnoff said, noting it abuts the city's courts and government buildings, and is home to many of the city's festivals. ""This is where Tucson comes together,"" Kasnoff said.

They must be matched by private fundraising. Tucson auto dealer Jim Click, co-chairman with Giffords of the project, said he has committed $250,000 to the effort and is working on fundraising efforts to raise another $250,000. Also, Congress must designate the site as an ""affiliated area"" of the National Park Service by mid-2023. Arizona's congressional delegation has introduced bills in both the House and the Senate to make that happen. Kasnoff said studies done on other sites that have received Park Service ""affiliate"" status have shown an increase in visitation and a resulting increase in jobs and tax collection. They looked at the experience of the Oklahoma City bombing site, outside a federal courthouse, as well as the Flight 93 memorial site in a field in Pennsylvania. The measure now goes to the House Rules Committee before heading to the full House for debate and a vote.

578734613,2017-02-09 05:22:11,Spicer claims he ‘clearly meant Orlando’ after citing mystery Atlanta terrorist attack three times,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/02/09/spicer-claims-he-clearly-meant-orlando-after-citing-mystery-atlanta-terror-attack-three-times/,en,False,,2,Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,"This article is more than 1 year old On three occasions in two days, White House press secretary Sean Spicer rattled off examples of terrorist attacks on U.S. soil while defending President Trump’s travel ban affecting seven majority-Muslim countries. All three times, the talking point was nearly identical: We must do more — just ask the victims’ families. What was puzzling, though, were the cities he invoked to prove this point. Spicer mentioned San Bernardino, Calif., and Boston, both places where the attacks were carried out by people who had self-radicalized in the United States but had foreign ties. Then he threw in Atlanta, a city whose only terrorist attack were bombings orchestrated by a Florida-born domestic terrorist with no foreign ties. They happened in the 1990s, including one during the 1996 Olympics. The head scratching commenced. Reporters scrambled to identify what exactly Spicer was implying with the Atlanta addition. That the travel ban could have prevented a born and bred U.S. citizen from attacking Atlanta? Was this another “Bowling Green massacre” incident, the White House again invoking a terrorist attack that never actually happened? Kellyanne Conway cites ‘Bowling Green massacre’ that never happened to defend travel ban The Daily Beast was the first to link the three Atlanta references, but when it asked the White House for clarification, it got no reply, the publication reported. CNN followed up with its own version of the story, and Spicer didn’t answer its questions either. Reports from other news media followed. Then nearly 24 hours after the Daily Beast broke the story, Spicer offered an explanation via email to ABC News: When he referenced the Atlanta terrorist attack, he “clearly meant Orlando.” A White House spokesperson confirmed that clarification in an email to The Washington Post Thursday morning. Orlando, a city located 450 miles south of Atlanta in a different state, is a popular Florida tourist destination and home to Mickey Mouse. It was also, on June 12 of last year, the site of the most deadly mass shooting in U.S. history. Forty-nine people were killed and even more injured when officials say Omar Mateen stormed Pulse, a popular gay dance club, on Latin night and opened fire. President Trump and his aides, including Kellyanne Conway, have been using the attacks in Orlando, San Bernardino and Boston as talking points during media circuits to defend the ban. But the administration’s use of all three cities — particularly Orlando — remains an odd choice. Kellyanne Conway’s ‘Bowling Green massacre’ wasn’t a slip of the tongue. She has said it before. Mateen was a U.S. citizen, born in New York to Afghan parents. He, like the Boston Marathon bombers and San Bernardino shooters, self-radicalized in the United States and had no direct ties to any terrorist organizations, though they claimed to be inspired by them. Afghanistan is not on Trump’s list of travel banned countries, nor is Pakistan, where Tashfeen Malik, one of the San Bernardino shooters, was born. Malik’s husband and co-attacker, Syed Farook, was an American-born U.S. citizen of Pakistani descent. And the countries where the Tsarnaev brothers, who bombed the Boston Marathon, were born aren’t on Trump’s ban list either. What the perpetrators in all three attacks do have in common, though, is their faith. All practiced Islam, a religion that President Trump has repeatedly disparaged in public appearances and tweets, words that could be weaponized against him as the courts decide the legality of his travel ban. The White House has insisted in recent weeks that the ban does not target Muslims. Trump’s own rhetoric, several state attorneys general argue, suggests otherwise. Trump’s loose talk about Muslims gets weaponized in court against travel ban Spicer’s Atlanta revelation comes just two days after President Trump suggested during a trip to Florida that the news media is purposefully not covering acts of terror. Spicer later clarified the president’s remarks, claiming what he really meant to say was that certain incidents were “underreported.” Hours later, the press secretary provided examples — a list of 78 alleged terrorists attacks that occurred between 2014 and 2016. As a frame for the way the Trump administration views terrorism, the list was telling. Not only was it littered with spelling errors, but the list contained factually inaccurate information. More than half of the incidents involved two or fewer deaths and the list focused largely on Western victims, even though the vast majority of terrorism deaths occur in a handful of geographically concentrated Muslim-majority countries. Three of those countries — Iraq, Nigeria and Syria — weren’t mentioned at all on the White House list. The other two, Pakistan and Afghanistan, got a single mention each, for attacks that injured one U.S. citizen and killed 14 Nepali security guards, respectively. No Atlanta terrorist attack was included on the list, but the exhaustively covered San Bernardino and Orlando attacks were. What’s largely and glaringly missing from Trump’s list of terrorist attacks: Non-Western victims “Two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized, and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre,” Conway told MSNBC’s Chris Matthews in an interview on Feb. 2. “Most people didn’t know that because it didn’t get covered.” It didn’t get covered, it turns out, because a massacre in Bowling Green, Ky., never happened. Conway later claimed she misspoke, but The Washington Post later learned that the White House senior adviser had referenced a massacre or attack in Bowling Green during two additional interviews. This teed up the outcry that followed Spicer’s mention of a mystery Atlanta attack. On Jan. 29, ABC News’s Martha Raddatz asked Spicer about the travel ban and whether it led to humiliation for travelers denied entrance to the United States, like an Iraqi interpreter who worked for the U.S. military and was temporarily detained. No, Spicer said, then continued: The next day, during an appearance on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, Spicer revived the same line. New York Times reporter Jeremy Peters asked if President Trump was motivated to sign his executive order by an imminent threat to the United States. Spicer responded: Later that day, during his daily White House press briefing, Spicer lumped Atlanta into his examples for a third time: Before Spicer clarified his remarks late Wednesday, experts and the authorities had told the Daily Beast and CNN that Atlanta’s inclusion was nonsensical. Trump and his aides keep justifying the entry ban by citing attacks it couldn’t have prevented “There has not been a successful jihadi terror attack in Atlanta,” Seamus Hughes, deputy director of George Washington’s Center for Cyber and Homeland Security, told the Daily Beast. Atlanta police spokeswoman Elizabeth Espy told CNN by email that the last known terrorist attack in the state of Georgia was in 1996. That year, Eric Rudolph planted a 40-pound bomb filled with nails and screws in Centennial Park during the Olympic Games. One person died and more than 100 others were injured. Rudolph wasn’t named a suspect in the bombing until 1998, and wasn’t formally indicted until 2000. He was also charged in three other bombings; at an Alabama abortion clinic, near an Atlanta abortion clinic and outside a popular Atlanta lesbian nightclub. In 2005, Rudolph pleaded guilty to all four bombings and was sentenced to serve four consecutive life sentences plus 120 years in prison.

577309816,2017-02-06 15:03:00,President Trump is now speculating that the media is covering up terrorist attacks,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/02/06/president-trump-is-now-speculating-that-the-media-is-covering-up-terrorist-attacks/,en,False,,2,Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,"This article is more than 1 year old Speaking to the U.S. Central Command on Monday, President Trump went off his prepared remarks to make a truly stunning claim: The media was intentionally covering up reports of terrorist attacks. “You’ve seen what happened in Paris, and Nice. All over Europe, it’s happening,” he said to the assembled military leaders. “It’s gotten to a point where it’s not even being reported. And in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that.” The comment immediately harked back to comments from senior adviser Kellyanne Conway on MSNBC last week. “I bet it’s brand-new information to people that President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized and were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre,” she said. “Most people don’t know that because it didn’t get covered.” It was brand-new information to people because there was no “Bowling Green massacre.” Conway had referred to the supposed terrorist attack previously, including in response to a question posed by TMZ. But the two Iraqis arrested in Bowling Green, Ky., in 2011 never committed an attack in the United States. She later admitted that she’d misspoken. Trump’s comment goes far further than Conway’s, though. Her statement that “it didn’t get covered” probably referred to the alleged “six-month ban” from the Obama administration. (That this, too, didn’t happen has been somewhat swept under the rug.) Trump is positing that the media actively suppresses news of terrorist attacks to fulfill a political agenda. It’s certainly true that not every terrorist attack receives broad coverage in the national media. FiveThirtyEight looked at the likelihood that a terrorist attack in a foreign country would be covered by the New York Times, looking at coverage of 40,129 attacks from 1968 to 2009. Not every attack received coverage over that period. Last spring, the Los Angeles Times set out to log every single terrorist attack in the month of April, counting 180 attacks that killed 858 people. Not every one of those attacks made your local nightly newscast. The White House released a list of ‘under covered’ terror attacks it would like you to look at But filtering what to cover is very different than suppressing information. On any given day, local newspapers and news broadcasts decide what to spend resources on. If your home is burglarized, it may not make the cut. This probably isn’t because the Channel 5 news director has a vendetta against you; it’s that there are limited resources. Trump’s comment is very much in line with comments he made last June about President Barack Obama. “Look guys, we’re led by a man that either is not tough, not smart or has something else in mind,” Trump said about Obama’s response to the attack at a gay nightclub in Orlando. “And the something else in mind — people can’t believe it. People cannot believe that President Obama is acting the way he acts and can’t even mention the words radical Islamic terrorism. There’s something going on.” The clear implication: Obama is on the side of the terrorists. Trump didn’t quite say that the media was siding with the terrorists, just that the media would happily ignore terrorism if it made Trump look bad. Interestingly, Trump himself ignored the mass shooting that occurred at a mosque in Quebec last week, killing six people. White House press secretary Sean Spicer told the media that the president and the Canadian prime minister had spoken, but Trump himself declined to weigh in. (Spicer cited the attack mostly as somehow validating Trump’s immigration policies.) Trump did tweet about another attack. In that one, no one was killed. Trump has consistently seen attacks like that in Quebec — committed by a young man who espoused anti-Muslim politics and defended Trump online — as isolated incidents from mentally disturbed individuals, while attacks by Muslims are part of a broader pattern spurred by radical Islamism. He sees an institution behind attacks by Muslims that he doesn’t see behind attacks like that in Quebec or in Charleston in 2015. That helps explain why he is willing to focus the country’s anti-terrorism efforts solely on terrorism committed in the name of Islam: He doesn’t see how other threats are systemic. With his comments on Monday, Trump implied that the media is complicit in making terrorists successful. It’s part of a recent pattern of suggesting that others are standing in the way of his terrorism-fighting efforts, which includes disparaging a federal judge who halted his immigration executive order. Conway’s comments about Bowling Green earned her an enormous amount of public mockery — an undue amount, given the likelihood that her comments were a mistake rather than an intentional lie. Trump’s comments are of an entirely different order and magnitude. Trump’s relationship with the media has never been strong during his time in politics. But he’s never before tried to push the media into the “against us” circle alongside those who commit acts of terrorism — at least, not so explicitly. We don’t anticipate that, like Conway, he’ll admit to having misspoken. Update: In a press availability on Air Force One, Spicer tried to soften Trump’s comment. Terror attacks had been “under reported,” not “unreported.” He continued, according to the pool report: Spicer said the White House would at some point release examples of this “under reporting.” Update: The list is out, according to CNN.

605028744,2017-02-07 07:00:00,Trump’s loose talk about Muslims gets weaponized in court against travel ban,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/02/07/words-matter-trumps-loose-talk-about-muslims-gets-weaponized-in-court-against-travel-ban/?hpid=hp_rhp-banner-low_mm-trumpban-1125a:homepage/story&utm_term=.1a1e03d2afa7,en,False,,2,Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,"This article is more than 1 year old Throughout Donald Trump’s campaign and now into the first weeks of his presidency, critics suggested that he cool his incendiary rhetoric, that his words matter. His defenders responded that, as Corey Lewandowski said, he was being taken too “literally.” Some, like Vice President Pence, wrote it all off to his “colorful style.” Trump himself recently explained that his rhetoric about Muslims is popular, winning him “standing ovations.” No one apparently gave him anything like a Miranda warning: Anything he says can and will be used against him in a court of law. And that’s exactly what’s happening now in the epic court battle over his travel ban, currently blocked by a temporary order set for argument Tuesday before a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. The states of Washington and Minnesota, which sued to block Trump’s order, are citing the president’s inflammatory rhetoric as evidence that the government’s claims — that it’s not a ban and not aimed at Muslims — are shams. In court papers, Washington and Minnesota’s attorneys general have pulled out quotes from speeches, news conferences and interviews as evidence that an executive order the administration argues is neutral was really motivated by animus toward Muslims and a “desire to harm a particular group.” His words, the two states say in their brief, show “that the President acted in bad faith in an effort to target Muslims.” The courts, they say, “have both the right and duty to examine” Trump’s “true motives.” The states offer a multitude of exhibits, starting with a December 2015 release from the Trump campaign calling for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on.” They cite his August speech advocating screening out people “who believe that Sharia law should supplant American law.” Trump lashes out at ‘so-called judge’ who temporarily blocked travel ban Another exhibit: His Jan. 27 interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network in which he said he wanted to give priority to Christians in Syria. They even hauled out Rudolph W. Giuliani’s comment on Fox News that Trump wanted a “Muslim ban” and requested he assemble a commission to show him “the right way to do it legally.” In response, government lawyers are trying to have Trump’s rhetoric treated, so-to-speak, as inadmissible and irrelevant. It is inappropriate and contrary to precedent, they say in their brief, for the court to “‘look behind’ the stated basis for the Order to probe its subjective motivations.” The states, they complain, are asking “the courts to take the extraordinary step of second-guessing a formal national security judgment made by the President himself pursuant to broad grants of statutory authority.” How the appeals court and ultimately, no doubt, the Supreme Court, respond remains to be seen. Both sides have their precedents to cite on probing presidential motive. And there are numerous other issues in the case, including the government’s argument that the states do not have standing to sue. If the appeals court and the Supreme Court agree, this particular case could come to an abrupt halt without a decision on whether Trump’s order violates anyone’s rights under the Constitution. However it comes out, it may or may not sink in with Trump that his words can be used to wreak havoc with his policy agenda. His remarks could hurt the government’s key argument as it seeks to reinstate the order — that there was a “rational basis” for issuing it — said Jayashri Srikantiah, an immigration law professor at Stanford Law School. “When there is a record of evidence, as there is here, of the president making discriminatory comments about Muslims, the question is, does that animate the executive order?” Srikantiah told The Washington Post. “If it does, it raises some serious concerns, and it reflects an intentional discrimination.” “It’s pretty unusual for a president to make those kinds of statements so candidly or publicly,” she continued. “In some ways, this is new territory.” Trump’s call for a Muslim ban came just days after the deadly terrorist attack in San Bernardino in 2015, in which a Muslim couple shot and killed 14 people and injured 22 others at a holiday party. In December, during an appearance on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” Trump suggested that the proposed ban was “no different” than President Franklin Roosevelt’s internment of hundreds of thousands of Japanese Americans during World War II. Trump again called for a “ban” after the Pulse nightclub shooting in June, the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. He framed the attack as an immigration issue, even though the shooter was a U.S. citizen born in New York to Afghan parents. The ban, Trump said in a speech in New Hampshire, would be lifted “when we as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screen” people entering the country. “We are importing radical Islamic terrorism into the West through a failed immigration system,” he said. “If we want to remain a free and open society, then we have to control our borders.” The plan seemed to shift later in the summer, when Trump said he intended to suspend immigration from “any nation that has been compromised by terrorism.” When asked in an appearance on “Meet the Press” in July if the change marked a “pull-back on his Muslim ban,” Trump responded that it didn’t, saying it could be viewed instead as an “expansion.” What happens next with Trump’s travel ban? In a foreign policy speech the following month, Trump proposed an ideological test for new immigrants, saying government should screen out any travelers “who believe that sharia law should supplant American law.” He seemed to temper his remarks as the election drew closer, calling for “extreme vetting” of people entering the country as opposed to an outright ban. But late last month, in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, Trump said he wanted to give priority to Christian refugees over Muslims fleeing conflict in the Middle East. All this and more have been submitted as exhibits in the case to illustrate that the travel restrictions aren’t what the administration claims in court: A lawful “exercise of the President’s authority over the entry of aliens into the United States and the admission of refugees” that is neutral on nationality or religion, based not on any hostility toward Muslims but on a congressional determination of countries that are hotbeds of terrorism. It is unknown what advice President Barack Obama gave to President Trump in the traditional letter left in the Oval Office on Inauguration Day. But he could have given Trump a lesson in how words come back to haunt presidents, as that’s exactly what happened to Obama in his own immigration case when it reached the courts. When Texas and 25 other states successfully sued to temporarily block Obama’s attempt to shield millions of illegal immigrants from deportation in 2015, among their chief arguments was that the president’s executive actions were an overreach, an end-run around the Republican-controlled Congress that had refused to go along with his proposals. Among their best pieces of evidence were some of Obama’s own words, uttered at a moment of frustration when he was getting heckled for his deportation policy: “… I just took an action to change the law,” he responded. Both the U.S. District Court in Texas and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit used those and other words against him when they ruled against Obama. When the Supreme Court deadlocked in the case, the lower court decisions stood. It was, as The Post’s Robert Barnes reported in June 2016, “the biggest legal defeat of his administration.” Read more: ‘If something happens’: Trump points his finger in case of a terrorist attack ‘We’ll do better’: Trump’s White House tries to gain a sense of order amid missteps ‘We are all Americans,’ says Corona ad, meaning not just folks in those 50 states The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

The list, which includes domestic and overseas incidents, starts in September 2014. It includes some very heavily covered news events, including last year’s attack at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando and the mass shooting and attempted bombing in San Bernardino, Calif., in 2015. But the White House asserted that most of incidents on the list were under-covered by Western media sources. ‘If something happens’: Trump points his finger in case of a terrorist attack During an appearance at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Trump sought to make the case for the need to be vigilant at a time when legal action looms over his now-frozen ban on travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Trump cited attacks in the United States and in Europe as he spoke of the dangers of “radical Islamic terrorists.” “In many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report it,” Trump said. “They have their reasons, and you understand that.” White House spokesman Sean Spicer later told reporters that Trump believes attacks are not “unreported” but “underreported.” “He felt members of the media don’t always cover some of those events to the extent that other events might get covered,” Spicer told reporters traveling on Air Force One. Later Monday, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said that “the real point here is that these terrorists attacks are so pervasive at this point that they do not spark the wall-to-wall coverage they once did.” “If you look back just a few years ago, any one of these attacks would have been ubiquitous in every news outlet, and now they’re happening so often — at a rate of more than once every two weeks, according to the list we sent around — that networks are not devoting to each of them the same level of coverage they once did,” she said.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy","This article is more than 1 year old The White House on Monday night released a list of 78 terrorist attacks in response to an assertion earlier in the day by President Trump that the “very dishonest press” often doesn’t report on them. The list, which includes domestic and overseas incidents, starts in September 2014. It includes some very heavily covered news events, including last year’s attack at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando and the mass shooting and attempted bombing in San Bernardino, Calif., in 2015. But the White House asserted that most of incidents on the list were under-covered by Western media sources. ‘If something happens’: Trump points his finger in case of a terrorist attack During an appearance at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Trump sought to make the case for the need to be vigilant at a time when legal action looms over his now-frozen ban on travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Trump cited attacks in the United States and in Europe as he spoke of the dangers of “radical Islamic terrorists.” “In many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report it,” Trump said. “They have their reasons, and you understand that.” White House spokesman Sean Spicer later told reporters that Trump believes attacks are not “unreported” but “underreported.” “He felt members of the media don’t always cover some of those events to the extent that other events might get covered,” Spicer told reporters traveling on Air Force One. Later Monday, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said that “the real point here is that these terrorists attacks are so pervasive at this point that they do not spark the wall-to-wall coverage they once did.” “If you look back just a few years ago, any one of these attacks would have been ubiquitous in every news outlet, and now they’re happening so often — at a rate of more than once every two weeks, according to the list we sent around — that networks are not devoting to each of them the same level of coverage they once did,” she said.

608950478,2017-02-13 03:48:00,John Oliver Reveals How Trump Creates His Own Reality,http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/02/13/john-oliver-reveals-how-trump-creates-his-own-reality.html,en,False,,1707,Daily Beast,http://www.thedailybeast.com/,"SEARCH The ‘Last Week Tonight’ host returned after a two-month hiatus to rail against President Trump’s reliance on the alt-right site Breitbart and the conspiracy-theory outlet Infowars. Senior Entertainment Editor Donald Trump, the 45th president of these United States, has a tenuous relationship with the truth. Politifact, the Pulitzer Prize-winning fact-checking site, calculated that Trump tells the truth approximately 4 percent of the time, while 17 percent of his statements constitute egregious lies. Critics of Trump have labeled his modus operandi “gaslighting”—a form of psychological warfare wherein you manipulate a person into questioning their own sanity. The term comes from the 1944 film Gaslight, starring screen siren Ingrid Bergman as a wife whose husband (Charles Boyer) convinces her that she’s lost her faculties in order to obscure his true motive: Stealing the jewels of her late aunt, whom he murdered years earlier. In Trump’s case, he has a troubling tendency to launch attacks at targets that are actually veiled criticisms of himself. It’s a genius strategy, really: a preemptive strike that not only removes the card from his opponent’s deck, but also accuses them of the very thing that he is guilty of. A few examples: After a photo emerged of Hillary Clinton being escorted up some steps, Trump spent weeks on the campaign trail taking shots at the Democrat’s perceived health woes, even though he himself is said to suffer from bathmophobia, or a crippling fear of steps and slopes. His childish nicknames for his political foes—“Little” Marco Rubio, “Lyin’” Ted Cruz,’ “Crooked” Hillary”—are words that have been used to describe Trump for decades, while his narrative of a corrupt Clinton Foundation more closely resembled his own. Even his continued assault on CNN, which President Trump has labeled “fake news,” appears remarkably disingenuous when you consider that CNN chief Jeff Zucker and Trump are longtime friends (Zucker hired him for The Apprentice, and he reportedly keeps a framed Trump tweet in his office), and the cable news network played a substantial role in helping Trump get elected POTUS—from round-the-clock coverage of his rallies, at times airing just an empty podium, to its army of pro-Trump campaign propagandists, including: Kellyanne Conway, Scottie Nell Hughes, Kayleigh McEnany, Jeffrey Lord, and Corey Lewandowski, who remained on Trump’s payroll for the lion’s share of his CNN tenure. Furthermore, nobody is more reliant on “fake news” than President Trump. On Sunday, John Oliver returned to his perch as the shouty host of HBO’s Last Week Tonight following a two-month hiatus, where he focused much of his attention on four questions pertaining to President Trump: “How did we get a pathological liar in the White House? Where are his lies coming from? Why do so many people believe him? And what can we possibly do about it?” Trump is, of course, widely known to regurgitate talking points that he hears on the right-wing morning-show programs, from Morning Joe to Fox & Friends. For instance, two weeks ago he tweeted: “Ungrateful TRAITOR Chelsea Manning, who should never have been released from prison, is now calling President Obama a weak leader. Terrible!” Manning, however, never called Obama a “weak leader,” and Trump’s tweet was sent a mere 15 minutes after Fox News aired a critical segment on Manning, calling her an “ungrateful traitor.” More troubling, though, is the president’s dependence on Breitbart, which former honcho Steve Bannon once called “a platform for the alt-right,” and former Breitbart writer Ben Shapiro labeled “Trump’s personal Pravda,” as well as Infowars, a site run by the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. “He also takes information in from frighteningly unreliable sources such as Breitbart, the organization which gave us Steve Bannon—now Trump’s chief strategist,” said Oliver. “Bretibart has published such Pulitzer-eligible stories as ‘Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy,’ ‘Racist, Pro-Nazi Roots of Planned Parenthood Revealed,’ and ‘Hoist It High and Proud: The Confederate Flag Proclaims a Glorious Heritage.’ You know, the kind of headlines you see your old high-school friends share on Facebook and think, Oh, that’s a shame! I guess Greg sucks now.”“But Trump’s trust in Breitbart actually goes way back,” the satirist continued. “A few years ago, Trump was challenged by Bill O’Reilly, who correctly pointed out that [Trump’s] claim that ‘thousands of Muslims’ were seen celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11 was based on no evidence whatsoever.” Trump, as is his wont, responded to Fox News’s O’Reilly by holding up a printout of a terribly misleading and unsubstantiated Breitbart story that appeared to validate his claims, saying, “Well, I don’t know that I’m wrong, Bill. This just came out from Breitbart—I mean, literally, it just came out: ‘Trump 100% Vindicated.’” This prompted O’Reilly to fire back, “Believe me: If there were thousands, that would have been reported.” “This article says they were swarming all over the place!” exclaimed Trump, waving the piece of paper around. “So, I don’t know what that means, but it means a lot of people!” Oliver was incredulous. “Wait: Holding up a Breitbart article does not make you seem more credible,” he said, before picking up a banana, holding it to his ear, and joking that the “sources” on the other end of the imaginary banana phone line were about as credible as a Breitbart story. Then there’s Infowars, which also attempted to back up Trump’s bogus claim that “thousands of Muslims” were celebrating in New Jersey on after the 9/11 attacks—while providing zero supporting evidence. Infowars’ unhinged host, Alex Jones, has claimed that 9/11 and the Oklahoma City bombing were inside jobs, the Boston Marathon bombing was a “false flag” operation, and that the U.S. government has the ability to control the weather, and are poisoning the water to “turn the friggin’ frogs gay.” One of Jones’s most disgustingly offensive claims is that the Newtown mass shooting, which left 20 young children and six adults dead at the Sandy Hook Elementary School, was “a synthetic, completely fake” and “manufactured” massacre “with actors.” Jones has not only boasted about advising Trump, but even confessed, “It is surreal to talk about issues here on air and then word for word hear Trump say it two days later.” For example, back in September, Jones claimed to have been the guiding force behind candidate Trump’s baseless claims that the election would be “rigged” against him. Trump also appeared on Infowars during the campaign, telling Jones, “Your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down, and you’ll be very, very impressed—I hope.” Mark Barden, a Sandy Hook father who lost his 7-year-old son, Daniel, in the shooting, told me some months back that he was sickened by Trump’s affiliation with Jones. “The Republican presidential nominee of the United States is being advised by a delusional sociopath. It speaks for itself,” Barden said, adding, “What else can you say about that? It’s disgusting.” Oliver pointed out how problematic this call-and-repeat with dubious news sites is: “This is really dangerous, though, because there is a pattern here: Trump sees something that jibes with his worldview, doesn’t check it, half-remembers it, and then passes it on, at which point it takes on a life of its own and appears to validate itself.” Jones’s constant claim of election “rigging” prior to the general later mutated into unsubstantiated allegations that “millions” of people voted illegally against Trump in the election, causing him to lose the popular vote to Hillary Clinton—a claim voiced by Trump, and parroted by Trump’s senior policy adviser Stephen Miller on Sunday’ news talk shows. “Trump’s constant claim that ‘millions of people voted illegally’ originated, as far as anyone can tell, from some dude on Twitter who claimed in November—while providing no evidence: ‘We have verified more than three million votes cast by non-citizens,’” said Oliver. “The next day, Infowars picked that up and it spread like jet fuel among right-wing sites. Now, it was quickly debunked by multiple outlets, but despite that, days later, President-elect Trump started tweeting about ‘millions’ of illegal votes, and ‘serious voter fraud’ in places like California. And by early December, people were on TV expressing similar concerns.” The comedian threw to a CNN clip of correspondent Alisyn Camerota interviewing a panel of Trump supporters. “Voting is a privilege in this country, and you need to be legal, not illegal like in California where three million illegals voted,” said Paula Johnson, a Trump supporter. “Where are you getting your information?” asked Camerota. “From the media!” Johnson replied. Cue Oliver, who broke it down as follows: “If you get your news from similar sources to [Trump], as many, many people do, he doesn’t look like a crank—he looks like the first president to ever tell you the ‘real’ truth. But rumors can be really tenacious, and I’ll prove it,” he said. “What rumor do you think of when you hear the name Richard Gere?” asked Oliver, referring to the infamous (fake) rumor that Gere had to have a gerbil removed from his rectum. “Well, here’s the thing: There is no proof that he did that. If you think about it, it’s ridiculous. Have you ever held one of those things? There’s no way it was possible,” he continued. “But, if the president went on TV and told you it was true, you’d go, ‘I knew it! Thank you! I knew it! Finally someone said it!’ But that loop gets much more dangerous when you’re not talking about something as silly as gerbils. Trump validated his supporters’ beliefs about voter fraud, and in turn, they validated his.” He closed the segment with a call to action: “We all need to commit to defending the reality of facts, but it’s going to take work.” That includes making sure stories are properly sourced, questioning stories that merely validate your own worldview, not taking the White House at its word, and, last but not least, avoiding sketchy sites like Breitbart and Infowars."

About 400 people attended a vigil Monday in Kalamazoo, Mich., to remember and honor the victims of the Kalamazoo mass shooting Feb. 20, 2016. “What began as a dark evening,” Pastor Paul Fazio, of North Park Reformed Church, told the audience gathered at Wings Event Center, “over the last year the darkness has begun to break because of the light of the victims. They may be gone but their hearts beat.” The 90-minute program included words from family members of some of the victims as well as community and law enforcement officials. The ForeverStrong Memorial Foundation also announced plans to construct a complex to honor the victims and include soccer fields, playgrounds and a memorial for each of the victims. A portion of the memorial also will be in Battle Creek, Mich. The project may take years to complete. ► Related: Kalamazoo shooting survivor Abbie Kopf to undergo more surgery Six people were killed: Barbara  Hawthorne, 68, Mary Jo Nye, 60, Judy Brown, 74, Mary Lou Nye, 60, Richard Smith, 53, and his son, Tyler, 17.

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: WASHINGTON — A White House list of what it calls underreported terrorist attacks did not support President Donald Trump’s claim that the media are downplaying a “genocide” carried out by the Islamic State group. But it did shine new light on the difficulty in defining the scope, source and motives behind the violence carried out in the name of radical Islam. A close review of the 78 attacks listed by the White House shows almost all the attacks were reported by the news media and that many were widely covered by local and international outlets. The review, carried out by Associated Press reporters on four continents, found that more than half of the attacks, including most of those in the Middle East, were linked to the Islamic State group, as the White House suggested. Others were ruled IS-inspired, but carried out by lone wolf attackers. But in some cases, the motive was unclear, and investigations as to possible extremist links were inconclusive. The examples range from knife-wielding assailants in Texas to hostage-takers in Australia to the gunmen who killed at least 129 people across Paris in 2015. The magnitude of the attacks on the document circulated by the White House — which appeared to be hastily compiled and included several typos — ranges from several dozen dead to one or two people injured. It has some notable omissions. It did not include any attacks by Boko Haram, an Islamist insurgent group operating in West Africa that is responsible for far more deaths than the Islamic State. The group, which has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, has led an uprising that has killed more than 20,000 people and left 2.6 million homeless this decade in Nigeria and neighboring countries. It also pays little heed to the scores of terror acts that have plagued nations like Syria and Iraq that are close to the Islamic State’s caliphate and under near-daily siege. The list itself was created to bolster the case for Trump’s executive order restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries and suspending the U.S. refugee program. But that ban would not have prevented any of the terrorist attacks on the list that occurred in the United States. Here’s a closer look at some of the attacks on the list: The inclusion of some of the attacks in the United States defies credulity. Among those on the White House’s list are a deadly rampage in San Bernardino, California, in 2015 in which 14 people were killed and 21 injured, and the June 2016 nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, which left 49 dead, the biggest mass shooting in the nation’s history. Both of those attacks received blanket news coverage for days, and all of the attacks in the U.S. received at least some attention by the American media.Related Articles

			Biden won’t invoke executive privilege on Trump Jan. 6 docs A 2015 attack in Garland, Texas, took place outside a venue hosting a provocative contest for Prophet Muhammad cartoons. According to trial testimony, the suspect, Elton Simpson, was an American Muslim who became the subject of a criminal investigation in 2006 because of his association “with an individual whom the FBI believed was attempting to set up a terrorist cell in Arizona.” He was never found to have links to the Islamic State group or any other established radical groups. Non-fatal knife attacks on police officers in Boston and New York, a knife attack at a Minnesota mall and the shooting of a police officer in Philadelphia were also reported. “The notion that terrorism is an under-covered subject is preposterous,” said David H. Schanzer, director of Duke University’s Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security. “It’s highly over-covered compared to the amount of violence that we face in society.” Citing a study his department recently published, Schanzer said, “one out of every 2,000 homicides since 9/11 have been linked to al-Qaida or ISIS-inspiration or control.” Two October 2014 attacks in Canada — one in Quebec and one in Ottawa — received media coverage in Canada, where attacks of this nature are rare. In Quebec, soldier Patrice Vincent was killed in an apparent act of homegrown terrorism. The suspect was known to police and had his passport seized to stop him from traveling to Syria. It was never determined whether the suspect had any ties to Islamic militant groups, though former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper described the suspect as an “ISIL-inspired terrorist,” referring to the Islamic State group by an acronym. In the Canadian capital, one soldier was killed at a war memorial and two were wounded in shootings at the Parliament building. Meanwhile, in Quebec last week, a gunman who reportedly held anti-immigrant views killed six men at a local mosque in an incident described by Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as a “terrorist attack.” Trump has yet to personally comment on the attacks, although the White House did offer assistance to Trudeau. That attack wasn’t listed. Across Europe, attacks are increasingly being attributed to the flow of refugees across the continent — and it’s hard to find a single attack, large or small, that didn’t generate global coverage. Trump himself used a non-fatal knife attack outside the Louvre in Paris last week to underscore his efforts to ban migrants from entering the U.S., writing on Twitter, “A new radical Islamic terrorist has just attacked in Louvre Museum in Paris. Tourists were locked down. France on edge again. GET SMART U.S.” All of the attacks cited on the list in Europe were widely reported both by international and local media — some in real time. A 2015 attack at a Paris supermarket was covered live as it was happening. When the attacker, Amedy Coulibaly, pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group, it was urgently reported by The Associated Press and others. Links between the attackers and terror groups were also reported, although at times that did not happen until they were unearthed by investigators days later. In London, a 2015 knife attack by a man shouting “this is for Syria” at an underground rail station made headlines in newspapers around the world. Police said they treated it as a terrorist incident, although a link was never drawn between the attacker and any particular group. A 2014 attack on a police station by a Muslim convert in Joue-les-Tours, France, was reported by The Associated Press at the time and followed up with his brother’s arrest in Burundi. AP did not report on any links to the Islamic State group, although British media later said he posted a black Islamic State flag on his Facebook page. The Muslim world is the front line in the battle against the Islamic State group, and civilians across the region have not been spared the group’s deadly campaign. A number of attacks cited on the White House list occurred in Egypt. A 2015 attack on a camp used by a multinational peacekeeping force was reported by several news outlets, as was the Islamic State group claim. Other attacks occurred in Cairo in 2015, including one that resulted in the kidnapping and beheading of a Croatian national, and a car bomb at the Italian Consulate that left one dead. Both were claimed by the Islamic State group and reported worldwide. Additional attacks in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Tunisia and Turkey were also reported by various news outlets, citing officials who linked the attacks to the Islamic State group — a common claim by governments across the Middle East, even when dealing with lone wolf attackers. The White House list did not include any attacks in Iraq, Syria or Yemen, where civilians are targeted almost daily by militant attacks. Many of those attacks are covered by the media, despite the often-perilous conditions involved in reporting those stories. Included on Trump’s list is a standoff at a Sydney chocolatier in 2014. The incident drew round-the-clock coverage by the world’s news outlets. A request by attacker Man Haron Monis for an Islamic State group flag during the faceoff fueled anxiety about the group’s expanding influence across the globe. Monis himself was never determined to have had contact with the group. An incident shortly before that in Melbourne also made headlines when Numan Haider was shot dead by police in connection with the stabbing of two police officers. Photographs on Haider’s Facebook site included images of what appeared to be members of the Islamic State group. Lemire reported from New York.

Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives. Apple isn't an activist, but is actively opposed to the immigration order. Donald Trump has, in the past, called for a boycott on Apple products. This was after Cupertino had refused an FBI request to hack a phone issued to one of the terrorists involved in the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. I wonder, though, whether the president might have itchy Twitter fingers after Apple's CEO made a strong statement on Wednesday against Trump's order temporarily banning immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. Speaking at Scotland's University of Glasgow -- where he was receiving an honorary degree -- Cook made his opposition to the order clear. As reported by the university's own Twitter feed, he said: ""If we stand and say nothing we become a part of it, our company thrives on diversity."" Cook appears to believe that this is a moral, as well as a political issue, just as he does with respect to privacy. He insisted, though, that Apple isn't a political company. ""I don't believe Apple is an activist and I don't view myself as an activist,"" he said, answering a question from the audience. ""A lot of people hear that word and think about sort of a professional activist."" He suggested that Apple carefully picks the issues it addresses loudly. ""For things that we have some deep knowledge of -- or think we do -- or a strong point of view based on things we want, that gives us some standing, we're not shy,"" he said. The dry will suggest that at least part of why Apple is objecting to the order is because the company wants to continue being able to hire foreign nationals on H1-B visas. This allows the company to hire more cheaply than in the US and potentially keep the employee for longer. Apple is one of more than 90 tech companies that have signed a letter speaking out against the so-called ban. Cook also wrote a memo to employees laying out the company's opposition. Apple is also one of the most admired brands in the world. When its CEO comes forward to address the order so forcefully, it makes a strong impression. Of course, there's now the not-so-small matter of doing something about it. I suspect it will take a lot more than a letter and compelling statements.

Noor Salman, 31, is accused of aiding in the attack and misleading police and FBI special agents after the carnage. Salman could face life in prison if convicted of the charges. No trial date has been set. Orlando Police Chief John Mina said he was disappointed in the ruling by Judge Donna Ryu. ""Nothing can erase the pain we all feel about the senseless and brutal murders of 49 of our neighbors, friends, family members and loved ones,"" Mina said in a statement. ""But I have full faith that she will ultimately be brought to justice.""  Prosecutors argued against releasing Salman, calling her a danger to the public. She will stay behind bars for two days so the government can appeal. Salman's husband, Omar Mateen, called a local TV station and 911 to ""pledge allegiance"" to the Islamic State during the siege at Pulse nightclub June 12. He died in a confrontation with police. FBI arrests wife of Orlando nightclub shooter Omar Mateen Salman, who married Mateen in 2011, grew up about 25 miles northeast of San Francisco. She must wear an ankle monitor and live with an uncle in Northern California. Salman was arrested last month at her Northern California home on charges of aiding and abetting. She is also charged with obstruction of justice for her dealings with authorities after the attack. Her lawyers have claimed Salman had no prior knowledge of the rampage. Salman, in interviews with federal investigators after the shooting, allegedly acknowledged driving Mateen to the Pulse nightclub at least once before her husband launched the assault. But she told The New York Times in November she was unaware of his intentions until he sent her a 4 a.m. text message the night of the shooting, asking whether she had seen what happened on the news. The last message from her husband was a text saying, “I love you babe.”"

          / CBS/AP ORLANDO -- The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)  has claimed responsibility for the attack early Sunday morning at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida that left at least 50 dead and 53 injured. The group's official radio station, al-Bayan, said Monday morning that, ""Over 100 Crusaders killed and injured after an attack on their gathering at a night club in America."" ""We begin from America, where Allah has enabled brother Omar Mateen, one of the soldiers of the Caliphate in America, to carry out a raid where he was able to infiltrate a Crusaders' gathering at a gay night club in Orlando, Florida. Allah enabled him to inflict heavy casualties amongst the filthy Crusaders. He killed and injured over a hundred of them. This is the biggest raid to be carried in America after the raid of Manhattan 16 years ago. All praise to Allah."" ISIS has in the past claimed responsibility for attacks that did not originate within their command structure or territory, and analysts say this latest claim still does not prove ISIS was directly involved in the shooting. The gunman behind the mass shooting has been identified as Port St. Lucie resident Omar Mateen, CBS News confirms. Officials are still investigating the exact motives for the shooting, and both ties to radical Islam as well as a general hate crime motivation are being considered. A U.S. intel source tells CBS News that Mateen called 911 during the shooting from the bathroom. They called him back and that is when Mateen pledged alliance to ISIS and al Baghdadi. The source tells CBS News that Mateen made two foreign trips, one in 2011 to Dubai and one to Saudi Arabia in 2012. He was not on a current watch list. He was on the Terrorist Screening database when the FBI was questioning him. The source tells CBS News he was removed when the FBI closed their investigation. The 2013 investigation began when Mateen told co-workers and others he knew the Tsarnaev brothers who were responsible for the Boston marathon bombings. The FBI confirmed at a press conference Sunday afternoon that federal authorities twice looked into Mateen in the past. In 2014, Mateen was questioned because of what FBI Special Agent Ron Hopper called a possible connection to a suicide bomber Hopper said agents contacted Mateen three times, but ultimately determined there was no reason to pursue an investigation. ""Those interviews turned out to be inconclusive so there was nothing to keep the investigation going,"" Hopper said. Mateen's ex-wife told The Washington Post that she met him online about eight years ago and decided to move to Florida and marry him. The ex-wife, who wasn't named in the report, says at first the marriage was normal, but then he became abusive. They were together for only a few months and her parents intervened when they learned Mateen had assaulted her. She says he wasn't very religious and gave no signs of radical Islam. She said he owned a small-caliber handgun and worked as a guard at a nearby facility for juvenile delinquents. Mateen's ex-wife said his family was from Afghanistan, but her ex-husband was born in New York. His family later moved to Florida.

578192646,2017-02-08 09:46:27,Fact check: Trump’s bogus terrorist claim,http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/268670986/0/usatodaycomwashington-topstories~Fact-check-Trump%e2%80%99s-bogus-terrorist-claim/,en,False,,4,USA Today,http://www.usatoday.com,"At a military base in Florida, President Trump complained that “radical Islamic” terrorist attacks are “not even being reported” by the “very, very dishonest press.” That’s nonsense. White House press secretary Sean Spicer later revised Trump’s criticism of the media by claiming the president was talking about terrorist attacks that have gone “underreported,” not unreported. But that’s not what the president said. Trump and Spicer were both proven wrong when the White House produced a list of “underreported” terrorist attacks that contained numerous widely covered terrorist attacks over the last two years, including the Orlando, Fla., mass shooting that left 49 people dead and the San Bernardino, Calif., attack that killed 14. The White House list also included the Nov. 13, 2015, attack in Paris that killed more than 130 people; the Bastille Day attack last year in Nice, France, that killed 84 people; and the bombing attacks at an airport and on a subway train in Brussels on March 22, 2016, that killed at least 31 people. All were, obviously, widely covered. Trump made his remarks at MacDill Air Force Base. Trump, Feb. 6: ""Radical Islamic terrorists are determined to strike our homeland as they did on 9/11; as they did from Boston to Orlando, to San Bernardino. And all across Europe, you’ve seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe it’s happening. It’s gotten to a point where it’s not even being reported and, in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report it. They have their reasons and you understand that."" Trump, Feb. 6: ""Radical Islamic terrorists are determined to strike our homeland as they did on 9/11; as they did from Boston to Orlando, to San Bernardino. And all across Europe, you’ve seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe it’s happening. It’s gotten to a point where it’s not even being reported and, in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report it. They have their reasons and you understand that."" What terrorist attacks are “not even being reported”? When asked, Spicer backtracked and said that Trump was complaining about “underreported attacks.” Spicer, Feb. 6: ""Look, I think the president’s comments were very clear at the time. He felt as though members of the media don’t always cover some of those events to the extent that other events might get covered; that a protest will get blown out of the water, and yet an attack or a foiled attack doesn’t necessarily get the same coverage."" Spicer, Feb. 6: ""Look, I think the president’s comments were very clear at the time. He felt as though members of the media don’t always cover some of those events to the extent that other events might get covered; that a protest will get blown out of the water, and yet an attack or a foiled attack doesn’t necessarily get the same coverage."" The White House then provided a list of 78 attacks that were carried out by terrorists or suspected terrorists from September 2014 to December 2016. We searched Nexis, a news database, for coverage of all 78 incidents and found tens of thousands of news articles, TV news transcripts and news wire accounts of the attacks and subsequent stories related to these attacks. Several of the suspected terrorist attacks described as “not … reported” (Trump) or “underreported” (Spicer) received so much global press coverage that Nexis could not return all search results — instead it provided just a warning that the search would yield more than 3,000 results. In addition to the five high-profile attacks we mentioned earlier — in Orlando, San Bernardino, France and Belgium — the White House list included these other incidents that yield more than 3,000 results in our Nexis search for “all English language news”: • Michael Zehaf-Bibeau shot and killed a Canadian soldier in Ottawa in October 2014. The name “Michael Zehaf-Bibeau” was mentioned in more than 500 U.S. news and wire stories, including in front page articles in the Los Angeles Times and The New York Times. • Amedy Coulibaly killed one police officer and four hostages in a shooting at a kosher supermarket in Paris. The name “Amedy Coulibaly” appeared in at least 1,400 U.S. news and wire reports, including in at least 150 front-page stories. The New York Times alone wrote 22 front-page stories on the attack. • Man Haron Monis killed two hostages in December 2014 after taking over a downtown cafe in Sydney, Australia, for more than 16 hours. Man Haron Monis, who was killed when law enforcement officers stormed the cafe, was mentioned in nearly 500 U.S. news and wire reports. The incident was on the front page of five U.S. newspapers, and carried on all the major TV networks and cable stations. All of those attacks can be found on CNN’s website, which lists 143 terrorist attacks through July 25, 2016. Extensive media coverage was not limited to attacks that resulted in the loss of innocent lives. Our search turned up heavy coverage for attacks listed by the White House that resulted in no one other than the attackers being killed: • Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi were killed after they opened fire on May 3, 2015, at an exhibit of cartoons lampooning the Prophet Muhammad in Garland, Texas. One security guard was wounded. Abdul Malik Abdul Kareem, a roommate of the gunmen, was convicted of conspiracy to support ISIL and other terrorist-related charges. We found more than 1,200 U.S. news and wire stories that mentioned Kareem and the attack, including 21 stories in The New York Times. • Usaama Rahim was shot and killed by a Boston police officer and FBI agent after Rahim approached them with a machete. A Nexis search of Rahim’s name in U.S. news and wire reports turned up 278 hits, including 12 stories in The Boston Globe and four in The New York Times. The Globe wrote four front-page stories on Rahim’s case. • Mohamed Barry was shot and killed by police a year ago in Columbus, Ohio, after he injured four people in a restaurant with a machete. We found more than 100 search results for “Mohamed Barry” and “Columbus,” including five front-page stories by the Columbus Dispatch. It was covered by CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox News. Simpson, Soofi and Rahim are listed in a federally funded report for the U.S. Department of Justice as “deceased American jihadists.” It is not clear, however, if the Ohio incident was a terrorist attack. The Columbus Dispatch reported that Barry “had been on a watch list for ‘espousing extremist views,’” but FBI agents “didn’t use the words ‘terrorism’ or ‘terrorist’” at the time to describe the attack. The White House list also includes at least two attacks that do not appear to be terrorist attacks at all: • Khaled Babouri was killed in August after injuring two female police officers in Brussels with a machete. Belgium Migration State Secretary Theo Francken said Babouri “was not known for terrorist reasons,” according to an Associated Press report. • Smail Ayad killed two people, Mia Ayliffe-Chung and Tom Jackson, at a hostel in Australia in August. The Brisbane Times reported that Ayad was “alleged to have yelled ‘Allahu Akbar’ during the attack but authorities found no evidence to suggest his motivations were terror-related and have considered whether he had an obsession with Ms Ayliffe-Chung.” Ayad “has been given a preliminary diagnosis of schizophrenia,” the paper said. Update, Feb. 8: Mia Ayliffe-Chung’s mother, Rosie Ayliffe, said the murders of her daughter and Jackson should not have appeared on the White House list of terrorist attacks. In an open letter to Trump on Facebook, Ayliffe wrote that “an Islamic terror attack was discounted in the early stages of the police investigation.” For sure, there are some suspected terrorist attacks that were not widely reported. But we found that those were generally in far-flung places that, for the most part, did not result in any deaths. The White House listed, for example, these nonfatal attacks that received little U.S. media coverage: a June 9, 2015, rocket attack targeting an airport in el Gorah, Egypt; a roadside bombing attack that injured four U.S. soldiers in el Gorah, Egypt; and the shooting of two U.S. defense contractors in Saudi Arabia in January 2015. (We note that nine of the 78 attacks listed by the White House were in Egypt, which has been struggling with “a long-running insurgency in the region that has grown since the 2011 popular uprising against longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak,” the former president of Egypt, according to U.S. News and World Report.) Trump’s criticism of the media and the reporting on terrorist attacks comes at a time when the Department of Justice is in federal court defending the president’s executive order — Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States. The order seeks to impose a 90-day travel ban on the citizens of seven predominately Muslim countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. It also would suspend the refugee program indefinitely for Syrians and for 120 days for all other refugees. A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order on Feb. 3 that for now blocks enforcement of portions of Trump’s order. We will leave it to the courts to decide the merits of Trump’s executive order. But we judge that his claim that terrorist attacks are “not even being reported” by the “very, very dishonest press” is unsupported by the facts.

Spicer was attempting to explain to reporters at the daily press briefing why Trump did not use his massive Twitter reach to address last month’s mass shooting at a Quebec mosque. Earlier this week, White House aide Kellyanne Conway had defended Trump’s silence by saying, “The president doesn’t tweet about everything.” But why, Sirius XM correspondent Jared Rizzi asked, was Trump so willing to use Twitter to launch an attack on Nordstrom ― over his daughter’s clothing line, no less ― when he didn’t use it to respond to the deadly Jan. 29 attack by a white supremacist? The press secretary, who was already on the defensive, became irate. “I stood at this podium and opened a briefing a couple days ago about the president expressing his condolences [for the mosque shooting],” Spicer said. “I opened the briefing about it. So for you to sit there and say ― why are you asking why [Trump] didn’t [tweet about it], when I stood here and did it? I don’t understand what you’re asking.” “I came out here and actually spoke about it,” Spicer repeated. “What are you ― you’re equating me addressing the nation here, with a tweet? That’s the silliest thing I’ve ever heard.” Indeed, Spicer said at a Jan. 30 briefing that Trump had spoken by phone with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and expressed his condolences. The testy exchange on Thursday underscored the difficulty Trump’s aides are having as they try to defend the president’s choice to use his enormous platform on Twitter, where he has some 25 million followers, to rail about trivial things while ignoring major events like the Quebec shooting.

The four women who were with the Battle Creek teen that night and were shot died. Abbie, 14, clung to life and has made a remarkable recovery. The communities of Kalamazoo and Battle Creek have been steadfast in their thoughts, prayers and donations of support every step of the way along her road to recovery. They follow her progress on the GoFundMe page set up to help raise money for her medical expenses, and on the Facebook page Abbie's parents use to keep a concerned public informed of their daughter's progress while protecting the family's privacy. ""Still praying for this little miracle"" Jermaine Jackson of Kalamazoo wrote on that page. Jackson organized a Gospel concert benefiting Tiana Carruthers, the other survivor of the mass shooting that killed six people.Women killed in Uber gunman's rampage still touch communities they loved ""We certainly want Abbie to know that she is loved and supported by the entire community at large,"" Jackson said Thursday. Judging by the outpouring of Facebook comments, cards and donations over the past year there's little doubt of that. Abbie is 15 now. Following the shooting she had to learn to walk and talk all over again. She has worn a helmet for months to protect her brain in the area where her skull was shattered by the gunman's bullet. She has undergone reconstructive surgeries. Her most recent surgery, replacement of a protective plate, was last week. She has spent this week fighting severe headaches. Throughout the arduous recovery, the support keeps on coming. Kalamazoo mass shooting victims to be remembered on 1-year anniversary Donations are still coming in to the GoFundMe site. Established in April, it now stands at $68,000. In January, when the family posted a mailing address to receive cards for Abbie, the outpouring was swift, and included cards for her younger sister. A Cooper Township woman has organized a fundraising sale and silent auction from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. next Saturday, Feb. 25, at Western Michigan University's Fetzer Center. Vendors include Lularoe, Paparazzi, Scentsy, Young Living, Home Pride cleaners, Pure Romance, Younique, Discovery Toys and Thirty-one. Oranizer Ashley Bilyk said a portion of the proceeds from 32 vendors, and 100 percent of proceeds from the auction, will go straight to the Kopf family. Bilyk said it was easy to get vendors and businesses to donate to the cause. ""We have all followed Abbie's story,"" she said. ""I love kids, and I have followed Abbie's story since Day 1,"" Bilyk said. ""I have to drive by (accused shooter) Jason Dalton's house every day, and it fills me with rage."" ""We certainly want Abbie to know that she is loved and supported by the entire community at large,"" Jackson said. ""I just spoke to Abbie's father a couple of weeks ago,"" when she was preparing for her most recent surgery, Jackson said. ""We will endeavor to keep her in our thoughts at challenging times like these.""

If not for the heroic efforts of a stranger on Feb. 20, 2016, she may have lost a child. ""She did the most selfless thing anybody could do,"" Coleman said of Carruthers. ""She was ready to lay down her life for babies she didn't even know, as well as her own. I feel like we are forever indebted to her."" Last weekend, Coleman and her daughter Joi gathered with Carruthers and several other children at Kalamazoo's Milham Park to pose for photos. Last Feb. 20, Joi, then 12, was one of six children walking with Carruthers outside at The Meadows Townhomes east of Kalamazoo around 6 o'clock in the evening. Testifying during a court hearing last May, Carruthers recalled a man driving erratically into the parking lot and asking if someone there was named ""Maisie."" He drove away briefly, then sped back toward Carruthers and the children. That's when she saw a gun pointed out of the driver's side window. 'I just told the kids to run,"" she testified. ""I didn't care what they heard or what they saw, to run and don't come back no matter what."" She yelled to other children who were nearby on a playground. ""I didn't even make it anywhere because I was busy telling the children to run,"" Carruthers testified. ""Honestly, I wasn't concerned about myself. I was concerned about the kids."" In the burst of gunfire that ensued, Carruthers was struck four times. None of the children were hit. Police have hailed Carruthers as a hero. ""I don't think a lot of people would be able to think that quickly, act that quickly, or have the courage,"" Coleman said. ""She didn't (just) protect her own child. She thought of everybody's child. She could have grabbed her baby and ran. She didn't."" Carruthers, 26, would be the first of eight people that authorities allege 46-year-old Uber driver Jason Dalton shot in the course of a little over four hours the night of Feb. 20. At around 10 p.m., authorities say Dalton, who had switched cars, ambushed Rich and Tyler Smith in the parking lot of a Seeyle KIA on Stadium Drive in Kalamazoo, shooting and killing the father and son from Mattawan. Less than 20 minutes later, he allegedly shot and killed four women and critically injured 14-year-old Abigail Kopf in the Cracker Barrel restaurant parking lot off I-94 southwest of the city. Dalton is charged with 16 felonies, including six counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder and eight firearm counts. Carruthers identified him at the May hearing as the man who opened fire on her. Healing physically and mentally Almost a year after the shooting, Carruthers said she is focused on herself and her daughter. She said her physical therapy is ""like a full-time job."" After numerous surgeries, metal rods run the length of both of femurs from her hips to her knees. Another rod keeps her left arm together. She can only raise it shoulder high. A bullet remains lodged in her liver. Still, she said physically, she has more good days than bad now. The mornings are the worst, when her body is stiff. ""It's gotten a lot better,"" she said. ""I went from the bed to a wheelchair to a walker to a cane, to now I'm not even walking with my cane. I still have a limp, but it's not like a major limp."" Carruthers said doctors have told her she has recovered quickly because she is young, but she likely will have complications as she ages. Healing mentally may be a longer process. Carruthers said she has started to see a therapist, something she had avoided. ""Some days I wake up, like is this really my life?"" she said this week. ""I was really, honestly, in denial. I thought I was fine, l thought I just really needed to work on my body, but after the tragedy I didn't really fully break all the way down. I feel like just now it's starting to hit me like I need to go see someone, talk to them."" On top of all that happened to her in 2016, her brother, Anthony Lamb, died Sept. 11 in a shooting near Holland. ""That was really hard,"" Carruthers said, her voice quieting as she cried. ""It's still hard. It's so hard. It's been a hard year."" Coleman said, though her daughter was not injured in the shooting, it has left psychological scars. Joi has been dealing with symptoms of post-traumatic stress, panic attacks and anger, she said. It was Coleman's townhouse that the children ran to during the shooting. The single mother of seven said that after the shooting, her children couldn't function there anymore, so they moved out and are still is seeking permanent housing. ""We're trying to find the next steps now,"" Coleman said. ""It's still difficult but I'm grateful. I'm grateful that my babies are OK and they're here and I'm here. I'm grateful that Tiana did what she did and she's here."" Coleman and Carruthers, though they lived in the same complex, had never met until last weekend, when they gathered at Milham Park with their children and others who were at The Meadows when the shooting broke out. It was the first time Carruthers had seen all six children together since the shooting: her daughter, Kaniya Whyte, 8, her niece, Edriana Nichols, 4, Dorjaye Marion, 9, Joi Coleman, 13, Teriahna Duckett, 11 and Salinah Duckett, 9. Coleman said after meeting Carruthers that it felt like seeing a friend. ""I don't know her very well, but I know her heart and I know she's an amazing person and has good intentions,"" Coleman said. ""She's going to be a lifelong friend. I feel like God put us together."" Carruthers, too, was glad the two could finally meet. It was Coleman who took care of Carruthers' daughter in the moments following the shooting. ""It was the best feeling in the world when I finally met her,"" Carruthers said. ""For a parent to be like, I'm forever in debt to you and I love you, and her daughter, too, the hug she gave me. It was the best feeling ever."" After meeting at the park, the six children all spent the night at Carruthers' house, watching movies and hanging out. She said seeing them all together and healthy was part of her therapy, her recovery. ""I didn't realize how much this has affected the children. I mean I knew, but when you actually sit down and talk to all six of the girls, and ask them how they felt, I was in tears. I couldn't even talk to them like I really wanted. They were saying thank you, telling me that I'm their hero."" She said through it all, she and her daughter are closer. ""I feel like our relationship has grown a lot. I guess when you're put in certain situations it makes you appreciate so much because you never know when your life is going to be gone,"" Carruthers said. She said she thinks she did what any mom would do in that parking lot on Feb. 20. Thinking of the families who lost their loved ones that night makes her hesitant to talk about herself. ""There's not a day when I don't think about the other families. I just don't know how I would go about talking to them because I would be in tears,"" Carruthers said. ""Then some days I know I just got to get up and move around. I really feel like I owe it to the other families too, like I can't mope around. So many people did lose their lives and I feel like I really have to represent for them, too."" In the future, Carruthers said, she hopes to volunteer or even become a motivational speaker. She credits the community with playing a big role in her recovery. ""I say the same thing all the time, like man I wouldn't have been able to do this without the community,"" she said. ""I don't think I would've gotten through that without the support of the community. All their random cards, random cards, hugs. Even though some hugs were painful,"" she said, laughing. She's preparing herself mentally for the possibility of facing Dalton in court again. At the preliminary examination in May, he interrupted during her testimony, causing her to break down on the witness stand. He was removed from the courtroom, and after a recess the hearing resumed with Dalton appearing via video from the Kalamazoo County Jail. ""That was really hard,"" Carruthers said. ""I don't think I can go in a courtroom. I'm trying to prepare myself mentally."" She wants the community to take the seemingly random shootings as a warning to be aware, for people to keep their eyes open. ""I'm always on alert. Call me paranoid, but once is enough for me,"" Carruthers said. ""I feel like this is my second chance in life to do something. I don't know what, but I know God is calling me and he wants me to do something, and I just really want to figure it out. I don't know what, but I know it's going to be big.""

Instead, she carried his ashes and her brother's in an urn alongside her bouquet. The urn, not her father, would occupy the empty seat beside her mom. They didn't get to dance to Heartland's ""I Loved Her First,"" a song that made her father's eyes well up with tears when they first heard it. She knew, even then as a child, that they would one day dance to it at her wedding. Instead of having her dad on her arm, she had a heart-shaped piece of his favorite blue shirt sewn into her dress. The wedding, while a celebration, was bittersweet for Lemmer. She struggled to make December's momentous occasion about her and new husband Kyle Lemmer, and not about the two other men she dearly loved who couldn't be there. ""As much as it was beautiful and as much as it was everybody's dream, for me it was kind of like a nightmare,"" she said. ""It's not because it wasn't nice or wasn't pretty. It was everything anyone could ever ask for. It was just not what I had envisioned as a kid."" Two of the people Lemmer wanted most to be there were among six killed Feb. 20, 2016 in a mass shooting. Rich and Tyler Smith were looking at a car in a dealership parking lot when a gunman ambushed and shot them, then drove away. Police say soon after that the Uber driver fatally shot four woman and critically injured 14-year-old Abigail Kopf in a restaurant parking lot off I-94. Hours earlier, he is accused of shooting Tiana Carruthers, who survived, at a townhome complex east of Kalamazoo. Jason Dalton faces six counts of murder, two counts of assault with intent to commit murder and eight felony firearm counts in the shootings. As the anniversary of that horrific day last February approaches, Lemmer and her mother, Laurie Smith, say they still feel like they're living in a fog, like Tyler and Rich could walk through the door at any minute. Lemmer said it feels like forever since she's seen them, but the pain feels like it just happened yesterday. ""When there's that one thing that they should be there for, it breaks your imagination, your imaginative take on the whole situation, and kind of brings you back to reality. Reality's not really something we want to realize,"" she said. ""In the days leading up to it, it just feels like deja vu almost, it feels like everything is happening. I feel like I'm just going to get that call over and over again."" Smith and Lemmer keep mementos of Rich and Tyler with them daily. They both have a pendant that holds their ashes. Smith wears hers on a chain around her neck, hanging close to her heart. She wears Rich's wedding ring around her neck as well. Lemmer wears a bracelet she got her brother for his birthday. The pendant holding his ashes and her father's hangs from her Jeep's rearview mirror, along with Tyler's Mattawan High School Class of 2016 graduation tassels and her father's Pfizer work ID badge. She said she feels closest to them in her Jeep, in which the family spent many summers traversing the Silver Lake Sand Dunes. Ashes of both Rich and Tyler were spread over Sunset Hill, a point in the dunes where Lake Michigan and Silver Lake are visible. ""Even though it's not him, it's a memory,"" Lemmer said of the mementos. ""You hold onto all the memories. Even though the memories hurt, you hold onto them because that's all you have left."" A PAINFUL ANNIVERSARY Smith said she's dreading the anniversary of the shootings, if only because it makes the loss of her husband and son more real. ""I don't want it to be past one year, because it's almost like I have to face reality,"" she said. ""It's been really hard losing a child and added onto that I don't have my soulmate, the person that would normally get through everything. I'm thankful that I still have Emily, but she has her life and I don't want to be the third wheel everywhere. We're very close and we do a lot together."" She tries not to think about the 25th wedding anniversary she and Rich, who was 53, would have celebrated this year. She was sure they would have one day celebrated 50 years together. ""It's really hard that we didn't make it to 25 when I planned on experiencing grandchildren and everything you want to experience,"" she said. ""I try not to think about that, because there are no answers. I try to do what I need to do and focus on other people and what I need to do there."" Smith said she can count on one hand the times she has been grocery shopping since Feb. 20. Something that was once so basic is now hard. ""I still find myself grabbing things that I know that they would have wanted, and then putting them back and not actually grabbing them because no, it's just you,"" she said. She has days when she doesn't cry, and others when she's ""a mess."" She tries to keep busy. She's been instrumental in planning a Forever Strong memorial project that will be unveiled at a community candlelight vigil at Wings Event Center the night of Feb. 20. ""That's really where I think my hope is, is in that,"" Smith said. ""It's kind of rediscovering what my purpose is and I know it's definitely something to do with giving back to others. That's where I find any real joy anymore."" Smith said the community support she and her family have received keeps her going on days she doesn't want to get out of bed. She hears about how Tyler, just 17 when he died, had touched people's lives in ways she didn't even know, like the father who donated a tree in Tyler's name because of how he treated his son. ""It's actually been helpful that the community is so embracing and supportive, because it gives us an expectation that we have to be what they think we are, even though we don't feel strong, or we don't feel inspirational, it helps keep us going and it has over the past year,"" she said. That support has given the family strength as they grapple with not only the loss of their loved ones, but the cold, senseless manner in which they were taken. ""The way they died makes this a million times harder,"" Smith said. ""The fact that (Dalton's) not even remorseful about it."" Lemmer said that's the part that hurts the most. ""What I would kill to have him tell me that he's sorry, even though it wouldn't make the pain go away, but just the fact that he was sorry and it hurt him."" Both Smith and Lemmer were in the courtroom during Dalton's preliminary examination last spring, and say they plan to be there for the trial, which is not yet scheduled. ""I want him to see me. I want him to have to face me,"" Lemmer said. ""I want him to have to look at me and see he left me without a dad. He left me without a brother. He left my unborn baby without a grandpa. He left my unborn baby without an uncle. I will never be an aunt. ""I just want him to know and look at me and realize that he destroyed my life.""

          / CBS News The White House is heavily weighing the use of an executive order to expand background checks for gun buyers, two administration sources confirmed to CBS News. The use of executive authority would allow the president to bypass Congressional gridlock to impose stricter regulations on gun dealers. The new rule would require gun dealers who sell a large number of firearms to perform checks on potential buyers. Gun dealers would also need to be licensed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The White House is expected to come to a final decision on issuing the executive order soon. The consideration of the new rule comes as the president heads to Roseburg, Oregon Friday to offer his condolences to the families of the victims from last week's mass shooting at Umpqua Community College. Mr. Obama, who has expressed mounting frustration over Congressional inaction on gun control, called last week for the partisan bickering to stop. ""Our thoughts and prayers are not enough,"" the president said last Thursday in a statement from the White House briefing room. ""It's not enough. It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel. And it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America."" The latest rule change was first considered in 2012, after a lone gunman opened fire and killed 20 schoolchildren and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. ""As a country, we have been through this too many times,"" the president said the day of the Newtown, Connecticut shooting. ""We're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics."" The difference the new order could make is questionable. Many gun dealer sales are already covered by the president's previous executive actions which require sellers ""in the business"" of dealing firearms to have a federal license and perform background checks. The new order, however, would make clear what it means to be ""in the business"" of selling firearms. The president has seen increasing gun-related violence over the course of his presidency and has addressed the nation nearly a dozen times after domestic mass shootings. Early Friday, another school shooting occurred at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. One person was reported killed and three wounded. CBS News' Major Garrett contributed to this report.

          / CBS News From Charleston, South Carolina, to the statehouse steps in Columbia, there is anger over the Confederate flag and all it represents. The mass shooting at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston has reignited the debate over whether officials should remove the Confederate flag from state property. Republican state Rep. Doug Brannon plans to introduce a bill to remove the flag, which he acknowledges will likely cost him re-election, reports CBS News' Adriana Diaz. ""The switch that flipped was the death of my friend Sen. [Clementa] Pinckney... I've been in the House five years. I should have filed that bill five years ago. But the time is now, I can't let my friend the senator's death go without fundamental change in South Carolina,"" Brannon said. Brannon said he plans to introduce his bill as early as he can, which won't be until December. Other politicians have said they will wait until after funerals can be held for the nine victims of last week's shooting before they weigh on whether the flag should be moved. This isn't the first time the flag has sparked outrage. In 2000, protests led to a compromise: The flag was removed from the Capitol dome, but instead of placing it behind the building, legislators placed it near a Confederate memorial out front. Now old wounds are being reopened. Saturday night, a Confederate memorial in Charleston was spray painted with the words ""black lives matter,"" and elsewhere people burned Confederate flags. ""It is a reminder, and more so an insult to the very soul of African Americans,"" said Dot Scott, president of the Charleston NAACP chapter. To many like Scott, the flag is a symbol of intolerance and white supremacy. ""We should not have to continue to be forced to somehow revere the flag,"" Scott said. But to others, the flag represents the sacrifices thousands of South Carolinians made -- regardless of color -- during the Civil War. ""We want to remember those men. They are family members, there are pictures on our walls, their names are in our Bibles. They're part of us, their DNA is in us,"" Randy Burbage of the Sons of Confederate Veterans said. While Burbage said he feels for the families and relatives who died in the mass shooting at Charleston's Emanuel AME church, ""the flag didn't have anything to do with why [shooting suspect Dylann Roof] did what he did."" The flag is now an issue in the Republican presidential race. Former nominee Mitt Romney on Saturday Tweeted: ""Take down the #ConfederateFlag at the SC Capitol. To many, it is a symbol of racial hatred."" Take down the #ConfederateFlag at the SC Capitol. To many, it is a symbol of racial hatred. Remove it now to honor #Charleston victims. Jeb Bush agreed, noting while governor of Florida he ordered the flag moved ""to a museum where it belonged."" In the important primary state of South Carolina, others tried to avoid angering potential voters. ""My opinion is that we should let the people of South Carolina go through the process of making this decision,"" former Sen. Rick Santorum said on ABC's ""This Week."" ""It works here, that's what the statehouse agreed to do,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham said.

          / CBS News After leading the United States for seven years, President Obama on Tuesday night will deliver his final State of the Union address -- perhaps his last great opportunity to command the nation's attention. The annual address, typically delivered before a joint session of Congress, usually gives the president an opportunity to encourage Congress and the American public to embrace his policy agenda. However, for a president at the end of his second term, the State of the Union gives him a chance to define his legacy in his own terms and make the case that the next president should build on that legacy. President Obama intends to do that by arguing that he has left the United States poised for a bright future. ""There is no country in the world that is better positioned to capitalize on the kind of opportunities we see, whether it relates to our national security or it relates to our economy than the United States of America,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest explained Monday. ""That ultimately is the essence of the message the president wants to deliver, precisely because the next president needs to understand that, and the American people need to understand that,"" he continued. ""They need to have an accurate assessment of what our challenges are, what the risks are out there. But also to have an adequate understanding of what opportunities are available so that we do not miss them and we are at a critical juncture in our history that we've spent seven years digging out of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression."" While Mr. Obama will urge the nation to seize the opportunities his administration has created, he won't dwell on making the final ""victory lap"" that's expected of an outgoing president, Earnest insisted. ""If the president wanted to give a speech about what the president has been able to do over the last seven years, we'd have plenty to talk about,"" the White House official said. ""But the president is still writing a speech that is not about him. It is about the American people and about the future of our country and about how our kids and their kids are going to fare."" This creates a contrast with two of Mr. Obama's predecessors, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. As the first president to lead the nation for two full terms since President Eisenhower, Reagan used his final State of the Union address to make the closing arguments for the ideology behind the Reagan Revolution: ""Our record is not just the longest peacetime expansion in history but an economic and social revolution of hope based on work, incentives, growth, and opportunity,"" Reagan said. ""A revolution of compassion... a revolution that at a critical moment in world history reclaimed and restored the American dream."" Similarly, Clinton boasted in 2000 that ""the state of our Union is the strongest it has ever been."" He made the case that the nation's prosperity could be attributed in part to his center-left style of governance. He specifically highlighted accomplishments like shrinking the federal workforce and turning deficits into surpluses while maintaining investments in areas like education. ""We restored the vital center, replacing outmoded ideologies with a new vision anchored in basic, enduring values: opportunity for all, responsibility from all, a community of all Americans,"" he said. ""We reinvented government, transforming it into a catalyst for new ideas that stress both opportunity and responsibility and give our people the tools they need to solve their own problems."" McGill University History Prof. Gil Troy argues that like Reagan and Clinton, Mr. Obama should use his last State of the Union address to help define his legacy. ""By branding his presidency and explaining his rationale, Obama could advance the longstanding debate about what government should and should not do,"" he wrote for the Brookings Institution. For Mr. Obama, however, it will be harder to make a compelling case for style of governance than it was for Clinton or Reagan. For one thing, the nation is simply less satisfied with his presidency: Just 44 percent of Americans said they approved of the way Mr. Obama is handling his presidency in a CBS News/ New York Times poll conducted last month. By comparison, 56 percent of Americans approved of how Reagan was handling his presidency in December 1987. Similarly, 56 percent of Americans approved of how Clinton was handling his presidency in December 1999. Furthermore, Troy told CBS, Mr. Obama has yet to truly define the philosophies that drive his policymaking. ""The fact that Obama hasn't done this, and has been resistant to doing it, makes it that much harder to do it at the top of the Ninth,"" he said. Given these challenges, Mr. Obama could take a page from former President George W. Bush's playbook. In January 2008, just 29 percent of Americans approved of the way President Bush was handling his job as president, and 75 percent said the nation was on the wrong track. Consequently, Mr. Bush opened his final State of the Union address with a conciliatory tone. ""Our country has been tested in ways none of us could have imagined,"" he said. ""We faced hard decisions about peace and war, rising competition in the world economy, and the health and welfare of our citizens. These issues call for vigorous debate, and I think it's fair to say, we've answered the call. Yet history will record that amid our differences, we acted with purpose, and together we showed the world the power and resilience of American self-government."" Yet Mr. Obama on Tuesday night plans to strike a decidedly optimistic tone, administration officials say. ""There are certainly [reasons] for people to be concerned"" about issues like the economy and national security, Earnest said Monday. ""The president's reaction to that though, is that he has never been more confident about our ability to confront successfully those challenges. But also, never been more confident about our capacity to capitalize on the opportunities that exist for this country."" Earnest also argued, however, that GOP rhetoric has aggravated the public's concerns. ""The willingness of those candidates to exploit people's fears and insecurities and anxieties has infected the political debate,"" he said. Troy warned that if Mr. Obama sounds too optimistic, without acknowledging the legitimate concerns of the public, it will add to his ""credibility gap."" ""One of the things Obama has to worry about is having happy talk that doesn't resonate with the American mood,"" he said. The president has already taken heat in recent weeks for not responding forcefully enough to events like the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. The president's cool demeanor has given oxygen to Donald Trump's presidential campaign, Troy argued. ""Trump has positioned himself as the truth-teller who doesn't play games about what's really going on in America, whether it's with regard to terrorism or the economy,"" he said. While he must remain sensitive to the mood of the nation, Mr. Obama still has an obligation to explain and defend his style of governance, Troy argued. ""The nation would benefit from Obama saying...what's the role of government and the relationship between the federal government and the individual citizen.""

According to the Palm Beach Post, the FBI has arrested the renter of the house where the triple murders took place on February 5. According to Jupiter Police Chief Frank Kitzerow, the arrested man was identified as 27-year-old Charles Vorpagel. However, he went on to clarify that this individual was arrested on federal firearms charges, while adding that they are still on the lookout for another person of interest. They have not named a suspect at this point of time.  https://www.facebook.com/WPTV5/videos/10155045449818384/ Earlier, police identified the victims of the triple homicide, the worst mass shooting incident in the area since 2009 as 20-year-old Kelli J. Doherty of Tequesta, 24-year-old Brandi El-Salhy of Gainesville, and 25-year-old Sean P. Henry of Jupiter. The trio were all killed in the shooting that was reported earlier this week at a home located on the 1100 block of Mohawk Street in the Jupiter River Estates neighborhood. The investigating team also found a car on the southbound side of Interstate 95 just north of Northlake Boulevard, which they believe is a vehicle of interest. Jupiter Police Chief maintains that the triple homicide does not appear to be ""a random act of violence."" Police officials have also not revealed as to how many shots were fired in the incident or if any weapons were found at the crime scene. A few minutes after the triple homicide, another shooting was reported from less than a mile away, where one person was injured and was taken to a trauma center. The individual's condition remains unknown at the time of this publishing. Police now believe the two shootings were related. However, they stopped short of divulging further infirmation citing an ongoing investigation.  ""He is deeply missed here,"" she said. ""He is loved by this congregation.

The measure was passed by a 57-43 margin and is now before President Donald Trump, who ran on a campaign of support for the National Rifle Association and the Second Amendment, and is ""widely expected"" to approve it.  Democrat Chris Murphy, a U.S. senator from Connecticut, asked of the gun bill ""If you can't manage your own financial affairs, how can we expect that you're going to be a responsible steward of a dangerous, lethal firearm?"" Proponents of the bill, such as the NRA, the American Civil Liberties Union, and U.S. Senator from Iowa Chuck Grassley, are reported to cite varying motivations.   ""If a specific individual is likely to be violent due to the nature of their mental illness, then the government should have to prove it,"" Senator Grassley was quoted by NPR. The ACLU is said to oppose the bill's effect of stereotyping mentally impaired individuals. The NRA is said to oppose the measure because of the restrictions it places on the Second Amendment rights of citizens. Others are said to point to the fact that the vast majority of those who may have difficulty managing their own finances and need them managed by third parties, the group targeted by the rule, are non-violent and include those with eating and sleeping challenges. Twenty schoolchildren and six teachers were murdered during the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut, which is now the third-largest mass shooting in U.S. history, as previously reported by the Inquisitr. Worldwide, school shootings are said to be occurring at a rate of about one per week in the wake of the Connecticut massacre.   In December 2016, it was reported that 94 deaths and 156 injuries had occurred in school shooting incidents since 2012. It was further noted that figures do not include the many plans by children to carry out shootings thwarted by authorities, with an incident in Oklahoma involving a ""heavily armed"" 13-year-old girl suspected to be planning to attack classmates she had previously threatened being held up as evidence. The measure passed was a ""Resolution of Disapproval,"" described as a ""rarely used"" mechanism, giving legislators the power to overturn executive measures with a majority vote from both the House and Senate.   Reacting to the approval of the measure, Cenk Uygur, host and co-founder of The Young Turks, found irony in the fact that in the wake of past shootings and calls for tighter gun control measures Republicans have argued that violence is not a gun issue, but a mental health issue. The Inquisitr has previously reported on the 40-time disparity of per capita gun violence in countries with tight gun controls, such as Canada and the United Kingdom, and the United States, which has relatively lax gun legislation. ""I know they want to sell more weapons,"" Uygur said of the resolution.  [Featured Image by Thomas Cooper/Getty Images]"

It looks like the Wikipedia editors are kicking you off their site. The online encyclopedia made a rare move this week by classifying the British tabloid as a “generally unreliable source” and has called on its editors to remove citations linking to the paper as a general rule. Wikipedia said it made this decision due to the Mail’s “reputation for poor fact checking, sensationalism, and flat-out fabrication.” “This means that the Daily Mail will generally not be referenced as a ‘reliable source’ on English Wikipedia, and volunteer editors are encouraged to change existing citations to the Daily Mail to another source deemed reliable by the community,” the site said in an open notice to its editors. “This is consistent with how Wikipedia editors evaluate and use media outlets in general – with common sense and caution.” Also Read: Pennsylvania State Senator to Trump: 'Try to Destroy My Career, You S-t-Gibbon!'

Wikipedia editors say they have been debating the move since January, with the new rule put into effect following a vote. Dissenters cited in a discussion thread on the crowdsourced encyclopedia site claimed that the Daily Mail has proven to be reliable for some topics. Dissenters also argued that Wikipedia has allowed other publications to be used as sources despite having posted inaccurate stories, believing this move to be motivated by personal distaste for the Daily Mail. Articles from Russia Today and Fox News are still accepted as credible sources despite objections from some editors. Wikipedia is stopping short of ordering a complete ban on Daily Mail articles, allowing editors to use it as a source in special circumstances. Such citations will be judged on a case-by-case basis.

The paper is currently in an ongoing lawsuit filed by First Lady Melania Trump, who sued the paper last September for a story that discussed allegations that she worked as an escort in the 1990s. Though the paper noted in the article that there is no evidence to back up the allegations and issued a retraction, the suit is still in court with Trump seeking $150 million in damages. Misinformation in 2016: A Timeline of Fake News (Photos)






Hopefully we'll look back at 2016 as that weird year when fake news stories oddly garnered influence over the voting population of the country. On the other side of the spectrum, there's also a chance we may look back one day in an effort to decode the origins of a propaganda tactic that's continued to be manipulated by powerful and/or misinformed ne'er do wells. Either way, there's no doubt we can learn from the false stories that started it all.

In February, Donald Trump entertained conspiracy theories that Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was murdered when reports surfaced that he was found with ""a pillow on his face."" Alex Jones' InfoWars had earlier reported on suggestions Scalia was killed. But the owner of the ranch where Scalia died later clarified that he did not have a pillow over his face.

Anti-terrorism police launched the security operation against people with alleged links to IS early Sunday, conducting simultaneous raids in 29 provinces, including Istanbul, Ankara and the border provinces of Gaziantep and Sanliurfa. The Interior Ministry released a statement Monday saying that 748 people have been detained in the police sweep, but did not give their nationalities. In addition, 72 other suspects were detained last week, it said. The state-run Anadolu Agency said police seized IS documents, digital material and six firearms during the raids. Anadolu, citing police sources, said the IS was “searching” for ways to carry out a “sensational attack” in Turkey, and was actively engaged in propaganda in order to recruit fighters. It said the raids targeted suspects believed to be in contact with IS operatives in conflict zones. Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said Turkey was determined to “bring to their knees” IS and other terror organizations active in the country by blocking them from recruiting new fighters. “We will get results,” Kurtulmus added. Turkey in the last year has suffered dozens of deadly attacks linked to IS or Kurdish militants, and has been stepping up its anti-terrorism efforts. The Islamic State group, which took responsibility for a New Year’s mass shooting at an Istanbul nightclub that killed 39 people, claims to have multiple cells in Turkey. The accused perpetrator of the nightclub attack, an Uzbek national who reportedly trained in Afghanistan, was detained in Istanbul two weeks after the assault.

(Credit: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg) Remember last year when Apple refused to give the FBI the ability to unlock a cell phone that belonged to Syed Rizwan Farook, accused of the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, California? Apple said that by creating new software to break into the iPhone it could create a permanent security issue and iPhones would be susceptible to hacking from other countries, spy agencies, and others. Plus there were First Amendment issues. The FBI said that the data on the phone could tell them who Farook and his wife had been talking to and where they were before and after the attack. Information that could help prevent further attacks and was, to say the least, time sensitive. In the end, the FBI gained access to the phone via a third party. All of this raised important questions. Should the government be able to gain access to encrypted communications when investigating criminal activity? Should tech companies refuse to give the government access based on principle? Does that principle put us in danger? Once again we are looking at the issue of security vs privacy. The Pew Research Center did a study to find out what Americans think about this issue. The infographic below shows the results. Privacy Vs Security: How Americans View The Issue Of Encryption This is an important issue and our views seem to be divided right down party lines. These were simple questions with no real details on who the person of interest is or what crime is being investigated and we were quick to jump to one side or the other. Only 3 to 7% of the people surveyed answered, “it depends."" The question of “Should the government be able to access encrypted communications when investigating a crime?” is very broad and potentially means that any person of interest could have a large chunk of their privacy taken away by the government. Even if they are being investigated for jaywalking. What are your views on this issue? Let us know in the comments.

""Nothing can erase the pain we all feel about the senseless and brutal murders of 49 of our neighbors, friends, family members and loved ones,"" Mina said in a statement. ""But I have full faith that she will ultimately be brought to justice.""  Prosecutors argued against releasing Salman, calling her a danger to the public. She will stay behind bars for two days so the government can appeal. Salman's husband, Omar Mateen, called a local TV station and 911 to ""pledge allegiance"" to the Islamic State during the siege at Pulse nightclub June 12. He died in a confrontation with police. FBI arrests wife of Orlando nightclub shooter Omar Mateen Salman, who married Mateen in 2011, grew up about 25 miles northeast of San Francisco. She must wear an ankle monitor and live with an uncle in Northern California. Salman was arrested last month at her Northern California home on charges of aiding and abetting. She is also charged with obstruction of justice for her dealings with authorities after the attack. Her lawyers have claimed Salman had no prior knowledge of the rampage. Salman, in interviews with federal investigators after the shooting, allegedly acknowledged driving Mateen to the Pulse nightclub at least once before her husband launched the assault. But she told The New York Times in November she was unaware of his intentions until he sent her a 4 a.m. text message the night of the shooting, asking whether she had seen what happened on the news. The last message from her husband was a text saying, “I love you babe.”"

          / CBS/AP TUCSON - Investigators in the attack that killed six people and wounded 14 others, including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, said they seized evidence suggesting Jared Loughner planned ahead. Investigators carried out a search warrant at the suspect's home and seized an envelope from a safe with messages such as ""I planned ahead,"" ""My assassination,"" and the name ""Giffords"" next to what appears to be the man's signature. Special Section: Tragedy in Tucson The FBI also found a letter in a safe from Giffords, on Congressional stationery, dated Aug. 30, 2007 that thanked Loughner for attending a ""Congress on your Corner"" event at the Foothills Mall in Tucson. Loughner is charged with one count of attempted assassination of a member of Congress, two counts of killing an employee of the federal government and two counts of attempting to killing a federal employee. Criminal Complaint Against Jared Lee Loughner Heather Williams, the first assistant federal public defender in Arizona, says the 22-year-old suspect doesn't yet have a lawyer, but that her office is working to get a lawyer appointed for Loughner. Loughner remains in federal custody and is being transported to Phoenix where he will make an initial court appearance on Monday at 2 p.m. local time. Meanwhile, authorities released 911 calls in which a person witnessing the mass shooting outside a grocery store in Tucson describes a frantic scene and says, ""I do believe Gabby Giffords was hit."" Loughner fired at Giffords' district director and shooting indiscriminately at staffers and others standing in line to talk to the congresswoman, said Mark Kimble, a communications staffer for Giffords. ""He was not more than three or four feet from the congresswoman and the district director,"" Kimble said, describing the scene as ""just complete chaos, people screaming, crying."" Loughner is accused of killing six people, including a federal judge, an aide to Giffords and a 9-year-old girl who was born on Sept. 11, 2001. Fourteen others were wounded, including the three-term Democrat lawmaker. Authorities don't know his motive, but said he targeted Giffords at a public gathering around 10 a.m. Saturday. Doctors treating the lawmaker provided an optimistic update about her chances for survival, saying they are ""very, very encouraged"" by her ability to respond to simple commands along with their success in controlling her bleeding. Giffords Doctors: Good News on Bullet TrajectoryJared Loughner Interacted With Giffords in 2007Victims of the Tucson Shooting Rampage In one of several YouTube videos, which featured text against a dark background, Loughner described inventing a new U.S. currency and complained about the illiteracy rate among people living in Giffords' congressional district in Arizona. ""I know who's listening: Government Officials, and the People,"" Loughner wrote. ""Nearly all the people, who don't know this accurate information of a new currency, aren't aware of mind control and brainwash methods. If I have my civil rights, then this message wouldn't have happen (sic)."" In Loughner's middle-class neighborhood - about a five-minute drive from the scene - sheriff's deputies had much of the street blocked off. The neighborhood sits just off a bustling Tucson street and is lined with desert landscaping and palm trees. Neighbors said Loughner lived with his parents and kept to himself. He was often seen walking his dog, almost always wearing a hooded sweat shirt and listening to his iPod.

The ForeverStrong Memorial Foundation was revealed by Laurie Smith at a candlelight vigil held on the one-year anniversary of the mass shooting, which took the lives of her son, husband and four other people on Feb. 20, 2016. The foundation is a non-profit organization created to strengthen the communities affected while honoring the victims and survivors of both tragedies. The memorial is a multi-year project and will consist of several unique sections including an indoor soccer/multipurpose facility, outdoor soccer fields, large remembrance panels dedicated to victims and survivors, a memorial pavilion and more. Concepts and designs were shown at Monday night's vigil. The memorial could take up a minimum of 28 acres of land and a maximum of 32, according to architect David VanderKlok. He said they have a location in mind along a ""major thoroughfare"" in Kalamazoo but did not reveal a specific location. ""I can't think of a better way to carry on the legacies of those people that we lost and those that are critically injured forever and ever,"" said Smith, whose son Tyler, one of those killed in the shootings, was an avid soccer player. ""It's (the memorial) a good way for us to have hope and dive into something that's going to make a difference."" VanderKlok worked with Smith, fellow family members of victims and survivors to create the memorial design. ""Some want to engage about this and help a lot. Some are really struggling, really struggling,"" VanderKlok said of working with those affected. In addition to those killed in the shooting rampage, the memorial will honor five bicyclists who were killed and four injured when a pickup truck struck a group of cyclists north of Kalamazoo on June 7, 2016. Neither Smith nor VanderKlok have disclosed a cost for the project, but Smith said they are just beginning to work with Hopkins Fundraising Consulting in Grand Rapids. Their first effort will be to conduct a feasibility study and once that is completed, they will start speaking to foundations and corporations in the area in search of financial support. The final step, pending how much Smith and others with the foundation are able to raise, will be to launch a public fundraising campaign. ""We'd love to have it tomorrow but in all reality, this an enormous undertaking, moreso than I think anybody could have imagined,"" VanderKlok said. ""Life's too short to spend time on things that you're not passionate about and when we all leave this earth it's about who we've impacted and whose lives we touched, not about what we had,"" Smith said. ""And I believe that the memorial that we've come up with will impact a lot more lives and will touch a lot more people than if we put up a smaller one.""

695394969,2017-02-13 14:35:00,Hey Americans: Why Are You Ignoring The New Online Right’s First Mass-Shooter?,https://www.buzzfeed.com/jessebrown/hey-americans-quebec-city?utm_term=.keErkALVV#.lyzOr41VV,en,False,,6218,Buzzfeed,http://www.buzzfeed.com,"When an anti-immigrant, meme-baiting, white nationalist troll starts shooting. The view from Toronto. BuzzFeed Contributor Alexandre Bissonnette An idiotic conspiracy theory is making the rounds in Canada’s alt-right media (yes, we have one too). Here's how it goes: Despite what the lying media told you, last month’s mosque shooting in Quebec city was actually an act of Muslim on Muslim terror carried out by a Moroccan jihadist from a rival mosque. But Justin Trudeau couldn't let the truth out since it would make him look bad for taking in all of those Syrian refugees. So, the powers that be offered the shooter a sweet deal: He'd be released without charges if he backed up their official story, that he was arrested in error while providing first-aid to people shot by the real killer, who according to police is a white nationalist named Alexandre Bissonnette. It's total bullshit (duh). Even the premise is absurd: Why would a terrorist attack by a Moroccan jihadist make Trudeau look bad for accepting Syrians? Then there’s the crazy notion that the cops would be cool with letting a mass murderer walk because of political pressure from Trudeau. Also, what about the dozens of survivors who could refute a revisionist account? Debunking this nonsense is hardly worth the effort, as any dummy who buys it won't be swayed by things like facts and reason anyhow. I bring it up now to point out something far more disturbing than the conspiracy theory itself; namely, the fact that there are more people in the alt-right credulously discussing and sharing the conspiracy version of the shooting than there are people in the mainstream conversation recognizing what actually happened in Quebec. What actually happened is that Canada suffered the world’s first terrorist attack carried out by an extremist who was radicalized by the new online right and whose political guidestars included Donald Trump. Here’s what we know so far about Bissonnette: He was a right-wing troll, a white-nationalist and an anti-feminist. He didn't just ""like"" Donald Trump on Facebook. He also championed Trump in arguments, trolled pro-immigration forums, and defended the president's Muslim ban. In fact, the ban directly anticipated the mosque shooting. In defending the ban, Bissonnette railed about his fears regarding the ""marginalization"" of the white race. A day after he wrote that, he allegedly walked into a mosque and allegedly opened fire into a crowd during evening prayer, killing six people and injuring many more. Bissonnette’s Facebook history reportedly contained glorified Christian Crusader imagery, a popular meme of Trump's online supporters. How is this getting slept on? This was not a bunch of trolls harassing a woman on Twitter. This was not a confused man with a rifle in Comet Pizza, investigating an absurd 4Chan conspiracy theory, arrested without injuries. This was alleged politically motivated mass murder by a terrorist who was indoctrinated into a racist ideology that he believed was consistent with the agenda of the American president. So how has this killing, and its implications, faded so quickly from public conversation? It's hard to imagine the press moving on to Nordstrom and Shia LaBeouf so quickly had the suspect been a guy in a MAGA cap shooting up a Florida mosque. The fact that it happened in Canada (French Canada, no less) definitely helped distance the story from its global political context, despite the many connections. Plus, there were other factors. There was the initial media confusion based on the early arrest of the Moroccan witness. There was Quebec’s own unique history of intolerance to outsiders. Then there was the usual caution of the Canadian press: No one wanted to jump to conclusions and make too much of Bissonnette's Facebook profile, which included unrelated endorsements and affiliations. Who was to say, in those early moments, that Bissonnette was inspired to do murder by Trump any more than he was by Pizza Hut or by the left-wing NDP, both of which he also ""liked""? It was only in the days that followed that Bissonnette's politics and passions became clear, as reporters spoke to those who knew him and saw evidence of his online behavior. They emerged with a profile of Bissonnette's ideology and interactions that leaves little room for doubt, and the cultural context for the killing is now indisputable. An old friend of Bissonnette’s described how he became “enthralled by a borderline racist nationalist movement.” Bissonnette took his anger to the enemy, trolling members of a refugee-support page with rants against “feminazis.” The page’s moderator described Bissonnette as part of a “nationalist conservative identity movement.” Bissonnette’s flavor of racism was not the Confederate flag-flying anti-black variety of Dylann Roof, it was the anti-immigrant, meme-baiting, white nationalist trolling of the extreme elements of the pro-Trump internet. This isn’t to compare the new online right to the ISIS internet — it lacks the coherence and clear political leadership of ISIS’s online presence. And, needless to say, it's not attached to a murderous pseudostate. Nor am I assigning direct responsibility for a mass shooting to someone other than the alleged shooter. The comparison is between young men drawn to dangerous ideologies. We can’t blame Donald Trump for the Quebec mosque shooting, but we also can't separate him from it. There will, from now on, always be lonely and angry young men, clicking around the internet, vulnerable to seductive and simple ideologies that tell them that they are heroes with a glorious past whose culture and masculinity is under threat from terrible enemies. Some of them find ISIS. Alexandre Bissonnette found Trump. Toxic ideologies spread across borders no matter how extreme the vetting. A final bit of post-truth irony: If Bissonnette hoped his actions could further the Trump agenda, the Trump administration seemed to agree. When asked about the massacre, Sean Spicer said that the Quebec shooting was one more reason why the travel ban was needed.

The man, Enrique Marquez Jr., was a friend of Syed Rizwan Farook, who, with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, carried out one of the worst terrorist attacks on American soil, killing 14 people and wounding more than 20 others at a social services center. The couple were killed in a shootout with the authorities hours after the attack. Mr. Marquez, 25, of Riverside, Calif., did not participate in the Dec. 2, 2015, attack on the center. He has agreed to plead guilty in federal court on Thursday to conspiring to provide material support to terrorists, including weapons, explosives and personnel, to attack Riverside City College and commuter traffic on a local freeway, the United States attorney’s office for the Central District of California said in a statement. Those attacks were never carried out, but Mr. Marquez discussed with Mr. Farook using radio-controlled improvised explosive devices for the attacks and bought Christmas tree light bulbs and a container of smokeless powder to use in the devices, the statement said. He has also agreed to plead guilty to making false statements as the “straw buyer” of two assault rifles that were used in the San Bernardino shooting, the authorities said. Investigators uncovered evidence that, in 2011 and 2012, Mr. Marquez bought two rifles that Mr. Farook and Ms. Malik used in their attack. According to the plea agreement, Mr. Farook paid Mr. Marquez for the guns. “While his earlier plans to attack a school and a freeway were not executed, the planning clearly laid the foundation for the 2015 attack on the Inland Regional Center,” Eileen M. Decker, the United States attorney for the Central District of California, said in the statement, referring to the social services center. Mr. Marquez, the only person charged in connection with the massacre, faces a maximum sentence of 25 years. His lawyer could not be immediately reached on Tuesday night. Three other people were charged for their roles in a fraudulent marriage designed to skirt immigration laws, offenses that came to light as part of the investigation into the massacre. They pleaded guilty to various charges, which were unrelated to the attack. Tatiana Farook, the sister-in-law of the couple who carried out the attack, pleaded guilty last week to a felony count of conspiracy to commit immigration fraud that included lying to federal agents and in legal documents, officials said. Her husband, Syed Raheel Farook, the brother of Mr. Farook, pleaded guilty last month to conspiring to commit immigration fraud by setting up his Russian sister-in-law, Mariya Chernykh, in a fraudulent marriage to Mr. Marquez. Ms. Chernykh pleaded last month to conspiracy, perjury and two counts of making false statements. Advertisement"

                    Jonathan Lemire, Associated Press Vivian Salama, Associated Press


                    Vivian Salama, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON — A White House list of what it calls underreported terrorist attacks did not support President Donald Trump’s claim that the media are downplaying a “genocide” carried out by the Islamic State group. But it did shine new light on the difficulty in defining the scope, source and motives behind the violence carried out in the name of radical Islam. A close review of the 78 attacks listed by the White House shows almost all the attacks were reported by the news media and that many were widely covered by local and international outlets. The review, carried out by Associated Press reporters on four continents, found that more than half of the attacks, including most of those in the Middle East, were linked to the Islamic State group, as the White House suggested. Others were ruled IS-inspired, but carried out by lone wolf attackers. But in some cases, the motive was unclear, and investigations as to possible extremist links were inconclusive. The examples range from knife-wielding assailants in Texas to hostage-takers in Australia to the gunmen who killed at least 129 people across Paris in 2015. The magnitude of the attacks on the document circulated by the White House — which appeared to be hastily compiled and included several typos — ranges from several dozen dead to one or two people injured. It has some notable omissions. It did not include any attacks by Boko Haram, an Islamist insurgent group operating in West Africa that is responsible for far more deaths than the Islamic State. The group, which has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, has led an uprising that has killed more than 20,000 people and left 2.6 million homeless this decade in Nigeria and neighboring countries. It also pays little heed to the scores of terror acts that have plagued nations like Syria and Iraq that are close to the Islamic State’s caliphate and under near-daily siege. The list itself was created to bolster the case for Trump’s executive order restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries and suspending the U.S. refugee program. But that ban would not have prevented any of the terrorist attacks on the list that occurred in the United States.  Here’s a closer look at some of the attacks on the list: ___ UNITED STATES The inclusion of some of the attacks in the United States defies credulity. Among those on the White House’s list are a deadly rampage in San Bernardino, California, in 2015 in which 14 people were killed and 21 injured, and the June 2016 nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, which left 49 dead, the biggest mass shooting in the nation’s history. Both of those attacks received blanket news coverage for days, and all of the attacks in the U.S. received at least some attention by the American media. A 2015 attack in Garland, Texas, took place outside a venue hosting a provocative contest for Prophet Muhammad cartoons. According to trial testimony, the suspect, Elton Simpson, was an American Muslim who became the subject of a criminal investigation in 2006 because of his association “with an individual whom the FBI believed was attempting to set up a terrorist cell in Arizona.” He was never found to have links to the Islamic State group or any other established radical groups. Non-fatal knife attacks on police officers in Boston and New York, a knife attack at a Minnesota mall and the shooting of a police officer in Philadelphia were also reported. “The notion that terrorism is an under-covered subject is preposterous,” said David H. Schanzer, director of Duke University’s Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security. “It’s highly over-covered compared to the amount of violence that we face in society.” Citing a study his department recently published, Schanzer said, “one out of every 2,000 homicides since 9/11 have been linked to al-Qaida or ISIS-inspiration or control.” ___ CANADA Two October 2014 attacks in Canada — one in Quebec and one in Ottawa — received media coverage in Canada, where attacks of this nature are rare. In Quebec, soldier Patrice Vincent was killed in an apparent act of homegrown terrorism. The suspect was known to police and had his passport seized to stop him from traveling to Syria. It was never determined whether the suspect had any ties to Islamic militant groups, though former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper described the suspect as an “ISIL-inspired terrorist,” referring to the Islamic State group by an acronym. In the Canadian capital, one soldier was killed at a war memorial and two were wounded in shootings at the Parliament building. Meanwhile, in Quebec last week, a gunman who reportedly held anti-immigrant views killed six men at a local mosque in an incident described by Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as a “terrorist attack.” Trump has yet to personally comment on the attacks, although the White House did offer assistance to Trudeau. That attack wasn’t listed. ___ EUROPE Across Europe, attacks are increasingly being attributed to the flow of refugees across the continent — and it’s hard to find a single attack, large or small, that didn’t generate global coverage. Trump himself used a non-fatal knife attack outside the Louvre in Paris last week to underscore his efforts to ban migrants from entering the U.S., writing on Twitter, “A new radical Islamic terrorist has just attacked in Louvre Museum in Paris. Tourists were locked down. France on edge again. GET SMART U.S.” All of the attacks cited on the list in Europe were widely reported both by international and local media — some in real time. A 2015 attack at a Paris supermarket was covered live as it was happening. When the attacker, Amedy Coulibaly, pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group, it was urgently reported by The Associated Press and others. Links between the attackers and terror groups were also reported, although at times that did not happen until they were unearthed by investigators days later. In London, a 2015 knife attack by a man shouting “this is for Syria” at an underground rail station made headlines in newspapers around the world. Police said they treated it as a terrorist incident, although a link was never drawn between the attacker and any particular group. A 2014 attack on a police station by a Muslim convert in Joue-les-Tours, France, was reported by The Associated Press at the time and followed up with his brother’s arrest in Burundi. AP did not report on any links to the Islamic State group, although British media later said he posted a black Islamic State flag on his Facebook page. ___ MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA The Muslim world is the front line in the battle against the Islamic State group, and civilians across the region have not been spared the group’s deadly campaign. A number of attacks cited on the White House list occurred in Egypt. A 2015 attack on a camp used by a multinational peacekeeping force was reported by several news outlets, as was the Islamic State group claim. Other attacks occurred in Cairo in 2015, including one that resulted in the kidnapping and beheading of a Croatian national, and a car bomb at the Italian Consulate that left one dead. Both were claimed by the Islamic State group and reported worldwide. Additional attacks in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Tunisia and Turkey were also reported by various news outlets, citing officials who linked the attacks to the Islamic State group — a common claim by governments across the Middle East, even when dealing with lone wolf attackers. The White House list did not include any attacks in Iraq, Syria or Yemen, where civilians are targeted almost daily by militant attacks. Many of those attacks are covered by the media, despite the often-perilous conditions involved in reporting those stories. ___ AUSTRALIA Included on Trump’s list is a standoff at a Sydney chocolatier in 2014. The incident drew round-the-clock coverage by the world’s news outlets. A request by attacker Man Haron Monis for an Islamic State group flag during the faceoff fueled anxiety about the group’s expanding influence across the globe. Monis himself was never determined to have had contact with the group. An incident shortly before that in Melbourne also made headlines when Numan Haider was shot dead by police in connection with the stabbing of two police officers. Photographs on Haider’s Facebook site included images of what appeared to be members of the Islamic State group. ___ Lemire reported from New York.

577861383,2017-02-07 15:59:00,Justin Trudeau treads cautious path in the Trump era,http://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/07/justin-trudeau-treads-cautious-path-in-the-trump-era.html,en,False,,1755,CNBC,http://www.cnbc.com/," Justin Trudeau, Donald Trump's neighbour to the north, has a $500bn problem — how to keep Canada's most important economic relationship on track when he is at odds on so many issues with the new occupant of the White House. There are many contrasts between the Canadian prime minister — a 45-year old self-declared feminist who campaigned an optimistic message of ""sunny ways"" — and the 70-year US president who won power on a platform of protectionism and immigration curbs. In policy terms, potential flashpoints include the  North American Free Trade Agreement, which Mr Trump blames for the loss of US jobs and which he has pledged to overhaul; immigration, with Canada pledging to admit 25,000 Syrian refugees this year; and climate change as Mr Trudeau looks to push through a carbon tax plan while Mr Trump reverses course in the US. More from Financial Times:Nafta: First shots in a trade warQuebec mosque attack suspect charged with murderBiotech industry leaders lambast Trump travel ban ""Although Trump's actions in the past few weeks are what he said he would do, they still come as a shock,"" said Roland Paris, one of Mr Trudeau's top foreign policy advisers during his 2015 election campaign and first months in office. The challenge for Mr Trudeau is to keep faith with Canadians — who largely disapprove of Mr Trump, according to recent polls — while preserving his country's $500bn annual trade relationship with the US. ""It is common sense"" not to endanger the relationship, said Paul Frazer, former Canadian ambassador to the US. The prime minister could only watch as Mr Trump fired off a barrage of executive orders, including a travel ban barring people from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the US. The ban, currently suspended pending litigation in the US courts, even raised questions about whether Ahmed Hussen, Ottawa's own immigration minister and a former Somali refugee, could still cross the two nations' shared 9,000km border. Ties between the nations have been through rough patches before. The relationship between  Stephen Harper, former Conservative prime minister, and then US President Barack Obama was chilly, while Mr Trudeau's father Pierre, a long-time Canadian premier, clashed with Richard Nixon. But when Mr Trudeau took the helm, the countries entered a new era. Mr Trudeau and Mr Obama were an ideological fit, fuelling a bond that even the White House Instagram account labelled a ""true bromance"". With Mr Trump at the helm in the US, the relationship between the two countries has entered a new and far more turbulent phase. Mr Trudeau will emphasise the value of the bilateral ties when he meets Mr Trump, which Sean Spicer, White House press secretary, said was likely to happen ""very shortly"". The Canadian prime minister has already begun a charm offensive, sending staff to meet Jared Kushner, Mr Trump's aide and son-in-law, and Steve Bannon, the president's chief adviser. Mr Trump's antitrade rhetoric has focused more on Mexico and China, and if he does leave Nafta, the US and Canada have a separate trade agreement dating back to the 1980s. ""So in some sense Canada approaches the renegotiation from a good position,"" said Max Cameron, professor at the University of British Columbia. Mr Trudeau's challenge, said Mr Paris, is to hold his principles ""without picking a fight with Trump"". The premier knows how to cater to his domestic audience, Mr Paris said, pointing to his political performance after Mr Trump announced the travel ban. The prime minister swiftly tweeted a photograph of himself welcoming a young Syrian refugee at Toronto's international airport, earning widespread plaudits. The following day, in the aftermath of the mass shooting at a  Quebec mosque, Mr Trudeau condemned the act as ""terrorism on Muslims"". But he is under pressure from rivals including Tom Mulcair, leader of the leftwing New Democrats, and Rona Ambrose, interim Conservative leader, who are seeking to capitalise on Mr Trump's unpopularity. Although his poll ratings have slipped, Mr Trudeau remains a historically popular prime minister. But ""charm will only get you so far"", warned Mr Frazer. ""Something sudden will happen with Trump and Canadians will look to Mr Trudeau immediately and say: what are you going to do about it? And that day will come."" Got a confidential news tip?

588842704,2017-03-03 10:23:14,Missouri man arrested and charged with threats against Jewish facilities,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/03/03/missouri-man-arrested-and-charged-with-threats-against-jewish-facilities/?utm_source=rss_post-nation,en,False,,2,Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,"This article is more than 1 year old A former journalist allegedly carried out at least some of the recent bomb threats against Jewish institutions across the country, according to the FBI, which described the menacing calls as part of the man’s campaign to harass a woman. Law enforcement officials said Friday that they do not believe the man they arrested — Juan Thompson, 31 — is responsible for all of the calls to scores of Jewish centers and schools in recent months, nor do they think he was behind the vandalism of headstones at Jewish cemeteries in Missouri, Pennsylvania and, most recently, Upstate New York. The arrest of a onetime reporter, fired last year for fabricating quotes, was a bizarre twist in the threats against Jewish facilities, which have forced people from dozens of Jewish Community Centers, schools, offices and day cares, contributing to heightened anxiety about anti-Semitism nationwide. Even after Thompson was taken into custody in St. Louis, Jewish groups and officials remained on edge about the threats that are still unsolved. “There are many more JCC bomb threats that have not been solved, and communities are hurting,” Evan Bernstein, the New York regional director at the Anti-Defamation League, told reporters Friday. “We hope all law enforcement will continue to be diligent.” There have been more than 100 threats, according to the ADL. The FBI on Friday called its ongoing investigation into the threats “a top priority” for the bureau. “Agents and analysts across the country are working to identify and stop those responsible,” the bureau said in a statement. “The FBI is committed to ensuring that people of all races and religions feel safe in their communities and places of worship.” FBI Director James B. Comey met Friday morning with Jewish community leaders to discuss the threats. In a statement, the Jewish groups said they “expressed the deep gratitude of the entire community for the extraordinary effort that the FBI is applying to the ongoing investigation.” Trump questions who is really behind anti-Semitic threats and vandalism Federal agents arrested Thompson on Friday morning, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of New York. Thompson — whose Twitter page is full of rants about white people and President Trump — was charged with cyberstalking and is accused of communicating at least eight threats to Jewish Community Centers, which an FBI complaint said were “part of a sustained campaign to harass and intimidate” a woman with whom he had been romantically involved. Thompson previously drew national attention when he was fired a little more than a year ago from the Intercept, an investigative journalism website, for fabricating quotes and misleading colleagues to cover his tracks. In an editor’s note, the publication said Thompson had engaged in “a pattern of deception” and wrote that he created fake email accounts to impersonate people. “We were horrified to learn this morning that Juan Thompson, a former employee of The Intercept, has been arrested in connection with bomb threats against the ADL and multiple Jewish Community Centers in addition to cyberstalking,” Charlotte Greensit, the Intercept’s managing editor, said in a statement Friday. “These actions are heinous and should be fully investigated and prosecuted.” Thompson appeared in federal court Friday wearing handcuffs and leg chains along with a faded blue denim shirt and beige jeans. He was accompanied by a U.S. marshal and a public defender. His mother, along with several other family members and friends, sat in the galley. After the hearing, Thompson was remanded to federal custody. When approached by a reporter, his mother and other relatives declined comment. An FBI spokeswoman said Thompson is not believed to be responsible for all of the threats to Jewish Community Centers across the country. Thompson was arrested in St. Louis, not far from a Jewish cemetery in suburban University City, Mo., where 150 headstones were recently vandalized, but the spokeswoman said agents do not think he is responsible for that incident. Doron Krakow, chief executive of the Jewish Community Center Association of North America, said the group is “gratified” by Thompson’s arrest, though they hope officials will find those responsible for the other threats. “It’s a good thing they got this guy, but this indictment brings us no closer to identifying the source of the broader campaign aimed at Jewish centers, with around 100 threats still unaccounted for, not to mention the numerous incidents of vandalism,” J.M. Berger, a fellow with the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism at The Hague and an expert on extremism, wrote in an email Friday. According to the complaint, after Thompson’s relationship with the woman ended, he began sending defamatory emails and faxes to her workplace, falsely reporting that she was involved in criminal activity and making threats to the Jewish centers in her name. Last year, speaking to the Riverfront Times, an alt-weekly in St. Louis, Thompson disputed the Intercept’s characterization of his firing and said he would “come through on this.” The story described Thompson as a young, handsome journalist who is “maddeningly elusive” and acted cagey when asked for evidence of claims about having cancer and being accepted to law school. The Intercept’s account of Thompson’s fabrications is echoed in the criminal complaint filed Friday. The complaint says that after he and the woman he dated broke up in July 2016, Thompson began emailing and faxing her company defamatory messages about her. In one, for example, a person claiming to be a TV producer for a national news organization said the woman had been pulled over for drunk driving and was being sued for spreading a sexually transmitted disease. The woman also received a series of bizarre texts and emails related to Thompson from someone claiming to be his friend. One said — falsely — that Thompson had been the victim of a robbery and shooting, and was on life support. The woman obtained a protective order against Thompson in August 2016 and renewed it in October and December. Law enforcement confronted Thompson in November 2016, after someone from his IP address reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children that the woman possessed child pornography. A New York police detective eventually got in touch with Thompson — who claimed his email accounts had been hacked — and told him he should not attempt to contact the victim. Attempts to reach the woman Friday were not successful. In the months that followed, Thompson began making threats to Jewish Community Centers, sometimes in the woman’s name and sometimes in his own, though he claimed the woman was trying to frame him, according to authorities. “People can leverage a climate of hate to have much more magnified effect than they otherwise could’ve,” Andrew Rehfeld, president of the Jewish Federation of St. Louis, said in an interview Friday. Thompson seemed to be aware of the news coverage of threats. Using an apparently hacked email address, he sent a message to the Anti-Defamation League in February 2017 saying the woman was “behind the bomb threats against jews. She lives in nyc and is making more bomb threats tomorrow.” The next day, the ADL received a call that said someone would detonate an explosive at the group’s New York headquarters. Police searched and did not find a bomb. Similar threats were relayed in various ways toward Jewish centers in Dallas and San Diego, a Jewish school in Farmington Hills, Mich., as well as the Jewish History Museum in Manhattan. A Jewish school in Manhattan received two separate threats, one of which said Thompson wanted “to create Jewish newtown tomorrow,” a reference to the mass shooting of 20 children at a school in Newtown, Conn. Thompson claimed on Twitter that the woman was stalking and harassing him, and that law enforcement had questioned him unfairly because of her. He also tweeted about the threats, seeming to condemn them. “Another week, another round of threats against Jewish ppl. In the middle of the day, you know who’s at a JCC? Kids. KIDS.” Oren Segal, director of the ADL’s Center on Extremism, said in a conference call with reporters Friday that while he could not speculate about what was in Thompson’s mind, “threatening Jewish institutions is an anti-Semitic act.” The criminal complaint filed in federal court points to his Twitter page, where he rails about an ex-girlfriend he describes as a “nasty/racist #whitegirl.” Thompson’s page also expresses disdain for Trump and white people generally. “White folk are trash,” he wrote in a tweet about the Oscars. He praised black women for their opposition to Trump. “The only person to call Trump a fascist in the #dncdebate is a black woman,” he wrote. “Of course. Black women are the root of left mvmnts.” Earlier this week, Trump condemned the recent anti-Semitic threats and vandalism, his second such condemnation, but in a meeting with attorneys general he also questioned who was behind it. His remarks appearing to suggest that it may have been the work of his political opponents disturbed some of those in the room. Trump said that while the threats were reprehensible, sometimes it’s “the reverse,” according to two attorneys general at the meeting. He also said last month that some bigoted public sentiments could be traced to his opponents and “it won’t be my people,” but will be done to make his supporters look bad. ADL leaders said Friday that law enforcement officials informed them that the arrest was made in the case of a bomb threat against its offices as well as “several other” facilities. “The defendant allegedly caused havoc, expending hundreds of hours of police and law enforcement resources to respond and investigate these threats,” James P. O’Neill, the New York police commissioner, said in a statement. “We will continue to pursue those who peddle fear, making false claims about serious crimes.” Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly recently pledged additional support to Jewish communities after “unacceptable and escalating threats and actual harassment directed at faith-based communities around the country, with a particular focus on threats to Jewish Community Centers.” In a statement, Kelly had said he was directing the agency “to heighten our outreach and support to enhance public safety.” As part of that, a branch of Homeland Security spoke with executive directors of the JCC association to offer more help with training and protective measures, he said. Philadelphia police investigate ‘reprehensible’ toppling of 100 headstones at Jewish cemetery The ADL said Thursay that at least 16 headstones were toppled at a cemetery in Rochester, N.Y., that has been used by the Jewish community there for nearly a century, the third such act of vandalism in recent weeks. “A number of headstones were recently vandalized and toppled over at Waad Hakolel Cemetery in Rochester,” New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) said in a statement. “Given the wave of bomb threats targeting Jewish community centers and disturbing vandalism at Jewish cemeteries nationwide, I am directing the state police to immediately launch a full investigation into this matter.” Julie Tate in Washington and Kurt Shillinger in St. Louis contributed to this report, which has been updated.

Liberal Canadian Parliament Member Iqra Khalid introduced a motion, M-103, to condemn Islamophobia, and to have the House of Commons analyze and create solutions to rising anti-Muslim hatred in the nation. But, according to BuzzFeed News, right-wing sites are curating fake reports of the motion, claiming that Canada will make it illegal to criticize Islam. The motion comes on the heels of the mass shooting in Quebec City where white nationalist Alexandre Bissonnette opened fire at a mosque during evening prayers killing six men. In response to the terrorist attack, over 70,000 Canadians signed a petition to call on the House of Commons to combat the ""notable rise of anti-Muslim sentiment in Canada.""Â Despite the alarming concern of rampant Islamophobia in Canada, the motion was tabled. Nevertheless, anti-Islam and self-described free speech activists have capitalized on the fear ofÂ Muslims to spread false rumors about the motion. Canadian conservative site The Rebel, for example, compared the motion to ""blasphemy laws"" in some repressive theocratic countries. ""Canada is on the verge of passing what amounts to Islamic blasphemy laws,"" the post read. ""If this motion passes, Canadians can be persecuted for expressing any criticism of Islam, even when warranted."" On JihadWatch, American anti-Islam activistÂ RobertÂ Spencer's blog, similar narrativesÂ claimed M-103 would put Canada under sharia law.Â ""Now this 'Islamophobia' motion is inching toward law in Canada, the very real first step toward subjugating Canada under the sharia and a kind of blasphemy law: anyone who articulates the truth about Islam faces legal Sharia penalties, a grave precedent with serious implications for Canada and the West,"" the blog post read. Sharia law is a methodology derived from interpretations of the Quran and the sayings of Prophet Muhammad that Muslims abide in their daily lives. Contrary to public opinion, sharia law is not a set code of laws, but rather a set of religious principles Muslims look to for marriage, finance, health, dietary restrictions etc. Pamela Geller, another prominent U.S. anti-Muslim activist, wroteÂ a blog postÂ with the same trope: Canada is creating a ""sharia state."" Geller suggested that Trump should close the border or build a wall between the United States and Canada. ""To keep his country safe from [Justin] Trudeau's sharia state, President Trump could very well decide to close the border, build a wall among a myriad of other scenario,"" the post read. Khalid is a bit surprised at the dramatic reaction and the amount of fake reports in response to her motion. She laughed off the reports that said she is attempting to infiltrate sharia law into Canada's government.Â ""I would be the first person to oppose a bill or a motion that challenges our multicultural and secular society,"" Khalid toldÂ BuzzFeed News. ""It's quite the opposite. It's about finding peaceful ways that we can live together."" The motion, which the House of Commons is set to debate on Feb. 15, hits close to home for Khalid, who is a young Canadian Muslim woman. For Khalid, the motion is in response to the acts of Islamophobia that have been all too familiar for the Canadian Muslim community. ""When I moved to Canada in the 1990s, a young girl trying to make this nation my home, some kids in school would yell as they pushed me, 'Go home, you Muslim' â but I was home,"" Khalid said. ""I am among thousands of Muslims who have been victimized because of hate and fear."""

Instead, she carried his ashes and her brother's in an urn alongside her bouquet. The urn, not her father, would occupy the empty seat beside her mom. They didn't get to dance to Heartland's ""I Loved Her First,"" a song that made her father's eyes well up with tears when they first heard it. She knew, even then as a child, that they would one day dance to it at her wedding. Instead of having her dad on her arm, she had a heart-shaped piece of his favorite blue shirt sewn into her dress. The wedding, while a celebration, was bittersweet for Lemmer. She struggled to make December's momentous occasion about her and new husband Kyle Lemmer, and not about the two other men she dearly loved who couldn't be there. ""As much as it was beautiful and as much as it was everybody's dream, for me it was kind of like a nightmare,"" she said. ""It's not because it wasn't nice or wasn't pretty. It was everything anyone could ever ask for. It was just not what I had envisioned as a kid."" Two of the people Lemmer wanted most to be there were among six killed Feb. 20, 2016 in a mass shooting. Rich and Tyler Smith were looking at a car in a dealership parking lot when a gunman ambushed and shot them, then drove away. Police say soon after that the Uber driver fatally shot four woman and critically injured 14-year-old Abigail Kopf in a restaurant parking lot off I-94. Hours earlier, he is accused of shooting Tiana Carruthers, who survived, at a townhome complex east of Kalamazoo. Jason Dalton faces six counts of murder, two counts of assault with intent to commit murder and eight felony firearm counts in the shootings. As the anniversary of that horrific day last February approaches, Lemmer and her mother, Laurie Smith, say they still feel like they're living in a fog, like Tyler and Rich could walk through the door at any minute. Lemmer said it feels like forever since she's seen them, but the pain feels like it just happened yesterday. ""When there's that one thing that they should be there for, it breaks your imagination, your imaginative take on the whole situation, and kind of brings you back to reality. Reality's not really something we want to realize,"" she said. ""In the days leading up to it, it just feels like deja vu almost, it feels like everything is happening. I feel like I'm just going to get that call over and over again."" Smith and Lemmer keep mementos of Rich and Tyler with them daily. They both have a pendant that holds their ashes. Smith wears hers on a chain around her neck, hanging close to her heart. She wears Rich's wedding ring around her neck as well. Lemmer wears a bracelet she got her brother for his birthday. The pendant holding his ashes and her father's hangs from her Jeep's rearview mirror, along with Tyler's Mattawan High School Class of 2016 graduation tassels and her father's Pfizer work ID badge. She said she feels closest to them in her Jeep, in which the family spent many summers traversing the Silver Lake Sand Dunes. Ashes of both Rich and Tyler were spread over Sunset Hill, a point in the dunes where Lake Michigan and Silver Lake are visible. ""Even though it's not him, it's a memory,"" Lemmer said of the mementos. ""You hold onto all the memories. Even though the memories hurt, you hold onto them because that's all you have left."" A PAINFUL ANNIVERSARY Smith said she's dreading the anniversary of the shootings, if only because it makes the loss of her husband and son more real. ""I don't want it to be past one year, because it's almost like I have to face reality,"" she said. ""It's been really hard losing a child and added onto that I don't have my soulmate, the person that would normally get through everything. I'm thankful that I still have Emily, but she has her life and I don't want to be the third wheel everywhere. We're very close and we do a lot together."" She tries not to think about the 25th wedding anniversary she and Rich, who was 53, would have celebrated this year. She was sure they would have one day celebrated 50 years together. ""It's really hard that we didn't make it to 25 when I planned on experiencing grandchildren and everything you want to experience,"" she said. ""I try not to think about that, because there are no answers. I try to do what I need to do and focus on other people and what I need to do there."" Smith said she can count on one hand the times she has been grocery shopping since Feb. 20. Something that was once so basic is now hard. ""I still find myself grabbing things that I know that they would have wanted, and then putting them back and not actually grabbing them because no, it's just you,"" she said. She has days when she doesn't cry, and others when she's ""a mess."" She tries to keep busy. She's been instrumental in planning a Forever Strong memorial project that will be unveiled at a community candlelight vigil at Wings Event Center the night of Feb. 20. ""That's really where I think my hope is, is in that,"" Smith said. ""It's kind of rediscovering what my purpose is and I know it's definitely something to do with giving back to others. That's where I find any real joy anymore."" Smith said the community support she and her family have received keeps her going on days she doesn't want to get out of bed. She hears about how Tyler, just 17 when he died, had touched people's lives in ways she didn't even know, like the father who donated a tree in Tyler's name because of how he treated his son. ""It's actually been helpful that the community is so embracing and supportive, because it gives us an expectation that we have to be what they think we are, even though we don't feel strong, or we don't feel inspirational, it helps keep us going and it has over the past year,"" she said. That support has given the family strength as they grapple with not only the loss of their loved ones, but the cold, senseless manner in which they were taken. ""The way they died makes this a million times harder,"" Smith said. ""The fact that (Dalton's) not even remorseful about it."" Lemmer said that's the part that hurts the most. ""What I would kill to have him tell me that he's sorry, even though it wouldn't make the pain go away, but just the fact that he was sorry and it hurt him."" Both Smith and Lemmer were in the courtroom during Dalton's preliminary examination last spring, and say they plan to be there for the trial, which is not yet scheduled. ""I want him to see me. I want him to have to face me,"" Lemmer said. ""I want him to have to look at me and see he left me without a dad. He left me without a brother. He left my unborn baby without a grandpa. He left my unborn baby without an uncle. I will never be an aunt. ""I just want him to know and look at me and realize that he destroyed my life.""

Presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway initially announced the wrong winner, though it wasn't revealed until after the producers of La La Land corralled on stage and began their acceptance speeches. The real best-picture winner, however, was Moonlight. Moonlight, which was nominated for eight other Oscars, is a relative surprise as best picture, considering the momentum La La Land carried throughout awards season. However, Moonlight's nuanced exploration of black masculinity and sexual identity has been hailed by critics. That it ultimately claimed the academy's top honor is emblematic of what Mic's Kevin O'Keeffe previously described as a requirement for best picture: ""choosing the picture that best represents the year."" ""Now more than ever, Moonlight's story is so vital,"" Mic's Jordan Appugliesi wrote in a review of the film. ""As we've seen this year, both the gay and African-American communities were victims of attacks. There was June's mass shooting at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando. There's the Black Lives Matter movement, which calls for an end to the systemic mistreatment of African Americans.Â In a year that has featured so much attention to violence against queer and black people, this movie is all the more vital."" ""There are plenty of films likely to be nominated for best picture this year (Moonlight,Â Fences,Â Hidden FiguresÂ and more) that have purpose beyond escape; they have something to say not just about themselves, or about film, but about the world,"" Mic's Kevin O'Keeffe wrote in December. ""They're grounded in today, whereasÂ La La LandÂ can't stop dreaming about the past.""Â But the real shock of the evening was Beatty's mishap.

919626619,2017-02-14 00:00:00,Friend of San Bernardino Attacker Will Plead Guilty to Supplying Guns - The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/us/san-bernardino-attack-enrique-marquez-jr.html?_r=0,en,False,,1,New York Times,http://nytimes.com,"Advertisement Supported by By Christopher Mele A longtime friend of one of the attackers in the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., has agreed to plead guilty to plotting two unrealized terrorist attacks in the state in 2011 and 2012 and to buying the weapons used in the massacre, federal officials said on Tuesday. The man, Enrique Marquez Jr., was a friend of Syed Rizwan Farook, who, with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, carried out one of the worst terrorist attacks on American soil, killing 14 people and wounding more than 20 others at a social services center. The couple were killed in a shootout with the authorities hours after the attack. Mr. Marquez, 25, of Riverside, Calif., did not participate in the Dec. 2, 2015, attack on the center. He has agreed to plead guilty in federal court on Thursday to conspiring to provide material support to terrorists, including weapons, explosives and personnel, to attack Riverside City College and commuter traffic on a local freeway, the United States attorney’s office for the Central District of California said in a statement. Those attacks were never carried out, but Mr. Marquez discussed with Mr. Farook using radio-controlled improvised explosive devices for the attacks and bought Christmas tree light bulbs and a container of smokeless powder to use in the devices, the statement said. He has also agreed to plead guilty to making false statements as the “straw buyer” of two assault rifles that were used in the San Bernardino shooting, the authorities said. Investigators uncovered evidence that, in 2011 and 2012, Mr. Marquez bought two rifles that Mr. Farook and Ms. Malik used in their attack. According to the plea agreement, Mr. Farook paid Mr. Marquez for the guns. “While his earlier plans to attack a school and a freeway were not executed, the planning clearly laid the foundation for the 2015 attack on the Inland Regional Center,” Eileen M. Decker, the United States attorney for the Central District of California, said in the statement, referring to the social services center. Mr. Marquez, the only person charged in connection with the massacre, faces a maximum sentence of 25 years. His lawyer could not be immediately reached on Tuesday night. Three other people were charged for their roles in a fraudulent marriage designed to skirt immigration laws, offenses that came to light as part of the investigation into the massacre. They pleaded guilty to various charges, which were unrelated to the attack. Tatiana Farook, the sister-in-law of the couple who carried out the attack, pleaded guilty last week to a felony count of conspiracy to commit immigration fraud that included lying to federal agents and in legal documents, officials said. Her husband, Syed Raheel Farook, the brother of Mr. Farook, pleaded guilty last month to conspiring to commit immigration fraud by setting up his Russian sister-in-law, Mariya Chernykh, in a fraudulent marriage to Mr. Marquez. Ms. Chernykh pleaded last month to conspiracy, perjury and two counts of making false statements. Advertisement"

But in the year following, the Kalamazoo community did not falter and instead came together to help one another heal, rallying around the victims and survivors. As over 100 people came to Wings Event Center for a candlelight vigil on the one-year anniversary of the mass shooting, the people of Kalamazoo showed their continued strength. The vigil was led by Rev. Paul Fazio, pastor of North Park Reformed Church, and honored those affected by the actions of one man on the night of Feb. 20, 2016. ""I truly believe that we as a community are an example to the nation and very possibly an example to the world in which we live,"" Fazio said to the crowd Monday evening. ""We are an example of not letting tragedy define us. Kalamazoo is bigger than that. We are an example of not letting darkness win, Kalamazoo is brighter than that."" State Sen. Margaret O'Brien, Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller and Kalamazoo Mayor Bobby Hopewell were among the first speakers. Hopewell said the event should be about more than loss, but also celebration. ""We need to celebrate (the victims). We need to be excited that they were in our lives,"" he said. To the families, Hopewell said: ""We will stand with you today, tomorrow and everyday as you heal, as you journey beyond this crisis, this event, this very sad time,"" Kalamazoo Mayor Bobby Hopewell said. The six victims of the shooting included two groups of people; a father and son shopping for a car and a group of women who were enjoying a night out with dinner and a show. Tyler and Rich Smith of Mattawan were killed in the parking lot of Seelye Kia on Stadium Drive in Kalamazoo. Mary Lou Nye, 62, of Baroda; Mary Jo Nye, 60, Dorothy ""Judy"" Brown, 74, and Barbara Hawthorne, 68, all of Battle Creek, were killed as they sat in two different vehicles in the parking lot of the Cracker Barrel restaurant on South Ninth Street in Texas Township. The group of women had seen a show at Miller Auditorium earlier that evening. Two people left severely injured in the shooting continue to recover. Tiana Carruthers, 25, was shot in the parking lot of Meadows Townhomes, and Abbie Kopf, 14, was shot in one of the vehicles at Cracker Barrel. ""There's nothing that can prepare you for the phone call that we received on the morning of February 21st, 2016,"" Jeff Reynolds, son of Brown said on stage Monday evening as his brother Rob stood by his side. Laurie Smith, the wife and mother of victims Rich and Tyler Smith, thanked all of those who have supported them through the past year. ""I count on you being there, that's what gets me up every day,"" she said. ""The last year has been incredibly difficult and without my family I don't know what I would do,"" Smith said. Alaina Gruizenga, a family friend of the Smith's who was with Laurie Smith the night of the shooting, who was among those to attend Monday night. ""It's definitely a shock that it's already been a year,"" said Gruizenga, of Kalamazoo, said. ""So many people were right there by their (the Smith's) side,"" Gruizenga said of the days, weeks and months following."" U.S. Rep. Fred Upton recalled standing on the floor of the House of Representatives asking colleagues to join in a moment of silence. Upton said Kalamazoo would not the events of Feb. 20 define, divide or defeat the community. ""We cry our hearts off thinking about those victims, senseless tragedy, lives snuffed out, but we're not going to forget them. No we're not. We're going to walk a better step."" Upton was among many speakers to thank police and other first responders who responded that night. ""On that night, they are the ones that searched and scoured and stopped something that could have been more horrific,"" Fazio said. A moment of silence was held for 4 minutes, 42 seconds, to symbolize the 4 hours, 42 minutes that the shooting spree lasted. Following the vigil, the ForeverStrong Memorial Foundation, a new non-profit organization, was to announce a major initiative designed to ""cultivate community strength and solidarity,"" according to a press release. The project will include a permanent memorial to the shooting victims as well all victims of the June 7, 2016, bicycle crash that killed five bicyclists in Kalamazoo County.

583595731,2017-02-20 11:00:49,Editorial: Bring sanity to gun policy for mentally ill,http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/02/20/editorial-bring-sanity-to-gun-policy-for-mentally-ill/,en,False,,35,San Jose Mercury News,http://www.mercurynews.com/,"Trending: Part of the stigma associated with mental illness is the notion that the mentally ill are uniformly dangerous. It doesn’t help that any time there is a mass shooting, the immediate response is the perpetrator must be crazy. This sad lack of knowledge about the mentally ill is perhaps only eclipsed by our lack of understanding of the underlying causes of gun violence. When the two issues collide, the result is legislative mayhem. Last week Republicans brought before the Senate a bill that would revoke an Obama administration regulation preventing individuals with serious mental illness from purchasing guns. The rule, Republicans argue, abridges their constitutional rights. The House had already passed the bill, and the Senate approved it Wednesday. President Trump is expected to sign it into law. Trump should veto the bill, but not out of fears that the mentally ill are a threat to the public. They aren’t. Research shows that 96 percent of the violent acts in the United States are committed by people with no mental illness. Mentally ill people are actually much more likely to be victims of violence than culprits. Trump should veto the bill because those with serious mental illnesses can be a threat to themselves. More than half of all deaths cause by guns are suicides, and those suffering major depression are four times more likely than the general public to kill themselves. An estimated 20 percent of Americans have some form of mental illness. These people can be helped, if legislators would treat the mentally ill with more compassion — and free up more funding to help doctors cure their problems. Medical professionals know that three out of every four people with serious mental illnesses can be successfully treated. What they don’t need is the growing belief that they are responsible for the mass shootings in the United States. Lawmakers can’t hope to get at the root causes of gun violence as long as the Centers for Disease Control fails to conduct policy-informed research on the issue. The CDC stopped its efforts in 1996 when the NRA intimidated Congress into threatening to strip the agency’s funding if it published studies promoting gun control. President Obama tried to reverse the ban following the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting in 2012, but Republicans in the Senate blocked the effort. America is never well served by efforts to block basic scientific research that could inform people  on critical public health issues. Let’s bring sanity to the connection between the mentally ill and gun violence.  Get Morning Report and other email newsletters"

I’ve never used it before, never had any reason to use it, until now. According to the dictionary, it means “the deliberate choice to deny the truth about something because it is too uncomfortable or difficult to accept.” You already know how this works. MONTINI: Flack lies matter (when the attack dog works for Trump) It is President Donald Trump’s secret to success. An inauguration crowd that is larger than his is NOT larger, no matter what the photograph evidence says. Getting beat at the ballot box by over three million votes is the result of illegal immigrant voting for which there is absolutely no proof. An actual judge who rules against him is a ""so-called"" judge who is allowing terrorists into the country, even though no terrorist acts have been committed in the U.S. by people from these countries, and all of them have gone through a roughly two-year vetting process. The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy! And when public opinion polls show sagging popularity numbers and less than enthusiastic support for a travel ban, Trump tweeted: Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting. There you have it. Facts you don’t like are NOT facts. Trump on Monday said the media downplays or ignores terrorist attacks, and the list he provided to “prove” this actually included the Paris attacks that killed 130 people (No coverage there, right?) and the Orlando, Fla., nightclub massacre that killed 49 (What? You heard of that?) and the mass shooting in San Bernardino. The media downplayed them? Ignored them? See how that works? Facts he doesn’t like are NOT facts. Imagine how that would work in your daily life. MORE: What's really driving Trump's media attacks? The fuel gauge in your automobile points to “E” but you won’t allow that to prevent you from believing you can’t make it to Vegas. From Yuma. You have chest pains and your so-called doctor tells you that your “bad” cholesterol is 350 but you won’t let that stop you from ordering the bacon double-cheeseburger. With fries. And a milkshake. The rotten egg smell in your house is overwhelming but you’re unconcerned with fake news about gas leaks and fire up the front burner on the range. A political demigod claims massive voter fraud -- without evidence -- tells easily disproved lies, attacks the media, demonizes immigrants and his political opposition (which he calls “enemies”) and … we elect him."

A stray bullet struck Takiya in the head Saturday night. She was sitting in a parked car with her mother and other relatives. More than two days after the tragic shooting, her cousin, Rachel Williams, said in a social media post that Takiya “passed away in her mother’s arms,” the Tribune reported.  About 30 minutes before Takiya was shot, a bullet also hit Kanari Gentry Bowers, 12, while she played basketball with friends at Henderson Elementary School. A bullet struck Kanari in the head, and she remains unresponsive on life support. “Shooters were aiming at other individuals when the girls were hit by stray rounds,” a Chicago Police spokesman told the Tribune. The shootings happened in a “gang conflict” area, the spokesman added. No one has been arrested.

The names of the victims, who ranged in age from 18 to 50, have now been released. Eddie Sotomayor Jr., 34, was among those killed in the shooting at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando. Sotomayor was a caring, energetic man known for wearing a silly top hat on cruises, said David Sotomayor, who identified himself as the victim's cousin. David Sotomayor, who lives in Chicago, told The Associated Press Sunday that Edward worked for a company that held gay cruises and often traveled to promote the company's events. ""He was just always part of the fun,"" David Sotomayor said. Stanley Almodovar III - 23 The mother of Stanley Almodovar III had prepared a tomato-and-cheese dip for him to eat when he came home from his night out. Instead, Rosalie Ramos was awakened by a call at 2 a.m. Sunday telling her something had happened.

""I wish I had that (video) to remember him forever,"" she told the newspaper. Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo - 20 Ocasio-Capo wanted to be a star. The 20-year-old dancer was working at Starbucks inside a Kissimmee Target store while studying theater, and would have auditioned on Tuesday for a play, said his sister, Belinette Ocasio-Capo. ""He was one of the most amazing dancers,"" she said. ""He would always call me and say, 'I'm going to be the next Hollywood star.' He really did want to make it and be known. Juan Ramon Guerrero - 22 Guerrero had told his cousin Robert Guerrero, that he was gay about two years ago but he was worried about how the rest of his family would react so he did not tell them until just before the beginning of this year. And when he did? ""They were very accepting,"" said Guerrero, 19. ""As long as he was happy, they were OK with it."" Guerrero worked as a telemarketer, according to his cousin. He also had recently started attending college at the University of Central Florida. He was happy in a relationship with a person his relatives came to regard as a member of the family, Robert said. ""He was always this amazing person (and) he was like a big brother to me,"" he said of his cousin. ""He was never the type to go out to parties, would rather stay home and care for his niece and nephew."" Eric Ivan Ortiz-Rivera - 36 Peter O. Gonzalez-Cruz - 22 Gonzalez-Cruz, who worked for UPS, was known among family and friends as ""Ommy."" He was always the life of the party, according to his aunt, Sonia Cruz.

Wilson-Leon's partner of six years, Jean Carlos Mendez Perez, was also killed in the attack. Mercedez Marisol Flores - 26 Flores went to Pulse nightclub almost every weekend, Flores' sister-in-law said Monday, often with her best friend Amanda Alvear. Both women died in the shooting. Born in Queens, New York, the 26-year-old Flores moved to Florida when she was a child, her sister-in-law said. She worked at Target and studied at Valencia College, a local community college. She wanted to become a party planner so she could coordinate events with her two older brothers, who are both DJs.

Aracena-Montero - 26 Enrique L. Rios, Jr. - 25 Rios' Facebook page says he worked with a home health care agency and his mother said he had a heart for helping the elderly. He transferred to St. Francis College in Brooklyn last year where he was studying social work. He was in Orlando to celebrate a friend's birthday. Gertrude Merced says that even though her heart is broken at the death of her 25-year-old son Enrique Rios, she has already forgiven the gunman. Miguel Angel Honorato - 30 Honorato was a father of three, among them a one and two-year-old, 30-year-old. He managed four restaurants in central Florida along with a catering business on the side and was always the one to drop everything to help out his family, which included seven siblings.

Leroy Valentin Fernandez - 25 Fernandez had recently found a job as a leasing agent for an Orlando apartment complex, according to his friend, Jennifer Rodriguez. ""He had finally found something he liked. He was taking care of his mom,"" she said. Fernandez, 25, recently had been dating an older man, a dancer known by the stage name Eman Valentino. That dancer was Xavier Emmanuel Serrano Rosado, 35, who also died and left behind a young son who had graduated from pre-kindergarten earlier this month. List of victims: Orlando nightclub shooting victims' names released Tevin Eugene Crosby - 25 Tevin Eugene Crosby's inspirational posts on Facebook - ""2016 will be the best year ever"" - represented his drive for success.

U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, a Republican of Wisconsin, does not know why this is.Â But in anÂ interview with CNN's Alisyn Camerota, he inadvertently suggested an answer: Islamophobia, coupled with some white supremacy. ""Why isn't the president talking about the white terrorist who mowed down six Muslims who were praying at their mosque?"" Camerota asked.Â ""I don't know, but I would just tell you there's a difference,""Â Duffy replied.Â Conflating the Islamic State with all of Islam, Duffy argued that there have been ""dozens of scenarios where ISIS-inspired attacks have taken innocents,"" whereas the attack by a white man on the Quebec CityÂ Islamic CenterÂ was a ""one-off.""Â It was also the work of pro-Trump, anti-immigrationÂ shooterÂ Alexandre Bissonnette, whose classmatesÂ described himÂ as an ""ultra-nationalist white supremacist"" and who became very involved with the far right online.Â In defining terror attacks, the White HouseÂ recently omittedÂ those committed by white supremacists. But that doesn't mean that violent white extremists don't exist, and it doesn't mean that white people don't commit broad-scale violent crimes. Statistically, mass shooters tend to be male and white, if not necessarily extremists, and very rarely motivated by ""radical Islam.""Â There are plenty of examples of racially motivated terrorism from the far right, though: There's the 65-year-old white man who attempted toÂ coordinate the bombingÂ of a New York mosque in 2015. There are the right-wing extremistsÂ formingÂ militiasÂ andÂ arming themselves for a violent struggle against Muslims.Â There's the anti-Semitic white supremacist who, in 2014,Â shot up a Jewish community centerÂ in Kansas and killed three.Â There's also the neo-Nazi gunman who, in 2012, killed six people worshipping at a Sikh temple in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. One might think that Duffy would remember the incident, seeing as it happened in his own state fewer than four years ago, but one would apparently be wrong.Â And then, there's Dylann Roof, the 22-year-old who wasÂ recently sentenced to death for opening fire on worshipers at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina in 2015. He killed nine people, and he did it ""because he felt like he had to do it,"" Roof said at trial. Because he was completely convinced that black people represented a threat to white people. After Camerota drew a parallel between the Quebec City shooting and the Charleston shooting, Duffy painted the latter as a vehicle for positive change â the confederate battle flag was removed from South Carolina's state house, he said. Ultimately, DuffyÂ concluded that ""there's no constant thread that goes through these attacks.""Â There is. It's white extremism. So glad we've cleared that up.

          / CBS News NEW YORK -- Gunmen opened fire on the Inland Regional Center in San Bernadino, California killing at least 14 and wounding more than a dozen others Wednesday. The center usually has security employed at the entrance to the building and requires people to show their badges before they enter, but security at the facility's conference center isn't as tight when the center is rented out for parties or events, Sheela Stark, an employee of the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino says. That was apparently the case Wednesday when at least two shooters entered the facility's conference center, which was hosting a banquet for the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health, and opened fire. Stark, who was watching television to find familiar faces at the scene after trying to reach out to more than dozen coworkers, had only been able to reaching one. Sally Abdelmageed, who works at the Inland Regional Center told CBS News' Scott Pelley she was shocked that the center had become the site of the deadliest mass shooting since the Newtown, Connecticut, massacre that left 26 adults and children dead in 2012. Here's a look at center and the work they do: The Inland Regional Center is a non-profit organization that has been serving people with developmental disabilities for 44 years, according their website According to their Facebook page, the Inland Regional Center works to ""eliminate barriers for individuals with developmental disabilities and their families so they can closely live a typical lifestyle."" The organization serves people of all age groups by offering different support based on need and age and say that their ""core values are independence, inclusion and empowerment."" The Inland Regional Center's most recent posts on social media show a joyous holiday party held just Tuesday. On both Twitter and Facebook the center posted photos of Santa meeting with some of the guests. The ICF Holiday Party is in full swing and SANTA is in the house! SANTA! This post on Inland Regional's Facebook page shows staff members and the people they serve the holiday party: This photo is from last year's CAC Winter Dance! This year's event is happening THIS Friday! Details here: http://inlandrc.org/event/winter-dance-for-irc-consumers/  The Inland Regional Center employs nearly 670 staff members and provides assistance to more than 30,000 individuals in Southern California, according to its Facebook page. The complex is spread across multiple buildings. Staff members work to coordinate services for people who are developmentally disabled  in order to simplify the process and ensure that their clients receive all the services that are available to them. Staff members work with closely state agencies and other non profits to ensure the people who use their services live the fullest lifestyle available to them.

Benjamin Thomas Samuel McDowell, 29, of Conway, S.C., was arrested Wednesday on a federal weapons charge after the Justice Department said he attempted to illegally purchase a handgun from an undercover FBI agent in January. McDowell served prison time for a felony burglary conviction in 2011, making it illegal for him to own a gun.
Advertisement Prosecutors said in a federal court filing McDowell was plotting an attack on the Temple Emanu-El Conservative Synagogue and said he wanted to spray paint ""in the spirit of Dylann Roof"" on the building after the attack, as an ode to the massacre Roof carried out inside a black church that killed nine people in Charleston in 2015. Investigators said McDowell first met the undercover FBI agent posing as a member of the Aryan Nation prison gang at a hotel in Myrtle Beach in January, when he solicited the officer's help in obtaining a gun. During the meeting, McDowell allegedly stated his desire to honor Roof by carrying out a similar mass shooting, this time targeting Jews.
Advertisement McDowell was charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm and/or ammunition. He is being held at the J. Reuben Long Detention Center where he is awaiting a preliminary court appearance on Tuesday."

Two days after the White House released a list of what it called 78 “underreported terror attacks” — an effort to back up President Donald Trump’s comment that the media has been ignoring terrorism across the globe — a prominent Jewish leader who defended Trump’s campaign told POLITICO in an interview that he was dismayed by what he took to be a glaring omission. “I am deeply perplexed as to how the administration put out a statement on terror attacks that haven't been reported without Israel being on that list,” Mort Klein, national president of the Zionist Organization of America, said in an interview on Thursday. “It's painful and perplexing — especially on top of the Holocaust gaffe.” ZOA is funded in a large part by Adelson, who has a close relationship with Trump and is reportedly dining at the White House with the president on Thursday. Klein last year defended former Breitbart chairman Steve Bannon against charges of anti-Semitism. He is also supportive of Trump’s pick for ambassador to Israel, David Friedman. By NOLAN D. MCCASKILL and MATTHEW NUSSBAUM But Klein said he wants answers. “Although it’s painful, what's important are the policies toward Israel,” Klein said. “It's not important in the scheme of things, but I would like someone to explain it to me because I don't get it. No country has had more terror attacks than Israel. Obviously many of them are not covered because it’s almost impossible to cover them all.” The hastily prepared list — White House press secretary Sean Spicer said on Tuesday that it was assembled after Trump's comment on Monday — included well-covered attacks like the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, and the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, last year, which killed 49 people. It also excluded major massacres abroad, like the 145 civilians who were killed in Kobani, Syria, in 2015. Klein has taken pains to defend Trump in the past. But his criticism of the administration marks the second time in two weeks that he has broken ranks to voice concern about how the White House is talking about Israel and the Jewish people. After the Trump administration released a statement commemorating Holocaust Remembrance Day that made no mention of Jews, Klein, the son of Holocaust survivors, said in a statement that he felt “chagrin and deep pain at President Trump” for “omitting any mention of anti-Semitism and the six million Jews who were targeted and murdered by the German Nazi regime and others.” By NOLAN D. MCCASKILL, LOUIS NELSON and ISAAC ARNSDORF Since then, the administration has doubled and tripled down on the statement. Spicer accused reporters who asked about the omission of ""nitpicking,"" and earlier this week, White House aide Sebastian Gorka said in a television interview that criticism of the statement was “asinine” and “absurd.” The White House did not respond to a request for comment about Klein’s comments or why Israel was not included in the list.

We’re trying to make America great again”,http://www.salon.com/2017/03/04/the-golden-state-of-hate-i-do-not-need-to-serve-you-anymore-we-are-trying-to-make-america-great-again_partner/,en,False,,1757,Salon,http://www.salon.com/,"This article originally appeared on Capital & Main. The reports began filtering in on election night. At the Southern California offices of the Counsel of American-Islamic Relations, CAIR’s civil rights monitors received their first call within hours of Donald Trump’s victory. A Muslim woman wearing the traditional hijab headscarf reported being refused service at a gas station by an attendant who allegedly announced, “I don’t need to serve you anymore. We’re trying to make America great again.” And a widely shared Facebook post from friends of a Calgary film producer showed a graphic photo of the man, who was bloodied outside a Santa Monica bar, allegedly for being gay, immediately after watching election returns with a date as raucous patrons shouted to the pair, “We have a new president, faggot!” The new president’s rhetoric has been implicated in a flurry of incidents throughout the state, dating back to June of 2015, when he first announced his White House bid amid a blare of anti-Mexican and anti-Muslim vitriol, a tone maintained throughout a campaign that, according to CAIR, effectively mainstreamed Islamophobia in the United States. Balmeet Singh is neither a Muslim nor an immigrant, but a member of Bakersfield’s large Sikh community and sports the full beard and distinctive turban that is mandatory dress for religiously observant Sikh men. He was born in Ohio to South Asian parents and moved with his family to Kern County as a child. During the final stretch of the election campaign, the 31-year-old Bakersfield realtor got a first-hand taste of the fear and public humiliation that an increasing number of Californians are experiencing in the age of Trump. On the evening of Sept. 30, 2016, Singh was having dinner at a Habit Burger restaurant in a West Park commercial strip mall when he stepped out to a patio dining area to take a phone call from his cousin. “He turned 14 that day,” Singh recalled in a phone call to Capital & Main. “And so here I am, wishing him a happy birthday, having a long conversation with him, when out of the corner of my eye [I saw] a Caucasian man approach and he started yelling at me, telling me that I was a terrorist, that I was going to blow up the country.” Confused, Singh said he stared uncomprehendingly as the bearded and tattooed man repeated the words, adding, “I should fucking kill you right now.” Instead, said Singh, the man threw his drink at him, soaking Singh’s turban and clothes as nearby diners watched. “I felt the adrenaline rush, the fight or flight,” Singh remembered. “I actually told him that I would call the police, and I stepped towards him . . . and had actually dialed 911, and I think that’s why he walked away.” Fortunately, the cup contained nothing more lethal than a cold beverage, and Singh was able to give the police a description of the assailant along with his vehicle make and license plate number. But it was little consolation, given the shock of what had just happened. Most painful, he said, is the memory of what didn’t happen. “They just sat there,” Singh said incredulously of the other diners. “I don’t know if this was the bystander effect or what, but none of them said or did anything. . . . That was painful because my cousins were inside the Habit Burger, so I had to walk inside afterwards past all of these people who had just seen what happened. They are talking and laughing and having a good time, and here I am, dripping this liquid and in shock.” A December report by the Southern Poverty Law Center had California leading the nation in post-election hate incidents, tallying 125 for the state in the month following Nov. 8. The center also recorded a dramatic surge in the number of U.S. anti-Muslim hate groups, which nearly tripled in 2016 over its tally for 2015 — a year that itself saw a 67 percent jump in hate crimes against Muslims across the country. A CAIR spokesperson told Capital & Main that November and December alone saw reports coming into its office of anti-Muslim incidents in Los Angeles and Orange County roughly triple that of pre-election monthly averages. Some of those 2016 California incidents include: The true numbers are likely higher. According to CAIR, because of the climate of fear surrounding the administration’s ramped up deportations and Trump’s executive order barring refugees and entry by citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, those most vulnerable to hate violence also tend to be reticent when it comes to reporting incidents to police or speaking to the media. The man who targeted Balmeet Singh turned out to be 40-year-old David Hook of Bakersfield, who later claimed that he had heard Singh “say something about a bomb” during the cell call and confronted him about it. Hook insisted he had a constitutional right to take direct action against Singh, believing that “If you see something, say something.” The Kern County District Attorney’s office, however, was unconvinced and charged Hook with two hate crime misdemeanors, including one count of interference with the exercise of a civil right and one count of battery. (Attempts to reach Hook for comment were unsuccessful.) For his part, Singh, who formerly taught special education, thought there was a learning opportunity to be had. Since 9/11, he noted, the country’s Sikh community has increasingly found itself at risk in similarly mistaken and sometimes far more tragic hate attacks. And so Singh arranged with the DA’s office for a 15-minute face-to-face with his attacker, believing that the dialogue and perspective could result in something positive. But Hook was not open to persuasion. “There was no remorse,” Singh admitted. “He basically told me that he didn’t want to see me again and that he was a military veteran. He said, ‘I have served the country, what have you done?’ He was just yelling this stuff over and over.” On the positive side, Singh was inundated with hopeful messages on social media, and Bakersfield residents stepped forward with an outpouring of support, including an anonymous delivery of flowers to his realty office with a card that read, “Just remember: Bakersfield is better than this. We’re not all like that.” Still, the experience has been sobering. Recalling his father, who came to the United States in the 1980s with $200 in his pocket, a medical degree and a desire to have a better life than the one he left behind in India, Singh reflected on the rising levels of fear, mistrust and misunderstanding that he fears have tarnished the American dream. “Maybe I am a little naive in thinking that every story has a happy ending or thinking that people will change,” he said. “I see what’s happening here and [my father] talks about how America is different from the America that he remembers in the ’80s when he came. It seems that this hatred was maybe not as open — at least on a public level — by politicians and by leaders. It does affect everyone. I was speaking to a schoolteacher here, who said that in his school, kids were walking down the hallway chanting, ‘Build the wall, build the wall!’ These are the values that we are now instilling on our children.”  Copyright © 2021 Salon.com, LLC.

Texan Michael Berry mocks Chicago homicide victims in his regular feature, ""Chicago Weekend Crime Report,"" which includes a shooting victim bingo game in which listeners are supposed to guess where in the body victims were shot. ""He won't have to live with that name anymore,"" Berry chortled not long after 14-year-old Tyjuan Poindexter was the unintended and blameless victim of a September 2015 drive-by shooting. ""At least they're not indiscriminately firing at black people,"" Berry added. ""At least they're saying, 'Are those the black people, because we want to make sure we get the right ones?' even if they didn't."" Media Matters, a liberal media-monitoring organization that tracks conservative media, wrote about Berry online this week, and provided the Tribune with 10 clips from his shows. Those clips and others found online suggest that riffing on the fatal shootings of Chicagoans, particular African-Americans, is a routine part of the white 46-year-old former Houston council member's shtick. He refers to the segment as his ""Butcher's Bill"" and has been successful enough to have scored a 2015 interview with President Donald Trump, and to have become the nation's 16th highest-rated radio talker by the trade magazine, Talker. Berry, who has been a big supporter of U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and counts Confederate Army Gen. Robert E. Lee among his heroes, last week said on air that he had won the award, saying ""to be named the top radio personality in the country is rather humbling."" He added that he was grateful to have an employer that gave him ""room"" and that didn't tell him ""this is offensive — I don't like this."" He also tweeted last week that he was ""honored to be named top talk radio personality by @iHeartRadio nationally in the 1st award for this. It's a testament to our team and listeners."" Talker magazine also reported the award, which it said would be given to Berry in a televised ceremony Sunday in Los Angeles. But Berry and his producer did not respond to calls from the Chicago Tribune this week. Nor did bosses at Berry's Houston station, KTRH, nor did representatives of its parent company, iHeartMedia, which was formerly known as Clear Channel and owns 800 stations nationwide, including Chicago-based black music station WGCI-FM 107.5, as well as the iHeartRadio brand that Berry says will honor him. Berry, who has referred to Chicago as ""Thuglandia"" and makes frequent sarcastic references to a black character he calls ""Pookie"" and the character's run-ins with the ""po-po,"" has been making Chicago gags for at least a year and a half, accompanied by the ""Peter Gunn"" theme from ""The Blues Brothers."" Though his show is syndicated in cities across the South, in New York and in Oregon, and is available online, it is not broadcast by any Chicago stations. That's not surprising. Less than two weeks ago, on Feb. 20, Berry joked that a bullet wound to a 30-year-old Chicago man's right leg would ensure ""he will never be a professional field goal kicker."" And, in a more serious segment Jan. 23, he faulted residents of crime-ridden Chicago communities for not doing more to root out crime. The ""hood rats driving through the hood shooting people up"" are ""the least of their worries,"" he said. ""They're afraid, they're scared of Donald Trump, of white police officers? Please!"" And in an earlier show, he jokingly compared the killing of a 17-year-old Chicagoan in the back seat of a car to a scene in ""Pulp Fiction."" ""I'm calling the Wolf!"" he said, referring to the Harvey Keitel character who cleans up murder scenes in the Quentin Tarantino movie. ""If there is one thing you should learn from all this,"" he added, ""it's that black lives matter, just not to black people."" Media Matters' guns and public safety program director, Tim Johnson, said that, even by the debased standards of talk radio, Berry's comments about crime victims are ""reprehensible."" ""If he was mocking the victims of a public mass shooting that makes national headlines instead of these very vulnerable people, advertisers would flee his show and he would be fired,"" Johnson said. kjanssen@chicagotribune.com Twitter @kimjnews CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"

D. James’s Still-Haunting Vision in Children of Men Why China Is Winning the War for High Tech In Defense of Citizenship An op-ed titled “How Microaggressions Lead to Mass Shootings” appeared in the official student newspaper of Quebec’s Concordia University on Tuesday, asking people to think about how their insensitive remarks might be leading to murder. In the piece, student Florence Lee argues that since “racial violence builds itself on top of its smaller forms,” everyone shares responsibility for events like the January shooting at the mosque in Quebec City. Yep, Lee says, stuff like that all starts with a microaggression — which she defines as “a comment or action that is subtly and often unintentionally hostile or demeaning to a member of a minority or marginalized group.” According to Lee, subtle, “unintentionally” mean comments “alienate people and subconsciously start to form an insidious divide,” which then leads to “prejudice” and “overgeneralizations,” which then leads to “discrimination,” which then ultimately leads to murder. “In this whole process, there has been an abuse of so-called freedom of speech,” Lee writes in the Concordian. “If you think about it as ‘just political correctness’ or ‘limiting freedom of expression,’ I hope you also think about your part in inciting race-based violence in direct and inevitable ways. “Please consider your role in the ongoing tensions,” Lee continues. “You may not have fired the gun, but you helped load the bullets.” Okay, Lee. I did “consider” it, and have come to the conclusion that I, in fact, have had nothing to do with any mass shooting of any kind — not to brag! The truth is, people kill people for all kinds of reasons. Yes, some attacks are racially motivated. Sometimes, they happen because a cheating wife wants to spend her husband’s life-insurance money on a new life with her new lover. There has even been some speculation that the Muslim student who stabbed his classmates at Ohio State University did so because an anti-microaggressions class convinced him that he was being victimized by white people. It’s obviously never okay to murder, and we obviously should do all we can to stop people from murdering, but I’m pretty sure that telling people that even the slightest, most accidental missteps in their speech are causing murders is not the way to go about that. Why? Because that’s crazy. I’ve faced microaggressions. Hell, I’ve faced full-on aggressions, and do you know how many people I’ve murdered? Zero. Do you know how many people I’m planning on murdering? Zero. Why? Well, because I’m not a deranged psychopath, and that’s how us not-a-deranged-psychopaths do things. If you want to talk about how it’s bad to say mean things to people, then fine. If you want to talk about how racism is bad, then fine. I’d agree with both of those things. But responding to thoughtful concerns about how political correctness might hinder free speech with a simple, “Well, but if you’re not politically correct enough, then people will die” is not making a legitimate, well-reasoned argument — and it’s a great way to get people to stop taking you seriously.

Tuesday, 07 February 2017 08:41 AM The White House released a list of 78 terror attacks that it said the media did not cover sufficiently, starting in September 2014, according to The Washington Post. On Monday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters traveling on Air Force One that some terror attacks were ""underreported."" He made the comment in response to President Donald Trump's claim earlier that day at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida that the ""very, very dishonest press"" had not reported on a number of attacks, according to The Hill. ""The real point here is that these terrorists' attacks are so pervasive at this point that they do not spark the wall-to-wall coverage they once did,"" White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said, according to The Post. Some of the attacks on the list did draw intensive coverage, such as the San Bernardino terror attack in December 2015 in which U.S. citizen Syed Rizwan Farook and wife Tashfeen Malik killed 14, as well as the June 2016 massacre at LGBTQ nightclub Pulse in Orlando in which 49 were killed. Several times on the list, the words ""attacker"" is misspelled as ""attaker,"" according to The Post. Denmark is spelled ""Denmakr"" on the list, as well. The list does not contain any attacks in Israel, such as the knife attacks in 2015 and 2016 that terrorized residents there. Also not on the list: White supremacist Dylann Roof's mass shooting at an African-American church in Charleston, SC in June 2015 or a Planned Parenthood clinic shooting in November 2015. Eleven of the attacks on the list happened in the U.S. The rest occurred in Afghanistan, Algeria, Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Bosnia, Britain, Canada, Chad, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Indonesia, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Tunisia, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates, according to The Post. On CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360,"" Monday night, Cooper pointed out that he covered many of the incidents on the list in person. Story continues below video.  ""We covered them heavily. I know, because I was on the ground reporting them,"" Cooper said about a number of the attacks on the list.  © 2021 Newsmax. All rights reserved. Newsmax, Moneynews, Newsmax Health, and Independent.

932705464,2017-02-06 18:24:40,A Gun Maker Reveals What Trump's Presidency Means For His Business,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestreptalks/2017/02/06/a-gun-maker-reveals-what-trumps-presidency-means-for-his-business/#7bd5814b16a9,en,False,,1104,Forbes,http://www.forbes.com/,"At Daniel Defense, a Black Creek, GA-based manufacturer of AR-15 semi-automatic rifles and accessories, founder Marty Daniel saw sales spike last year when it looked like Hillary Clinton would win the presidency. Though he supports Donald Trump, his customers aren’t buying as many firearms now that they have a National Rifle Association supporter in the White House. But Daniel, 54, sees a promising long-term future for gun makers. He’s weathered sales surges and dips since he founded the company in 2001 after inventing a custom attachment for his Colt rifle and selling extra pieces online. At a 2002 gun show, he was discovered by a rep for U.S. Special Forces, which wound up signing a $20 million contract. Daniel Defense has since grown into one of the country’s largest privately held producers of guns and accessories, with $73 million in 2016 sales, a gross profit margin of 35% and 279 employees. In this interview, which has been edited and condensed, he describes building the company, how news and politics affect gun sales, and where he sees his business going under President Trump. Susan Adams: Did you always want to be an entrepreneur? Marty Daniel: In college I was more into beer drinking than studying. I flunked out and my mom got me a job in a saw mill. After six months of that, I went back to school but I didn’t learn my lesson and I flunked out again. I even got a letter saying, don’t re-apply. I went back to the saw mill for a year and somehow talked my way back into school. I made the dean’s list after the first quarter and ended up graduating with a degree in electrical engineering and technology. I didn’t want to work in a saw mill for the rest of my life. Adams:  What kind of career did you want? Daniel: My college roommate had started a business with his dad and he asked me to buy his dad out. I borrowed $25,000 from his father and became his partner. We built replacement storm windows and then we moved into the garage door business. I bought my partner out in 1993. Adams: How did garage doors lead to guns? Daniel: I was complaining about my golf game one day and a friend said, let’s take up shooting. I had hunted growing up but I’d never done target shooting. That’s where I was introduced to the kind of gun we sell now, the AR-15. Adams: How did you turn your hobby into a business? Daniel: I wanted something called a flat top upper that would allow me to mount a scope on the gun. In 2001 I started calling around to find a manufacturer. But to get the four I needed, I had to buy 100. I set up a website to sell the other 96. I bought the pieces for around $100 each and sold them for $130. Adams: How did you come up with that price? Daniel: I just pulled it out of the air. Adams: How did you go from selling parts online to a full-fledged company? Daniel: I developed a rail system where I could mount other accessories on the gun, like lights, lasers and rangefinders. I also hired a patent attorney to make sure I wasn’t stepping on anyone’s patents. I sold the rails for six or eight months, and then went to a gun show in Orlando where a contractor from Special Forces walked up to me and said he was looking for civilian providers who could provide new and innovative products for the government. We bid on the contract and won it. Adams: How much was the contract worth? Daniel: Twenty million dollars. That contract has been renewed and we’ve gotten other contracts. Adams: How did you feel about winning that contract? Daniel: Very excited. The garage-door business was limited to how far you could drive. I could sell gun parts all over the world. This was 2003, after 9/11, and I was motivated to provide products for our soldiers. I thought it was really cool, that I could help them come home safely. Adams: What was your next big break? Daniel: In 2007 the U.K. was looking for rail systems for their military rifles and we won the contract. Adams: When did you become profitable? Daniel: We were profitable every year. We didn’t have any backing so we had to make money from day one. But my wife and I kept working in the garage door business and we didn’t draw a paycheck from the gun business until 2008. The housing market was crashing. We would have gone broke if we didn’t have the gun business. Adams: What was it like to compete with big gun manufacturers like Colt and Smith & Wesson? Daniel: I’ve had conversations with people there and they’re happy for us because we’re still in a niche. Their goal is to sell volumes of firearms. Adams: How difficult was it to make the transition to manufacturing whole guns? Daniel: It was an uphill climb. We bought a machine called a hammer forge that forms steel into a barrel but we didn’t have any idea how to operate the beast. At the time it was overwhelming. But we thought making guns was the way to grow our business. Adams: What are the economics of gun manufacturing like? Daniel: In any manufacturing business, if you can make 30% gross profit or better and do enough volume to cover your overhead, you can be successful. The challenges are cash, people, space and know-how. A big issue is cash because it takes a lot of money to build a manufacturing plant. Adams: Where do you manufacture? Daniel: We have a plant in Ridgeland, SC and a plant in Black Creek, GA. We’re building a new 300,000-square-foot plant in Black Creek and we’re going to be moving everything there in September. Adams: What percentage of your sales are to governments vs. shops or consumers? Daniel: Last year 90% of our sales were to consumers. Adams: Can you sell online? Daniel: We can but because of background checks, the sale still has to go through a gun store. Also we don’t want our dealers and distributors to feel like we’re using their supply to sell directly to a consumer. Adams: What’s your marketing strategy? Daniel: We’ve done some TV, a lot of magazine advertising and a lot of gun shows. We also have relationships with prop houses and celebrities and our guns have been featured in movies. Adams: Do the movies help sales? Daniel: Not that much. Hollywood in general is anti-Second Amendment. It’s amazing how many celebrities use guns in their movies and also speak out against guns. Adams: Which celebrities do you know? Daniel: Steven Segal. We love him and he loves the Second Amendment. Adams: What happened when you tried to run a Super Bowl ad? Daniel: We were going to spend $400,000 to target five big local markets with a 30-second commercial that showed a soldier coming home from war and wanting to protect his family. But the Super Bowl has to approve the ad. We couldn’t show a firearm in the commercial even though there were five or six Super Bowl commercials for upcoming TV shows that were full of guns. Adams: But those shows aren’t trying to sell guns. Daniel: I get that we’re trying to sell guns but we didn’t show an actual firearm. We showed a silhouette at the very end that had a gun in it. Fox rejected the ad but we went on Fox and Friends and ended up getting a lot of media out of it. Adams: Why were your sales up in 2013 and then down in 2014? Daniel: The mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012 drove a lot of sales. That was a horrible event and we don’t use those kinds of terrible things to drive sales but when people see politicians start talking about gun control, they have this fear and they go out and buy guns. Adams: What about common-sense gun control proposals like closing the gun-show loophole? How would such a measure affect your business? Daniel: Terms like “common sense” come from people whose only goal is to take our guns away. There is no gun show loophole. Every licensed dealer has to follow the law. Adams: But unlicensed private dealers sell at gun shows and they don’t have to do background checks. Daniel: Those transactions happen at shows, outside of shows and on Craigslist and between friends. They don’t affect our business. Adams: How did Hillary Clinton’s candidacy affect your sales? Daniel: Mrs. Clinton was definitely aiming to take away gun rights. People overbought out of fear that they would not be able to buy guns in the future. If she had been elected our business would be going through the roof right now. We’d be doubling in size. Adams: Were you at all disappointed when she lost? Daniel: No. I’m more interested in conserving our gun rights than making a dollar. Adams: What does the Trump presidency mean for your business? Daniel: We are very much relieved in the long term. We know that 10 or 20 years down the road we’re going to remain in business. But we’ll see a little bit of a down cycle compared to the last few years. It will take about a year for the market to correct. Adams: Did you support Trump’s candidacy from the beginning? Daniel: I voted for Ted Cruz in the primary because I was trying to figure out who had the best chance to beat Hillary Clinton. But I was 100% behind Donald Trump once he got the nomination. He’s absolutely good on guns. Also he’s the first president who isn’t a politician or who came out of the military. We talk about this great democratic process and this great experiment with self-government but we’ve never experimented with having a businessman president. Adams: What’s the biggest challenge you face? Daniel: Working through the slow market and continuing to build our brand. There were a lot of people in the gun business who were for Donald Trump but were planning on Hillary Clinton. We had a Trump plan and a Clinton plan. We’re fortunate that instead of being overstocked we’re still understocked because our brand is still growing faster than our ability to produce.

But there was a time when he had gay friends, a high school classmate says. FORT PIERCE, Florida — Years before he shot up an Orlando gay club in what became the largest mass shooting in American history, Omar Mateen regularly picked up lunch from a drag queen at Ruby Tuesday. He may have even gone to see a drag show or two, a former high school classmate told The Daily Beast. About 10 years ago, Mateen, a few years out of high school, was working at the supplement store GNC. Samuel King, a year ahead of him in high school, was working next door at the restaurant chain. Mateen was a few years out of playing football in high school while King, who is openly gay, had long, flowing extensions, and prettier hair than most of his female co-workers. “He always had a smile on his face,” King told The Daily Beast on Sunday. “Maybe it’s because he was working in customer service.” After seeing the trending news story about the Orlando shooting, King posted his disbelief on Facebook. “I can’t believe i knew this dude…. He worked at GNC at the treasure coast mall when i was at Ruby Tuesday’s and he Graduated from the same high school in 2004,” he wrote. “He was a jokester and at the time didn’t have an issue with the LGBT community.” Mateen’s father told NBC News that Mateen “got angry when he saw two men kissing in Miami a couple of months ago” and that he “thought that might be related to the shooting.” But King saw none of that homophobia. Quite the opposite: He said Mateen knew that he and many of his co-workers at Ruby Tuesday were gay, and didn’t seem to have a problem with it. “That’s the thing that’s pinning me to the wall the most, that it was a gay nightclub,” King said. “Because he would come into the [the restaurant] and laugh with us. “He might’ve even sat down at the bar and had a drink and laughed with the bartenders, knowing that they were lesbians,” King added. These interactions shed new light on a man believed to be motivated by blind hatred for gay people. By the end of his rampage, Mateen had killed 49 people and wounded 53 others in the most deadly terror attack on U.S. soil since 9/11. During his attack on a sea of dancing young men, Mateen called 911 and pledged allegiance to the leader of ISIS, announcing himself as a terrorist and mentioning the Boston marathon attackers. Yet if Mateen was a religious extremist, King didn’t know it, and the topic of religion never came up in conversations. Instead, the two men would greet each other on the street. King likely showed him, like the rest of the employees and regulars, photos in full costume from his performances. “I can’t pinpoint a date that he went with us, but he probably gone there with us once,” he said. Syed Shafeeq Rahman, Imam at the Islamic Center in Fort Pierce where Mateen worshipped, said he had been a sunny child who enjoyed skipping but something had changed in recent years. “He would not talk to anybody, but would just smile,” he said. Recent co-workers described Mateen’s demeanor as aggressive and anti-gay. Daniel Gilroy, who worked with Mateen at the security company G4S, told Florida Today that he was “unhinged and unstable.” “I quit because everything he said was toxic, and the company wouldn’t do anything,” Gilroy told the news outlet. “This guy was unhinged and unstable. He talked of killing people.” He said Mateen stalked him with dozens of text messages a day, but the company didn’t take action because Mateen was Muslim. “When I saw his picture on the news, I thought, of course, he did that,” fellow security guard Eric Baumer told Newsday. “He had bad things to say about everybody—blacks, Jews, gays, a lot of politicians, our soldiers. He had a lot of hate in him. He told me America destroyed Afghanistan.” Indeed, it was a co-worker’s tip that set off an FBI investigation into the man in 2013. “The FBI first became aware of him in 2013 when he made inflammatory comments to co-workers alleging possible terrorist ties,” Ronald Hopper, an assistant agent in charge of the FBI’s Tampa division, said at a press conference. The ties were unconfirmed. The following year, the agency investigated his potential links to an American suicide bomber in Syria, Moner Abu-Salha, but found the connections negligible. Mateen was still able to purchase both weapons he brought to the attack legally last week, according to Trevor Velinor, an assistant special agent in charge of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Tampa. Mateen had worked at G4S since 2007, and cleared their security checks when he was hired and again in 2013. The company said they were made aware that Mateen had been questioned by the FBI in 2013 and knew that the investigations had closed. “We were not made aware of any alleged connections between Mateen and terrorist activities, and were unaware of any further FBI investigations,” G4S communications director Monica Lewman-Garcia told The Daily Beast in a statement. Mateen had a gun because of his work as a security officer. G4S provides guards to more than two dozen juvenile detention centers in Florida, and Mateen’s ex-wife told The Washington Post that he’d worked at one such facility near their Fort Pierce home. A spokesperson at the St. Lucie Regional Juvenile Detention Center directed queries about Mateen to the State of Florida Department of Juvenile Justice. The agency directed inquiries to G4S, which did not return requests for comment. But the company’s employees have been accused of abusing children in the centers where they work. A male Palmetto Youth Academy guard was arrested in 2014 on charges that he sexually assaulted two teenage boys, ages 15 and 17. A judge set his bond at $250,000, but the disposition of the case remains unclear. A female employee in Tampa was accused of engaging in sex acts with a boy that same year. “I’m amazed at the amount of violence that goes on over there, both against staff and other inmates,” Assistant State Attorney Vicki Nichols, Martin County Florida’s juvenile prosecutor, told the Scripps Treasure Coast Newspapers of one facility that employs G4S guards. Residents of Mateen’s quiet neighborhood, made up largely of retirees, construction workers, and families with toddlers, were shocked by news of his rampage on Sunday. The Woodland Condominium complex where he lived was roped off with yellow police tape as the FBI and local authorities investigated the gunman’s residence. The area has many Hispanic immigrants, residents gathered outside the complex said, but doesn’t have a large Middle Eastern or Muslim community. Esmeralda Gonzalez, whose parents live adjacent to the gunman’s parents said that she hadn’t seen Omar but his father “seems really nice.” “You see it in the news and all the sudden it happens right next to you.  My mom is scared and wondering if they should sell the house,” she told The Daily Beast. Mateen’s father Seddique Mir Mateen did appear to have extreme views, however. In videos on his YouTube channel he has previously paid tribute to the Afghan Taliban. Early Monday, he posted a new video in which he described his “sadness” over the death of his son. “I did not know and did not understand that he has anger in his heart,” he said. “Only God can punish homosexuality… This is not an issue for humans to punish.” The 29-year-old Mateen, who has a 3-year-old child, married Sitora Yusufiy, an immigrant from Uzbekistan in 2007. The couple officially divorced in 2009, but Yusufiy told reporters on Sunday that they only lived together for a few months, during which time he beat and emotionally abused her. From her home in Colorado, Yusufiy told reporters on Sunday that Mateem was bipolar and abused steroids. “A few months after we were married I saw his instability, I saw his bipolar, and he would get mad out of nowhere, and that’s when I started worrying about my safety,” she said. “Then after a few months he started abusing me physically, very often, and not allowing me to speak to my family, and keeping me hostage from them.” At Mateen’s regular house of worship, the Fort Pierce Islamic Center, Imam Rahman assured visitors that the community had no idea about the storm brewing in the gunman’s heart—or the FBI’s investigations into him. Meanwhile protesters outside called for authorities to shut down the Islamic center, with some driving by urging people to “burn it down.” Rahman, also a medical doctor, said that Omar Mateen attended the mosque service Friday night with his young son curled up next to him. “He was the last to arrive and the first to leave,” he said, but recalled nothing else about Mateen wasn’t regular in his attendance. “One hundred and thirty people came Friday so I don’t notice,” Rahman said. Fellow members of the mosque said they knew little about Mateen. “He wasn’t rude, but he wasn’t very friendly either,” said Mohammad Jamil. Sometimes he would come for prayers in his security uniform and Jamil noted he was very muscular. “He would say, hello, but that was about it.” As tradition, the women and small children gathered in a separate room for their feast. The mood was somber and Lucy Haq, a member, said the crowd was lighter than normal. She said that Mateen and other radical Islamic terrorists like him hurt all Muslims. “What they are doing is not Islam,” she said. Rahman, who has been Imam at the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce since 2005, said Mateen was sporadic in his attendance to prayers. He might come for prayers two or three times in a week and might not show the following week. Mateen’s father, by accounts was more outgoing. Rahman said the elder Mateen was in the insurance business and offered his services to fellow worshippers and he offered to help with any problems. “He said he knew police chief and authorities and he could help us if we ever had problems.” “Always told if anything bad was happening we could contact the father and he would take care of it,” Rahman said. Rahman said the center did not promote violence and that Mateen did not get his radical ideas from the center. “We do not want these things to happen. We condemn radical Islam.” The FBI has not talked to Rahman. “What could I share with them? I have nothing because we did not know. Of course we would have called them. In our religion it says he who kills one person kills all mankind.” Read more coverage of the massacre at the Pulse nightclub"

Hundreds of tourists were sunbathing when jihadi Seifeddine Rezgui opened fire with a Kalashnikov assault rifle, killing 38 tourists in total in a rampage that lasted about 30 minutes. Rezgui was shot dead by Tunisian authorities as he ran from the hotel. The attack came three months after Islamist militants attacked the Bardo National Museum in the Tunisian capital city of Tunis. They killed 21 people – mostly European tourists – on the spot, and another victim died 10 days later. The inquest, which opened at the Royal Courts of Justice in London seven weeks ago, heard emotional and graphic evidence from survivors and relatives of victims. Tui – the travel company that owns Thomson holidays, through which all 30 of the Britons booked their trip – came under significant scrutiny over its handling of Foreign Office travel advice for Tunisia. Lawyers for the families of 22 of the victims accused Tui of burying UK Foreign Office warnings about terrorism in Tunisia, while a number of survivors claimed they were pushed into taking holidays to the North African country. Others told the inquest they were reassured the country was “100% safe”. Tui, which in the year to September made an underlying profit of €1bn (£866m), sold customers travel insurance that meant they were not covered if their trip was cancelled due to terrorism risks, the inquest heard. Lawyers representing Tui presented evidence that showed where customers could access travel advice through its website. Representatives from Tui told the inquest that security was the responsibility of the local Tunisian authorities and not the tour operator. The coroner, Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith, suggested in closing submissions last Thursday that he intended to give a short-form conclusion of unlawful killing before delivering a factual narrative briefing. Rezgui, from Gaâfour in north-west Tunisia, was a 23-year-old electrical engineering student at the University of Kairouan. It emerged he had received military training in Libya. Some of his associates went on to launch the Bardo Museum attack. The ringleader behind the Sousse and Bardo attacks – and Rezgui’s recruiter – was identified as Chamseddine al-Sandi by a BBC Panorama investigation in January. Panorama said Sandi was believed to be on the run in Libya. The Guardian has not been able to verify his role. Two weeks after the Sousse attack, the Foreign Office altered its travel advice to warn against all travel to four areas of Tunisia and against all but essential travel to the rest of the country. This advice remains in place. Tourism in Tunisia, which had accounted for 8% in gross domestic product – a broad measure for the size of a country’s economy – has suffered considerably since the attacks. According to the Tunisian ministry of tourism, tourist receipts plunged 50% year-on-year in 2016, while the number of border arrivals was down 18%."

          / CBS/AP   (CBS/AP) TUCSON, Ariz. - The husband of former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords says he and his wife are satisfied with a plea agreement for the suspect in the Tucson mass shooting. ""We don't speak for all of the victims or their families, but Gabby and I are satisfied with this plea agreement. The pain and loss caused by the events of January 8, 2011 are incalculable. Avoiding a trial will allow us -- and we hope the whole Southern Arizona community -- to continue with our recovery and move forward with our lives,"" Mark Kelly wrote in a statement. Jared Loughner is scheduled for a change of plea hearing in federal court Tuesday. He will be asked to acknowledge that he shot and killed six people and wounded 13 others, including Giffords. Loughner's attorneys and prosecutors also will try to persuade U.S. District Court Judge Larry A. Burns that Loughner no longer is mentally unfit for trial. A lot will depend on how Loughner behaves in Court Tuesday. Experts had concluded that Loughner suffers from schizophrenia, and officials at a federal prison have forcibly medicated him with psychotropic drugs for more than a year. A court-appointed psychiatrist is expected to testify Tuesday that he is competent to enter a plea.  Survivors of the shooting will be in court and many wonder which Jared Loughner will show up - the one made more coherent through heavy medication, or the angry, rambling Loughner who destroyed so many lives, CBS News correspondent Bill Whitaker reports. On ""CBS This Morning,"" CBS News legal analyst Jack Ford said the standard for competency to stand trial that Loughner faces, which is different from what his mental state was at the time of the shooting, is whether he understands the charges against him. ""Do you realize why you're there? And can you assist in your defense?"" said Ford. ""Can you help your lawyer when your lawyer says 'OK, do you remember what you were doing at the time? What witnesses can we get?' ""So it's a very limited threshold standard, important in terms of a trial, but in some ways, it might have nothing to do with the issue of whether you were actually criminally insane at the time that the act took place."" If Burns agrees, as legal experts expect, a formal change-of-plea hearing will follow. That's when those in the court will hear from Loughner at length for the first time, as the judge questions him about the agreement and changing his plea to guilty. Burns may ask Loughner to recite his actions in his own words, but either his lawyer or the federal prosecutor could just read the facts of the January 2011 shooting spree at a Tucson supermarket, where then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was holding a meet-and-greet with constituents. Either way, Loughner will be asked to acknowledge that he shot and killed six people, including the top federal judge in Arizona, and wounded 13 others, including Giffords. He'll need to convince Burns he understands what is going on, what he's doing and what he did. Still, Loughner could break down, change his mind about pleading guilty or show so little understanding of what he's doing that Burns rejects the plea, lawyers not involved in the case said Monday. Medicated Jared Loughner set to plead guiltyGiffords leads vigil on shooting anniversaryOne year later, Tucson itself still healing too ""The fact that there is this planned change of plea is no guarantee that it will go forward,"" said Paul Charlton, a former U.S. attorney for Arizona. ""There are any number of things that would happen that would either cause it to be removed from the calendar or not go forward at all."" The plea agreement that is expected to be made public on Tuesday would see Loughner sentenced to life in prison, taking the possibility of the death penalty off the table in the federal case, a person familiar with the case told The Associated Press on Saturday. The person was not authorized to discuss the case publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. An agreement that would spare Loughner the death penalty offers something for both sides, said Quin Denvir, a California defense attorney who has worked with Loughner attorney Judy Clarke on the case against Ted Kaczynski. Prosecutors would avoid a potentially lengthy and costly trial and appeal, knowing that the defendant will be locked up for life. Clarke managed to avoid the death penalty for other high-profile clients such as Kaczynski and Eric Rudolph, who bombed abortion clinics in the late 1990s and Atlanta's Olympic park in 1996. News of an agreement hasn't brought negative reaction from victims' families, and some said they support the government's decision. The top prosecutor in southern Arizona's Pima County said last year that she may file state charges in the case that could carry the death penalty. An official in the prosecutor's office, Amelia Craig Cramer, declined to comment, saying the office did not have an active prosecution against Loughner. Denvir said it was possible that the plea agreement calls for the state to avoid pursuing criminal charges against Loughner, though that's not a given. ""Ideally (as a defense attorney) you'd like to have it resolved all at once, but sometimes you have to take one at a time,"" he said. The decision to spare Loughner a federal death sentence makes sense, said Dale Baich, a federal public defender in Phoenix who handles capital case appeals and isn't involved in the case. ""As time went on and there were numerous evaluations, I think everybody had a better understanding of Mr. Loughner's mental illness."" Baich said. He added: ""It appears that he will need to be treated for the rest of his life in order to remain competent.""

That all people, regardless of race, ethnicity, or religion, are susceptible to radicalization is the antithesis of the Trump administration’s narrow and dangerous approach to fighting terrorism. Amid the ongoing clamor surrounding the President’s executive order banning the people of seven majority Muslim nations from entering the US, there’s also talk of scrapping the government’s “Countering Violent Extremism” (CVE) program, which covers all ideologies, for one that focuses exclusively on Islamist terrorism. Advertisement Unlike other antiterrorism programs, CVE’s mission is to identify and address the causes of terrorism and create community resources that promote counter-narratives to undermine online violent extremism. On the Department of Homeland Security website, the program is called “a key focus” to “secure the homeland.” The site also mentions that “violent extremist threats come from a range of groups and individuals, including domestic terrorists and homegrown violent extremists in the United States, as well as international terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and ISIL.” Like other remnants of the Obama administration, this policy may be at risk of being expunged. From his anti-Muslim campaign rhetoric to his seething inaugural address, in which he promised to “eradicate” Islamist terrorism “from the face of the Earth,” Trump has never mentioned the kind of homegrown terrorism usually perpetrated by white men. When the White House last week released a list of 78 terrorist attacks, it falsely claimed the media had ignored, it cited only those it said were “executed or inspired by” Islamist fundamentalists. Conspicuously missing were the acts of Dylann Roof, an avowed white supremacist convicted and sentenced to death for the murders of nine African-Americans in a Charleston, S.C., church in 2015; Ronald Dear, accused in a 2015 attack at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood clinic that killed three people, including a police officer; and Bissonnette, identified by Canadian authorities as “a criminal extremist.” The president, who rarely holds his tongue or tweets, has had nothing to say about the Quebec mosque massacre once it was confirmed that the accused murderer is not Muslim. Advertisement This is an especially tenuous time. Trump’s contentious rhetoric has emboldened white nationalists. House minority leader Nancy Pelosi twice described Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon as “a white supremacist.” Trump was endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan and has been praised by neo-Nazis and David Duke. With hate crimes on the rise since the election, going after homegrown terrorists must be a crucial part of securing this nation. CVE can be effective only if it continues to encompass all extremists, regardless of race or religion. To focus only on Islamist terrorism will allow domestic extremism to fester as a serious threat. Narrowing CVE’s original, more expansive mission won’t cripple terrorism; it will only enable it.

James Eric Fuller started ranting at the end of the program Saturday, then took a picture of a Tea Party leader and yelled, ""You're dead.""

Fuller apologized through his girlfriend, Dorothy Deruyter. He has been in a hospital since being involuntarily committed Saturday for a mental health evaluation but wrote a statement and called Deruyter. Fuller apologized for his ""misplaced outrage."" Fuller was one of 19 people shot when a gunman opened fire Jan. 8 at a meet-and-greet for Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. The congresswoman was critically injured and six people were killed. Fuller was shot in the knee and back, and drove himself to the hospital, where he spent two days. Deruyter said Fuller has no family or children, and was coping with the shooting almost entirely on his own and lost his temper. Trent Humphries, co-founder of the Tucson Tea Party who was the focus of Fuller's outburst at a taping of ABC's ""This Week"" Saturday, told the Associated Press he is worried about threats he is receiving. Humphries told the AP he was worried about Fuller's threat, and the dozens of other angry e-mails he has received from people blaming right-wing political rhetoric for contributing to the assassination attempt on Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. ""I had nothing to do with the murders that happened or the shooting of Gabriel Giffords,"" Humphries said.

          / CBS News A childhood friend has offered a very different view of the young man accused of murdering nine people in a South Carolina church. Caleb Brown was good friends with Dylann Roof from grade school until high school, and the boy he knew is nothing like the man described by Roof's more recent acquaintances. Brown says he was shocked to hear that Roof was the alleged gunman behind the mass shooting during a bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. ""He never once said anything to me derogatory, racist, anything like that,"" Brown said. ""Otherwise we would have not been friends."" Brown said he knew Roof to be a happy, normal kid, but he also said he had not seen him in a year and a half. ""That was not inside of him the entire time I knew that kid, or his mom, they were not like that,"" Brown said. ""And I still believe that his mom is one of the greatest people... one of the nicest ladies I've ever met. If something in him turned, then it was recent.  It wasn't his whole life; he wasn't sitting, bubbling with hatred towards black people -- no, that just happened and I don't know why."" Brown's account stands in stark contrast to that of Joey Meek, who has said Roof wanted ""to start a civil war."" Meek reconnected with Roof a few weeks ago and said that while they got drunk together on vodka, Roof began complaining that ""blacks were taking over the world"" and that ""someone needed to do something about it for the white race."" The new information about Roof came as an apparent statement explaining the suspect's motivations surfaced online. CBS News was trying to confirm the authenticity of the document -- laced with profanity and vitriol aimed at every racial minority in the United States -- posted to a website registered in Russia. The site also contained dozens of photos of Roof, posing by Confederate graves, holding a Glock pistol and in various outdoor environments. Meek also said during their reunion a few weeks ago that Roof had told him he used birthday money from his parents to buy a .45-caliber Glock pistol, and that he had ""a plan"" that was six months in the making. Roof is being charged with nine counts of murder and possession of a weapon for opening fire in the Emanuel AME Church, which has deep historical roots in the black community in downtown Charleston, South Carolina.

Police shot and killed the gunman after he committed the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. Every Late-Night Host's Reaction to Orlando Shooting (Video)




 Jimmy Fallon:

""Maybe there's a lesson from all this. A lesson in tolerance. We need to support each other's differences and worry less about our own opinions. Get back to debate and away from believing or supporting the idea that if someone doesn't live the way you want them to live, you just buy a gun and kill them. Bomb them up. That is not OK.""



 Seth Meyers:

""So much, though, of the news right now is dominated by the horrific events in Orlando, the attack on the LGBTQ community there. And so, we decided we would try to address that and, in addressing it, maybe help us all process it a little bit more, because I don't know if we can ever fully understand it.""



 John Oliver:

“As I’m sure you know by now, at least 50 people were killed by a gunman at a gay nightclub in what is being described as a terrorist attack. And look, it’s still early and details are still emerging, and right now, this just hurts. And the worst thing is this pain is so familiar.”



 Stephen Colbert:

""You know what a president, whoever it is, will probably say. You know what both sides of the political aisle will say. You know what gun manufacturers will say. Even me, with a silly show like this, you have some idea of what I will say. Because even I have talked about this when it has happened before. It's as if there's a national script that we have learned.""



 Samantha Bee:

“What Paul Giamatti is to biopics, the highly profitable AR-15 is deadly mass shooting. Yes, I do want to take those guns away.”



 Trevor Noah:

""The saddest part is every time this happens, it feels like America has already decided. This is exactly the kind of country it wants to be. Because we know how this always plays out: We're shocked, we mourn, we change our profile pics, and we move on. It's become normal. I'm sorry. Maybe it's because I'm new, but it's not normal.""



 Conan O'Brien:

“I am not a pundit, I am not an expert, and I’ve always made it my policy to stick to my job and keep my opinions to myself. I simply do not understand why anybody in this country is allowed to purchase and own a semiautomatic assault rifle, it makes no sense to me. These are weapons of war and they have no place in civilian life.”



 James Corden:

""On behalf of the whole theater community and every person in this room, our hearts go out to all of those affected by this atrocity. All we can say is that you’re not on your own right now. Your tragedy is our tragedy. Theater is a place where every race, creed, sexuality and gender is equal, is embraced, and is loved. Hate will never win. Together we have to make sure of that. ""



 Larry Wilmore:

""Yeah, Donald, you were really ahead of the curve on the whole, 'terrorism is bad' thing. I mean, honestly, who brags about this?... It’s like your doctor saying, 'Yo, dude, I totally called it, you do have cancer.'""

Monash University provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation AU. The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations View the full list In the age of smartphones and social media, the spread of ideas as digital memes is global and unpredictable. This includes, for example, Islamic State (IS) recruiting followers from across the globe, to the nationalist and xenophobic ideas that were espoused respectively in the campaigns by Brexiteers to get the UK to leave the European Union and Donald Trump to get elected as US president. Around the world, the right especially has shown how effective a tool social media can be. A good example is popular South African singer Steve Hofmeyr, who is a foremost crusader for white right-wing causes, –especially on social media. With 222,000 followers, his Twitter timeline not only features local issues of so-called white victimhood, but also retweets of prominent European extremists’ campaigns. As to be expected, he is a strong Trump supporter. Recently, there was a fundraising campaign to send Hofmeyr to the US to meet with Trump. The extremist campaigner behind the proposed “talks” said it was aimed at stopping the “genocide” of white Afrikaners. He even sent tweets to Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, and his wife, Melania, to help facilitate the talks. But South Africa’s right-wing is a fractious bunch, and the fundraising campaign stuttered to a halt when it appeared that it was a scam and Hofmeyr distanced himself from the efforts. White victimhood has crossed international borders. The idea of white people falling victim to an “onslaught” of refugees and immigrants has become a major factor in elections across Europe. The meaning of “PC” is changing, with political correctness making way for patriotic correctness. That’s what Trump’s “America First” is all about. Trump’s campaign slogan “Make America Great Again” appealed to white victimhood. He focused on a white electorate who feels disillusioned by demographic and sociopolitical change in the US. They feel that American values are in danger, and hence there is the need to “take back America”. White victimhood is a right-wing tactic that inverts the left’s narratives of minority discrimination and neocolonialism. This tactic denies that there is such a thing as white privilege, and attempts to camouflage white domination. Whites can surely be victims of crime or discrimination as individuals, but white victimhood goes much further. It implies that whites as a demographic group are victims of discrimination, oppression or even persecution. In short, whites are endangered by all sorts of dangers out there in the world. This recent right-wing tactic has morphed into the “alt-right” movement in America with various faces. The extreme is the new Nazism dressed in designer suits and championed by American white supremacist Richard Spencer, who is president of the National Policy Institute. There is the more “gentrified” culture of anti-left trolling with the Brit Milo Yiannopoulos as its flamboyant poster boy. This right-wing provocateur was forced this week to fall on his sword over remarks in which he appeared to endorse sex between “younger boys” and older men. And there is Trump’s powerful chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, with his siege mentality against “Islamic fascism”. The “alt-right” news website Breitbart has an editor-at-large (after Bannon’s departure) with strong South African ties. Joel Pollak, born in South Africa, was a speechwriter for the opposition Democratic Alliance leader Tony Leon from 2002 to 2006 whilst studying in the country. Pollak is now being floated as Trump’s possible US ambassador in Pretoria. This South African connection goes deeper. The persecution of whites is an influential idea for the South African far-right. The fear of black violence, the so-called “Swart Gevaar” (Afrikaans for black danger) propagated by the apartheid state, still persists. The most extreme version of this victimhood is “white genocide”. This idea has been popularised by the Afrikaans pop singers Hofmeyr and Sunette Bridges through their Red October campaign.  They advocate that farm murders in South Africa come down to “white genocide” – farm murders most certainly are problematic, even without it being hijacked for political mileage. But they don’t amount to “white genocide” and affects more than white people. The right-wing political party Freedom Front Plus has called on the UN to investigate white genocide. The numbers show that this idea is sheer hyperbole. An online petition has also requested the Council of the EU to “allow all white South Africans the right to return to Europe”. The petition says that whites face persecution and ethnic cleansing at home. The petition has been reinvigorated by Trump’s election as US president and calls him “a new hope for white South Africans”. It now addresses Trump to accept whites from South Africa as refugees to the US. The idea of white genocide (or annihilation) has spread to the rest of the globe. Views from the South African far-right found its way into two well-known acts of terrorism committed by radicalised white men. The first was the 2011 mass murder of 77 people (mostly minors) by Anders Breivik on an island near Oslo in Norway. Breivik’s manifesto “2083 – A European Declaration of Independence” is a reference to his predicted date when Europe becomes a Muslim continent. It includes various references to the persecution of whites in South Africa and a whole section on Afrikaner genocide. The second was the 2015 mass shooting of nine black people by Dylann Roof in a church in Charleston, South Carolina. Roof’s manifesto “The Last Rhodesian” included a reference to discrimination against whites in South Africa. He also lauds the “success” of apartheid as proof that a black majority can be controlled by a white minority. Breivik and Roof both raised the fear of persecution of whites as motivation for their actions. They invoked the South African situation as “proof” that whites are in danger due to an onslaught by Muslims (in Europe) and black people (in the US). Trump’s mention of “American carnage” in his inaugural address is a continuation of the narrative of white victimhood. It forms the imaginary basis for something similar to the apartheid state’s “Swart Gevaar” – except with Mexicans and Muslims being the “peril”. Trump’s way to deal with these hyperbolic dangers is the proposed wall between the US and Mexico, and the Muslim travel ban targeting majority-Muslim countries. The idea of white victimhood played an important part in Trump’s rise. The South African brand of white supremacy has made a tangible contribution to this narrative of victimhood. It is part of a growing “white supremacist cosmopolitanism” and a Trump New World Order. Global Challenges Podcast Series 2

                    Laura Santhanam As details surrounding the San Bernardino, California, shooting gradually emerged Wednesday evening, President Barack Obama told CBS News that the U.S. has “a pattern now of mass shooting in this country that has no parallel anywhere else in the world.” The mass shooting at a social services agency in San Bernardino left at least 14 dead and 17 others wounded. It is also the deadliest mass shooting in the U.S. since Adam Lanza opened fire at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, on Dec. 15, 2012, killing 26 children and adults. Using data from shootingtracker.com, which is maintained by a Reddit group, we’ve updated our map that documents all the U.S. mass shootings in 2015 alone. The group defines mass shootings as incidents when at least four people are killed or wounded, including the gunman. According to the tracker’s data, the San Bernardino incident represents the 355th shooting this year, the Washington Post reported. The incident in San Bernardino also overshadowed another shooting in Savannah, Georgia that occurred the same day, claiming one life and injuring three others. However, there’s not a standard definition of “mass shooting.” Adam Lankford, a criminal justice professor at the University of Alabama previously told the NewsHour that FBI’s data included incidents where fewer than four people were shot and didn’t include shootings of multiple people that occur in a home or other uncrowded setting. On Friday, a gunmen surrendered to police after an hourslong siege in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where he killed three people and wounded nine others in a Planned Parenthood clinic. The same day, a gunfight killed two and injured two in Sacramento, California. On Nov. 23, there were mass shootings in Houston, Minneapolis and Columbus, Ohio. There were five shootings on Nov. 22. On Oct. 1, when a gunman killed 10 people and wounded seven more at a community college in Roseburg, Oregon, Obama also spoke of the routine nature of these shootings. “[A]s I said just a few months ago, and I said a few months before that, and I said each time we see one of these mass shootings, our thoughts and prayers are not enough. It’s not enough,” Obama said.  Megan Crigger

          / CBS/AP ORLANDO, Fla. -- Mina Justice was sound asleep when she received the first text from her son, Eddie Justice, who was in the gay nightclub when a gunman opened fire and slaughtered 50 and wounded more than 50 others. Early Monday morning, Eddie's name was added to the list of the deceased. Here is the conversation Mina had over text message with her 30-year-old son before he was killed. ""Mommy I love you,"" the first message said. It was 2:06 a.m. ""In club they shooting."" Mina Justice tried calling her 30-year-old son. No answer. Alarmed and half awake, she tapped out a response. ""U ok"" At 2:07 a.m., he wrote: ""Trapp in bathroom."" Justice asked what club, and he responded: ""Pulse. Downtown. Call police."" Then at 2:08: ""I'm gonna die."" Now wide awake, Justice dialed 911. She sent a flurry of texts over the next several minutes. ""I'm calling them now. U still in there Answer our damn phone Call them Call me."" The 911 dispatcher wanted her to stay on the line. She wondered what kind of danger her son was in. He was normally a homebody who liked to eat and work out. He liked to make everyone laugh. He worked as an accountant and lived in a condo in downtown Orlando. ""Lives in a sky house, like the Jeffersons,"" she would say. ""He lives rich."" She knew he was gay and at a club -- and all the complications that might entail. Fear surged through her as she waited for his next message. At 2:39 a.m., he responded: ""Call them mommy Now."" He wrote that he was in the bathroom. ""He's coming I'm gonna die."" Justice asked her son if anyone was hurt and which bathroom he was in. ""Lots. Yes,"" he responded at 2:42 a.m. When he didn't text back, she sent several more messages. Was he with police? ""Text me please,"" she wrote. ""No,"" he wrote four minutes later. ""Still here in bathroom. He has us. They need to come get us."" At 2:49 a.m., she told him the police were there and to let her know when he saw them. ""Hurry,"" he wrote. ""He's in the bathroom with us."" She asked, ""Is the man in the bathroom wit u?"" At 2:50 a.m.: ""He's a terror."" Then, a final text from her son a minute later: ""Yes."" More than 15 hours after that text, Justice still hasn't heard from her son. She and a dozen family and friends are at a hotel that has become a staging area for relatives awaiting news. Any news. ""His name has not come up yet and that's scary. It's just ..."" she paused and patted hear heart. ""It's just, I got this feeling. I got a bad feeling."" As soon as shots started firing around 2:20 a.m. ET, eyewitness accounts began flooding social media, and the club itself alerted party-goers, at about 3 a.m. ET, by posting a frantic message on its Facebook page: ""Everyone get out of pulse and keep running."" Hours later, the same post has amassed numerous responses including unconfirmed eyewitness reports of the attack and others trying to locate family members or friends who were thought to be at the club. One mother, Libia Carmen, who was on the phone with her daughter still allegedly inside the club, posted: ""My daughter is in there. Please keep praying for them... She's waiting for cops to be able to come out. I was on the fone and all i hear is shot guns."" Another Facebook user, Ricardo Almodovar, responded: ""I was there. Shooter opened fire @ around 2:00am. People on the dance floor and bar got down on the floor and some of us who were near the bar and back exit managed to go out through the outdoor area and just ran. I am safely home and hoping everyone gets home safely as well :( ""  Multiple Twitter users, some who were allegedly hiding from the gunman and reaching out for help, described the grisly scene inside. @lakecitymedman wrote ""I've never seen so much blood and mayhem or been so scared ever."" Walking to ORMC now. I'm ok. Friend got shot.  I've never seen so much blood and mayhem or been so scared ever. pic.twitter.com/KyGhQGmWWQ Officials have started removing bodies from inside the Orlando nightclub.

          / CBS/AP ORLANDO, Fla. -- The latest on the attack at an Orlando nightclub, which is now apparently the deadliest mass shooting in American history: 5:50 a.m. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has claimed responsibility for the attack early Sunday morning at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida that left at least 50 dead and 53 injured. The group's official radio station, al-Bayan, said Monday morning that, ""Over 100 Crusaders killed and injured after an attack on their gathering at a night club in America."" ""We begin from America, where Allah has enabled brother Omar Mateen, one of the soldiers of the Caliphate in America, to carry out a raid where he was able to infiltrate a Crusaders' gathering at a gay night club in Orlando, Florida. Allah enabled him to inflict heavy casualties amongst the filthy Crusaders. He killed and injured over a hundred of them. This is the biggest raid to be carried in America after the raid of Manhattan 16 years ago. All praise to Allah."" ISIS has in the past claimed responsibility for attacks that did not originate within its command structure or territory, and analysts say this latest claim still does not prove ISIS was directly involved in the shooting. 4:04 a.m. The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee says it's possible the suspected Orlando, Florida shooter was self-radicalized but not ""under the command and control of ISIS."" Congressman Adam Schiff says he's been briefed multiple times by federal law enforcement about Omar Mateen, who opened fire early Sunday on a gay club, killing at least 50 people and wounding another 53. Officials say Mateen called 911 from the nightclub and expressed allegiance to an ISIS leader. 4:00 a.m. Authorities have added three names to the list of the deceased, bringing the total of those identified to 21: Mercedez Marisol Flores, 26 years old Xavier Emmanuel Serrano Rosado, 35 years old Gilberto Ramon Silva Menendez, 25 years old 3:19 a.m. Authorities have added three names to the list of the deceased, bringing the total identified to 18: Amanda Alvear, 25 years old Martin Benitez Torres, 33 years old Luis Daniel Wilson-Leon, 37 years old --- 1:57 a.m. Authorities have added five more names to the list of the deceased, bringing the total identified to 15.

In Miami Beach, mourners lit candles, embraced and waived rainbow flags Sunday evening. Members of LGBT groups and their supporters met in the Boystown neighborhood of Chicago. Among them was Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who said the city has stepped up security in gay communities. Also there in solidarity were mothers who have lost their children to gun violence. Hundreds of people in Austin, Texas, attended an evening vigil at the Capitol that included Muslim leaders and a Christian pastor, the Austin American-Statesman reported. Several hundred people filled the parking lot of a popular LGBT-district bistro in downtown Atlanta, singing, lighting candles and speaking out against the violence that struck Orlando. Matt Garrett helped organize the event, handing out candles and lining up a series of speakers who would address the swelling crowd that spilled into the busy street. --- 12:13 a.m. Host James Corden opened Broadway's biggest night with a message for the fallen in Orlando. ""Our hearts go out to all of those affected by this atrocity. All we can say is you're not on your own right now. Your tragedy is our tragedy,"" he said in part, adding: ""Hate will never win. Together we have to make sure of that. Tonight's show stands as a symbol and a celebration of that principle. This is the Tony Awards."" --- 10:24 p.m. A GoFundMe page setup for the victims of the Orlando mass shooting has now surpassed $1 million in donations. The fund, set up by Equality Florida, has had more than 25,000 donors since the shooting happened. --- 9:00 p.m. The ex-wife of the Orlando nightclub gunman says he was ""mentally unstable and mentally ill."" Sitora Yusifiy, speaking to reporters in Boulder, Colorado, says Omar Mateen was bipolar and also had a history with steroids. She says that in the four months they were together he cut her off from her family and regularly beat her. She says that her family visited her and saw she wasn't OK and rescued her from the situation. Yusifiy says they literally pulled her out of his arms. She says she left all her belongings and has had no contact with him for seven or eight years. She says Mateen was religious, but she saw no signs of radicalism. Of the nightclub massacre she says, ""there was no sign of any of this at all."" --- 8:50 p.m. Officials have started removing bodies from inside an Orlando nightclub where 50 people were shot and killed.

Rep. Adam Schiff has been briefed multiple times by federal law enforcement. He says it is possible that Omar Mateen was self-radicalized but not ""under the command and control of ISIS."" The California congressman says that could change and that it's too early to know whether there was something that could have been done to prevent the attack. The FBI investigated Mateen in 2013 after he made inflammatory comments to co-workers alleging possible ties to terrorists. The following year, the agency looked into potential ties connecting Mateen to Moner Mohammad Abusalha, the first American to carry out a suicide attack in Syria. He was cleared after both investigations. --- 6:40 p.m. Vice President Joe Biden released a statement Sunday evening in regards to the mass shooting, calling it ""an act of pure hate and unspeakable terror."" ""They were our brothers and our sisters; our friends, neighbors, and loved ones. In the coming days, we will learn more about these fifty souls and the lives they lived and the world they made better,"" Biden said. He offered condolences to the victims and their families.

Hall says many people are having trouble locating victims because they are being listed under fake names. --- 6:05 p.m. The City of Orlando is asking for a hold on vigils being planned in the city. In a tweet, the city asked that vigils be put on hold because of the strain it puts on its limited resources, which need to be dedicated to the victims and their families. We understand our community is grieving and vigils are being planned, but PLEASE hold off on vigils. #PrayforOrlando pic.twitter.com/9ZmbbLD4Tz --- 5:53 p.m. A U.S. intel source tells CBS News that Mateen called 911 during the shooting from the bathroom. They called him back and that is when he pledged alliance to ISIS and al Baghdadi. The source says he made two foreign trips, one in 2011 to Dubai and one to Saudi Arabia in 2012. He was not on a current watch list. He was on the Terrorist Screening database when the FBI was questioning him. Source tells CBS News he was removed when the FBI closed their investigation. The 2013 investigation began when Mateen told co-workers and others he knew the Tsarnaev brothers. --- 5:45 p.m. The ATF tweeted a photo of two guns, saying the guns were similar to those traced to the Orlando shooting. ""Guns traced in #Orlando shooting: .223 caliber AR type rifle and 9mm semiautomatic pistol. Similar to those pictured,"" the tweet read.

Similar to those pictured pic.twitter.com/Ao5pcLtwBg --- 5:21 p.m. The City of Orlando has released names of victims of the nightclub shooting whose next of kin have been contacted. The list will be periodically updated on www.cityoforlando.net/blog/victims/ as those who died are identified and families and loved ones notified. The city gave no additional information other than the names. -Edward Sotomayor Jr. -Stanley Almodovar III -Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo -Juan Ramon Guerroro - Eric Ivan Ortiz-Rivera - Peter O. Gonzalez-Cruz --- American Muslim leaders are condemning the attack on a gay nightclub in Orlando that killed 50 people and wounded more than 50 others. Nihad Awad, the executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, called the killings a hate crime and said the group has no tolerance for extremism of any kind. A law enforcement official has said the gunman, Omar Mateen, called 911 from the nightclub and expressed allegiance to an Islamic State leader. Awad says members of the LGBT community have stood with Muslims in the past and today they stand that community. --- 4:50 p.m. About 100 people gathered in Paris for a spontaneous vigil at Place Igor Stravinsky to remember those slain and wounded at an Orlando nightclub. Several people were draped in rainbow flags. They lit candles and took pictures as a person in head-to-toe fetish gear held up a sign saying ""Proud."" One woman carried a poster showing a ribbon with a rainbow on one side and an American flag on the other. ""To Orlando, we have love,"" it read. Remi Perrenoud, 30, said the news hit him particularly hard because, like the victims, he had been out partying at a gay club Saturday night. Ian Brossat, the capital's deputy mayor for housing, was at the vigil too. He says it seems important to mobilize to voice solidarity and to underline the fight against homophobia. --- The Orlando mayor says of the 50 victims who died from the shooting at a gay nightclub, 39 were killed at the club and 11 people died at hospitals. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer says at first officers mistakenly thought the gunman had strapped explosives to the dead victims and that the club was boob-trapped. A bomb robot sent back images of a battery part next to a body. Dyer says that held up paramedics from going in until it was determined it was something that fell out of an exit sign or a smoke detector. The robot was sent in after SWAT team members put explosive charges on a wall and an armored vehicle knocked the wall down in an effort to rescue hostages. --- 4:35 p.m. A law enforcement official says the gunman who killed 50 people at a gay nightclub made a 911 call from the club, professing allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The law enforcement official is familiar with the investigation but was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. --- 4:05 p.m. The FBI says agents twice investigated the man who killed 50 people inside a gay nightclub, but closed those cases after interviewing him. FBI agent Ronald Hopper said Sunday that Omar Mateen had been interviewed in 2013 and 2014. Hopper said agents first investigated Mateen after he made inflammatory comments to co-workers alleging possible ties to terrorists. Mateen was interviewed twice and, when investigators were unable to verify the details of his comments, the FBI closed the probe. In 2014, the agency looked into potential ties connecting Mateen to Moner Mohammad Abusalha, the first American to carry out a suicide attack in Syria. Like Mateen, Abusalha lived in Fort Pierce, Florida. Hopper says agents determined that contact was minimal and did not constitute a substantive relationship or a threat at that time. Mateen was 29 years old and born in New York. The FBI says he referred to the Islamic State in a 911 call before the slayings. --- 4:00 p.m. The ex-wife of the man authorities say killed 50 people at an Orlando nightclub says he beat her repeatedly while they were married. Omar Mateen's ex-wife told The Washington Post that she met him online about eight years ago and decided to move to Florida and marry him. The ex-wife, who wasn't named in the report, says at first the marriage was normal, but then he became abusive. They were together for only a few months and her parents intervened when they learned Mateen had assaulted her. She says he wasn't very religious and gave no signs of radical Islam. She said he owned a small-caliber handgun and worked as a guard at a nearby facility for juvenile delinquents. Mateen's ex-wife said his family was from Afghanistan, but her ex-husband was born in New York. His family later moved to Florida. --- 3:30 p.m. Mateen legally purchased in the last few days the two guns he allegedly used to kill 50, and wound 53 more at a gay night club in Orlando, authorities said Sunday. The FBI confirmed at a press conference Sunday afternoon that federal authorities twice looked into Mateen in the past. In 2013 Mateen allegedly made inflammatory statements referencing terrorism while talking to coworkers, and in 2014 he was questioned because of what FBI Special Agent Ron Hopper called a possible connection to a suicide bomber. Hopper said agents contacted Mateen three times, but ultimately determined there was no reason to pursue an investigation. ""Those interviews turned out to be inconclusive so there was nothing to keep the investigation going,"" Hopper said. --- 3:00 p.m. The suspected Orlando nightclub gunman had been licensed as a private security officer in Florida. State records show suspected shooter Mateen held the firearms license since at least 2011. It was set to expire in September 2017. It wasn't immediately clear where, if anywhere, Mateen had worked as a security officer. An armed guard license in Florida requires 28 hours of classroom training by a licensed instructor. --- 2:50 p.m. The terror group ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack Sunday morning at a gay nightclub, which left 50 dead and 53 injured, according to the latest estimates from authorities. The group's Amaq Agency quoted a source in claiming that the shooting ""was carried out by an Islamic State fighter."" ISIS has in the past claimed responsibility for attacks that did not originate within their command structure or territory. --- 2:30 p.m. President Barack Obama says the worst mass shooting in U.S. history is a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get a weapon that allows them to shoot people in a school, in a house of worship, a movie theater or a gay nightclub. Speaking from the White House, Obama says the United States has to decide if that is the ""country we want to be."" He says that doing nothing is a decision as well. The shooting has thrust the topic of gun control back into focus as a presidential election nears. Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has called for expanding background checks to sales at gun shows and online purchases, and for reinstating a ban on assault weapons. Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has said the existing background check system should be fixed, not expanded, and that assault-weapons bans do not work. --- 2:15 p.m. A law enforcement official has confirmed to CBS news senior investigative producer Pat Milton that shooting suspect Mateen made the Hajj, an Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia in March 2012. President Barack Obama said at a press conference Sunday that the shooting was an ""act of terror"" and an ""act of hate."" He said the FBI is investigating it as an act of terrorism and that no effort will be spared to determine whether the shooter was affiliated with terrorist groups. Staff at the Islamic Center, a mosque in Ft. Pierce, Florida, confirmed to CBS News that Mateen, 29, has worshiped at the facility regularly for several years. The mosque condemned the attack in a statement released Sunday afternoon: We condemn this monstrous attack and offer our heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of all those killed or injured. The Muslim community of Fort Pierce joins our fellow Americans in repudiating anyone or any group that would claim to justify or excuse such an appalling act of violence. --- 2:00 p.m. A security company has confirmed that Orlando shooting suspect Mateen was employed as a guard before he allegedly killed 50 and wounded 53 early Sunday. The company, G4S, released a statement Sunday afternoon: --- 1:30 p.m. A law enforcement official confirmed to Milton that Mateen called 911 and declared his allegiance to ISIS. He identified himself to the 911 operator giving his full name, according to the source. He also mentioned the Tsarnaev brothers, the men who ignited explosives at the 2013 Boston Marathon. --- 12:45 p.m. Although some Twitter accounts linked to the terror group ISIS have described Mateen as a hero, the group has not claimed responsibility for the attack. Members of Congress have been told by authorities that Mateen appears to have made some sort of pledge of allegiance to ISIS, reports CBS News Correspondent Jeff Pegues. --- 12:27 p.m. A law enforcement source tells Milton that investigators are seeking search warrants for Mateen's residence, car, and communication devices, including his cell phone and computer. They are also seeking his financial and phone records to determine who Mateen has been in contact with, and in particular if he was communicating with anyone overseas. --- 12:11 p.m. Souces tell CBS News that suspect Mateen was on law enforcement radar during the last five years, but no formal investigation was opened. Mateen, who has worked previously as a security guard, was not under investigation at the time of the shooting. A SWAT truck and a bomb disposal unit are on the scene of an address associated with Mateen, who is suspected of killing 50 and wounding 53, at a gay nightclub in Orlando early Sunday. There is a media staging area set up about a block away from the apartment complex in a residential neighborhood in Fort Pierce, Florida, on Sunday. Fort Pierce is about 118 miles southeast of Orlando. The apartment complex is a series of two-story buildings. Numerous police officers and members of the FBI also area there. --- 11:58 a.m. CBS News has confirmed that the photo above is of Mateen, the man who authorities believe killed 50 and wounded 53 early Sunday, in a mass shooting at Pulse, a gay night club in Orlando. Mateen's father says he is in shock and that he wasn't aware of anything his son might have been planning. Mir Seddique, of Port St. Lucie, Florida told media that his son got angry when he saw two men kissing in Miami a couple of months ago and thinks that may be related to the shooting. Seddique says: ""We are saying we are apologizing for the whole incident. ... We are in shock like the whole country."" The father also says the incident has nothing to do with religion. Officials say the shooter was among the 50 killed, and that they're investigating whether the incident was an act of terrorism. --- 11:30 a.m. The leaders of The American Muslim Community Centers, a mosque in Longwood, Florida, near Orlando, released a statement condemning the attack, which left 50 people dead and 53 injured early Sunday at Pulse a gay club, according to police . ""The American Muslim Community Centers is saddened and shocked by the senseless killings in downtown Orlando, and we pray for the victims and their family members,"" said Atif Fareed, the mosque's chairman.  ""AMCC and its members offer their deepest condolences to those affected by this tragedy, and we stand with our fellow Americans in this difficult time."" ""Ramadan is a month of deep reflection and prayer.  Senseless violence has no place in our religion or in our society. We strongly condemn this heinous act of violence against humanity,"" Fareed said. --- 11:20 a.m. Families and friends are awaiting word outside an Orlando hospital to learn whether their loved ones are among 50 killed and 53 more hospitalized at a shooting at a gay nightclub. About 50 people were gathered outside Orlando Regional Medical Center on Sunday, many in tears and anxious. Fatriana Evans frequents the Pulse nightclub and was outside when shots were fired. Evans says, ""It sounded like fireworks - pop, pop, pop - and then everybody scatters."" Jackie Smith was inside the club and says two friends next to her were shot. She says she hasn't gotten updates on their conditions. She came out of the hospital and burst into tears in the arms of friends. She says: ""Some guy walked in and started shooting everybody.

According to FBI Special Agent in Charge Steve LeValley, there has not been a terror attack in the city since February 1997, when convicted serial bomber Eric Rudolph blew up a lesbian nightclub, injuring four people. Rudolph was also convicted in the bombing of an Atlanta-area abortion clinic in Jan. 1997, as well as the July 1996 bombing at Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park during the summer Olympic games. Seven people were injured in the abortion clinic bombing and two people were killed in the Centennial Park bombing, according to CNN.  But the city has not experienced any terror-related incident since the Feb. 1997 attack that occurred exactly 20 years ago this month. When it comes to radical Islamic terror attacks, specifically, Atlanta Police Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Espy said there is ""no record"" of that ever happening in Atlanta.  Nevertheless, Spicer referenced the mysterious ""Atlanta"" terror attack three times in just two days recently, the first such instance occurring Jan. 29 during an interview with ABC's ""This Week."" ""What do we say to the family who loses somebody over a terroristic (sic) -- to whether it's Atlanta or San Bernardino or the Boston bomber? Those people, each of whom had gone out to a country and then come back,"" Spicer said, according to a transcript of the show.  Then, the very next day, Spicer again cited Atlanta as one of the U.S. cities that was recently struck by terrorists. ""Too many of these cases that have happened — whether you're talking about San Bernardino, Atlanta,  Boston. Would you wait until you do? The answer is we act now to protect the future,"" Spicer said Jan. 30 on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" Spicer's third and final reference to Atlanta in the context of domestic terrorism came Jan. 30 during the daily White House press briefing. ""I don't think you have to look any further than the families of the Boston Marathon, in Atlanta, in San Bernardino to ask if we can go further,"" Spicer told reporters, according to CNN. The three separate references left reporters scratching their heads for days as to why Spicer kept saying Atlanta had been the site of recent terror, when in fact it had not.  But in an email to ABC News Wednesday, Spicer said he ""clearly meant Orlando"" when he said Atlanta. Forty-nine people were killed and more than 50 other were injured when 29-year-old gunman Omar Mateen opened fire inside Orlando's Pulse nightclub in June 2016, making it the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. Mateen, who was killed after an hours-long standoff with police, was a U.S. citizen but both of his parents were born in Afghanistan. The Orlando attack came just six month after the San Bernardino, California, terror attack, in which 28-year-old Syed Farook and 27-year-old Tashfeen Malik, both Muslims, opened fire on a social services facility, killing 14 people and injuring 17 others. Spicer's ""Atlanta"" comments came on the same weekend that Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Donald Trump, faced criticism after citing the ""Bowling Green Massacre,"" which never happened, during an interview with MSNBC. Conway later said she misspoke and was referring to the two Iraqis,Waad Ramadan Alwan and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, both of whom came to the U.S. in 2009 as refugees and settled in Bowling Green, Kentucky. The two men were later sentenced to prison for aiding terrorism groups and attempting to kill U.S. soldiers who were serving in the Middle East. Former President Barack Obama ordered a review of the U.S.'s vetting of refugees coming from Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Syria, Libya, Yemen and Somalia in response to the two men being able to enter the country. Trump's controversial travel ban, issued by executive order, includes the same seven countries, but is now in legal limbo as the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is set to determine the order's fate in a much anticipated decision expected Thursday.

577930111,2017-02-07 21:03:28,About New York: Drawing a Line From Alternative Theories to Untruths,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/nyregion/donald-trump-infowars.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,en,False,,1,New York Times,http://nytimes.com,"Advertisement Supported by About New York By Jim Dwyer For years, false claims have bubbled from an especially noxious internet crockpot. The walks on the moon were faked by NASA. The Sept. 11 attacks and the bombing of an Oklahoma City federal building were inside jobs carried out by the United States government. The slaughter of children at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut did not actually happen but was staged by gun-control advocates, using child actors. Most people might want to get as far away as possible from this brew of toxins, carried on a website and radio show run by an ally of President Trump. But not the president. As he has before, President Trump dipped a ladle into this pot on Monday, asserting in a speech before military leaders in Florida that the “very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report” on episodes of terrorism. The White House followed up by releasing a list of 78 incidents of “Islamic violence” that the administration claims were played down. In fact, nearly all of them were covered by The New York Times and other news outlets, some with multiple reports from journalists around the world. The falsehood Mr. Trump uttered in his speech on Monday echoes untrue reports of a cover-up of Islamic terrorism that have been made repeatedly on Infowars, a website that traffics in conspiracy theories like those about Sept. 11 and the mass shooting at the elementary school. The site was founded by Alex Jones, on whose radio show Mr. Trump appeared during the primary campaign. “Your reputation is amazing,” Mr. Trump told Mr. Jones, promising to return. Mr. Jones has boasted that his radio show was the source of Mr. Trump’s accusation during the Republican primaries that the father of his opponent, Ted Cruz, had connections to Lee Harvey Oswald, who assassinated President John F. Kennedy in 1963. (Mr. Trump mentioned an article in the National Enquirer in making his unsupported allegation.) Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Jones falsely claimed that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States, and that thousands of Muslims in the New York area cheered the collapse of the twin towers. Mr. Trump has not endorsed the Jones view of Sept. 11, Oklahoma City or the killings at the school in Connecticut. But in the official efforts 11 years ago to address the conspiracy theories propagated by Mr. Jones and others known as “9/11 Truthers,” it is possible to hear a prophetic tone, strikingly relevant for these times. For the fifth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks in 2006, the State Department and a federal science agency issued reports that insisted the catastrophes were caused by hijackers who used commercial airliners as weapons, and not demolitions or missiles, as imagined by conspiracy theorists. In plain English, the scientific finding meant that what people saw with their own eyes, in real time, is what happened: Planes knocked down the buildings. To establish that beyond doubt, the science agency, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, published a 10,000-page draft report in 2005 (made final in 2008) on the events that led to the collapse of the towers at the World Trade Center, as well as another tall building that failed later in the day. Because of persistent claims that the trade center was destroyed by a “controlled demolition” rather than the hijacked airliners, it also published a frequently asked questions document that summarized crucial findings. Had the agency considered the demolition theory central to many of the conspiracy theories? Indeed it had, and detailed all the trails it had followed, using 7,000 video segments, 7,000 photographs, and 236 pieces of steel from the wreckage, and explained who had conducted the studies — 85 government scientists and 125 experts from the private sector and academia. “In summary, N.I.S.T. found no corroborating evidence for alternative hypotheses suggesting that the W.T.C. towers were brought down by controlled demolition using explosives,” the report stated. The agency did not use the term “conspiracy theorists,” but instead referred carefully to “so-called ‘alternative theory’ groups.” More than a decade later, one of the president’s chief advisers, Kellyanne Conway, invoked a notion of “alternative facts” in justifying false statements made by the president’s spokesman about the size of the crowd at the inauguration. A few days later, Ms. Conway referred to the “Bowling Green massacre,” an event that she conceded the next day had not occurred. It turned out she had made the same reference to a massacre that did not happen in other interviews. “Honest mistakes abound,” she wrote on Twitter. Abounding and abundant: Alternative theories. Alternative facts. Outright lies. The occasional honest mistake. Advertisement"
657704169,2017-02-22 14:27:11,How Doctors Can Prevent Gun Deaths,https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/07/doctors-gun-violence/493058/,en,False,,1110,Atlantic,http://www.theatlantic.com/,"Guns are a major cause of accidental death and suicide, yet most physicians still don’t treat them like a health hazard. Two people died in a mass shooting in Florida this week, after the worst mass shooting in U.S. history happened at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando just 43 days ago, which itself was the 15th mass shooting in Florida this year. The frequency of mass shootings, while horrifying, obscures the banality of everyday gun violence in the U.S. Specifically, that far more people are killed in gun suicides and accidents than in homicides. Guns are primarily suicide machines. There were 21,334 firearm suicides in 2014, according to the CDC, but people use guns to justifiably kill someone in self-defense only about 250 times each year. Half of Americans who kill themselves use a gun. Having a gun in the home is also strongly correlated with accidental shootings. As I’ve written, about 1.7 million children live in homes with guns that aren’t safely stored. Toddlers alone have shot at least 23 people this year. Most unintentional shootings of children happen in homes where guns are legally owned, but not stored safely, and 70 percent of them could have been prevented if the gun had been stored safely. In its call last year to consider gun violence “a public health imperative,” the American Academy of Pediatrics noted that among people younger than 24 “Gun injuries cause twice as many deaths as cancer, five times as many deaths as heart disease, and 15 times as many deaths as infections. The United States has the highest rate of firearm-related deaths among high-income countries,”* This is precisely where the health-care system can play a role in curbing gun deaths. Research shows that counseling by doctors can help promote safe gun storage—which is why most medical groups recommend that doctors ask patients whether they have guns, and if so, how they’re stored. A new survey of 3,914 Americans, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, found that two-thirds said it was at least sometimes appropriate for providers to have this kind of discussion with patients. Among firearm owners, about half said these conversations were sometimes appropriate. Despite the seeming openness on the part of patients, few doctors counsel people about gun safety. Their own apprehension and a confusing legal landscape keep them from asking patients about guns just like they would about seat-belts, poison control, or nutrition. According to a 2014 survey of internists, the overwhelming majority of doctors—85 percent—agree that firearm safety is a public-health issue, but 58 percent nonetheless said they never ask whether patients have guns in their homes. A meta-analysis published last year found that “providers rarely screen or counsel their patients—even high-risk patients—about firearm safety.” To make matters worse, Florida, home of both this week’s Ft. Myers shooting, last month’s Orlando nightclub shooting, and about 2,000 other yearly gun deaths, passed a law five years ago preventing doctors from asking their patients about gun ownership. The law, called the Firearms Owners’ Privacy Act and sometimes referred to as “Docs vs. Glocks,” allows doctors to ask their patients about guns only if they have a “legitimate safety concern.” Doctors who don’t follow the rule could be fined or lose their licenses. Many doctors’ groups say the law is against their First-Amendment rights, and the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta is currently weighing the law’s constitutionality. But at least 10 other states have introduced similar measures in recent years. Asking about guns seems to make some doctors uncomfortable. Most doctors don’t own guns themselves, and laws like those in Florida and elsewhere may prompt fears that they’re doing something illegal. (For example, the Affordable Care Act prohibits medical professionals from recording information about the presence of firearms in a patient’s home, as the Trace’s Kate Masters points out, but not from asking about firearm ownership). Patient resistance might be a factor, too: In the Annals of Internal Medicine study, a third of people said it was “never appropriate” for doctors to ask about guns. Doctors, already short on face time, might worry about needlessly offending their patients. “Conversations about gun safety between providers and patients should be nonjudgmental, educational, and focused on improving the health and safety of the patient and those around him or her,” the lead study author, Marian Betz of the University of Colorado in Aurora, told Reuters. “Unfortunately, the larger political debate over gun control laws can spill over into health-care settings.” In an editorial on the importance of physician gun-counseling published in the Journal of the American Medical Association last year, Betz and a colleague wrote that providers shouldn’t let their discomfort stand in the way. “At times, clinicians may feel uncomfortable or uninformed when discussing certain subjects, and may disagree with a patient’s choices or beliefs,” they write. “However, this discomfort or disagreement cannot justify either offensive condescension or silent inaction.” * This article has been updated to clarify that the study the AAP press release referenced measured cancer deaths among people under the age of 24."

By TED HESSON 02/07/2017 10:00 AM EST Presented by Value Our Families With help from Marianne LeVine and Mel Leonor SHOWDOWN OVER TRUMP’S TRAVEL BAN: The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals will hear oral arguments at 6 p.m. ET to decide the immediate fate of President Donald Trump’s travel ban, which temporarily restricts citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries from visiting the U.S. and suspends the refugee resettlement program. The oral arguments (to be conducted over the phone) are the latest turn in a legal fight between Washington State and the federal government; this is the challenge with the broadest implications for the policy so far. After the plaintiffs
argued last week that the ban was discriminatory and would hurt the state’s economy, a federal judge in Seattle
issued a restraining order Friday that blocked implementation of the policy nationwide. The Trump administration wants to reinstate the executive order, and the Justice Department
filed a brief Monday that defended the president’s policy, arguing it “is a lawful exercise of the president’s authority over the entry of aliens into the United States and the admission of refugees.” The brief said the ban was intended to protect against terrorism, and it termed the Seattle district court’s nationwide injunction against the program “vastly overbroad.” A wide range of interest groups have rallied against the ban. Nearly 100 tech companies — including Apple, Facebook, Airbnb, Netflix, Google and Uber —
filed an amicus brief Sunday that said Trump’s order “inflicts significant harm on American business, innovation, and growth.” Academics, refugee organizations, and former senior national security officials all joined the chorus against the travel ban, and
filed amicus briefs in recent days. On Monday, Washington State (joined by Minnesota)
submitted a brief to the court that argued residents would undergo “grievous harms” in employment, education, business, family relations, and freedom to travel if the ban took effect. Despite the high drama, it’s important to remember that the appeals court decision will determine only whether a temporary restraining order against the ban will remain in place. “They’re not going to decide the ultimate legality of the executive order,” Lee Gelernt, a senior attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, told Morning Shift. Once the appeals court rules, both parties will need to decide whether they want to petition the Supreme Court to intervene (which it may or may not choose to do). An alternative option would be to let the federal judge in Seattle reach a decision in the case and then consider a possible appeal afterward. The oral arguments will be available via livestream

PUZDER’S UNDOCUMENTED HELP: The Huffington Post’s Ryan Grim reports that fast-food executive Andrew Puzder, Trump’s nominee for Labor secretary, employed an undocumented immigrant as household help. “Hiring undocumented workers has sunk nominees in the past, particularly when it reflects directly on the scope of the Cabinet position,” Grim writes. “But Trump transition officials told Puzder that the previous rules for vetting and strict ethics no longer applied.” The White House provided Grim with a statement from Puzder. “My wife and I employed a housekeeper for a few years, during which I was unaware that she was not legally permitted to work in the U.S.,” he said. “When I learned of her status, we immediately ended her employment and offered her assistance in getting legal status. We have fully paid back taxes to the IRS and the State of California and submitted all required paperwork.” (That last statement left us scratching our heads. If Puzder thought she was a legal worker, why wasn’t he paying payroll taxes for her all along?) As Grim points out, the fact that Puzder hired an undocumented worker is hardly his biggest problem in the nomination process. Puzder, CEO of CKE Restaurants (parent company of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s), has taken heat for various labor abuses by franchisees. He’s also been scrutinized over domestic-abuse claims (since retracted) by his ex-wife, who discussed
the alleged abuse in disguise and under an assumed name on “The Oprah Winfrey Show.” Still, you can add Puzder’s
Zoe Baird problem to the list of vulnerabilities likely to be discussed at his (indefinitely delayed) nomination hearing. More from Huffington Post
here. SCOTT WALKER GETS SHERMANESQUE: Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said Monday that he would not accept a nomination for Labor secretary were Puzder to drop out. “I’m not going to be in the Cabinet,” he told
reporters. Walker’s statement came after Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wisc.)
tweeted Monday that he was “hearing rumors in DC that Scott Walker wants Labor Secretary if Andy Puzder’s nomination falls through.” Pocan
added that the rumor “started after Walker discussed labor issues w/ @VP Pence.” To whoever started the rumor: Get better sources. TODAY: KELLY TO TESTIFY: DHS Sec. John Kelly will appear before the House Homeland Security Committee at 10 a.m. in the House Visitor Center, Room 210. According to the committee, Kelly will discuss his short- and long-term plans to secure the border. He’ll also face some grilling from Democrats, an aide for a committee member told Morning Shift. Dems will press Kelly on two executive orders--the travel ban, of course, and also the one that called for construction of a wall along the Mexican border. The aide said Kelly can expect to hear that the travel ban was “ill-conceived, poorly drafted, un-vetted [and] badly executed.” On the wall, Dems will stress that the cost (in the neighborhood of
$20 billion) would be paid by U.S. taxpayers, not Mexican ones, as the president has promised. COTTON, TRUMP PLOT CRACKDOWN: “Overlooked in [Trump’s] campaign crusade against illegal immigration was his vow to crack down on legal immigration, too,” POLITICO’S Seung Min Kim reports. “Now, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), a reliable Trump ally, is taking steps to execute that part of the president’s immigration vision — and it could provoke a showdown between two competing ends of the GOP: the working-class populists led by Trump and the establishment Chamber of Commerce wing.” “The outspoken, 39-year-old Cotton has written the first in what may be a series of bills to revamp the nation’s immigration system,” she writes. “Cotton’s new legislation, being formally proposed Tuesday with Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) and detailed exclusively with POLITICO in advance of its release, swings an axe at the nation’s green-card system by eliminating several avenues for U.S. citizens and permanent residents to sponsor family members for green cards.” “Right now, U.S. citizens and permanent residents can sponsor a variety of family members, including spouses, parents, siblings and married adult children. Cotton and Perdue’s plan would allow only spouses and unmarried minor children to get green cards, although they would permit a modest number of visas for aging adult parents whose American children are their caretakers.” More
here. GORSUCH HEARTS BUSINESS: Trump’s nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court is good news for business groups, Sam Hananel and Laurie Kellman write for the A.P. “Gorsuch has criticized courts for giving too much power to government agencies that enforce the nation’s labor and employment laws,” Hananel and Kellman write. “As a lawyer in private practice, he also backed curbs on some class-action lawsuits. His conservative approach could tip the balance in labor rights cases and other high court clashes that have split the court.” “In a closely watched case the Supreme Court is expected to hear later this year, the justices will decide whether companies can require workers to sign away their right to pursue class-action lawsuits. The National Labor Relations Board says such waiver agreements violate the rights of millions of workers who want to sue over wage disputes and other workplace clashes.” More
here. FRIEDRICHS II: A California law that compels union-nonmember teachers and other public employees to pay “fair share fees” to a union that bargains collectively on their behalf is once again being challenged in court. A lawsuit was filed this week by the Center for Individual Rights, which was also behind
Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association — a similar challenge that split the Supreme Court following Justice Antonin Scalia’s death. “With judicial nominations now moving forward, it is imperative to have the issue ready for the full Supreme Court to consider,” the organization said in a written statement. The new challenge,
Yohn v. California Teachers Association, was filed on behalf of eight California teachers. Read more

DHS ‘BEACHHEAD’ TEAM MEMBERS ON IMMIGRATION, ISLAM: An organizational chart obtained by Morning Shift lists several dozen members of the so-called “beachhead” team at DHS, a group tasked with running the department until permanent staffers are in place. (The White House did not respond to a request to confirm the team members, so it’s possible this list may not be completely up to date.) Here are some with a background in immigration policy: Jon Feere, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement: Feere is a legal policy analyst at the Center for Immigration Studies, a non-profit organization that aims to reduce legal and illegal immigration. He’s spoken out in favor of tougher enforcement measures and empowering ICE agents (“Btw, we already have a deportation force,” he
tweeted in August. “It's called Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) — Obama's just hamstringing them.”). He also
backs a crackdown on so-called “sanctuary cities” that limit cooperation with federal immigration officials. Feere has questioned whether the children of undocumented immigrants should be entitled to birthright citizenship under the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment. In a 2015 op-ed, he
said Trump “could direct his agencies to issue Social Security numbers and passports only to newborns who have at least one parent who is a citizen or permanently domiciled immigrant.” Julie Kirchner, U.S. Customs and Border Protection: Kirchner was executive director at the Federation for American Immigration Reform, another group that favors dramatically lower immigration levels. Kirchner advised the Trump campaign on immigration issues and brings a hawk’s mentality to CBP, the parent agency to Border Patrol. In a statement to Breitbart in September, Kirchner
said “instead of providing free healthcare to millions of refugees, we must focus on rebuilding our inner cities and bringing jobs back to America.” The Southern Poverty Law Center, a liberal group,
said Kirchner’s appointment makes FAIR “the latest of extremist groups suddenly enjoying a direct line to federal power.” Katie Gorka, DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis: Gorka is a national security analyst who has focused intensely on the “radical Islamists” and the Islamic State. She has criticized the Obama administration for failing to recognize the threat of Muslim terrorists (“The United States must stop the misguided narrative that terrorism and extremism have nothing to do with Islam,” she
wrote in a May 2014 Breitbart article). Gorka advised the presidential campaign of Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) and heads up two organizations, the Council on Global Security (its website is currently offline, but you can view a version from early October
here) and the Threat Knowledge Group (also offline; see a mid-November version
here). Gorka’s husband, former Breitbart national security editor Sebastian Gorka, is a deputy assistant to Trump. Frank Wuco, White House senior advisor: Wuco is a national security expert and the CEO of Red Mind Solutions, a company that provides consulting, training and data analysis services. He spent 23 years as an intelligence officer in the U.S. Navy. Wuco has said in statements to the media that there’s a strong connection between mainstream Islam and terror attacks. Following the mass shooting in an Orlando nightclub in June, Wuco
told Breitbart News,. “There's nothing radical about him at all. He is a Muslim who is following the strictures of Islam and its guidance and prescriptions for violence and warfare against unbelievers…. If you're a Muslim, you believe it's being prescribed by God.” In his work as a consultant, he’s
role-played as a fictional jihadist, Fuad Wasul. TODAY: HOUSE RULES COMMITTEE TAKES ON ANOTHER OBAMA LABOR REG: The House Rules Committee will consider a Congressional Review Act
resolution today to block an
Obama Labor Department rule that clarified for state unemployment agencies the circumstances under which they may test benefit applicants for drug use. Under the 2012 Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act, state unemployment agencies were permitted to subject benefit applicants to a drug test if they were fired previously for drug use or if they applied for a job that required routine drug tests. The Labor Department’s rule, published in August, gave state agencies a list of occupations that fall within that category. The House Rules Committee will discuss the resolution at 3 p.m. in the Capitol, room H-313. PHILLY, DOJ REACH AGREEMENT ON DISABILITY CASE: The City of Philadelphia agreed to reinstate a sanitation worker who was fired because of a disability, under a proposed consent decree
filed by the Justice Department. After a heart attack, the employee’s doctor told him he could no longer lift more than 20 pounds. He asked the city for a different job, but the city fired him instead. According to the proposed consent decree, the city will reassign him and provide up to $90,000 in back pay and damages. More
here. QUESTIONS FOR CBP: California lawmakers want details from the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection about how the agency has enforced Trump’s travel ban at Los Angeles International Airport. In a letter to the acting commissioner, the lawmakers cite reports that travelers have been forced to sign a form relinquishing their right to enter and remain in the U.S. Read the letter here
here. PARENTAL LEAVE FOR ALL?: The Trump administration may be reconsidering the paid leave proposal the president announced on the campaign trail. The plan would grant paid leave to biological mothers, but exclude dads and adoptive parents. “Aparna Mathur, a resident scholar in economic policy at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning research group, said she spoke in December to a ‘lower-level’ member of Trump’s transition team about the President’s idea,” Danielle Paquette writes in the Washington Post. “Staffers were considering one key revision, she said: turning maternity leave into parental leave — a benefit that fathers, too, could access.” More

578334601,2017-02-08 12:18:34,No Moral Equivalence Between the Tea Party and the ‘Resistance’,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/0fzVehl-lfg/,en,False,,19334,Breitbart,http://www.breitbart.com,"Mainstream media journalists have begun to justify the militancy, and violence, of the Democrats’ so-called “resistance” by referring to the Tea Party’s protests at town hall meetings and elsewhere in 2009-10. But there is no parallel and no moral equivalence between a nonpartisan grass-roots opposition movement that wanted to broaden public debate, and a hyper-partisan “community organizer” campaign that rejects normal politics, aims to disrupt public debate and stifle free speech. As I documented in my book Wacko Birds: The Fall (and Rise) of the Tea Party, the movement had its roots in opposition to President George W. Bush’s bailout of Wall Street, emerged in the wake of President Barack Obama’s disastrous “stimulus,” and became a potent political movement in opposition to Obamacare. President Obama had wanted his health care bill passed by the late summer of 2009, and sent Democratic members of Congress to their districts to explain a bill they had not read. To many Americans, this was the third in a series of major pieces of legislation that was being forced down their throats with no real debate. They arrived at town hall meetings to ask questions — and, yes, to protest. But the real disruption was on the other side, as Democrats organized activists to stifle public opposition. At one town hall in suburban Chicago, for example, left-wing activists conspired to block members of the public from asking questions — and were caught red-handed on video.  To the extent there was violence at the town hall meetings, it was almost always carried out against Tea Party members. Meanwhile, the mainstream media vilified the Tea Party, playing up Democrats’ accusations that it was a racist organization. The worst of many examples of media misinformation was the false accusation that protesters at an anti-Obamacare rally on Capitol Hill had used the “N-word” against members of the Congressional Black Caucus — a claim for which no evidence was ever found. Since the midterm sweep of 2010, Democrats have been looking for their own Tea Party — and the media have been eager to help, doting on the new “movements” with generous media coverage while covering up their violence and extremist rhetoric. First there was Occupy Wall Street in 2011, then Black Lives Matter in 2014-16, and now the “Resistance” — a name hinting at the Hunger Games and ultimately at the Second World War, implying that our elected government is a totalitarian regime.  After Rep. Tom McClintock (R-CA) had to leave a town hall last week under police guard, and leftists rioted to stop Breitbart Tech editor Mio Yiannopoulos from speaking at UC Berkeley, Republican politicians, understandably, fear for their safety, as Politico’s Rachel Bade reports. But Bade writes, erroneously: “Protesters have disrupted town halls and other public events, jeering and yelling at Republicans just as conservatives did to Democrats when they were writing the law eight years ago.” There is no equivalence whatsoever. The Tea Party showed up at town halls to be heard; the “Resistance” is showing up to stop people from being heard. Moreover, they are doing so against a background of lies by the Democratic Party, which is sowing fear with defamatory e-mail campaigns warning supporters about a “white supremacist” presence in the White House, complete with the sort of “targeting” imagery the media belatedly complained about after the Tucson mass shooting in 2011.  There is a path back to political relevance, and perhaps political power, for the left. It is simple: find policies and messages that appeal to the sort of voters who once backed Obama but switched to Donald Trump last November. Instead, Democrats and their “base” are feeding each other’s hysteria, talking about impeachment as the media openly imagine the assassination of the new president. They are creating justifications for violence, which false comparisons to the Tea Party only reinforce. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

On Wednesday, Dec. 2, 2015, an attack by husband-and-wife assailants on a holiday luncheon for county health employees killed 14 people. Investigators say the attackers were inspired by the Islamic State group. (San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department via AP) (The Associated Press) WASHINGTON – A White House list of what it calls underreported terrorist attacks did not support President Donald Trump's claim that the media are downplaying a ""genocide"" carried out by the Islamic State group. But it did shine new light on the difficulty in defining the scope, source and motives behind the violence carried out in the name of radical Islam. A close review of the 78 attacks listed by the White House shows almost all the attacks were reported by the news media and that many were widely covered by local and international outlets. The review, carried out by Associated Press reporters on four continents, found that more than half of the attacks, including most of those in the Middle East, were linked to the Islamic State group, as the White House suggested. Others were ruled IS-inspired, but carried out by lone wolf attackers. But in some cases, the motive was unclear, and investigations as to possible extremist links were inconclusive. The examples range from knife-wielding assailants in Texas to hostage-takers in Australia to the gunman who killed at least 129 people across Paris in 2015. The magnitude of the attacks on the document circulated by the White House — which appeared to be hastily compiled and included several typos — ranges from several dozen dead to one or two people injured. It has some notable omissions. It did not include any attacks by Boko Haram, an Islamist insurgent group operating in West Africa that is responsible for far more deaths than the Islamic State. The group, which has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, has led an uprising that has killed more than 20,000 people and left 2.6 million homeless this decade in Nigeria and neighboring countries. It also pays little heed to the scores of terror acts that have plagued nations like Syria and Iraq that are close to the Islamic State's caliphate and under near-daily siege. The list itself was created to bolster the case for Trump's executive order restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries and suspending the U.S. refugee program. But that ban would not have prevented any of the terrorist attacks on the list that occurred in the United States. Here's a closer look at some of the attacks on the list: ___ UNITED STATES The inclusion of some of the attacks in the United States defies credulity. Among those on the White House's list are a deadly rampage in San Bernardino, California, in 2015 in which 14 people were killed and 21 injured, and the June 2016 nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, which left 49 dead, the biggest mass shooting in the nation's history. Both of those attacks received blanket news coverage for days, and all of the attacks in the U.S. received at least some attention by the American media. A 2015 attack in Garland, Texas, took place outside a venue hosting a provocative contest for Prophet Muhammad cartoons. According to trial testimony, the suspect, Elton Simpson, was an American Muslim who became the subject of a criminal investigation in 2006 because of his association ""with an individual whom the FBI believed was attempting to set up a terrorist cell in Arizona."" He was never found to have links to the Islamic State group or any other established radical groups. Non-fatal knife attacks on police officers in Boston and New York, a knife attack at a Minnesota mall and the shooting of a police officer in Philadelphia were also reported. ""The notion that terrorism is an under-covered subject is preposterous,"" said David H. Schanzer, director of Duke University's Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security. ""It's highly over-covered compared to the amount of violence that we face in society."" Citing a study his department recently published, Schanzer said, ""one out of every 2,000 homicides since 9/11 have been linked to al-Qaida or ISIS-inspiration or control."" ___ CANADA Two October 2014 attacks in Canada — one in Quebec and one in Ottawa — received media coverage in Canada, where attacks of this nature are rare. In Quebec, soldier Patrice Vincent was killed in an apparent act of homegrown terrorism. The suspect was known to police and had his passport seized to stop him from traveling to Syria. It was never determined whether the suspect had any ties to Islamic militant groups, though former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper described the suspect as an ""ISIL-inspired terrorist,"" referring to the Islamic State group by an acronym. In the Canadian capital, one soldier was killed at a war memorial and two were wounded in shootings at the Parliament building. Meanwhile, in Quebec last week, a gunman who reportedly held anti-immigrant views killed six men at a local mosque in an incident described by Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as a ""terrorist attack."" Trump has yet to personally comment on the attacks, although the White House did offer assistance to Trudeau. That attack wasn't listed. ___ EUROPE Across Europe, attacks are increasingly being attributed to the flow of refugees across the continent — and it's hard to find a single attack, large or small, that didn't generate global coverage. Trump himself used a non-fatal knife attack outside the Louvre in Paris last week to underscore his efforts to ban migrants from entering the U.S., writing on Twitter, ""A new radical Islamic terrorist has just attacked in Louvre Museum in Paris. Tourists were locked down. France on edge again. GET SMART U.S."" All of the attacks cited on the list in Europe were widely reported both by international and local media — some in real time. A 2015 attack at a Paris supermarket was covered live as it was happening. When the attacker, Amedy Coulibaly, pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group, it was urgently reported by The Associated Press and others. Links between the attackers and terror groups were also reported, although at times that did not happen until they were unearthed by investigators days later. In London, a 2015 knife attack by a man shouting ""this is for Syria"" at an underground rail station made headlines in newspapers around the world. Police said they treated it as a terrorist incident, although a link was never drawn between the attacker and any particular group. A 2014 attack on a police station by a Muslim convert in Joue-les-Tours, France, was reported by The Associated Press at the time and followed up with his brother's arrest in Burundi. AP did not report on any links to the Islamic State group, although British media later said he posted a black Islamic State flag on his Facebook page. ___ MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA The Muslim world is the front line in the battle against the Islamic State group, and civilians across the region have not been spared the group's deadly campaign. A number of attacks cited on the White House list occurred in Egypt. A 2015 attack on a camp used by a multinational peacekeeping force was reported by several news outlets, as was the Islamic State group claim. Other attacks occurred in Cairo in 2015, including one that resulted in the kidnapping and beheading of a Croatian national, and a car bomb at the Italian Consulate that left one dead. Both were claimed by the Islamic State group and reported worldwide. Additional attacks in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Tunisia and Turkey were also reported by various news outlets, citing officials who linked the attacks to the Islamic State group — a common claim by governments across the Middle East, even when dealing with lone wolf attackers. The White House list did not include any attacks in Iraq, Syria or Yemen, where civilians are targeted almost daily by militant attacks. Many of those attacks are covered by the media, despite the often-perilous conditions involved in reporting those stories. ___ AUSTRALIA Included on Trump's list is a standoff at a Sydney chocolatier in 2014. The incident drew round-the-clock coverage by the world's news outlets. A request by attacker Man Haron Monis for an Islamic State group flag during the faceoff fueled anxiety about the group's expanding influence across the globe. Monis himself was never determined to have had contact with the group. An incident shortly before that in Melbourne also made headlines when Human Haider was shot dead by police in connection with the stabbing of two police officers. Photographs on Haider's Facebook site included images of what appeared to be members of the Islamic State group. ___ Lemire reported from New York. Geir Moulson in Berlin; Jan Olsen in Copenhagen; Jill Lawless in London; Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow; Dominique Soguel in Basel, Switzerland; Adam Schreck in Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Rob Gillies in Toronto; Lori Hinnant in Paris; Andrew Meldrum in Johannesburg, South Africa; Rahim Faiez in Kabul, Afghanistan; and Leon Keith in Bangkok, Thailand, contributed to this report.

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee, File) (The Associated Press) FORT PIERCE, Fla. – An ex-convict who posted anti-Islamic rants online pleaded no contest Monday to setting fire to a mosque that the Orlando nightclub shooter occasionally attended and now faces up to 30 years in prison. Joseph Schreiber, dressed in a burnt orange jumpsuit, his wrists and ankles shackled, pleaded no during Monday's hearing before Circuit Judge Steven Levin. Schreiber answered Levin's questions in a clear, unwavering voice. A no contest plea is treated the same as a guilty plea. He had confessed to detectives that he set fire to the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce last Sept. 11, the 15th anniversary of the 2001 terrorist attacks. The damage to the mosque was so extensive that the leaders recently announced that it will move. Omar Mateen was killed by police after opening fire at the Pulse nightclub on June 12 in a rampage that left 49 victims dead and 53 wounded, making it the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Mateen professed allegiance to the Islamic State group. His father is among roughly 100 people who regularly attend the mosque. Schreiber, who is Jewish, posted on Facebook last July that ""All Islam is radical"" and that all Muslims should be treated as terrorists and criminals. Schreiber, 32, was previously sentenced twice to state prison for theft, according to records from the Florida Department of Corrections. The records show he served his first sentence from March 2008 to July 2009 and his second from June 2010 to August 2014. Last September, a former inmate who served time with Schreiber at the faith-based Lawtey Correctional Institution, described Schreiber as being a ""couple cans short of a six-pack."" Ralph Alfonso said Schreiber joined a Messianic Jewish group he led because he was looking for a place to fit in. Messianic Jews follow Jewish law and the Torah but also believe that Jesus Christ is the Messiah. He said Schreiber sometimes would say something negative about Muslims, but ""we would tell him that's not what we believe, that it is not godly."" A surveillance video from the mosque showed Schreiber driving up to the mosque on a motorcycle and approaching the building while talking on a cellphone. He carried a bottle of liquid and some papers and left when there was a flash. The first 911 calls were made about 45 minutes later, after the fire had spread to the attic. It took about four-and-a-half hours for firefighters to extinguish the blaze. No one was injured in the fire.

By BEN SCHRECKINGER February 15, 2017 Ben Schreckinger is a reporter for Politico. Ben Schreckinger is a reporter for Politico. Among the herd of reporters filing past an oil portrait of Hillary Clinton in the vaulted Center Hall of the White House on Monday afternoon walked Jim Hoft, publisher of the Gateway Pundit, a conservative blog founded at the outset of George W. Bushâs second term. It was a banner moment for the decade-old website, known for reporting obvious hoaxes as legitimate news and headlines such as: âEXPOSED=>HILLARY HITMAN Breaks Silenceâ and âDental Expert: Hillary Clinton Is Suffering From Serious Gum Infectionâ and âOne Week After Election Loss Hillary Clinton Looks Like Death.â Hoft was on his way to his first White House news conference in the company of self-described âbrand strategistâ Lucian Wintrich, the Gateway Punditâs inaugural White House correspondent, who for his first day on the job wore a blue tie studded with elephants in every color of the rainbow to announce his gay Republican pride. Briefly disoriented upon entering the majestic East Room, the pair soon located the gold-painted chairs that had been reserved for them and settled in for President Donald Trumpâs joint appearance with the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau. Gateway Punditâs mission in expanding the websiteâs White House coverage is, according to Wintrich â a 2012 Bard College graduate with ruffled hair and tortoise-rimmed glasses who could pass for a precociously dressed high school student ââto help drain the press swampâ by covering the press corpsâ âvery leftist and biased reporting.â Their arrival, at the invitation of Trumpâs team, represents the latest in the tug of war between the administration and the mainstream media for control of The Narrative. All administrations play politics with media access. Barack Obama circumvented the media filter by granting sit-downs to YouTube stars, and, at one infamous 2005 news conference, George W. Bush called on a sycophantic conservative blogger who, it was later revealed, worked as a male prostitute before being given a White House press pass. But none of that matches the early efforts of the Trump administration, which has labeled the media âthe opposition partyâ in a struggle to define the nature of reality itself. To that end, the Trump team has gotten to work quickly, stacking its briefings in its favor. In its first week in the White House, Trumpâs communications team installed screens in the briefing room to allow journalists outside Washington â including conservative talk radio hosts â to participate. Sean Spicer â the White House press secretary who has achieved a perverse form of celebrity in the form of a brutal impersonation on âSaturday Night Liveâ â has also taken to calling on pro-Trump news outlets in an apparent attempt to deflect hard questions. On Friday, at a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump called only on outlets owned by Rupert Murdoch, who has aggressively courted the new president and whose flagship newspaper, The Wall Street Journal, is being roiled by the discontent of reporters who feel it has been too soft on Trump (at a staff meeting on Monday, the paperâs editor dismissed such concerns as âfake newsâ). On Monday, in the minutes before Trump and Trudeau appeared, a correspondent for One America News, a fledgling network that has emerged as a consistent Trump cheerleader to the nationalist right of Fox News, stood for a live shot at the front of the East Room next to Foxâs John Roberts and CNNâs Sara Murray. During the news conference, the only questions from American outlets went to the right-leaning Daily Caller and to Sinclair Broadcasting Networkâs WJLA, which reportedly struck a deal with Trumpâs son-in-law, Jared Kushner, during the campaign to gain more access to Trump in exchange for less-critical coverage. Both reporters conspicuously avoided asking Trump about the hottest story of the day: the status of embattled national security adviser Michael Flynn, who resigned hours later over revelations he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Trump and Trudeau were instead asked questions about trade and border security. Afterward, the tall, snowy-haired Hoft offered his take on this, his first such event: âKind of quick,â he said. Indeed, things are moving fast. The president did not call on the Gateway Pundit on Monday, nor did Spicer during his White House briefing on Tuesday, but it appears that it is only a matter of time before they do. In its zeal for seizing on anything that makes Trump look good and the left and the mainstream media look bad, the site has published a number of obviously false stories, often deleting the posts after their source material is exposed as a parody, a hoax or just plain wrong. Gateway Pundit has gained notice for a number of its recent missteps, including reporting that an Asian woman seen photographing Rex Tillersonâs notes at a Senate confirmation hearing was Washington Post homepage editor Doris Truong, which it was not. The site later updated its post to note that the woman in question was not Truong and to accuse the mainstream media of having âcircled the wagonsâ to avoid reporting of the true identity of this mysterious woman. During the campaign, the site claimed that photos of hundreds of thousands of people in the streets of Cleveland showed the crowd for a Trump rally when, in fact, the photos depicted a victory parade for the NBA champion Cavaliers, and during the inauguration, it reported as real a hoax picture that had been poorly photoshopped to make it appear as though Obama was touching Melania Trumpâs rear end during the transfer of power. In response to critics who call the site âfake news,â Wintrich said that other online outlets, like BuzzFeed and The Huffington Post, have also run with stories that were later debunked, and that âincorrect information slip-upsâ are an inevitable if unfortunate consequence of a competitive new media environment in which everyone is racing to be first. âJust because the Gateway Pundit is a conservative site, I feel itâs criticized for that unfairly,â he said. Hoft founded the website in 2005 and has grown it from a one-man operation into a site with a network of paid contributors and a handful of paid staffers. Wintrich said the operation is profitable and that its sole source of revenue is advertising. Its name refers to Hoftâs hometown of St. Louis, Americaâs proverbial Gateway to the West. A friend of the late culture warrior Andrew Breitbart, Hoft has spent years in the trenches of the conservative blogosphere, making him an intimate of Trumpâs chief strategist, Steve Bannon, who took over Breitbart News after its namesakeâs death in 2012. Before he joined Trumpâs campaign, Bannon had hosted Hoft and Hoftâs identical twin, Joe, a business executive in Hong Kong, on his Breitbart morning radio show. In 2013, when Hoft fell ill with sepsis â suffering five strokes, losing an eye and getting a knee replaced â Bannon looked after the Gateway Punditâs day-to-day operations. âHe hasnât been the demon people portray him as,â Hoft said. The Gateway Pundit is often described a mini-Breitbart News with Hoft playing the role of Bannon to Wintrichâs Milo Yiannopoulos, the flamboyantly gay provocateur and Breitbart tech editor who has sought to translate the conservative outsider brand for a younger audience. Gabe Gonzalez, a correspondent for the progressive news site Mic who has feuded with Wintrich on social media and rebuffed Wintrichâs repeated attempts to challenge him to a debate about identity politics, described Wintrich as a âknockoff Milo.â (Wintrich, for his part, called Mic a âtrash publication.â) Like Breitbart News, the Gateway Pundit became an early and fierce advocate of Trumpâs presidential campaign, reporting obsessively on the size of his crowds and on dubious accounts of Ted Cruzâs alleged extramarital affairs under headlines like âCuban Mistress Crisis.â It has turned out to be a Faustian bargain: Hoftâs erstwhile friendships with anti-Trump conservatives like Daily Wireâs Ben Shapiro and the Blazeâs Dana Loesch have soured, degenerating into sniping on Twitter, but traffic has boomed. Hoft said he averaged 1 million page views a day during the campaign â with headlines like âBlack Muslim Chases, Tackles White Trump Supporterâ and âWHOA! It Sounds Like Chris Matthews Just Endorsed Trumpâ â and that the site is now averaging 800,000 views a day. Last June, in the wake of a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Hoft came out as gay. A month later, he met Wintrich at the Gays for Trump party at the Republican National Convention, where the far-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders delivered a fiery broadside against Islam in front of photos taken by Wintrich of scrawny, shirtless men posing seductively in âMake America Great Againâ hats. Wintrich, an organizer of the event, scuttled up and down three flights of stairs in a gold-embroidered MAGA hat and snapped photos of guests including Yiannopoulos and anti-Islam crusader Pamela Geller. In August, Wintrich was fired from his advertising job in New York, which his lawyer later alleged was illegal retaliation for his political activities. (Wintrich said the matter has been settled out of court.) After the election, Hoft said he approached Trumpâs transition team about setting up a White House correspondent. In January, at Deploraball, an unofficial inauguration party at the National Press Club for Trumpâs biggest super-fans, Hoft made public his plan and announced that Wintrich would fill the role, prompting elated attendees to break into chants of âReal news! Real news!â The pairâs arrival at the White House on Monday did not go unnoticed. As a Politico reporter peppered them with questions, a conservative documentary crew filmed us, and a correspondent for The New Yorker made arrangements to rendezvous with them later. âIt feels like being the new kid in school,â said Wintrich, who had stopped for a smoke break on the concrete steps outside the briefing room. Earlier, Hoft had tweeted a photo of himself and Wintrich posing at the briefing room podium along with a reference to Pepeâthe cartoon frog who is considered a hate symbol by the Anti-Defamation League and a harmless mascot by many Trump supportersâprompting David Brockâs left-leaning Media Matters to publish a post titled, âA Dangerous Troll Is Now Reporting From The White House.â Wintrich, whose undergraduate thesis was titled âThe new media as a political tool,â called the Media Matters post âcute.â Brockâs group has also compiled a running list of the siteâs âabsurdly wrongâ posts, including one headlined âRats Jump Shipâ that reported on allegations that Michelle Obama had scrubbed her social media account of mentions of Hillary Clinton, which she had not. Despite it having received an âAccuracy in Mediaâ award at a conservative conference in 2013, such egregious errors are earning the Gateway Pundit criticism from the right as well. On Tuesday morning, anti-Trump conservative Erick Erickson greeted the pairâs arrival with a post titled, âTrump Invites a Cesspool of Fake News to Cover the White House.â And Shapiro, a former Breitbart columnist who left the site amid a bitter falling-out with Bannon over its coverage of the presidential race, said that while Democrats have benefited from the biases of mainstream media outlets, the Trump administrationâs gambits are far more brazen. âThe difference between what Obama did with the press generally is he drew from press people who were leftist-oriented. Trump is now drawing from outlets that are openly sycophantic,â Shapiro said. âIn a certain way, thatâs actually more honest, I guess, when they are talking to Pravda than when theyâre speaking to a â quote, unquote â âobjectiveâ news source that acts as Pravda.â But Hoft simply views his outlet as speaking for the heartland. âIâm in the Midwest,â he said. âPeople there feel completely different about the situation here.â Now that the Gateway Pundit is also in Washington, it remains to be seen how it fits in with the changing Beltway establishment, or doesnât. Wintrich declined to say whether the outlet is trying to join the White House Correspondentsâ Association, the group that represents the press corps he has come here to savage, saying only, âWeâre still working out all the details.â But on its first day, the publication was already adopting some of the capitalâs folkways. Late on Monday afternoon, former Trump campaign aide and conservative media connoisseur Sam Nunberg took a Politico reporterâs phone call while kibbitzing at Off the Record, the White House-adjacent basement bar favored by Washington insiders. Asked about the Gateway Pundit, Nunberg said that Hoft had just found his way to the bar and happened to be sitting at the next table. Then, Nunberg got Hoftâs attention and explained in a mischievously loud voice, âIt was part of the fake news for Trump during the primary.â At this, Hoft burst out laughing.

Breitbart News reported Jan. 3 that Democrat lawmakers in New Mexico were quietly pushing a requirement that every firearm sale–retail or private–be conducted via the auspices of a Federal Firearm License holder (FFL). This is the kind of the law that was passed in Washington state in November 2014 and did nothing to stop the September 23, 2016, mass shooting in a Burlington mall. It is also the same kind of law on the books in California, which did nothing to prevent the December 2, 2015, San Bernardino terror attack. But while such laws are powerless to stop determined attackers, they do pose a real hindrance to law-abiding citizens’ exercise of freedom. And in the case of New Mexico, sheriffs are warning that the state will follow in California’s footsteps; adding a gun registry to universal background checks because the checks are not enforceable without a registry. Thirty-two of the thirty-three sheriffs in New Mexico oppose the gun control on these grounds: “.. this scheme would be unenforceable without creating a gun registry.”#NewMexico https://t.co/GditbX4NlU — NRA (@NRA) February 8, 2017 Breitbart News has long warned that a gun registry is necessary for universal background checks to work, whether the checks are at a federal or state level. This is because the government has to know where every gun is if it wants to know whether a gun is changing hands in a private sale. And those who have paid attention have witnessed the scenario play out in California, where universal background checks have been complimented with firearm registration and gun confiscation laws. It is also worth noting that the checks being pushed in New Mexico are prone to fail and would not have stopped an attack like the one on the Orlando Pulse nightclub (because the Orlando attacker passed a background check for both his guns). So the ultimate result of the passage of the proposed checks in New Mexico could be the establishment of a gun registry.

          / CBS News With the specter of this month's mass shooting at an Oregon community college still hanging over the country, presidential contenders took on the politically charged topic of gun control during Tuesday's first Democratic primary debate. Hillary Clinton first blasted opponent Bernie Sanders for his positions on gun control. When asked if she believed the Vermont senator was tough enough on the issue, she responded, ""No, not at all."" ""I think that we have to look at the fact that we lose 90 people a day from gun violence,"" Clinton said. ""This has gone on too long, and it's time the entire country stood up against the NRA. The majority of our country supports background checks, and even the majority of gun owners do."" Sanders has a complicated history with gun control legislation, coming from a state with a strong hunting tradition where as recently as 2010 over half of adults owned guns. Though he has received a D- rating from the NRA, he's also voted in line with the conservative organization on legislation like 1993 Brady Act. Sanders voted against the bill, which demanded a waiting period and national background checks for gun buyers. Clinton also charged that her opponent had voted for an ""immunity provision"" for gun manufacturers so they wouldn't be held responsible in lawsuits for a gun misused by a third party. The act in question, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act passed by Congress in 2005 and voted for by Sanders in the House, gave manufacturers and dealers of small-caliber weapons protection from liability lawsuits. During the debate, Sanders called the measure ""a large and complicated bill."" ""There were provisions in it that I think made sense,"" he said. ""For example, do I think that a gun shop in the state of Vermont that sells a gun legally to somebody -- and that somebody goes out and does something crazy -- that that gun shop owner should be held responsible? I don't."" But, he added, ""On the other hand, where you have gun manufacturers and where you have gun shops knowingly giving guns to criminals - or aiding and abetting that, of course we should take action."" Clinton fired back. ""I voted against it,"" she said. ""I was in the Senate at the same time. It wasn't that complicated to me. It was pretty straightforward to me that he was going to give immunity to the only industry in America -- everybody else has to be accountable, but not the gun manufacturers. And we need to stand up and say enough of that. We're not going to let it continue."" In an exchange with former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, Sanders defended his positions as coming ""from a rural state."" ""The views on gun control in rural states are different than urban states whether we like it or not,"" Sanders said. ""Our job is to bring people together around strong common-sense gun legislation. I think there is a vast majority in this country who want to do the right thing and I intend to lead the country in bringing the people together."" O'Malley argued against the Vermont independent, saying that it was ""not about rural"" communities versus urban ones. The Maryland Democrat spoke of his own record in passing firearm regulations in his own state. ""We are able to pass this,"" he said of his state, ""and still respect the hunting traditions of people who lived in our rural areas and we did it by leading by principle not by pandering to the NRA."" Sanders shot back, ""I don't think I am pandering, but you have not been in the United States Congress.""

His refusal to admit gun laws had anything to do with the Sandy Hook school massacre earned him the title of the “craziest man on earth”. Today, LaPierre sits at the left hand of the president. Trump seems eager to flatter the National Rifle Association’s executive vice-president and CEO, the leader of the group that became one of his most loyal champions and spent more than $30m to back his candidacy.  In his second week as president, Trump called LaPierre to the White House for a special meeting of conservative leaders. Securing a new supreme court nominee who would guard the court’s favorable rulings on gun rights had been the NRA’s highest election priority, and Trump had just delivered it. The president asked LaPierre to introduce himself. “Wayne, I would say they know you,” said Trump, referring to the group of conservative leaders. “Perhaps they know you better than they know me.” LaPierre laughed, as did others around the room. “I doubt that,” he said. The photograph of LaPierre and Trump turned towards each other, the president eagle-eyed and benevolent, LaPierre’s face scrunched in a wide grin, is already being used by gun violence prevention groups as a fundraising tool. Trump has promised to support a sweeping pro-gun agenda, and the NRA has told its members that it’s finally time for the group “to go on offense”. But LaPierre’s ascendancy marks more than a shift towards ever looser gun laws. It’s a triumph for the political strategy that LaPierre perfected, one that has frequently been derided as extreme and paranoid. Trump won the White House, and is now governing the country, using the same playbook as LaPierre: always attack, never apologize and treat the news media as the opposition party. “If you want to understand some of the approach and personality of Donald Trump, I think you look at what Wayne LaPierre has been doing for a long time. He’s a little bit of a test run of what Trump been doing,” said Arkadi Gerney, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and longtime gun control advocate. Asked what Trump and LaPierre have most in common, Gerney said, simply: “Lying.” LaPierre’s spokesman, Andrew Arulanandam, declined to comment. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the president’s relationship with the NRA. LaPierre and other NRA leaders have long argued, even as the gun control movement has set increasingly modest aims, that Democrats’ real goal is confiscation of Americans’ firearms. LaPierre claimed that a narrow expansion of background check laws after Sandy Hook would be turned into a national registry of gun owners, something that is prohibited by federal law, and that the final background check legislation explicitly said it would not do. “The gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill,” a furious Barack Obama said after the legislation failed to advance in the Senate. “They claimed that it would create some sort of ‘big brother’ gun registry, even though the bill did the opposite. This legislation, in fact, outlawed any registry. Plain and simple, right there in the text. But that didn’t matter.” LaPierre’s antagonism towards the mainstream media and liberal politicians is rooted in some real failings. News reporting on American gun politics is sometimes marked by condescension of and ignorance towards gun owners. Democrats have continued to champion some anti-gun measures that have little evidence behind them. The assault weapon ban, for instance, is a symbolic policy that even a senior Obama administration admitted would be unlikely to save many lives. But for decades, LaPierre has also pushed an apocalyptic view of the United States as besieged by terrorists and violent criminals. Trump and his administration have embraced a similar dark vision of “American carnage”, which runs counter to crime data that show decades of increasing safety and declining violence. Trump has seized on a real recent uptick in murders as a devastating development. His new attorney general suggested this week, to the astonishment of America’s crime experts, that he believes the increase is a “dangerous permanent trend”. Like Trump, LaPierre has been criticized by liberals as a power-player who rakes in millions by fearmongering and railing against the establishment. Both men have been painted by the left as manipulators who fail to represent the true interests of their base, a view undermined by their continued popularity. When confronted with the dark side of America’s gun culture, LaPierre has gone on the offensive. Days after the Sandy Hook shooting in December 2012, which left 26 students and educators dead, LaPierre’s combative pro-gun press conference was widely derided as tone deaf and out of touch. In response to 20 first-graders being shot to death by a disturbed young man with a military-style rifle, LaPierre denied that guns were the problem. “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,” he told a room packed with reporters. LaPierre slammed “our nation’s refusal to create an active national database of the mentally ill”, and put the blame for the shooting on violent video games and Hollywood films, not the easy access to guns by deeply disturbed young men. To respond to the country’s mass shooting problem, he proposed a program to put armed police officers in every school in America. LaPierre almost dared the room of reporters to respond to his speech with “shocking headlines”, and they did. One Republican commentator called the speech “very haunting and very disturbing”. Chris Christie, then a potential Republican presidential contender, told a reporter: “I don’t necessarily think having an armed guard outside every classroom is conducive to a positive learning environment.” Billionaire gun control advocate Michael Bloomberg slammed LaPierre for offering a “paranoid, dystopian vision of a more dangerous and violent America where everyone is armed and no place is safe”. Despite the political fallout from this speech, the NRA would ultimately win out in the battle to block new federal gun control laws after Sandy Hook – a victory that cemented the group’s political influence, and its status as one of the most hated organizations for the left. Over the next years, despite a steady drumbeat of mass shootings, Congress refused to pass any new gun control legislation. Obama would continue to call out the NRA for pushing “conspiracy” and “the imaginary fiction in which Obama’s trying to take away your guns”, as he put it in 2016. He told a CNN town hall that year that he had repeatedly invited the NRA to speak with him, “but the conversation has to be based on facts and truth”. The NRA had simply declined to participate in the televised conversation about guns in America. Under previous Republican presidents, the NRA had been in the good graces of the White House. In 2000, an NRA official claimed that the group was so close with George W Bush that if he won, “we’ll have a president where we work out of their office – unbelievably friendly relations.” But LaPierre’s fierce anti-government rhetoric has at times alienated some Republican leaders. In 1995 LaPierre sent out a fundraising letter about the threat of “jack-booted government thugs”, a letter that came shortly before anti-government extremists carried out a terror attack in Oklahoma City. In response, former President George HW Bush publicly resigned from the NRA. “Your broadside against federal agents deeply offends my own sense of decency and honor; and it offends my concept of service to country,” the elder Bush wrote. “It indirectly slanders a wide array of government law enforcement officials, who are out there, day and night, laying their lives on the line for all of us.” LaPierre later apologized, saying the words were misunderstood. With Trump, the NRA is once again celebrating the optics of being a key ally of the White House. Trump came to the presidential campaign with little record as a gun rights champion. He once supported a ban on assault weapons. But NRA leaders endorsed him early, and stood with him through a careening candidacy that included his claim that “second amendment people” might be able to stop Hillary Clinton from appointing supreme court judges if she were elected, an offhand comment widely interpreted as a threat of violence or assassination. “We saw through the media deception, and recognized him for who he was: the most openly pro-second amendment presidential candidate in history,” LaPierre said in a recent video address to members. “They made a bet on an extreme candidate, and it paid off,” Gerney said. Gun control advocates are now sharing the photograph of LaPierre in the White House to rally their supporters for the coming fight over more expanded, permissive gun laws. After Sandy Hook, LaPierre “lied to the faces of grieving Americans and tried to convince them that the only thing capable of keeping them safe is a gun”, Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat and one of Congress’s most vocal gun control supporters, said in a statement. “That has never been true and it will never be true. “When you exaggerate and you mislead people and you fearmonger and you intensify people’s beliefs and divide people,” that strategy “may overwhelm a more disorganized, better-informed majority perspective”, said Gerney, the longtime gun control advocate. “But, at some point, if the more diverse majority coalition can coalesce, then you may have discredited yourself from being at the table.”","Donald Trump seems eager to flatter the National Rifle Association’s executive vice-president and CEO, once described as the ‘craziest man on earth’ Last modified on Thu 7 Jan 2021 00.07 GMT Four years ago, Wayne LaPierre’s face was plastered across New York’s tabloid covers as a “gun nut” and a “loon”.

          / CBS/AP The school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, now ranks among the most deadly mass shootings in American history. With at least 17 dead, the Valentine's Day shooting is worse than the Virginia Tech and Columbine shootings. Two of the deadliest mass shootings in modern U.S. history happened just 35 days apart in 2017. The Las Vegas shooting at the Route 91 music festival near the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino on Oct. 1 left 58 people dead and hundreds wounded. Then five weeks later, on Nov. 5, at least 26 people were killed by a gunman at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. News of shooting incidents at everyday places like offices, schools and shopping malls seem to have become numbingly common, and a 2014 FBI study found that the number of mass shootings has increased in recent years. Here is a look at the some of the worst mass shootings this country has seen. October 1, 2017: A shooting at a music festival on the Las Vegas Strip killed 58 people and wounded more than 500 others. The gunman, Stephen Paddock, 64, of Mesquite, Nevada, opened fire on thousands of people gathered at an outdoor music festival from a hotel room window on the Las Vegas strip. Paddock was found dead when police entered the hotel room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino across Las Vegas Boulevard from the Route 91 Harvest country music festival. ""We believe it's a solo actor. A lone wolf,"" Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said. Police said more than 20 firearms were found in Paddock's hotel room, including some modified to fire like fully automatic weapons. At least 18 more firearms, thousands of rounds of ammunition and some explosives were found at his home in Mesquite. June 12, 2016: A gunman armed with an assault-type rifle and a handgun opened fire inside a crowded gay nightclub in Orlando in a rampage and hostage standoff that lasted three hours before he was killed in a gunfight with SWAT officers, police said. The gunman was identified as 29-year-old Omar Mateen. Mateen pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) during the attack. His wife, Noor Salman, is facing charges of aiding and abetting and obstruction in federal court; she has pleaded not guilty to helping her husband. April 16, 2007: Seung-Hui Cho, 23, killed 32 people in two shooting scenes at a dorm and then in a classroom building on the Virginia Tech campus in Blacksburg, Virginia. He then killed himself. Dec. 14, 2012:  Adam Lanza, 20, opened fire at Sandy Hook Elementary School, killing 20 children and six staff members before killing himself. His mother, Nancy Lanza, was also found shot to death at their home. Nov. 5, 2017: Police say Devin Patrick Kelley opened fire with a military-style rifle, killing 26 and wounding at least 20 at a Sunday church service, in the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history. Authorities say Kelley apparently shot and killed himself in his car after a chase.

598230195,2017-02-07 07:00:00,Here's a recap of Trump's third week in office,http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-trump-third-week-20170207-story.html,en,False,,6,LA Times,http://www.latimes.com/,
577906215,2017-02-07 20:08:18,Trump&#8217;s Bogus Terrorist Claim,http://www.factcheck.org/2017/02/trumps-bogus-terrorist-claim/,en,False,,798,FactCheck,http://factcheck.org/,"By Brooks Jackson, Eugene Kiely, Lori Robertson and Robert Farley Posted on February 7, 2017 | Updated on February 8, 2017 At a military base in Florida, President Donald Trump complained that “radical Islamic” terrorist attacks are “not even being reported” by the “very, very dishonest press.” That’s nonsense. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer later revised Trump’s criticism of the media by claiming the president was talking about terrorist attacks that have gone “underreported,” not unreported. But that’s not what the president said. Trump and Spicer were both proven wrong when the White House produced a list of “underreported” terrorist attacks that contained numerous widely covered terrorist attacks over the last two years, including the Orlando, Florida, mass shooting that left 49 people dead and the San Bernardino, California, attack that killed 14. The White House list also included the Nov. 13, 2015, attack in Paris that killed more than 130 people; the Bastille Day attack last year in Nice, France, that killed 84 people; and the bombing attacks at an airport and on a subway train in Brussels on March 22, 2016, that killed at least 31 people. All were, obviously, widely covered. Trump made his remarks at MacDill Air Force Base. Trump, Feb. 6: Radical Islamic terrorists are determined to strike our homeland as they did on 9/11; as they did from Boston to Orlando, to San Bernardino. And all across Europe, you’ve seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe it’s happening. It’s gotten to a point where it’s not even being reported and, in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report it. They have their reasons and you understand that. What terrorist attacks are “not even being reported”? When asked, Spicer backtracked and said that Trump was complaining about “underreported attacks.” Spicer, Feb. 6: Look, I think the president’s comments were very clear at the time. He felt as though members of the media don’t always cover some of those events to the extent that other events might get covered; that a protest will get blown out of the water, and yet an attack or a foiled attack doesn’t necessarily get the same coverage. The White House then provided a list of 78 attacks that were carried out by terrorists or suspected terrorists from September 2014 to December 2016. We searched Nexis, a news database, for coverage of all 78 incidents and found tens of thousands of news articles, TV news transcripts and news wire accounts of the attacks and subsequent stories related to these attacks. Several of the suspected terrorist attacks described as “not … reported” (Trump) or “underreported” (Spicer) received so much global press coverage that Nexis could not return all search results — instead it provided just a warning that the search would yield more than 3,000 results. In addition to the five high-profile attacks we mentioned earlier — in Orlando, San Bernardino, France and Belgium — the White House list included these other incidents that yield more than 3,000 results in our Nexis search for “all English language news”: All of those attacks can be found on CNN’s website, which lists 143 terrorist attacks through July 25, 2016. Extensive media coverage was not limited to attacks that resulted in the loss of innocent lives. Our search turned up heavy coverage for attacks listed by the White House that resulted in no one other than the attackers being killed: Simpson, Soofi and Rahim are listed in a federally funded report for the U.S. Department of Justice as “deceased American jihadists.” It is not clear, however, if the Ohio incident was a terrorist attack. The Columbus Dispatch reported that Barry “had been on a watch list for ‘espousing extremist views,’” but FBI agents “didn’t use the words ‘terrorism’ or ‘terrorist’” at the time to describe the attack. The White House list also includes at least two attacks that do not appear to be terrorist attacks at all: Update, Feb. 8: Mia Ayliffe-Chung’s mother, Rosie Ayliffe, said the murders of her daughter and Jackson should not have appeared on the White House list of terrorist attacks. In an open letter to Trump on Facebook, Ayliffe wrote that “an Islamic terror attack was discounted in the early stages of the police investigation.” For sure, there are some suspected terrorist attacks that were not widely reported. But we found that those were generally in far-flung places that, for the most part, did not result in any deaths. The White House listed, for example, these nonfatal attacks that received little U.S. media coverage: a June 9, 2015, rocket attack targeting an airport in el Gorah, Egypt; a roadside bombing attack that injured four U.S. soldiers in el Gorah, Egypt; and the shooting of two U.S. defense contractors in Saudi Arabia in January 2015. (We note that nine of the 78 attacks listed by the White House were in Egypt, which has been struggling with “a long-running insurgency in the region that has grown since the 2011 popular uprising against longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak,” the former president of Egypt, according to U.S. News and World Report.) President Trump’s criticism of the media and the reporting on terrorist attacks comes at a time when the Department of Justice is in federal court defending the president’s executive order — Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States. The order seeks to impose a 90-day travel ban on the citizens of seven predominately Muslim countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. It also would suspend the refugee program indefinitely for Syrians and for 120 days for all other refugees. A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order on Feb. 3 that for now blocks enforcement of portions of Trump’s order. We will leave it to the courts to decide the merits of Trump’s executive order. But we judge that his claim that terrorist attacks are “not even being reported” by the “very, very dishonest press” is unsupported by the facts. Q: How do people who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19 pose a risk to people who have been vaccinated? A: An unvaccinated person who is infected with COVID-19 poses a much greater risk to others who are also unvaccinated. But vaccines are not 100% effective, so there is a chance that an unvaccinated person could infect a vaccinated person — particularly the vulnerable, such as elderly and immunocompromised individuals."

684050959,,"Orlando shooter was ""cool and calm"" at the end",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/orlando-omar-mateen-cool-and-calm-police-negotiators-pulse-nightclub/,en,False,,1752,CBS News,http://www.cbsnews.com/,"Watch CBSN Live  Updated on:  June 13, 2016 / 3:14 PM
          / CBS News ORLANDO - At about 5 a.m. on Sunday, Omar Mateen was in the bathroom of Pulse nightclub in Orlando holding several hostages, the city's top cop said. He had been making phone calls and spoken with hostage negotiators, seeming all the while to be ""cool and calm,"" said Orlando Police chief John Mina at a press conference Monday giving updates on the Orlando mass shooting that left 49 people dead, in addition to Mateen. Mina said it was then that he made the decision to send in the SWAT team. ""We believed further loss of life was imminent"" based on what Mateen was telling people, Mina said. As the country holds vigils for the dozens of the victims, questions about the 29-year-old shooter and the police decision to storm the club known for tolerance for all people are only beginning to find answers. Mina said at first the SWAT team attempted to breach a wall of the club with an explosive, but didn't succeed in fully knocking it down. So they sent in an armored vehicle to finish the job, rescued dozens of hostages, and engaged in a ferocious shootuout with Mateen. After it was over, it ended up being the worst mass shooting in American history. The Pulse nightclub - which describes itself as Orlando's hottest gay bar -- had been hosting a Latin night. Mateen called 911 during his nearly three-hour, well-armed standoff inside the club and pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS.) While ISIS took credit for the attack, investigators have so far uncovered no clear links between the shooter and its Syria-based terrorist administrators. FBI Director James Comey on Monday echoed President Obama's statement that the Orlando shooting was not a foreign-born plot and he also outlined the agency's previous interactions with the shooter. ""So  far, we see no indication that this was a plot directed from outside  the United States and we see no indication that he was part of any kind  of network,"" Comey told reporters. The intelligence community,  Comey said, is ""highly confident that this killer was radicalized at  least in part through the Internet."" Investigators have already seized electronics from the suspect's residence, including a  laptop computer, a Kindle and cell phones, a law enforcement source told CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton. The electronic devices are  being analyzed at the FBI lab in Quantico, Va., with the highest priority  being what he was looking at on the Internet and who he was  communicating with just prior to the attack. The source said that investigation indicates that the shooter heavily used the Internet and had a social media presence. The source said the shooter left a footprint and doesn't appear to have deleted files or scrubbed anything. The source noted this was different from the San Bernardino terrorists who left no footprints. His cell phone is posing no encryption issues as San Bernardino. A law enforcement source said that the shooting suspect legally purchased recently the  two weapons used in the attack at the shooting center in Port St. Lucie near his Fort Pierce home. He had a Glock 17 handgun purchased on June 5, a Sigsauer MCX assault rifle purchased on June 4 on his person during the shootout, and investigators later found a .38-caliber weapon in his vehicle. Mateen was a body builder and a religious man who attended the local mosque and wanted to become a police officer. He was born in New York to Afghan parents. He had no apparent criminal record and was working as a security guard before the attack. The shooter had been contacted by U.S. law enforcement at least twice in recent years. He had traveled to Saudi Arabia at least twice - once in 2011 and again in 2012 - as part of a religious pilgrimage. Mateen surfaced on the FBI's radar in 2013, when coworkers said he'd made inflammatory remarks about terrorist ties. ""Mateen was interviewed twice,"" said the FBI's Ron Hopper, who is leading the investigation into the Orlando attack. ""Ultimately we were unable to verify the substance of his comments and the investigation was closed."" In 2014 he came to the FBI's attention again, this time because of contact he had with Moner Abu-Salha, the first known American suicide bomber in Syria. But once again, Mateen was cleared of any wrongdoing He was not on a current terror watchlist, a U.S. intelligence source tells CBS News' Len Tepper. He was entered into a terrorist screening database during the time the FBI was questioning him, but he was removed when the FBI closed the investigation, Tepper reports. Despite those two investigations, Mateen was not on any list that prevented him from purchasing a weapon. While investigators search for answers, witnesses and victims' friends and family have been sharing stories of heroism and heartbreak amid the chaos. Florida Governor Rick Scott many of the people who died in the Orlando gay bar were from Puerto Rico. So far, 48 of the 49 victims have been identified. The Mexican Foreign Ministry said Monday that at least three of its country's citizens were killed as well. Josh McGill and friend Ashley Summers fled the club and lost track of one another. McGill found shelter behind a car. ""I was about to run for it, to the safe zone,"" McGill said. ""And I hear someone kind of like mumbling, 'Help! Help!'"" A few feet away, 27-year-old Rodney Sumter Jr. lay wounded and bleeding, shot in each arm and once in the back. ""I only saw the one bullet at first, and I was like, 'We need to stop the bleeding.' And he's like, 'Okay.' So I took my shirt off and I tied it around as tight as I could and then I saw his other arm had been shot. So I took his shirt off, tied it around that one,"" McGill recounted. The two hobbled their way to police at the scene. ""So the police officer turned to me and said, 'Okay, this is what the deal is. You're going to lay down in the back of that cop car and he's going to lay on top of you, and I want you to bear hug him and try to keep all the pressure on him as you can.' So I did,"" McGill said. ""And they were like 'Also, like keep him conscious.'"" McGill held Sumter all the way to the hospital.

Pulse Nightclub, the site of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, will soon become a permanent memorial and museum to commemorate both the survivors and lives lost, its owner, Barbara Poma, announced said earlier this week. The initiative will be funded by the onePULSE foundation, a non-profit organization where Poma serves as executive director and CEO. “Today, I’m able to share with you what I believe is news that will help in our mission of healing,” Poma said at a press gathering on Thursday. “It isn’t easy for me to stand on this site. What began as a place for fun and joy is now sacred ground.” Prior to the shooting on June 12, 2016, Pulse operated as a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. The club was capping off its “Latin Night” when the shooter, Omar Mateen, opened fire on remaining club-goers. Shortly after the shooting, Mateen swore allegiance to ISIS in a 911 call. Forty-nine people were killed and 68 were injured as a result of the attack. Today, the site of the nightclub has developed into a makeshift memorial filled with colorful artwork, flowers, and vigils. According to The Orlando Sentinel, it is unclear whether the onePULSE foundation plans to preserve the integrity of the original building, which is currently boarded up, or design a new structure for the permanent memorial. While many construction details have yet to be made public, the foundation said Pulse will no longer exist as a nightclub. “This project is not about replacing a building or a fun hangout for the gay community,” said Jason Felts, who serves on the memorial’s board of trustees. “This project is about healing Central Florida, the GLBT community, the Latino community.” The foundation will begin the design process by soliciting input from survivors and victims’ families. Poma has also sought advice from those involved in the development of the Oklahoma City National Memorial and National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York City, NPR reports. Jefre Manuel, a Miami artist known for his public art installations in Orlando, will head the design committee. The memorial is scheduled to open in 2020, followed by the construction of the museum, which will contain stories and artifacts from the massacre. In the short term, the foundation plans for the memorial site to be a place of comfort and healing, Poma said in a promotional video. But in 100 years, she said, “it should be a place of education, and a place of change and remembrance.” With plans for the memorial underway, the onePULSE foundation has also set its sights on providing financial assistance to victims of the shooting. In addition to construction costs, donations will go toward an educational fund, community grants for the victims’ families, and scholarships for the deceased. Already, the foundation has received generous support from high-profile figures, including Andy Cohen, Ellen DeGeneres, and Lady Gaga. Lance Bass and NBA player Jason Collins also serve on the foundation’s board of trustees."

                since Enrique Marquez Jr., 25, of Riverside, admitted in a plea agreement that he bought the assault rifles used by Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, in the Dec. 2, 2015, attack at a public health agency gathering that left 14 people dead and injured nearly two dozen others. Farook and Malik were later killed in a gunfight with authorities. Marquez also agreed to plead guilty to making false statements when he purchased the firearms used in the attack. Prosecutors said Marquez acknowledged being a ""straw buyer"" when he purchased two assault rifles from a sporting goods store that were used in the attack at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino. Prosecutors have said Marquez agreed to buy the weapons because the attackers feared Farook's Middle Eastern appearance might arouse suspicion. Marquez also admitted to plotting with Farook in 2011 and 2012 to massacre college students and gun down motorists on a gridlocked California freeway, though those attacks never occurred. Federal officials said the duo had envisioned halting traffic on state Route 91 with explosives and then firing at trapped motorists, or tossing pipe bombs into a crowded cafeteria at Riverside City College. Marquez said he backed out of the plot after four men in the area about 60 miles inland from Los Angeles were arrested on terrorism charges in late 2012, the FBI has said in court documents. ""While his earlier plans to attack a school and a freeway were not executed, the planning clearly laid the foundation for the 2015 attack on the Inland Regional Center,"" US Attorney Eileen M. Decker said Tuesday. Marquez is scheduled to appear before a federal judge on Thursday. His attorney didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment.

They happen at places of worship and study, work and play. And increasingly, they happen onstage — in fictional tragedies and verbatim dramas that explore the psychology of the shooters and the consequences for the affected individuals and communities. The past several years have seen Jessica Dickey’s “The Amish Project”; Stephen Karam and PJ Paparelli’s “columbinus”; Simon Stephens’s “Punk Rock”; Scott Z. Burns’s “The Library”; David Greig’s “The Events”; Julia Cho’s “Office Hour”; Rajendra Ramoon Maharaj, Adam Mace and Christian Lee Branch’s “Mother Emanuel”; and a host of one-acts — each instigated by one or more instances of gun violence. This month brings three new plays inspired by the 2012 events in Newtown, Conn., in which a man opened fire at Sandy Hook Elementary School, killing 26 children and adults before taking his own life. Eric Ulloa’s “26 Pebbles,” presented by the Human Race Theater Company in Dayton, Ohio, is a documentary drama in the style of Tectonic Theater Project’s “The Laramie Project.” Mr. Ulloa, an actor turned writer, based the play on the more than 60 interviews he did with Newtown residents. By contrast, Martín Zimmerman’s “On the Exhale” and Courtney Baron’s “When It’s You” use the Newtown catastrophe as a stimulus for anguished fictions. Mr. Zimmerman’s play, which opens on Sunday at the Roundabout Underground, is a monologue voiced by a nameless literature professor who finds herself fixated on a weapon used in a mass shooting. Ms. Baron’s piece, a Keen Company production that begins performances on Feb. 28 and is also a solo show, uses a multiple murder to meditate on what we owe to one another. The New York Times spoke to these writers about representing gun violence onstage and their own experiences with firearms. These are edited excerpts from the conversations. What inspired your play? I was tired of my own complacency whenever something horrific happens that I can’t understand, this being a traumatic one because it was 6- and 7-year old children. I was tired of doing Facebook posts with my personal comments about how angry I am and sending it into the void. I wanted to see if I could offer anything as a writer. Have you ever shot a gun or had experience with gun violence? I was not raised in a gun house. My dad owned a gun because he was a night-shift manager. I’m pretty common sense on gun control: I believe that people have the right to own a personal handgun for safety if they feel the need to. I don’t feel the need to. There’s a good police force out there that will do it for me. How do you as a playwright handle violence onstage? We use a very theatrical conceit; when the moment happens, it’s an actual giant shattering of glass. I promised every person I interviewed that I would never try to make this a piece of sensationalism. I don’t want to see that. We’re dealing with children, and that’s some touchy ground. That’s not the story I’m trying to tell. Do you think your play will register differently in the Trump era? I would never thank him for anything. But I’ve got to thank him because the climate he’s created in this country has made this piece relevant. I had students on opening weekend saying, “It made me realize that I want to become an activist.” This 35-year-old liberal heart was in heaven. What inspired your play? I knew that nothing legislative was going to happen after Sandy Hook; it filled me with such boiling rage. I really just couldn’t imagine how furious you would be if you lost a child like that. That was the seed. Also, I’ve been long-term fascinated with the contradictions over what it means to operate a weapon, that in order to do it effectively you need to be calm, almost meditative. Have you ever shot a gun or had experience with gun violence? I’ve shot a rifle — a bolt-action rifle at Boy Scout camp. I have never encountered any gun violence personally in Chicago, where I live. But I have read articles about someone living in my neighborhood, driving a route that I drive all the time and seeing someone get shot in the head. How do you as a playwright handle violence onstage? I have yet to see realistic violence rendered onstage that didn’t take me out of the experience: I’m so aware that what I’m watching is not real. We do ourselves a disservice when we try to make theater a literal space. It’s always way more effective to enlist an audience’s imagination. When you see weapons onstage, your eyes just go to them. It’s troubling, but they’re really fascinating, seductive, complex machines. If we put them onstage, you’re just going to be waiting for that thing to discharge, waiting for that sound. Do you think your play will register differently in the Trump era? I don’t know if this is still true in the age of Trump, but I would say that pre-election, gun control was the issue about which I felt the greatest despair. These objects are so seductive it’s almost impossible to control ourselves around them. Once you have access to this really powerful machine that gives you the illusion of power, it becomes really difficult to imagine yourself separated from it. You have to acknowledge that clearly there is some emotional connection going on, some deep fears and deep longings and deep love. What inspired your play? When Sandy Hook happened, my daughter had just turned 7. I think it woke me up. I grew up in a political family and my dad was very, very wrapped up in politics, but I had never taken on anything on my own. The only way I know how to write is the smallest, most microcosmic way. I had attempted to write something more overtly political, more of a polemic, and it didn’t feel true to me. Have you ever shot a gun or had experience with gun violence? I grew up in Dallas. It wasn’t odd to see gun racks in trucks. I shot rifles at summer camp just like everybody else did. Many of the families in the neighborhood I grew up in had guns. We didn’t think, like, “Oh, there are weapons of murder in our homes.” They were kind of casually for protection. When I was in college, my girlfriend and I were like, “Well, what happens at a gun show?” So we went to one. And it was kind of spectacular. First of all, there was a bar. And there were guns for ladies, which was the craziest thing to me — little, pretty guns specifically for ladies. And the ladies were lined up. How do you as a playwright handle violence onstage? Violence is more about entertainment than it is about the reality of what happens to people. It’s like sex onstage. It doesn’t work. I studied with Romulus Linney at Columbia, and he was always like: “Don’t put a gun onstage. It’s going to be horrible.” Do you think your play will register differently in the Trump era? I think it has to do with personal culpability as a member of society. In light of the election, whatever one’s political bent is, we have to take on social responsibility. I don’t think we should carry the bag of guilt in the heaviest way, but we are culpable. You cannot live in a vacuum. So you have to examine what’s important to you and what you can do about it.

577886582,2017-02-07 19:22:11,How Left-Wing Media Overstates Number Of &#8216;Mass Shootings&#8217; By Factor Of 10,http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/07/how-left-wing-media-overstates-number-of-mass-shootings-by-factor-of-10/,en,False,"gun control,firearms,murders and attempted murders",18775,Daily Caller,http://dailycaller.com,"(Butsaya/Shutterstock) A database regularly cited by liberal media outlets overstates the number of “mass shootings” by a factor of 10, according to analysis by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The website “Mass Shooting Tracker” (MST) has been regularly used by news outlets, like The Washington Post and PBS, to claim “mass shootings” occur much more frequently than they actually do. MST uses an alternative definition of “mass shooting” that greatly overstates their frequency relative to the commonly-accepted definition used by law enforcement and academics. MST openly acknowledges it uses the alternate definition to “punch a hole in the NRA argument.” NRA refers to the National Rifle Association, the country’s largest gun lobby. MST’s defines a mass shooting as any shooting where four or more people are injured or killed, not counting the shooter. This isn’t an official definition taken from law enforcement or academia, but appears to be originally created by anti-gun activists on Reddit. Law enforcement officials define a mass shooting as an event where four or more people are killed, not counting the shooter. This distinction is important, because MST data for January shows there are more than twice as many injuries in mass shootings as deaths, according to TheDCNF’s analysis. Only 5 out of the 48 alleged mass shootings MST says occurred in January, 2017 — 10 percent — actually meet the law enforcement’s definition of “mass shooting” events. Only 17 of those mass shootings — or, 35 percent — actually saw multiple people killed. Only 29 of MST-defined mass shootings — or, about 60 percent — included any deaths at all. Many of the shootings MST calls “mass murder” were actually grisly murder-suicides, gangland massacres, or robberies. A 2013 Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) inquiry found that only 160 “active shooter incidents” occurred between 2000 and 2013, when gang-related shootings were excluded. Ironically, using MST’s own definition proves that blue states have 42 percent more mass shootings than red states, after adjusting for population, according to data previously examined by TheDCNF. The deep-blue areas of Washington, D.C., and Maryland led the nation with 2.38 and .998 mass shootings per 100,000 people. Places where Democrats controlled the state legislature were even more likely to have mass shootings than the average blue state. This correlation between mass shootings and Democratic control of state legislature is especially striking, since Democrats are currently in full control of just 11 state legislatures, while the GOP is in full control of 30 state legislatures. Last June, the left-wing outlet Vox used MST’s metric to track mass shootings. TheDCNF found that, of the 998 “mass shootings” noted by Vox, only 86 — or roughly eight percent — meet the threshold of a “mass shooting” as defined by the FBI and academic institutions. This lack of “mass murder” didn’t stop Vox founder Ezra Klein from tweeting an updated map of 998 “mass shootings,” which was retweeted almost 25,000 times and favorited more than 22,000 times.

687310631,2017-02-22 17:58:00,Violence and mental illness: Is media overplaying link?,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/too-many-news-stories-wrongly-link-violence-with-mental-illness/,en,False,"medicine and health,mental health and disorders",1752,CBS News,http://www.cbsnews.com/,"Watch CBSN Live By Ashley Welch June 6, 2016 / 5:05 PM
          / CBS News It's a common narrative put forth throughout the news media almost every time a mass shooting occurs: mental illness, at least partly, must have played a role in the violent act. But many mental health experts have long warned not to jump to such conclusions, as the amount of violence in the U.S. actually attributable to mental illness is exceedingly low and the routine linkage paints an unfair portrait of those with mental health issues, who are much more likely to be the victims of violence than to commit it themselves. Now, researchers from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health are sounding the alarm with a new report on the disproportionate media coverage mental illness receives in relation to violence. The analysis, which appears in the June issue of the journal Health Affairs, found that nearly 40 percent of news stories about mental illness connected it with violent behavior toward others. That number does not match up with the 5 percent of violence in the United States that is actually directly related to mental illness, the researchers say. ""This is very problematic because the research evidence shows that people with mental illness are almost never violent toward other people and most violence in the United States is not caused by mental illness,"" study leader Emma E. ""Beth"" McGinty, Ph.D, MS, an assistant professor in the departments of Health Policy and Management and Mental Health at the Bloomberg School, told CBS News. ""So the fact that so much news coverage about mental illness focuses on violence toward others really potentially creates a misconception in the public's mind about how closely linked mental illness and violence are and also likely increases social stigma towards people with mental illness."" The study included a random sample of 400 news stories from top-tier media outlets, including high-circulation newspapers like the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times and Washington Post, as well as evening news programs on national television networks CBS, NBC, and ABC and all of CNN's news programs, over a 20 year period. The problem, experts say, is that many media outlets often seek to answer the common adage of ""How can this happen here?"" for viewers. But in doing so, more often than not, they wrongly default to an explanation of a mental illness because of the common -- but false -- idea among many that anyone who would commit violence, especially mass shootings, must have mental illness. ""Anyone who kills people is not mentally healthy, but that does not mean that they have a clinical diagnosis and therefore treatable mental illness,"" McGinty said. ""It could be that there are emotional issues at play, that there's anger that is driving this. Social isolation could be a factor, or there could be substance abuse going on. There are a whole host of other factors that even if you were to get them into the mental health treatment system, mental health treatment would not erase those factors."" Dr. Joshua D. Lee, an associate professor in medicine and psychiatry at NYU Langone Medical Center, also emphasized that most mass shootings, contrary to many media reports, are not the result of a flawed mental health system. ""These mass shootings are more often than not just like any other violent crimes,"" he told CBS News. ""There tends to be quite a bit of forethought and planning that would seem to demonstrate that it's not a mental health system or treatment system or screening problem so much as it is an ability to stockpile incredible amounts of firepower."" Of course, there are instances where mental illness actually does play a role in high-profile violent acts, a prime example being the 2011 Tuscon shooting that left U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords critically injured and six others dead. The perpetrator, Jared Lee Loughner, was subsequently diagnosed with schizophrenia. ""He appears to have been in a psychotic state when he committed this mass shooting,"" McGinty said. ""So in that case, while not at all representative of most people with schizophrenia, the reporting linking the mental illness to the mass shooting was completely accurate."" However, such cases where there is a confirmed, diagnosed mental illness involved in a mass shooting are few and far between -- though the disproportionate amount of coverage such news events like this receive would lead the public to believe otherwise. Both McGinty and Lee urge the media not to report a link between mental illness and violence unless it is actually documented. When there is a documented role of mental illness in a violent act, researchers say it's also important to include more context. ""Saying things like 'this case is an outlier,' and 'that most people with mental illness, according to research evidence, are never violent,'"" McGinty said. ""That can help with the stigma.""

Conway defended the administration, saying it has a “high regard for the facts” and also said that CNN is not “fake news” despite Trump repeatedly accusing the network of putting out false stories. “I don't think CNN is fake news,” Conway said. “I think there are some reports everywhere, in print, on TV, on radio, in conversation, that are not well researched and are sometimes based on falseness.” Tapper questioned Conway sharply, particularly pressing her on Trump’s false claim earlier on Tuesday that the U.S. murder rate is “the highest it's been in 45 to 47 years."" “Facts are stubborn things, and to say that we're not reporting something that happens not to be true, therefore we're not to be trusted, that's a problem,” Tapper said. Conway then tried to shift the conversation to the criticism she has received from media reports, while asserting that she’s “the most open press person in the White House. “I'm now being attacked by the media including networks that are familiar to you. And I'm just going to keep soldiering on,” Conway said. “I came to this White House to serve this president who is serving people.” While Trump and his aides have long had a contentious relationship with CNN, the tensions have escalated in recent days. Politico reported last week that the administration was freezing out CNN, and while some Trump aides started reappearing on the network since then, the administration made Vice President Mike Pence available to all the major Sunday shows except for CNN last weekend. The New York Times reported earlier this week that the Trump administration had offered to have Conway appear instead, but the network declined, partly because it wanted Pence and partly because of “serious questions about her credibility.” Conway fired back on Monday, saying she wasn’t available on Sunday because she had a family commitment. CNN then hit back, with its communications team tweeting that “we passed” on an offer for Conway to appear, and that, “Those are the facts.” During the interview on Tuesday afternoon, Conway addressed another one of her controversies — her repeated references to a “Bowling Green massacre” that did not happen. “I was misquoting, I should have said masterminds, and I’ve talked about all that,” she said. “But let me just say this on the broader point, we have a high regard for the facts.” Conway went on to claim that ""the massacre happened in Iraq."" But Politifact reported that the arrests of the two Iraqi nationals in Bowling Green was part of a sting operation by the FBI. Tapper also questioned Conway on a list of terror attacks the White House said the press did not cover seriously enough. However, the list included some major attacks that were widely covered, other attacks that had no casualties, and others whose connection to terrorism is questionable or don’t meet customary definitions of terrorism, as Politico reported. The list followed Trump bringing up the issue during a visit to Florida’s MacDill Air Force Base on Monday. “You’ve seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe, it’s happening,” the president said. “It’s gotten to a point where it’s not even being reported. And in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that.” In response, Tapper played clips of CNN reporters at the scenes of these attacks around the world. “It's offensive given the fact that CNN and other media organizations have reporters in danger right now in war zones covering ISIS,” Tapper said. “And I just don't understand how the president can make an attack like that.” Conway said she respected CNN’s coverage, and repeated her earlier defense that the list was aimed to elevate awareness of the threat of terrorism. Tapper followed up by asking why Trump had not tweeted or spoken publicly about the mosque attack in Canada, in which a white, right-wing extremist killed six Muslims. The White House’s list also didn’t include mention of the Charleston church shooting in June 2015 or the mass shooting at a Colorado Planned Parenthood clinic in November 2015. “He doesn’t tweet about everything, he doesn’t make a statement about everything,” Conway said. The CNN anchor said he would rather be covering important issues facing the nation, but the White House made it difficult by “declaring war” on the media. “I would much rather be talking to you about veterans issues. In fact, when it comes to the Trump administration, I would much rather be covering immigration, I would much rather be covering trade and I would much rather be covering draining the swamp and counter terrorism,” he said. “But instead, every day there are these sprays of attack and sprays of falsehoods coming from the White House. It would be better if they were not coming from the White House, for me and for you.” Conway agreed, but said it “has to go both ways.” “I sincerely don't see a lot of difference in coverage from when he was a candidate and when he became the Republican nominee, the president-elect and indeed the president,” she said. “Some outlets, some people cover him the same way and it doesn't have a great deal of respect, I think, for the office of the president and its current occupant.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

588403291,2017-03-02 10:29:34,Fake News: NBC Claims Trump Revokes Gun Background Checks for Mentally Ill,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/LDpaQsi9QKk/,en,False,"law and legislation,medicine and health,gun control,firearms",19334,Breitbart,http://www.breitbart.com,"On Tuesday, President Trump signed the repeal of Barack Obama’s gun ban for Social Security recipients. On Thursday, NBC News reported that Trump had signed a repeal of “gun checks for people with mental illness.” This is Fake News 101, inasmuch as it takes Trump’s commitment to defend the Second Amendment and reports it as something that endangers the American people by allowing mentally ill persons to acquire guns. Obama’s Social Security gun ban opened the door for beneficiaries to be investigated if they were under mental duress and needed help with their finances. A beneficiary who had his check sent to a third party could catch the Social Security Administration’s attention, be investigated, and turned over to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to be barred from gun purchases. This not only violated the beneciaries’ Second Amendment rights but their Due Process rights as well. It meant that a recently-widowed 85-year-old grandmother could be denied the right to buy a .38 Special revolver for self-defense because her temporary mental anguish required her to get help with finances. Duke psychiatry professor Jeffery Swanson criticized the ban, saying it targeted “the vulnerable” rather than the dangerous. The U.S. House voted to repeal the ban on February 2, the Senate on February 15, and President Trump signed the repeal on February 28. NBC News reported, “Trump signs bill revoking Obama-era gun checks for people with mental illnesses.” And they described the ban as a response to Sandy Hook, saying, “President Barack Obama recommended the now-nullified regulation in a 2013 memo following the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, which left 20 first graders and six others dead.” Bloomberg News similarly reported that the ban “was a reaction to school shootings like the 2012 Sandy Hook attack.” Neither NBC News nor Bloomberg asked how an elementary school attack carried out by a 20-year-old with stolen firearms could be justification for denying elderly Social Security beneficiaries their Second Amendment rights at retail gun stores.

684277594,2017-02-15 02:39:55,Does It Make a Difference If Students Protest Their Schools' Investments?,https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/04/the-push-for-ethical-investment-at-americas-colleges/391697/,en,False,"education and schools,politics and government,finances,colleges and universities,referendums",1110,Atlantic,http://www.theatlantic.com/,"Student campaigns urging universities to divest from industries such as fossil fuels and firearms have become increasingly popular. But financially speaking, they may be purely symbolic. Updated on April 29, 2015 At Princeton University last week, undergraduates narrowly rejected a student referendum that would’ve urged the Board of Trustees to rid itself of any investments in multinational corporations that “sustain the illegal military occupation and blockade of the Palestinian Territories.” The count was relatively close: Only 102 votes separated the two sides. But with just 2,200 students participating, less than half of the undergraduate population effectively took a stand on whether Princeton should divest from such companies. Now, this Wednesday, Princeton’s graduate students are slated to begin voting on the same proposal; they have until May 8 to do so. Whether the turnout will be any stronger is unclear at this point, though some graduate-student activists insist they’ll make sure their voices are heard. In fact, the Graduate Student Government will be the entity announcing the results of that vote as a “formal show of consensus” and to demonstrate “sustained graduate student interest,” Kelly Roache, an undergraduate alumna who’s currently enrolled as a graduate student in the School of Public and International Affairs, said in an email. Roache co-founded the Princeton Divests Coalition, the student group advocating for the cause. And faculty members are joining the effort, too. According to Molly Greene, a Princeton history professor, 71 tenured faculty members presented a petition to the university president in November in support of divestment. An additional 8 professors have signed on since. Similar campaigns are taking place at college campuses across the U.S. As Princeton undergraduates voted on their divestment proposal last week, Tufts students and alumni staged a three-day sit-in at the university president’s office as part of an ongoing movement on Boston-area campuses to divest from fossil-fuel companies—as numerous American colleges have already pledged to do. According to Ben Weilerstein, a junior who volunteers as an organizer for Tufts Climate Action, the 55-hour protest ended last Friday, the same day the Princeton undergraduates’ vote was announced, when Tufts administrators promised students in writing that they could meet with the Board of Trustees chairman. From the Middle East to energy policy to gun control, divestment campaigns have in recent years become an increasingly popular form of campus activism, with student groups pushing schools to drop from their endowments investments that don’t align with their political beliefs. Endowments are a crucial financial resource for schools, often funded by donations from wealthy benefactors and managed by professional investors. While divestment organizers see their school’s investment portfolio as a catalyst for political reform and social change, it’s difficult to quantify the actual impact of these campaigns; financially speaking, they may be purely symbolic. But money aside, those messages can have clout. Although the effect of selling assets can vary greatly from campus to campus, research shows that divestment generally has little visible effect on financial markets. When an organization or an endowment sells shares of a particular company, the move doesn’t limit the firm’s access to capital, nor does it depress share price. In a heterogeneous world of competing values and philosophies, there’s always another buyer for a stock or bond. Ironically, as Jonathan Macey, a Yale law professor and the chair of  the university’s Advisory Committee on Investor Responsibility, explained, divestment only shifts shares from people who may be “more compassionate and considered”—and may try, as shareholders, to pressure a company from within—to owners who don’t share the same concern. And in most cases, he said, management doesn’t care who the owners are. So from an economic view, as the Princeton economist Uwe Reinhardt recently wrote in the Daily Princetonian, divestment is a pretty hollow gesture. Campus campaigns are also superficial, Reinhardt reasoned, because students don’t make any personal sacrifice when a university shifts its portfolio. Still, divestment advocacy groups and their supporters argue that the strategy works on a symbolic level—signaling a message of disapproval, driving debate, and even helping shape a national agenda. Campus movements, they say, often achieve their goals in the long term: Although they won’t immediately cripple a company or an industry, the argument goes, they can still be powerful agents of social change after a few years or a decade of activism. Advocates of divestment believe it can place psychological pressure on an industry that has to recruit, hire, and retain employees, and that it can bring invaluable media attention—and public awareness—to an issue that otherwise might be ignored. “I’m under no delusion that if Yale or Harvard decided to divest from fossil fuels and guns it wouldn’t be on the front page of newspapers and everyone would be talking about it,” Macey said. “That’s the value in divestment campaigns. And I don’t think anyone believes they haven’t helped at all that way.” Over the past year or so, schools have responded differently to student demands, weighing both the financial and ethical consequences of divestment. Despite protests, Amherst College, for example, reportedly kept its coal stock but countered students with initiatives to promote sustainability on campus. Meanwhile, the New School in New York City divested from fossil fuels and beefed up its environmental efforts— in part by creating a less wasteful campus that uses only biodegradable take-out packaging, coffee cups, and utensils and has upgraded all campus showerheads to low-flow models. Students, too, have taken various approaches. Last year, a group of seven Harvard undergraduates took the university to court, arguing that the school’s investment in the fossil-fuel sector is “a breach of the school’s fiduciary and charitable duties as a public charitable and nonprofit corporation”—and that Harvard is mishandling funds by investing in “abnormally dangerous activities.” In March, a Massachusetts Superior Court judge dismissed their suit, holding that, as Harvard students, they had no specific, personal right to challenge the school’s management of assets. Divestment has also seeped into campus elections—most recently prompting a debate about what constitutes anti-Semitism. Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that a Stanford junior, who was then running for a seat that she later secured in the student senate, claimed she was asked by a campus organization known as the Students of Color Coalition how her Jewish identity would affect her decision on Stanford’s divestment from Israel. The coalition, which had endorsed the Stanford Out of Occupied Palestine initiative, countered the student's allegations in a campus op-ed, arguing that its members had asked her a “carefully worded standard question” that they had posed to all candidates. UCLA experienced a similar incident this spring, when an undergraduate was asked during a routine student council confirmation about her Jewish identity and divestment. Meanwhile, as divestment gains traction on U.S. campuses, schools face another significant challenge: Campaigns involve personal politics, and a university must define its values—but trustees have a fiduciary responsibility to protect an endowment and maximize portfolio value. For example, in 2014, over a year before the recent sit-in, Tufts President Anthony Monaco issued a statement announcing that divestment from fossil-fuel companies would “result in a significant reduction in operating funds” and have “an immediate adverse impact on the educational experience” on campus. According to Monaco’s letter, Tufts no longer invests directly in corporations as it did in the 80s during the anti-Apartheid movement, making divestment much more complex. Experts often treat anti-Apartheid divestment campaigns as the model of symbolic pressure, raising awareness about and causing embarrassment over the role that American businesses played in the oppressive South African regime. But back then, it was much easier to divest from companies doing business in South Africa: A school like Tufts could sell shares in an individual company without having to restructure multi-tiered investments. Now, as Monaco wrote, the university’s endowment makes extensive use of pooled funds, which offer benefits of scale and keep assets diversified but make it very difficult for investors to dictate the guidelines without taking a heavy financial hit. Gun-industry divestment illustrates these complexities, as researchers explore whether campus campaigns are an effective way of reducing gun violence. “For gun companies to thrive economically, they don’t have to have the approval of large swaths of Americans, certainly not progressive college students,” said Daniel Webster, who directs the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. “Most depend on a loyal base of gun owners who buy lots of guns.” Instead, Webster pointed to studies showing that comprehensive background checks, handgun-purchaser licensing, and dealer oversight reduce gun deaths. And while student campaigns may be gaining force, two years after Sandy Hook the American public is shifting (arguably) in favor of gun rights. The latest Pew Center survey found that, for the first time in more than two decades, there was more support for the Second Amendment in 2014 than there was for gun control. Fifty-two percent of Americans said they feel it is more important to protect the rights of Americans to bear arms than it is to strengthen gun control, while just 46 percent said the opposite. But some gun-policy experts dispute the findings, arguing that Pew’s numbers are flawed because the survey question—which asked which of the two objectives is more important—implicitly assumed that gun laws infringe on gun owners’ rights. (In reality, they add, most gun laws restrict criminals from buying guns and place minimal burdens on potential buyers, such as background checks.) In response to the mass shootings in Newtown and, more recently, near the University of California, Santa Barbara, students are urging schools to divest their endowment of companies that manufacture guns and ammunitions, such as Remington and Sturm, Ruger & Co., Inc. Research from the Center for American Progress shows that gun violence has a disproportionate impact on young people and that Millennials are increasingly concerned about the presence of guns in their communities—even though gun-related deaths aren’t prevalent on college campuses. This February, the Boston University Board of Trustees rejected a recommendation from its Advisory Committee on Socially Responsible Investment that the university divest from companies that make firearms for the civilian market. The deliberations trace back to a month after the Sandy Hook tragedy, when the board’s executive committee established a working group to report back on the school’s investment in civilian gun manufacturers. Lindsay Fuori is a BU freshman from Newtown, Connecticut, who attended Sandy Hook school. “Inside the school that day were many beloved teachers and neighborhood children I babysat,” she recalled. “I was speechless, furious, and crushed all at the same time.” As a reaction to the board’s February decision, students, including Fuori, launched the BU Campaign to Divest from Firearms, Fuori explained. “I myself was guilty,” she said, only learning about BU’s investment in firearm companies after the decision. According to the student petition, which was sponsored by the national gun divestment organization Campaign to Unload, “no university should ever fund an industry that profits from violence against its students”—as the petitioners believe the gun industry does. And this May, according to Campaign to Unload’s executive director, Jennifer Fiore, UC students and the father of a UC Santa Barbara student shot and killed in the massacre last year will deliver a divestment petition to the university’s Board of Regents—two days before the anniversary of the off-campus mass shooting. “There may be no traceable financial effect of a divestment campaign,” Fiore said. “But by stigmatizing the gun industry as bad corporate actors we are changing the culture and, eventually, cutting into profits.” Meanwhile, divestment “hobbles the industry politically,” she added, so the government can enact “sane gun laws.” After Newtown, Congress tried to expand background checks on firearm sales, but according to Fiore the National Rifle Association, funded by gun companies that profit from lax gun laws, mounted a powerful backlash. This is the crux of the issue, and perhaps why it’s so difficult for campuses to reach a consensus: The two sides are debating different questions. Opponents of divestment say it doesn’t make economic sense; proponents say that doesn’t matter."

Even under the Obama administration, when the President of the United States actively worked to heal racial divisions and preached peace and unity, we experienced hate-inspired gun violence, such as the Charleston mass shooting, where a white supremacist killed nine people in a church with the intention of sparking a race war, and the Orlando Pulse shooting, where a gunman targeted a haven for the LGBTQ community, the Pulse nightclub, and left 49 people dead and 53 injured, the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. Under the Trump administration, we are poised for a terrifying surge of hate-based gun violence, of which Olathe is just the beginning. Donald Trump achieved electoral victory by exploiting racial tensions and insecurities, giving his supporters permission to indulge in and normalize their worst biases and darkest prejudices. In the weeks since taking office, Trump’s actions have only intensified the climate of hate, gratifying his predominantly white supporters and further dividing them from America’s mainstream. Advised by his senior strategist Steve Bannon, a promoter of white supremacy, he’s moved to build a wall across the United States’ southern border to keep out Mexicans; ordered a Muslim Ban to choke the flow of lawful immigrants and refugees from Muslim-majority countries; and is now terrorizing immigrant communities with raids to identify and deport undocumented residents. Donald Trump is also beholden to the National Rifle Association, which gave $30 million to his electoral win and is now gleefully anticipating how it will be rewarded for its investment. Payback for the gun lobby will certainly mean an aggressive push to dismantle gun laws in order to boost gun ownership, flood American homes and communities with even more firearms, and further enrich the arms industry. Putting Trump’s hate-filled America together with more guns is an unfolding disaster for minority communities who will bear the brunt of this new wave of armed aggression driven by cynical political calculation. What this means for gun violence prevention (GVP) advocates is that they can no longer pretend that civil rights and racial justice are not issues of gun safety. It’s more important than ever for the GVP community to set aside its tunnel vision trained on strict gun policy reform, and join the battle against discrimination and hate, if its ultimate purpose truly is to save lives threatened by firearms. Trump Presidency will facilitate even more gun sales Americans make up less than five percent of the world’s population, but own 40 to 50 percent of its stockpile of guns. From 2007 to 2013, firearms manufacturers more than doubled their production from 4.5 to 10.8 million firearms a year in response to demand in the United States, and in 2016, President Obama’s last year in office, the U.S. government processed 20 percent more background checks than the year before, which is considered a reliable predictor of gun sales. The Trump administration has already shown it will be an unabashed cheerleader for the gun lobby: When Donald Trump announced Neil Gorsuch as his pick to fill the empty Supreme Court seat, he did so with NRA CEO Vice President Wayne La Pierre at his side, an ominous signal of Presidential support for expanding 2nd Amendment rights. The National Rifle Association (NRA) presents itself as a grassroots organization of gun owners. In reality, its priority has been to advance the interests of the firearms manufacturers, whose representatives sit on the NRA board, and with which the NRA has deep and lucrative ties. The NRA, which drives the rhetoric of the larger gun lobby, has long primed potential gun consumers with methods identical to those in Trump’s campaign playbook. Those methods are based on divisiveness and racial prejudice: fear of even the mildest commonsense gun control leading to gun confiscation by the nation’s first Black President Barack Obama; fear of rising crime perpetrated by persons of color; fear of terrorism perpetrated by immigrants. Indeed, in Donald Trump, the NRA could not have dreamed up a more perfect soul mate, and with a compliant Republican Congress already staunchly committed to gun rights, it is on the verge of pushing an extreme legislative agenda that it has every expectation of achieving. At the federal level, the NRA’s top legislative priority will be to mandate treating state-issued concealed carry permits like driver’s licenses. States would be forced to honor every other state’s permits, despite the fact that strongly pro-gun-rights states with minimal permitting requirements make a mockery of the carefully constructed gun safety frameworks in other states designed to keep guns out of unqualified or dangerous hands. Other federal gun-rights measures on the gun lobby’s wish list include legalizing silencers (of which the President’s own son Donald, Jr. is a vocal proponent), and abolishing school “gun-free zones.” And if the coming assault on national gun policy weren’t enough, the NRA and its allies are already busy executing their years-long strategy of capitalizing on Republican dominance in state houses across the country. Gun rights advocates at the state level have already rolled out initiatives designed to force the acceptance of gun carry into as many public places as possible, including bars, sports facilities, parks and schools; to expand Stand Your Ground laws to make it easier for gun owners to reach for their guns by diminishing their accountability; and to even do away with concealed carry permits altogether, on the argument that even the most minimal licensing requirement such as basic training violates Second Amendment rights. The gun lobby anticipates brisk sales if they achieve this great dismantling of any and all barriers to gun ownership at every level of government. The likelihood of armed, hate-based bullying and violence is growing In the run-up to the 2016 general election, when the prospect of a Hillary Clinton presidency ushering in stronger gun laws drove many Americans to stock up on firearms, hate groups were also booming. The number of active anti-government groups tracked by the Southern Poverty Law Center grew from 149 in 2008 to 998 in 2015. Ku Klux Klan groups grew from 72 in 2014 to 190 in 2015, catalyzed by the removal of the Confederate flag from the South Carolina Capitol in the wake of the Charleston mass shooting. After Donald Trump entered the race to become U.S. president in 2015, his rhetoric criminalizing entire immigrant communities, demonizing non-Christian communities, and denigrating women, the handicapped and any other group perceived as “weak,” was like dumping barrels of gasoline on an already roaring bonfire. He fast became the obvious candidate for the far right, with the KKK running a full, front-page story in its official newspaper embracing him and his promise to “Make America Great Again,” because ""America was founded as a White Christian Republic. And as a White Christian Republic it became great."" In the aftermath of Donald Trump’s electoral win, incidents of hate surged. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) report, Ten Days After, documented hundreds of cases of intimidation and attacks on people based on their race, religion, gender and sexual orientation. An SPLC survey of 10,000 K-12 educators in that period revealed that the rising climate of fear touched even the nation’s youngest: Eight in 10 teachers reported heightened anxiety among immigrant, Muslim, Black, LGBTQ and other marginalized students, and more than 25 percent of teachers described specific incidents of bigotry of harassment directly traceable to election rhetoric. Personal accounts of bigotry, harassment, and intimidation became commonplace on social media channels, the most egregious sometimes breaking through to the mainstream news media, highlighted by journalists like York Daily News columnist Shaun King, whose inbox exploded with reports and tips, many of which he shared through his Twitter feed. Studies show that the mere sight of weapons like guns makes people more aggressive and prone to overreaction. Giving people more access to firearms while inflaming their sense of anxiety and fear against others they see as alien to themselves (as President Trump’s rhetoric and policy actions are designed to do) is a deadly combination. With a significant overlap between gun rights proponents and racist, bigoted Trump supporters, the likelihood of armed, hate-based bullying and intimidation is ballooning. An opportunity for gun violence prevention There is a sense of dread in the gun violence prevention community as it waits for Washington to turn its attention to gun policy. With the White House and Congress in Republican hands, GVP advocates are bracing themselves for a bruising fight once the NRA and its allies begin to actively push gun bills through the legislative process. Should Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell move to scrap the filibuster, which effectively stops a bill unless it has 60 Senate votes (and was the tool used by the handful of Tea Party senators to grind lawmaking to a halt in the Obama years), then there will be little the minority Democrats could do to stop a tidal wave of transformative Republican legislation from moving forward and becoming law, including every item on the gun lobby’s wish list. With such grim prospects, it’s understandable that the GVP community is focused on the gun policy battles ahead, but gun policy must not be the only battlefield they are prepared to fight on. Since the Newtown mass shooting that killed 20 first graders and six educators in 2012, “90 percent (or some other high percentage) of Americans support stronger background checks,” has been the mantra on every GVP advocate’s lips. Yet, even in the aftermath of Newtown, this supposedly overwhelming public support could not move the Senate to take even the small step of passing a stronger background checks bill. This is because lawmakers did not feel the weight of that supposed 90 percent support, which people were taking at face value. The national conversation on gun policy, from lawmakers to advocacy groups to the grassroots on both sides, has largely been a White conversation anchored around the Second Amendment and gun rights, ideal for engaging and stoking the passions of largely White pro-gun adherents. It leaves out, however, the 40 percent of Americans who were not enfranchised at the founding of the country: The Black community commonly sees firearms as a tool of oppression as borne out through the eras of slavery, Reconstruction, Jim Crow and even today. With many Latinos having experienced gun violence in their native countries, Latinos in America, who with Blacks experience a disproportionate share of American gun violence, also tend to associate firearms with injustice and persecution. Other more recent immigrant communities (Asians and everyone else) have little cultural or historical context for understanding and engaging on the gun issue as filtered through the Second Amendment lens. While this 40 percent is part of the 90 percent of Americans who “support stronger background checks,” they have been largely sitting out the fight for stronger gun laws. And now this 40 percent is under attack and their very lives are on the line as many of their most enthusiastic attackers fit the same profile as those who are most likely to be armed. As the Olathe, Kansas shooting demonstrates, it doesn’t take very much for a person filled with hate to pick up his weapons – as the NRA has conditioned him to do – and take out his anger and frustration on strangers who drew his attention only because of the color of their skin – as Donald Trump has taught him to do. In past years, the GVP community understandably stayed out of immigration issues as they had little to do with gun safety. Less understandable was its silence after the shooting of Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, and its silence after each subsequent high-profile police shooting of an unarmed Black man. While law enforcement has indeed been a valuable ally in efforts to improve public gun policy, there is no reason good enough to excuse individual officers of the law for abusing their power and taking innocent lives, and GVP advocates should not have shied away from joining the #BlackLivesMatter call for accountability and giving survivors public support and sympathy for what were, after all, just more deaths caused by firearms. The Trump administration has introduced the likelihood of targeted gun violence to immigrant communities, and increased the likelihood of more gun violence in all communities. By singling out people based on their religion and skin color, it has legitimized hateful targeting throughout society, including by the armed populace. By embracing the Blue Lives Matter movement, accusing critics of law enforcement of being anti-police and brushing off police brutality, Donald Trump has signaled that gratuitous violence by law enforcement against Black and Brown communities is unimportant, and therefore all violence against Black and Brown communities is unimportant. In short, immigration, racial justice and civil rights are now clearly weaponized issues, more so than they’ve ever been. The gun violence prevention movement must stop insisting that strict gun policy is its only bailiwick and do its part to push back against the Trump administration’s assault on tolerance and civil liberties in order to save lives from gun violence. GVP advocates must speak out against Trump’s hateful rhetoric and the climate of hate that a growing number of people will take as permission to use their weapons to intimidate and commit violence against non-White, non-Christian people and other minority groups. When President Trump talks about the Mexican Wall or issues new orders banning Muslims, GVP advocates must join the cry for #NoWallsNoBan. It must decry the influence in the White House of Steve Bannon, the mastermind behind Trump’s race-based policies, and hold U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has a long record of racism, accountable for any misuse of power that harms marginalized communities. And when police shootings take more innocent Black lives, GVP advocates must not hesitate to join efforts opposing law enforcement’s knee-jerk response to circle the wagons and absolve itself from responsibility. By advocating not only for gun safety but civil rights and racial justice, the GVP community will find the voice it needs to engage immigrants and let them know that smarter gun laws would help make their communities safer, and it will finally show the Black and Brown communities that GVP truly is about saving lives and not just about controlling firearms. The Trump Presidency is an opportunity to build these bridges and finally achieve the broad, diverse coalition gun safety advocates need when the balance of power in Washington finally changes and the chance arrives for true gun policy reform. When that time comes, GVP will be able to again pull out the mantra that “90 percent of Americans support background checks,” and it will finally be close to the truth.

          / CBS/AP (CBS/AP) PHOENIX - Jared Lee Loughner, the primary suspect in last year's deadly Arizona mass shooting, arrived in Tucson Monday for competency and change of plea hearings, the U.S. Marshals Service confirmed. The judge overseeing the case scheduled the hearings Monday morning. That afternoon Loughner was housed in the federal prison facility on Wilmot Road U.S. District Judge Larry A. Burns scheduling order confirms that a plea deal has been reached in the shooting that left six dead and former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 12 others wounded outside a supermarket where the Congresswoman was holding a meet-and-greet with constituents. Possible plea deal in Giffords shooting caseWatch: What Officials Know About Jared LoughnerArizona Shooting: Will Jared Loughner Face the Death Penalty? Court documents show that the hearing is scheduled for Tuesday at 11 a.m. MST. Loughner had pleaded not guilty to 49 federal charges stemming from the Jan. 8, 2011 incident. Before Loughner can enter the plea, Burns must find that Loughner is mentally competent, understands what is happening and voluntarily entered the deal. CBS News legal analyst Andrew Cohen reports that federal prosecutors probably won't be pushing for the death penalty in exchange for Loughner's guilty plea. Rather, prosecutors will argue that he ""should spend the rest of his life in a federal prison, perhaps one of the special mental health facilities that are part of the Bureau of Prisons,"" Cohen said. Even so, Loughner could still face the death penalty if state prosecutors in Arizona try the suspect on capital murder charges. Loughner has spent more than a year in a federal medical facility in Missouri being treated for mental illness. Burns had ruled that Loughner wasn't psychologically fit to stand trial last year, but that he could be made ready for trial after treatment. Experts have concluded that Loughner suffers from schizophrenia. For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app First published on August 6, 2012 / 6:03 PM © 2012 CBS Interactive Inc.

Speaking at the end of the seven-week inquest into the 2015 mass shooting at the Imperial Marhaba hotel in Sousse, the relatives of 22 of the victims urged Thomson Holidays’ owner Tui to put “safety before a sale” after the coroner ruled that their relatives were unlawfully killed – but said he could not rule that neglect by the tour operator played a part.  The attack led to the greatest loss of British life in a single incident since the 7/7 bombings in London. Tui, with which all 30 Britons who were killed booked their holidays, came under significant scrutiny during the inquest over its handling of Foreign Office travel advice for Tunisia as well as security deficiencies at the hotel. Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith also described the response of police called to the scene as “at best shambolic, at worst cowardly”. But he added that it was impossible to say what difference better security would have made. And as family members listened in a packed courtroom, he said the laws around neglect did not cover tourists choosing to go on holiday because travel companies and the authorities did not have a formal duty of care. The widow and son of John Stollery, a soldier-turned-social worker killed in the attack, said afterwards they regretted that the legal framework did not allow the coroner to draw the “right conclusion”. Cheryl and Matt Stollery added that the case was “unique ... Therefore the findings and outcomes should reflect this uniqueness.” They said: “Disappointingly, we still believe questions have been left unanswered and responsibilities have not been accepted, so we are not able to rest or move on.” Suzanne Richards, who lost her eldest son, Joel, her father, Charles Evans, and her brother Adrian Evans in the attack, said: “The travel industry process of booking and giving travel advice needs to be reviewed, by implementing robust travel advice and security audits before and during all holidays to safeguard the customer and the industry – safety before a sale.” She added: “My family placed their trust in the fact that Tui, with all their knowledge and expertise, would not allow my family to travel to a hotel or destination where their safety was not the first priority – and yet ... they received no advice or warning.” Summing up the inquest on Tuesday morning, the coroner: After the inquest concluded, with a group of relatives standing behind her on the steps of the Royal Courts of Justice, Kylie Hutchison, a solicitor at Irwin Mitchell, confirmed legal action would be taken against Tui, which in the year to September made an underlying profit of €1bn (£866m). “It is now crucial that the whole travel industry learns from what happened in Sousse to reduce the risk of similar catastrophic incidents in the future,” she said. Speaking outside the court, Tui’s UK managing director, Nick Longman, said the company was “so very sorry” for the “pain and loss those affected have suffered”. He added: “As an industry we have adapted and we will need to continue to do so.” Hundreds of tourists were sunbathing outside the Imperial Marhaba on 26 June 2015 when jihadi Seifeddine Rezgui opened fire with a Kalashnikov assault rifle, killing 38 people, 30 of them British, in an attack that lasted about 30 minutes. Rezgui was shot dead by Tunisian authorities as he ran from the hotel. The attack came three months after Islamist militants attacked the Bardo in Tunis. They killed 21 people – mostly European tourists – on the spot, and another victim died 10 days later. Lawyers representing the families of the British Sousse victims had urged the coroner to rule that neglect played a part in their relatives’ deaths, in part because of a failure to provide adequate warnings. One holidaymaker said his wife had discussed the Bardo attack with a travel agent, who said it was a “one-off” and that Sousse was “100% safe”. But Loraine-Smith told the inquest that legal precedents prevented inquests from applying that conclusion to tourists on holiday because they were not “dependent” on the travel company or hotel. Referring to existing precedents, he said: “They very substantially limit the circumstances in which neglect can feature in the conclusions.”Loraine-Smith added that there were a lot of “what-ifs” around the case, and better hotel security may simply have meant that more people died on the beach instead. He added: “The simple but tragic truth in this case is that a gunman armed with a gun and grenades went to that hotel intending to kill as many tourists as he could.” But he painted a different picture of the response of police and military, including the guard who took off his shirt to hide the fact he was an officer. He said with the exception of two marine guards, no police entered the hotel grounds until the gunman had killed all 38 tourists. The judge also referred to a unit that stopped off to pick up more weapons instead of going straight to the scene. “They had everything they required to confront the gunman and could have been at the scene within minutes,” he said, adding: “The delay was deliberate and unjustifiable.” In a statement issued at the close of the inquest, Andrew Ritchie QC, who represented the families, acknowledged that the law restricted the coroner’s ability to ascribe blame and said the families had found that structure “both helpful and frustrating”. Longman said this company and the travel industry in general “must now take some time to further reflect”."

MERCED, CA, US November, 2015 TARGET: Four wounded in knife attack on a college campusATTAKER: US person Faisal Mohammad, whom the FBI called an Isis-inspired “lone wolf”, was shot dead.

It omits the names of three of the 11 men involved in the attack, and spells Chakib Akrouh’s name wrong. The death toll for the attacks stands at 130.

Last modified on Tue 31 Aug 2021 15.20 BST TIMELINE: September, 2014 - December, 2016 NUMBER OF ATTACKS: 78 It is not clear why these dates were chosen. A December 2016 cut-off excludes the Québec City mosque attack from the list. There were more than 78 terrorist attacks in that period – the ones selected by the White House are almost exclusively those linked – or rumoured to be linked – to Islamic State. The White House text is reproduced in bold and its errors have been kept.  MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA September, 2014 TARGET: Two police officers wounded in knife attackATTACKER: Abdul Numan Haider Global media organisations including the Guardian, BBC, CNN and Fox News were among those who covered this story. TIZI OUZOU, ALGERIA September, 2014 TARGET: One French citizen beheaded ATTACKER: Jund al-Khilafah in Algeria Algerian militant group Jund al-Khilafah broke its former allegiance with al-Qaida to pledge itself to Isis.

NEW YORK CITY, NY, USA October, 2014 TARGET: Two police officers wounded in knife attackATTACKER: US person This is vague but seems to refer to Zale Thompson, also known as Zaim Farouq Abdul-Malik, described as a “self-radicalised” Muslim convert. He was killed by police. RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA November, 2014 TARGET: One Danish citizen wounded in shootingATTACKERS: Three Saudi Arabia-based ISIL members Read a news report here.

PARIS, FRANCE January, 2015 TARGET: One police officer and four hostages killed in shooting at a kosher supermarket ATTACKER: Amedy Coulibaly The killings – part of the series of attacks around the Charlie Hebdo massacre – received global attention. Coulibaly had claimed to be acting for Isis. Curiously, the linked attacks by the Kouachi brothers, who had pledged allegiance to al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, are not on the list. TRIPOLI, LIBYA January, 2015 TARGET: Ten killed, including one US citizen, and five wounded in bombing and shooting at a hotel frequented by westerners ATTACKERS: As many as five ISIL-Libya members Read a news report here. RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA January, 2015 TARGET: Two US citizens wounded in shooting ATTACKER: Saudi Arabia-based ISIL supporter It’s not clear to which incident this refers.

NICE, FRANCE February, 2015 TARGET: Two French soldiers wounded in knife attack outside a Jewish community center ATTACKER: Moussa Coulibaly Three soldiers were wounded.

The story was carried live by many news outlets. KARACHI, PAKISTAN April, 2015 TARGET: One US citizen wounded in knife attackATTACKERS: Pakistan-based ISIL supporters No report of this could be found.

581676662,2017-02-15 13:11:32,Republicans in Congress just made it easier for mentally ill people to get guns,http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2017/02/15/republicans-in-congress-just-made-it-easier-for-mentally-ill-people-to-get-guns/?utm_source=rss_plum-line,en,True,"politics and government,law and legislation,united states politics and government,medicine and health,lobbying and lobbyists,gun control,firearms,mental health and disorders",2,Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,"This article is more than 1 year old With Washington under complete Republican control, the gun lobby finds itself in an odd position: Without anything to fight against, which is what they usually do, they have to find something to fight for. So what did they come up with? How about making sure that people suffering from mental illnesses can still have access to firearms? That’s what Republicans did Wednesday. A bill to undo an Obama administration regulation restricting gun access from certain mentally ill people had already passed the House, and Wednesday it passed the Senate. One can certainly argue that this is utterly ludicrous. But there’s a larger issue at work here about one of America’s most powerful lobbies. Despite the fact that their allies are in power, this is actually not a uniformly good time for them. I’ll explain why in a moment, but this current bill concerns an estimated 75,000 people, not all people with mental illnesses. The Obama administration wrote a regulation saying that people who had applied for Social Security disability benefits because of a mental condition, and whose condition makes them incapable of managing their own finances, should be referred to the FBI background check system and prevented from buying guns. That’s what Republicans have now reversed. This affects a limited number of people, and it should be said that the real gun problem today isn’t those with mental illnesses, it’s the estimated 300 million guns in circulation. As much attention as mass shootings get, most of the 10,000 or so gun homicides we have every year in America are committed by people who appear perfectly sane. Those homicides involve abusive husbands who kill their wives, arguments that get out of control and grudges settled with deadly force. Yet every time there’s a high-profile mass shooting, gun advocates say, “The problem isn’t guns, it’s mental illness. We just need to keep guns out of the wrong hands.” As though in every other advanced country where they have tiny numbers of gun deaths, it must be because there’s no mental illness. Nevertheless, no matter how disingenuous think the argument is, that still doesn’t mean it’s not a good idea to prevent people with serious mental illnesses from being armed. You’d think that at the very least this is something we could agree on. Or as gun advocate John Cornyn of Texas once said, “No one I know believes that a mentally ill person should be able to purchase a firearm.” But apparently that no longer applies. You might ask why the gun lobby cares about this (and when I use the phrase “gun lobby,” I’m referring to the symbiotic partnership of the National Rifle Association and the gun manufacturers). The simplest answer is that they’ve almost run out of new laws to advocate for. They have one big goal for the era of Republican rule: national concealed-carry reciprocity, which would mean that if you have a permit to carry in Oklahoma or Idaho, you could bring your gun to Connecticut or California no matter what their laws say. Beyond that, the gun lobby’s agenda seems like the product of a bunch of guys who have gotten almost everything they want and have just about run out of ideas. So the supposedly urgent items on their list are things like eliminating restrictions on silencers. Just imagine how glorious life will be when that terrible cloak of oppression no longer hangs heavily over the lives of every freedom-loving American. Much as they might say in public how happy they are, the truth is that total Republican rule has drawbacks for the gun lobby. Their ideal situation is to have a GOP Congress that will stop any restrictions from being enacted, while also having a Democratic president they can paint as a cartoon villain to scare gun owners with. Whenever there’s a Democrat in the White House, the NRA can cry, “He’s coming for your guns!!!,” which always means more people signing up for memberships, more contributions and more gun sales for the manufacturers that are the group’s patrons. Somehow America’s gun owners fall for it every time, despite the fact that we keep having Democratic presidents who do not actually send jackbooted thugs to break down every American’s door and confiscate their arsenals. Perhaps that’s because the profile of the typical gun owner has changed: Gun ownership has been on a steady decline for the last few decades, yet gun sales have never been higher, which means that the gun owners that remain are buying more and more guns. In any case, the NRA’s lock on the Republican Party — in which virtually every Republican officeholder takes the position dictated by the group even when it places them at odds with their constituents — means that legislation on even the most common-sense restrictions is impossible. We couldn’t even pass a universal background check bill supported by more than 90 percent of the public (including the overwhelming majority of gun owners) after 20 elementary school children were massacred at their school. So the gun lobby really never has much to worry about. But with a Republican president, they can’t warn that the government is coming for your guns. Their ordinary tools of fear, anger and hatred become far less effective. So they’re racking their brains to devise new pro-gun laws to pass. How about if we legalize armor-piercing “cop killer” bullets? Or require that all public school teachers pack heat? Or a national stand-your-ground law making “He was giving me the stink-eye” a legal defense for murder charges? Or a federally-financed “AKs are A-OK!” campaign? I’m sure they’ll come up with something. The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

The 10-to-4 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit vacates an earlier panel decision that cast doubt on the constitutionality of the ban that is similar to laws in seven states, including California, Connecticut and New Jersey. [Appeals court hears challenge to Maryland’s ban on ‘assault weapons’] The ruling from the Richmond-based court goes further than other appellate courts that have reviewed similar laws in stating clearly that “assault weapons and large-capacity magazines are not protected by the Second Amendment.” The majority opinion, written by Judge Robert B. King, refers to the banned firearms as “weapons of war” that the court says are most useful in the military. In a strongly worded dissent, Judge William B. Traxler Jr. said his colleagues have “gone to greater lengths than any other court to eviscerate the constitutionally guaranteed right to keep and bear arms.” The question for the court was how far the Maryland legislature could go to limit individual rights to gun ownership and what standard a District Court judge in Baltimore should have used to assess the law. Last February, a three-judge panel of the 4th Circuit found that the Baltimore judge should have used a more stringent test: The bar should be higher for the state, the panel said, when the government passes a law that affects a right protected by the Constitution. The majority disagreed in its opinion Tuesday siding with Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh who said the Second Amendment does not prevent legislators from passing measures designed to protect the public from gun violence. “It’s unthinkable that people could say that those weapons of war are protected by the Second Amendment,” Frosh said Tuesday. “Especially when you look at the carnage at Newtown and elsewhere around the country.” Maryland’s law does not ban all long guns, rifles or semiautomatic rifles. Gun restrictions enjoy wide support in the Democratic-leaning state, a factor that helped legislators pass some of the nation’s strictest gun-control laws in 2013. Opponents of Maryland’s law — including the Maryland State Rifle and Pistol Association and the Maryland Licensed Firearms Dealers Association — told the court that the prohibited firearms are not military weapons and that many owners have bought the guns for lawful purposes such as self-defense, target practice and hunting. The challenge was one of series of cases that followed the Supreme Court’s 2008 ruling that for the first time declared that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to gun ownership rather than one related to military service. The Supreme Court has not gone further to define the parameters of the right, such as weighing in on the legality of restrictions on certain weapons. The high court has repeatedly declined to review bans on firearms that New York, Connecticut and other jurisdictions have classified as “assault weapons.” Like Maryland, Connecticut’s ban was expanded after a gunman used a military-style semiautomatic weapon to kill 20 students and six teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The 81-page opinion issued Tuesday opens with a detailed description of that day, including the number of rounds of ammunition fired, and goes on to describe mass shootings involving similar military-style firearms in a long list of other U.S. cities. “We have no power to extend Second Amendment protection to the weapons of war that the Heller decision explicitly excluded from such coverage,” King wrote in the 4th Circuit opinion, referring to the Supreme Court case known as District of Columbia v. Heller. The court also found that Maryland lawmakers were justified in passing the ban in the interest of public safety because magazines holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition “enable shooters to inflict mass casualties while depriving victims and law enforcement officers of opportunities to escape or overwhelm the shooters while they reload their weapons.” In a separate concurring opinion, Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III said state governments — not the courts — have long been responsible for the safety of residents. The Supreme Court in Heller, Wilkinson said, did not prevent elected officials from regulating “assault weapons.” “Disenfranchising the American people on this life and death subject would be the gravest and most serious of steps,” Wilkinson wrote. “It is their community, not ours. It is their safety not ours. It is their lives, not ours.” [Read the full 4th Circuit opinion and dissent] The four dissenting judges said the banned firearms are not “dangerous or unusual” and are used by millions of law-abiding Americans in part because the military-style components increase accuracy and improve ergonomics. “As long as the weapon chosen is one commonly possessed by the American people for lawful purposes — and the rifles at issue here most certainly are,” wrote Judge Traxler, who was joined by Judges Paul V. Niemeyer, Dennis W. Shedd and G. Steven Agee. “The state has very little say about whether its citizens should keep it in their homes for protection.” We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites."
587941634,2017-03-01 19:48:41,Trump's speech was a broadside attack on the values of a free society,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2017/03/01/trumps-speech-was-a-broadside-attack-on-the-values-of-a-free-society/,en,False,"politics and government,united states politics and government,armament, defense and military forces,terrorism,united states armament and defense",2,Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,"This article is more than 1 year old That Donald Trump is getting bipartisan praise for Tuesday night’s fit of demagoguery masquerading as a presidential address is a frightening demonstration of how his first month in office has left those of who are supposed to hold him accountable timid and shell-shocked. We’ve been conditioned to accept behavior from the leader of the most powerful nation on Earth that we’d never have accepted from his predecessors (and I have pretty low expectations of presidents) — that we’d never accept from a friend, relative, pastor or community leader — as long as he spares us and our group from his attacks. We need to be better than that. Trump’s speech included plenty of lies, but they were the same lies that we’re used to hearing from this president. Because there weren’t any new lies, Trump gets praised. The speech was full of fact-free fear-mongering and ethnic scapegoating. But it’s the same variety of fear-mongering and ethnic scapegoating we’ve come to expect from this president. At least he didn’t ratchet up the demagoguery. So Trump gets praised. The speech was shallow and narcissistic. But that’s just who Trump is. It wasn’t any more shallow or narcissistic than, say, his Twitter feed. So Trump gets praised. The alleged magnanimity in the speech for which Trump is winning plaudits wasn’t just transparent and contrived; it was wholly at odds with Trump’s past behavior. His very recent past behavior. As in, his behavior from just hours earlier. But the pundit class has the memory of a tsetse fly. So Trump gets praised. At the most cosmetic level, the speech was also terribly written. I’m not particularly fond of soaring oratory, but this was neither that nor candid straight talk. It was an attempt at soaring oratory that floundered. To say that “a new national pride is sweeping across our nation” isn’t lofty or inspiring. It’s dull, vague and repetitive. “Finally, the chorus became an earthquake” is a hot mess of a mixed metaphor. More substantively, Trump’s speech was full of his typical doom-and-gloom pronouncements about America that tend to cover a spectrum of deception ranging from “unable to prove or disprove” to “completely at odds with reality.” Here are a few of the more egregious passages from what was apparently Trump’s most presidential moment to date. I’ll leave it to others to address his trade and protectionism shtick. I’ll mostly stick to my area of crime and civil liberties. The problems begin right at the top: Literally just hours before his speech, Trump had implied that some or most or all of the anti-semitic attacks may have been perpetrated by Jews themselves. When he was previously asked about the wave of attacks, Trump took offense, angrily told a Jewish reporter to “sit down,” then boasted about his electoral college victory. He has been roundly criticized for using his Twitter account to hype up terrorist attacks by Muslim radicals (to the point of congratulating himself for his own demagoguery) but remaining quiet about attacks on Muslims, such as the recent mass shooting in Quebec. I personally think it’s a bit much to expect the president to condemn nearly every bad thing that happens in the world. But Trump’s singling out of Muslims has been striking. That he found a few lines in his speech to unequivocally denounce anti-semitism and the clearly racist shooting in Kansas City is fine. It doesn’t suddenly make him credible on any of this. By whose measure? While it’s true that there has been a surge in opioid abuse in recent years, much of the problem is driven by prescription medication available here in the United States. Outside of opioids, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, drug use is down, sharply. Marijuana imports from Mexican cartels are down dramatically, thanks to legalization (which Trump’s attorney general would like to see overturned). Meth imports are up, but that’s largely because domestic crackdowns have created demand for imports. (And you can make a strong argument that the demand for meth is itself the product of prohibiting conventional amphetamines.) Given that illegal drugs are, well, illegal, there’s no foolproof way to prove or disprove the claim. The best we can do is look at border seizures of illicit drugs, on the theory that if demand, the numbers of border agents and the methods of detection remain the same from year to year, the ratio of illicit drugs seized to the total quantity of drugs smuggled will remain about the same. By this measure — really, the only one we have — Trump’s claim fails. Overall, border seizures of illicit drugs are trending down, not up. (See this graph in particular.) Even heroin seizures dropped in 2015 after hitting a high the year before. This isn’t all that offensive, but it also isn’t particularly original. Washington is full of task forces and blue ribbon commissions. They aren’t particularly effective. President Lyndon Johnson had a commission to study crime. Richard Nixon had a regular task force on drugs, a youth task force on drugs, a police task force within his National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals and a National Council on Organized Crime, among others. Ronald Reagan had a slew of task forces and commissions, including for victims’ rights, drug smuggling and organized crime. Crime went up during all three of those administrations. Good luck. George W. Bush thought he could do that by coercing the Mexican government into militarizing its drug war. The country’s homicide rate jumped by nearly 250 percent. Life expectancy in Mexico dropped for the first time in 60 years. The drug cartels exist for one reason, and only one reason: The drugs they smuggle are illegal in the United States. Alcohol is every bit as addictive as most illicit drugs. There are no alcohol cartels. The cartels exist because people will always want to get high, and because most ways of doing so are illegal. Again, it’s worth noting that the legalization of marijuana has hurt the Mexican cartels — and Trump’s attorney general wants to overturn it. Drug prohibition has failed for more than a century. The Trump era won’t be any different. Credit where it’s due: The line about expanding treatment is welcome. We’ll have to see how that manifests in actual numbers. Immigrants — including undocumented immigrants — are a net benefit for the economy. They produce more than they take out. They also provide an estimated net $12 billion to Social Security. Currently, the United States spends $30 billion on immigration enforcement, more than on all other federal law enforcement combined. Spending more money to deport people who are a net benefit to the economy won’t “save billions of dollars,” it will cost many, many billions. The conservative-leaning group American Action Forum estimates that Trump’s original plan to deport all undocumented immigrants would cost $100 billion to $300 billion. The same group estimates that Trump’s plan would also shrink the economy by more than $1 trillion, and Moody’s estimates it could shrink the labor force by as much as 5 percent. That would drive up wages, as Trump says, but it would also drive up prices, which would eventually cost jobs. The MIT Technology Review estimates that Trump’s border wall will cost $27 billion to $40 billion. Finally, there’s zero evidence that undocumented immigrants commit a disproportionate number of crimes. Countless studies over the past several decades have shown that immigrants (undocumented and otherwise) are much less likely to commit crimes than U.S. citizens and that they’re underrepresented in jails and prisons (outside of immigration detention centers, of course.) El Paso — one of the most Latino big cities in America, and just across the river from one of the most violent cities in the world — has one of the lowest violent crime rates in the country. Who knows what Trump means by this. Barack Obama, after all, deported more than any previous president. Trump’s supporters like to boast that he has “taken the cuffs off” of border patrol agents, and we’ve seen repeated stories of unlawful detainments. That does little for either integrity or the rule of law. See the above discussion on the cost of the border wall. By one estimate, it could take 16 years to build. It also faces significant geographic and ethical challenges. And it won’t come anywhere close to fixing most of the problems that Trump attributes to the “open border.” Even Trump’s own homeland security secretary has said that a border wall won’t do what Trump claims. This is a craven appeal to emotion. Trump is also deporting mothers and destroying families. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents seized an alleged victim of domestic violence and recently seized a woman with a brain tumor from the hospital where she was being treated. There’s little evidence that undocumented immigrants take American jobs, incomes or lives. There’s plenty of evidence that they create jobs (by reducing the cost of goods and services) and income (by contributing to the economy). But not from the seven countries on Trump’s “banned” list. The odds of your average American being killed by a terrorist attack committed by a refugee are astronomical — about one in 3.6 billion. Most radical Islamic terrorist attacks in Europe are perpetrated by the citizens of the countries attacked. American Muslims are an encouraging success story. One good way to turn that story around? Deploy guilt by association to marginalize and dehumanize them. The Associated Press says Trump has mischaracterized this report. It will also drive up the costs of services and goods like produce. It’s likely to leave fruit withering in fields. This is highly deceptive. The murder rate saw its largest percentage increase in a half-century, but it was nowhere near the largest increase in raw numbers. And the reason the murder rate increased so much is because it has been in free fall for 20 years. Look at it this way: Let’s say that in Country X there were 20 total murders in 1994, and then 25 in 1995. The total then fell for the next two decades to just one murder in 2014, but then rose back up to two in 2015. What Trump is saying today is akin to saying that the murder increase in Country X from 2014 to 2015 was greater than from 1994 to 1995. As a percentage, he’s right. The 2015 jump was 100 percent. The 1995 jump was 20 percent. But that doesn’t paint a remotely accurate picture of what actually happened. The murder rate did go up in 2015. In a handful of cities, it went up significantly. In most of the country, the increase was minor, or not at all. Nationally, it looked like a large percentage because the overall number of murders has fallen to such a small number. Chicago is a sad story. But as we’ve pointed out here before, you can make a strong argument that corruption and brutality within the city’s police department are big contributors to the violence. Trump and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions want police to have even less oversight. Blind support for law enforcement is no better than blanket criticism or distrust. It’s baffling to me how people with Trump’s or Sessions’s politics can understand the corruption of power and petty tyranny that infect bureaucracies, but advocate wholesale deference and reverence to the men and women to whom we give badges, guns and the power to terminate lives. Cops who risk their lives to save others deserve respect. Cops in general demand oversight. This is because (1) human beings are flawed, and (2) nothing exacerbates those flaws like giving one human being a gun plus power and authority over other human beings. Back to Trump: This is the most appalling part of the speech. Singling out perpetrators of crimes by their immigration status is no less abhorrent than singling them out by their race — which, of course, is what Trump senior adviser Steve Bannon used to do with the “black crime” tag at Breitbart. This sort of isolation and dehumanization is what authoritarians do to disfavored groups. It has a long and sordid history. It would be appalling even if undocumented immigrants were more prone to violent crime. But of course they aren’t, so in addition to being unabashedly bigoted, it’s also just ignorant. It’s about as useful as opening an office for victims of crimes committed by left-handed people. Or billionaires. Trump next singled out the father of a man killed by an undocumented immigrant. This too is an ugly appeal to emotion that isn’t backed by any data. Yes, there are awful stories like this one. There are also awful stories of people who are murdered by members of just about any group or class you can conjure up. Trump’s tribute to Carryn Owens, the widow of U.S. Navy SEAL Ryan Owens, has also been much discussed. Some pundits have called it the best moment of his presidency. I thought it was cheap and exploitative. There’s been much speculation about whether Trump prematurely ordered the raid that ended Owens’s life. I don’t know enough about military operations to have an opinion on that. But most military experts say that the raid was badly botched. The Trump administration responded to those criticisms by saying that anyone who questioned the raid’s success was doing a disservice to Owens. That approach became problematic when Owens’s own father began publicly questioning the raid. In the past week, Trump has put the blame for it on both the military and on the Obama administration. So it seems odd for him to have touted its success Tuesday night. Trump’s claim that the raid produced valuable intelligence has also been hotly disputed. In short, Trump deflected the growing criticism of his handling of the raid by inviting the widow of the soldier who died in it to his speech, where he got to indirectly revel in the ovation Congress gave for her husband. He did this even as Owens’s father was demanding answers. It wasn’t presidential; it was crass score-settling. It’s worth noting that Trump also called for substantial new spending on infrastructure. That isn’t exactly typical of a Republican these days. I suspect this is what’s driving at least some of the praise for his speech. But this has always been part of Trump’s agenda. It wasn’t an overture to the other side, it was merely confirmation that Trump’s raw nationalism doesn’t fall neatly along partisan lines. The fact that some of his agenda happens to overlap with some priorities of Democrats doesn’t make Trump statesmanlike or presidential. Nor does it dilute the deceit, egotism and shameless fear-mongering that infected the rest of his speech. This speech was a nightmare. That Trump managed to dress up the same populist resentment in language more familiar and palatable to Beltway types makes him more dangerous, not less.

(Pelosi was referring to Stephen K. Bannon, Trump's chief strategist.) CNN political commentator Van Jones: “This was a whitelash."" (Van Jones coined the term, a shortened version of “white backlash,” to describe Trump's victory) Then another text card appears, saying: “SO THEY STARTED A WAR.” The opening 13 seconds — reminiscent of the beginning of a trailer for an apocalyptic war film — are a buildup for what the video's protagonist says next: “Already, the forces that conspired to keep Donald Trump out of the White House are coming together to sabotage his administration,” declares Wayne LaPierre, the executive vice president of the National Rifle Association. NRA: Voters ‘sent a loud and clear message’ about gun rights The ad, released before the start of the Conservative Political Action Conference, not only solidifies the NRA's role as a Trump ally; it also positions LaPierre — and his organization — as the leaders of a movement to resist the resistance against Trump. NRATV shared the video on Twitter using the hashtag #counterresistance. Andrew Arulanandam, the NRA's managing director for public affairs, hasn't responded to a call from The Washington Post. But the video's message is clear: Those who lost couldn't accept the result of the election, so they began a bitter and violent resistance manifested in destructive riots. And the NRA, which spent more than $30 million to help put Trump in the White House, will be right there with the president, leading the effort against his enemies. The ad uses clips of street protests and flag-burning, footage of people smashing windows, and a video by a Russian government-funded television network of people starting fires — all to portray the other side as initiators of a violent war against the president. Another clip shows the mentally disabled white teenager who was beaten and tortured by four young African American adults. The suspects can be heard shouting expletives about white people and Trump in a video of the attack that was broadcast live on Facebook. NRA chief executive received nearly $4 million retirement payout in 2015 The rest of the ad shows other prominent figures who have spoken openly against Trump: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) holding a megaphone; actress Ashley Judd saying “I'm not nasty” at the Women's March on Washington; and Madonna talking about her thoughts of “blowing up the White House."" (The singer later clarified her comment, saying she was speaking metaphorically.) As they speak, the words “agitation,” “riots,” “insurrection” and “anarchy” flash on the screen — followed by another text card: “We fight back.” “Donald Trump will need every ounce of energy we can muster and he has no more powerful ally than the NRA,” LaPierre says. Then comes a plug of LaPierre's scheduled speech at CPAC on Friday. The NRA endorsed Trump in May, although Trump had not always been a fierce pro-gun advocate. In December 2012, about 2½ years before he announced his candidacy for president, Trump wrote a tweet praising President Barack Obama's appeal for stronger gun control following the mass shooting that killed 28 people -- most of them children -- at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. In his 2000 book, “The America We Deserve,” Trump wrote: “Democrats want to confiscate all guns, which is a dumb idea because only law-abiding citizens would turn in their guns and the bad guys would be the only ones left armed. The Republicans walk the NRA line and refuse even limited restrictions.” He further wrote: “I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun. With today's Internet technology we should be able to tell within 72 hours if a potential gun owner has a record.” Trump has since changed his position. When asked during a March 2016 debate about his view on a ban on assault weapons, he said: “I don't support it anymore.” Gun silencers are hard to buy. Donald Trump Jr. and silencer makers want to change that. As a candidate, Trump championed the Second Amendment, labeling Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton as “the most anti-gun, anti-Second Amendment candidate to ever run for office” and describing her as someone who would “disarm vulnerable Americans in high-crime neighborhoods.” In an article about the NRA video, the Trace, a nonprofit news site funded by Everytown for Gun Safety and other gun-control advocates, notes that the NRA views Trump's presidency as an opportunity to be aggressive. For instance, the group is pushing for two controversial initiatives: expanding concealed carry laws and easing silencer restrictions, the Wall Street Journal reported in November. The Trace further notes: And there's another friend of the gun industry's in the Trump family: the president's oldest son. Donald Trump Jr., an avid hunter, is backing a legislation that would make silencers easier to buy, The Washington Post's Michael S. Rosenwald reported last month. The bill stalled in Congress last year. Jenna Johnson contributed to this post.

If you answer yes, chances are you’ve been to a David Mamet play. He’s into writing these 70-minute plays and throwing in an intermission to make people believe he’s delivered a full evening in the theater. If only he would also add more characters, plot, substance. Mamet’s new one, “The Penitent,” which opened Monday at the Atlantic Theater Company, isn’t so much a play as an argument. Mamet watchers are used to that. What makes “The Penitent” not only thinner but also phony is the final scene where a character lets go with two bomblets that pretty much negate the previous 70 minutes. You will not feel so much enlightened as cheated. It’s like that short story grade school students write where everything is revealed, at the very end, to have been a dream. Not that “The Penitent” is ever riveting, except in some of the downright looney things Mamet’s characters say, as if they inhabit an alternate universe or one that no longer exists. A put-upon shrink (Chris Bauer being convincingly distraught throughout) has been accused of bigotry because he once wrote about homosexuality being “an aberration.” The problem is he didn’t. He instead wrote in some paper that it’s “an adaptation,” and a newspaper of record merely misquoted him. The shrink never gets around to revealing what makes homosexuality an adaptation, like that would make everything okay. Instead, the shrink and his wife (Rebecca Pidgeon indulging in the most overwrought mid-Atlantic accent this side of Norma Shearer) argue about how their lives have been ruined because it’s not enough that the newspaper of record wants to settle the matter by printing a retraction. This couple has apparently never heard of social media or 24-hour cable news, and Mamet is writing about the awesome power of print as though it’s 1984. Also Read: 'Sunday in the Park With George' Broadway Review: Jake Gyllenhaal Paints as Well as Sings Also Read: 'Sunday in the Park With George' Broadway Review: Jake Gyllenhaal Paints as Well as Sings Complicating matters is that the shrink counseled a young homosexual, who went on to shoot ten people, hence the media’s interest. The shrink’s lawyer (Jordan Lage) advises him not to fight the newspaper of record because they have all the money in the world (more echoes of 1984, if not 1964), and after all, the media have already turned the mass murderer into the victim and the shrink into the villain, since the mass murderer might have a civil rights case on his hands because gay people are so good at playing the special-rights card. But not to get worked up! Those two end-of-play bomblets let us know that nothing is as it first appeared. Tim Mackabee has designed a stunningly spare set, composed of two walls, two chairs, and one table. In between the play’s many scenes, Donald Holder’s lighting design brings the illumination down to an ominous level. Under Neil Pepe’s direction, the actors move the chairs and table every which way in the relative darkness, while the two walls remain stationary, like monoliths from “2001: A Space Odyssey.” It is amazing how many ways there are to arrange two chairs and one table. 18 All-Time Great Tony Awards Performances, From 'Dreamgirls' to 'Hamilton' (Videos)




 ""Cabaret"" (1967)  

Joel Grey sang ""Willkommen"" to the big time, winning both a Tony (and later an Oscar) playing the M.C. in this musical set in the early days of Nazi Germany.



 ""Promises, Promises"" (1969)  

OK, the song ""Turkey Lurkey"" frankly doesn't make any sense -- and the whole office holiday party is kind of shoehorned into the plot. (The show's ""I'll Never Fall in Love Again,"" however, became a big hit for Dionne Warwick.) But Michael Bennett's choreography is head-bobbingly, arm-spinningly awesome.



﻿ ""A Chorus Line"" (1976)  

The full ""I Hope I Get It!"" opening number from the quintessential backstage show -- amazing how long CBS let the numbers run back in the day. Bonus for ""Gilmore Girls"" fans: That's Kelly Bishop as the haughty dancer who says, ""I had it when I was in the front.""



 ""Sweeney Todd"" (1979)  

Angela Lansbury won the fourth of her five Tony's playing the daffy Mrs. Lovett, the baker of ""The Worst Pies in London,"" in Stephen Sondheim's dark musical.



 ""Dreamgirls"" (1982)  

Jennifer Holliday's rendition of ""And I'm Telling You..."" has been widely imitated, and this is the performance that is most often imitated. A-ma-zing.



 ""Cats"" (1983)  

Andrew Lloyd Webber continued his domination of Broadway with this feline musical starring Betty Buckley as Grizabella. Interestingly, the breakout ballad ""Memory"" was one of the few songs whose lyrics didn't come from T.S. Eliot's ""Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats.""



 ""Grand Hotel"" (1990)  

Michael Jeter, perhaps best known from the sitcom ""Evening Shade,"" was a rubber-limbed sensation playing a tipsy bookkeeper in the number ""Let's Take a Glass Together.""



 ""Rent"" (1996)  

Jonathan Larson's rock opera version of ""La Boheme"" gained extra poignance with his unexpected death after the first Off Broadway preview. The show became a phenomenon, and launched the careers of Idina Menzel, Jesse L. Martin and Taye Diggs.



 ""Chicago"" (1997 revival)  

Bebe Neuwirth and Ann Reinking displayed all the athleticism of Bob Fosse's original choreography in the hit revival of Kander & Ebb's musical about the dawn of celebrity criminals (which led to the Oscar-winning 2002 movie).



 ""The Lion King"" (1998)

While Disney's stage version of the animated movie swept most of the major awards in 1998, we chose the opening number from the 2008 telecast -- celebrating the show's 10th anniversary and with clearer shots of Julie Taymor's magnificent puppets and stagecraft.



 ""Wicked"" (2004)  

Idina Menzel may have had some cold-induced pitchiness on the final note, but she (and co-star Kristin Chenoweth) are still pretty sensational on the now-standard showstopper ""Defying Gravity.""



 ""The Drowsy Chaperone"" (2006)  

Sutton Foster shows off while insisting that she doesn't want to show off no more in this delightful number.



 ""Spring Awakening"" (2007)   

Duncan Sheik's rock musical about rebellious teens shook up the staid world of Broadway with a just-mouthed rendition of ""Totally F---ed"" performed by very young Lea Michele, Jonathan Groff, John Gallagher Jr. and Skylar Astin.



 ""Gypsy"" (2008 revival)  

Everything came up roses for Patti LuPone, who won her second Tony Award playing the irrepressible Mama Rose in the classic musical about showbiz striving.



 Neil Patrick Harris' Tony Opening Number (2013)  

It's hard to fill a space as cavernous as Radio City Music Hall -- but NPH did just that with a ""bigger"" number (written by ""Hamilton"" composer Lin-Manuel Miranda) that included high steps, high notes, leaps, magic, shout-outs to ""How I Met Your Mother"" fans and even Mike Tyson. Wow.



 James Corden's Tony Opening Number (2016)  

The hard-working late-night host (and a Tony winner himself) did his own version of a dream-big number, running through a dozen classic Broadway musicals from ""Les Miz"" to ""Fiddler on the Roof"" to ""Annie.""



 ""Hamilton "" (2016)  

Audiences at home finally got a chance to see a slice of the buzzed-about hip-hop hit, which even scored an intro from Barack and Michelle Obama.



 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Drama Students Sing ""Seasons of Love"" (2018) 

There wasn't a dry eye in Radio City Music Hall when students from Parkland, Florida, performed the anthem from ""Rent"" months after a horrific mass shooting killed 17 of their classmates and teachers. The Tonys had honored their drama teacher, Melody Herzfeld, with a special award.

A doctor put a stethoscope to Gardner's chest, then fastened a small target over the condemned man's heart. Minutes later, five marksmen, identities unknown, trained their Winchester rifles on Gardner from 25 yards, then opened fire on the executioner's command. The fusillade exploded through the hooded inmate's torso, killing him almost instantly. Gardner was the most recent U.S. prisoner to die by firing squad, a method of death once considered too brutal and offensive for civilized American society. But he might not be the last. An ongoing shortage of lethal injection drugs – coupled with the grisly spectacle of botched executions and a number of legal challenges to the use of less-effective substitute drugs – has several states, and at least one inmate, calling for the return of the firing squad. RELATED: Infamous death penalty cases In 2015, Utah Gov. Gary Herbert, a Republican, signed a bill that established firing squads as an execution option, reversing an 11-year ban, though no one has been put to death since Gardner. In Mississippi, a bill authorizing firing squads cleared the state House in early February before the state Senate shot it down. Firing squads are on the books in Oklahoma, and lawmakers in other Southern states are said to be considering similar legislation. Meanwhile, in late February, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the request by Thomas Arthur, an Alabama death-row prisoner who wanted the state to fatally shoot him rather than subject him to the likelihood of a painful death from secret, experimental lethal-injection drugs. But Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor excoriated her colleagues for tacitly endorsing execution methods that could reasonably be considered as cruel or inhumane – and she pointed to firing squads as the way to go. ""Some might find this choice regressive, but the available evidence suggests that a competently performed shooting may cause nearly instant death,"" Sotomayor wrote in a blistering dissent. ""In addition to being near instant, death by shooting may also be comparatively painless. And historically, the firing squad has yielded significantly fewer botched executions."" Death penalty opponents, however, say firing squads aren't fail-safe, the condemned don't always die immediately and the procedure smacks of tin-horn dictatorships, undermining America's global standing as a champion of human rights. That states are looking to salvage the practice, they say, is yet another sign that capital punishment is on its way out. ""I think that the death penalty is in big trouble in the United States,"" says Austin Sarat, an associate dean and law and political science professor at Amherst College. ""The legitimacy of capital punishment has been sustained in part by the belief that we could find a way of execution that would be safe, reliable and sane,"" says Sarat, the author of ""Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America's Death Penalty."" He notes the same arguments officials are making for the firing squad – it's quick, it's humane, it's reliable – were the same ones proponents used for lethal injections as its more clinical, civilized replacement. ""It's a back-to-the-future [method] that was replaced for a reason,"" Sarat says. The discussion over firing squads, however, has emerged against a series of bungled lethal-injection execution attempts, the effect of an engineered shortage of highly-effective drugs used to sedate and quickly kill the condemned. Several years ago, in a blow against capital punishment, the worldwide pharmaceutical industry has stopped supplying the drug protocol to death-penalty states that execute by lethal injection. Because of the boycott – and several high-profile DNA exonerations of death-row inmates – the number of executions in the United States stalled, and then dropped to historic lows. Scrambling for a Plan B, authorities began using combinations of drugs available on the market that were supposed to bring swift, painless death, but the opposite has happened. Some inmates have remained conscious for several minutes, screaming in agony as the toxic chemicals entered their bloodstreams. Others have foamed at the mouth in violent spasms, gasping for air as they died. Experts say the experience is probably akin to being burned alive from the inside out; in one Oklahoma execution, inmate Clayton Lockett contorted in pain for nearly an hour before he died. Several death-row inmates have challenged the new drug combination as cruel and inhumane, but the Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that that the lethal cocktail was legal under the Constitution. Nevertheless, corrections officials and death-penalty opponents, eager to avoid macabre headlines, are resurrecting an anachronistic punishment once considered the stuff of pulp fiction and lawless banana republics. ""The elusive search in the modern era for humane methods of execution was a reaction to the perceived barbarity of death by methods like the firing squad,"" Phyllis Goldfarb, a George Washington University law professor, writes in an email. ""Death by firing squad is not pain- and botch-free,"" Goldfarb writes, noting some marksmen have missed the heart target and hit other parts of the body, while others have fired prematurely. ""The condemned dies from blood loss and loses consciousness when blood supplied to the brain drops precipitously. Even when the people in the firing squad hit their target as intended, it may take at least a couple of minutes for the condemned to die and sometimes much longer."" To that point, firing-squad proponents have a quick retort: So what? ""How could a civilized society place a man before a firing squad, [opponents] ask,"" writes Joseph R. Murray II, a guest columnist for the Jackson, Miss., Clarion Ledger, commenting on the debate over the state's proposal to have inmates die by the bullet. ""To these folks, that's third-world justice. But isn't a firing squad the most humane way to execute a criminal? Isn't death instantaneous?"" Murray asks. ""Where lethal injection could go awry, causing prolonged pain, and electrocution could not work effectively, there is no doubt multiple bullets do the job quickly and safely."" Such was the case with Gardner, the Utah inmate who was executed in 2010. He was condemned for killing a bartender, then gunning down a lawyer in a brazen courthouse escape attempt in the 1980s. Though the state had outlawed firing squads six years before his execution, Gardner -- who had been behind bars for most of his adult life -- was an exception: Since he was sentenced in 1985, he got to choose his method of death. ""'I lived by the gun, I murdered with a gun, so I will die by the gun,"" he told loved ones. The anonymous sharpshooters who killed Gardner came from a volunteer pool of trained law-enforcement officers; those from the area where the crime happened are preferred. Authorities say prison officials typically get more volunteers than they need,, and Gardner's execution was no exception. Before he was strapped to the steel chair, the five officers on the squad loaded one round into their state-issued rifles. One random cartridge is blank, so no officer is entirely sure if he or she fired a fatal round. Though Utah had banned firing squads in 2004, lawmakers voted to bring back the procedure in 2015, their response to the shortage of death-penalty drugs. But Goldfarb says if authorities want to be absolutely certain that an inmate dies instantly without pain or suffering, they can choose another target on the body. ""Firing a gun at point blank range into the head"" is 100 percent effective, and ""would cause a near-instantaneous death. But it would be exceedingly violent and destructive,"" Goldfarb writes. ""But could we ask someone to inflict that kind of violence on another as part of their job as a state employee? If the state were to authorize such a gruesome spectacle in the name of law, how could we maintain our standing in the world as a protector of human rights?"" Still, she predicts the firing squad debate could go far in the current law-and-order climate ushered in with President Donald Trump's inauguration. ""I see the present moment as one in which fair debate based on factual evidence is being threatened and 'fear of the other' who would use violence to harm 'us' is being fanned for political gain,"" she writes. ""These are the emotional conditions that have allowed the death penalty to persist in America – providing a simple answer to a complex problem."" Still, ""there may be pockets of renewed death penalty support, using whatever methods are permitted,"" writes Goldfarb. ""But I don't think that approach will become widespread again, as it degrades us as a society and depends on rhetoric that is divisive, cynical, extremely racialized, and ultimately corrosive to America."" In Utah, some lawmakers apparently agree: A bill to completely abolish capital punishment in the Beehive State nearly reached the governor's desk last year. During the legislative debate, Ricky Gardner, Randy Gardner's brother, temporarily disrupted the session, waving enlarged photos of his brother's autopsy, showing a black, grapefruit-sized hole where his heart used to be. ""This is my brother!"" Randy Gardner yelled. ""Look at that! That's somebody's little brother, that's somebody's dad! That's what the death penalty's done to Utah!"" Around that time, the Salt Lake Tribune went all-in for repealing the death penalty, recalling the state's early history of rough frontier justice, as well as the years (and millions of state taxpayer dollars) it takes for an inmate to exhaust his legal appeals. Firing squads, the paper declared, are ""a relic of a brutal age that casts the state in the most negative light before the world,"" the paper declared. ""The legal, ethical and financial arguments necessary to make the death penalty seem like anything other that what it is – thuggish, expensive vengeance that harms everyone it touches – are getting harder and harder to make, or believe."" ""It's time to end this practice,"" the editorial concluded, ""once and for all."" Copyright 2017 U.S. News & World Report This content is not available due to your privacy preferences."

Early that Sunday, gunman Omar Mateen burst into the Pulse nightclub. By the time his rampage was over, he’d killed 49 people and injured 53 more. It was the deadliest mass shooting in American history. Colon, 26, was shot six times. He has since gone through three surgeries and months of rehab. A former Zumba instructor, Colon was used to being in top physical shape; now he’s in the midst of a long healing process. While he was in the hospital, Colon agreed to give a news conference with doctors, nurses and other victims. More than 100 reporters and photographers showed up. “I got to the [conference] room and was like, ‘Whoa!’ ” he recalls of the crowd. “I didn’t expect to see that many cameras,” he says. “I thought that there would just be a couple of reporters there. I didn’t realize that the whole world would be watching.” As he spoke, Colon tells PEOPLE he had an epiphany. “I decided right then, I’m not going to let this change me; I’m not going to let it break me down,” he says. “I gonna have to do something about it.” RELATED VIDEO: Story Behind the Story of PEOPLE’s Call to Action on Gun Violence • For more on Colon’s life after Pulse and his work now, subscribe to PEOPLE or pick up this week’s issue, on newsstands Friday. After surviving the mass shooting, Colon became an advocate: A mutual friend put him in touch with the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, and he flew to Washington to lobby Congress to prevent dangerous individuals from acquiring guns — including those with ties to terrorism. The FBI had investigated Mateen for such connections, but he was able to legally purchase the weapons he used at Pulse. “One minute I was having fun and the next, I was shot multiple times and fighting for my life,” Colon tells PEOPLE. “I was shot by a man who never should have had a gun.” Colon’s advocacy work has given him a new purpose. “I’m just grateful to be here,” he says. “It’s basically a second chance in life. I’m doing anything I can, and helping others as much as I can. I can share my message and my story and try to change the world.” The 49 victims killed at Pulse were among 15,060 people who lost their lives to gun violence in the United States in 2016, according to the nonpartisan research group Gun Violence Archive.

But he survived the June 12, 2016, attack thanks to a police officer dragged him to safety. Now, more than eight months after the deadliest mass shooting in American history killed 49 people and injured 53 others, the 26-year-old Colon is moving forward as a survivor.

A December 2016 cut-off excludes the Québec City mosque attack from the list. There were more than 78 terrorist attacks in that period – the ones selected by the White House are almost exclusively those linked – or rumoured to be linked – to Islamic State. The White House text is reproduced in bold and its errors have been kept.  MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA September, 2014 TARGET: Two police officers wounded in knife attackATTACKER: Abdul Numan Haider Global media organisations including the Guardian, BBC, CNN and Fox News were among those who covered this story.

NEW YORK CITY, NY, USA October, 2014 TARGET: Two police officers wounded in knife attackATTACKER: US person This is vague but seems to refer to Zale Thompson, also known as Zaim Farouq Abdul-Malik, described as a “self-radicalised” Muslim convert. He was killed by police. RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA November, 2014 TARGET: One Danish citizen wounded in shootingATTACKERS: Three Saudi Arabia-based ISIL members Read a news report here.

PARIS, FRANCE January, 2015 TARGET: One police officer and four hostages killed in shooting at a kosher supermarket ATTACKER: Amedy Coulibaly The killings – part of the series of attacks around the Charlie Hebdo massacre – received global attention. Coulibaly had claimed to be acting for Isis. Curiously, the linked attacks by the Kouachi brothers, who had pledged allegiance to al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, are not on the list.

RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA January, 2015 TARGET: Two US citizens wounded in shooting ATTACKER: Saudi Arabia-based ISIL supporter It’s not clear to which incident this refers. It could be two employees of Vinnell Arabia who were attacked by a former colleague in Al Ahsa, not Riyadh, that month; or the killing in October 2014 of another US VA employee, which did take place in Riyadh.

Possibly muddled with an earlier attack near Giza pyramids in which two police officers were killed. SOUSSE, TUNISIA June, 2015 TARGET: 38 killed and 39 wounded in shooting at a beach frequented by westerners ATTACKERS: Seifeddine Rezgui and another unidentified attacker The Sousse massacre was extensively covered.

Last modified on Tue 31 Aug 2021 15.20 BST TIMELINE: September, 2014 - December, 2016 NUMBER OF ATTACKS: 78 It is not clear why these dates were chosen. A December 2016 cut-off excludes the Québec City mosque attack from the list. There were more than 78 terrorist attacks in that period – the ones selected by the White House are almost exclusively those linked – or rumoured to be linked – to Islamic State. The White House text is reproduced in bold and its errors have been kept.  MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA September, 2014 TARGET: Two police officers wounded in knife attackATTACKER: Abdul Numan Haider Global media organisations including the Guardian, BBC, CNN and Fox News were among those who covered this story. TIZI OUZOU, ALGERIA September, 2014 TARGET: One French citizen beheaded ATTACKER: Jund al-Khilafah in Algeria Algerian militant group Jund al-Khilafah broke its former allegiance with al-Qaida to pledge itself to Isis. QUEBEC, CANADA October, 2014 TARGET: One soldier killed and one wounded in vehicle attack ATTACKER: Martin Couture-Rouleau The Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu ramming attack was described by the Canadian government and police as Isis-inspired. OTTAWA, CANADA October, 2014 TARGET: One soldier killed at war memorial; two wounded in shootings at Parliament building ATTACKER: Michael Zehaf-Bibeau Read the Guardian’s live coverage here. NEW YORK CITY, NY, USA October, 2014 TARGET: Two police officers wounded in knife attackATTACKER: US person This is vague but seems to refer to Zale Thompson, also known as Zaim Farouq Abdul-Malik, described as a “self-radicalised” Muslim convert. He was killed by police. RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA November, 2014 TARGET: One Danish citizen wounded in shootingATTACKERS: Three Saudi Arabia-based ISIL members Read a news report here. ABU DHABI, UAE DATE: December 2014 TARGET: One American killed in knife attack ATTACKER: Dalal al-Hashimi Read a news report here.

TOURS, FRANCE December, 2014 TARGET: Three police officers wounded in knife attackATTACKER: Bertrand Nzohabonayo Read a news report here. PARIS, FRANCE January, 2015 TARGET: One police officer and four hostages killed in shooting at a kosher supermarket ATTACKER: Amedy Coulibaly The killings – part of the series of attacks around the Charlie Hebdo massacre – received global attention. Coulibaly had claimed to be acting for Isis. Curiously, the linked attacks by the Kouachi brothers, who had pledged allegiance to al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, are not on the list. TRIPOLI, LIBYA January, 2015 TARGET: Ten killed, including one US citizen, and five wounded in bombing and shooting at a hotel frequented by westerners ATTACKERS: As many as five ISIL-Libya members Read a news report here. RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA January, 2015 TARGET: Two US citizens wounded in shooting ATTACKER: Saudi Arabia-based ISIL supporter It’s not clear to which incident this refers. It could be two employees of Vinnell Arabia who were attacked by a former colleague in Al Ahsa, not Riyadh, that month; or the killing in October 2014 of another US VA employee, which did take place in Riyadh. NICE, FRANCE February, 2015 TARGET: Two French soldiers wounded in knife attack outside a Jewish community center ATTACKER: Moussa Coulibaly Three soldiers were wounded. COPENHAGEN, DENMARK February, 2015 TARGET: One civilian killed in shooting at a free-speech rally and one security guard killed outside the city’s main synagogue ATTACKER: Omar Abdel Hamid el-Hussein Read a news report here. TUNIS, TUNISIA March, 2015 TARGET: 21 tourists killed, including 16 westerners, and 55 wounded in shooting at the Bardo Museum ATTACKERS: Two ISIL-aligned extremists In fact 22 people were killed, not including two perpetrators. Mention of “16 westerners” presumably excludes the Tunisian, Japanese and Colombian victims. Isis did claim responsibility but the Tunisian government blamed an al-Qaida splinter group. The story was carried live by many news outlets. KARACHI, PAKISTAN April, 2015 TARGET: One US citizen wounded in knife attackATTACKERS: Pakistan-based ISIL supporters No report of this could be found. However, an American woman, Debra Lobo, was shot and wounded in April 2015 in Karachi by a reported Isis sympathiser. PARIS, FRANCE April, 2015 TARGET: Catholic churches targeted; one civilian killed in shooting, possibly during an attempted carjackingATTACKER: Sid Ahmed Ghlam Sid Ahmed Ghlam is charged with the attack and is awaiting trial. ZVORNIK, BOSNIA April, 2015 TARGET: One police officer killed and two wounded in shooting ATTACKER: Nerdin Ibric It is true there are few English-language reports on this attack. Here is one. GARLAND, TX, USA May, 2015 TARGET: One security guard wounded in shooting at the Prophet Muhammad cartoon event ATTACKERS: Two US persons The “two US persons” were Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi, both killed in the attack. BOSTON, MA, USA June, 2015 TARGET: No casualties; one police officer attacked with knife ATTACKER: US person Very vague but could refer to Usaama Rahim, who was shot dead by police after officers said he “threatened” (not “attacked”) them with a knife. He was under counter-terrorism surveillance. EL GORA (AL JURAH), EGYPT June, 2015 TARGET: No casualties; camp used by Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) troops attacked in shooting and bombing attack ATTACKERS: Unknown number of ISIL-Sinai members Few reports on this in mainstream press, possibly explained by the “no casualties”. LUXOR, EGYPT June, 2015 TARGET: One police officer killed by suicide bomb near the Temple of Karnak ATTACKER: Unidentified This could be wrong. A police officer sustained minor injuries in an attempted suicide bombing at Karnak in which two would-be assailants were killed and one injured. Possibly muddled with an earlier attack near Giza pyramids in which two police officers were killed. SOUSSE, TUNISIA June, 2015 TARGET: 38 killed and 39 wounded in shooting at a beach frequented by westerners ATTACKERS: Seifeddine Rezgui and another unidentified attacker The Sousse massacre was extensively covered.

DHAKA, BANGLADESH September, 2015 TARGET: One Italian civilian killed in shooting ATTACKER: Unidentified This could refer to the aid worker Cesare Tavella. Isis claimed responsibility. COPENHAGEN, DENMARK September, 2015 TARGET: One police officer wounded in knife attackATTACKER: Palestinian national It is not clear why the list spells “attacker” as “attaker” from here onwards. EL GORA, EGYPT October, 2015 TARGET: No casualties; airfield used by MFO attacked with rockets ATTAKER: Unidentified ISIL-Sinai operatives News reports on this could not be found. PARRAMATTA, AUSTRALIA October, 2015 TARGET: One police officer killed in shooting ATTAKER: Farhad Jabar The killing was widely reported in Australia and worldwide. RANGPUR, BANGLADESH October, 2015 TARGET: One Japanese civilian killed in shooting ATTAKER: Unidentified Isis claimed responsibility for the death of Kunio Hoshi. HASANAH, EGYPT October, 2015 TARGET: 224 killed in downing of a Russian airliner ATTAKER: Unidentified ISIL-Sinai operatives The Sinai plane crash was the subject of massive global media coverage. MERCED, CA, US November, 2015 TARGET: Four wounded in knife attack on a college campusATTAKER: US person Faisal Mohammad, whom the FBI called an Isis-inspired “lone wolf”, was shot dead. But why highlight this and the Ohio State University attack and not, say, these other campus attacks? PARIS, FRANCE November, 2015 TARGET: At least 129 killed and approximately 400 wounded in series of shootings and IED attacks ATTAKERS: Brahim Abdelslam, Saleh Abdeslam, Ismail Mostefai, Bilal Hadfi, Samy Amimour, Chakib Ahrouh, Foued Mohamed Aggad, and Abdelhamid Abaaoud The White House surely cannot include the Paris attacks in the “most” on this list that it thinks were under-reported. It omits the names of three of the 11 men involved in the attack, and spells Chakib Akrouh’s name wrong. The death toll for the attacks stands at 130. DINAJPUR, BANGLADESH November, 2015 TARGET: One Italian citizen wounded in shooting ATTAKER: Unidentified This appears to refer to the attack on the priest Piero Parolari. RAJLOVAC, BOSNIA December, 2015 TARGET: Two Bosnian soldiers killed in shooting ATTAKER: Enes Omeragic Read news reports here. SAN BERNADINO, CA, US December, 2015 TARGET: 14 killed and 21 wounded in coordinated firearms attack ATTAKERS: Two US persons The spelling should be San Bernardino. The “two US persons” were Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik. Media coverage extended to networks carrying live footage as reporters entered the couple’s home. LONDON, ENGLAND, UK December, 2015 TARGET: Three wounded in knife attack at an underground rail station ATTAKER: Muhyadin Mire The stabbing was covered in the US as well as across the UK.

PARIS, FRANCE January, 2016 TARGET: No casualties; attacker killed after attempted knife attack on Paris police station ATTAKER: Tarek Belgacem Read news reports here and here. PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA January, 2016 TARGET: One police officer wounded in shooting ATTAKER: US person The case of Jesse Hartnett, the police labor union said after the White House claim, was covered adequately and fairly. HURGHADA, EGYPT January, 2016 TARGET: One German and one Danish national wounded in knife attack at a tourist resort ATTAKER: Unidentified As with the Cairo incident cited above, this is not clear. Three people – two Austrians and a Swede – were stabbed at a Hurghada resort. One perpetrator was shot dead.

ORLANDO, FL, US June, 2016 TARGET: 49 killed and 53 wounded in shooting at a nightclub ATTAKER: US person The worst mass shooting by a single perpetrator in US history was far from “under-reported”.

1248168014,2017-02-21 15:06:12,Gun silencer bills could mean big business for industry,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/money_latest/~3/kYHCvFagA7o/index.html,en,False,"politics and government,law and legislation,gun control,firearms",1102,CNN Money,http://money.cnn.com/,"Do Not Sell The lawmakers say the devices are useful because they keep shooters from blowing out their eardrums. Gun control advocates see them as dangerous weapons that can be exploited by criminals, which is why they were subjected to rigorous constraints in the first place. Identical bills, each called the Hearing Protection Act of 2017, have been introduced in the House and Senate. If they pass, silencers will no longer require extra layers of gun control that have been in place for more than 80 years. It would be great news for the silencer industry, which boomed in recent years but appears to have slowed in recent months. ""The return on that would be huge,"" said Philip Sansotta, the online marketing manager for Gemtech, an Idaho company that has made silencers since the 1970s. Idaho is the home state of Republican Mike Crapo, a sponsor of the Senate bill. Gemtech and SilencerCo, a leading silencer company headquartered in Utah, displayed their wares recently at the SHOT Show, the annual gun industry exhibition in Las Vegas. Reporters were invited to a windswept desert range to use SilencerCo's Salvo 12, the world's first silencer for a shotgun, and the Maxim 9, a pistol-silencer combo. Silencers, also known as suppressors, are canister-shaped mufflers attached to the ends of gun barrels to dampen the noise of gunshots. They sound louder in real life than they do on, say, ""The Walking Dead,"" where they're used to quiet gunshots to avoid alerting marauding zombies. Real silencers sound more like a car door slamming, but they're still quieter than the loud crack of unsilenced guns. ""What you can likely hear behind me is an unsilenced firearm,"" said Jason Schauble, chief revenue officer at SilencerCo. He was referring to the staccato from the neighboring lane, where reporters were blasting AR-15s from Daniel Defense. Schauble, a Marine veteran who was shot and wounded in Iraq, said his company sold 120,000 silencers last year, up from 35,000 in 2013. Revenue grew 600% in the same time. The silencers cost $323 to $1,200, depending on the type of gun and caliber. Related: Gun sales cool following post-San Bernardino surge More than 330,000 silencers were registered nationwide in the two years ending in February 2016, according to the federal government. That amounts to about a third of all silencers registered since 1934, when the National Firearms Act was implemented. Silencer sales surged in tandem with gun sales under President Barack Obama, who tried and failed to get gun control measures passed, and with Hillary Clinton running to succeed him. Under President Trump, though, the threat of tougher federal gun laws has vanished. Gun sales have dropped dramatically, and the future of silencer sales is uncertain. The Hearing Protection Act appears to be slowing silencer sales, too. Knox Williams, president of the American Suppressor Association, an industry group, said customers are waiting for looser restrictions rather than paying the $200 tax required under current law and submitting to a months-long background check ""for what is effectively a muffler."" They could be waiting a while: Industry officials say the bill is not a priority in Congress and might not pass until 2018 or 2019. Schauble already laid off some workers after the ATF closed a loophole on silencer sales in July 2016, and he said the Trump factor and the bill in Congress have further slowed sales. SilencerCo is already offering an unusual rebate: Anyone buying a silencer during a three-month period is eligible for a rebate on the $200 tax required by the NFA. The rebate provides $200 worth of SilencerCo merchandise. Related: Why NRA-endorsed President Trump is bad for gun sales Schauble said he suffered hearing loss during his time with the Marines and would have benefited from a silencer. He and Sansotta played down concerns about their potential criminal use, blaming spy movies for making the devices seem quieter than they are. Under the 1934 act, federal law equates silencers to machine guns and sawed-off shotguns. They're legal in 42 states but subject to more rigorous federal regulations than most guns. In addition to the FBI check, anyone wanting to buy a silencer has to mail or fax a photo and fingerprints to the ATF and pay the $200 tax. Approval can take nine months or more, unlike a gun background check, which can take minutes. The bills in Congress would remove that classification for silencers, get rid of the extra layers of background checks and speed the process of buying one. Related: Buying a gun silencer just got easier The bills propose that silencers be treated the same as rifles and shotguns, which require standard background checks when purchased through federally licensed dealers. Many states also require their own background checks. But in some states, they could be purchased from non-dealers with no background check. Brendan Kelly, a spokesman for the Brady Campaign and Center to Prevent Gun Violence, dismissed the Hearing Protection Act as ""absurd."" ""There are far more effective hearing protection devices already easily available,"" he said. ""What this is really about is a case of misplaced priorities. Lawmakers introduce this bill in the name of safety, yet continue to trounce the will of the American people by keeping dangerous people armed with guns."" Related: The shotgun silencer is not really silent The silencer companies have powerful allies in addition to the lawmakers. President Trump was endorsed by the National Rifle Association, and his son Donald Jr. is a competitive shooter who produced a video with SilencerCo CEO Josh Waldron touting the virtues of silencers. The White House did not respond to a question from CNNMoney about where Trump stands on silencers. Silencers were originally regulated because of their association with gangsters during Prohibition. Al Capone is long gone, but gun control advocates fear that silencers could still be used to dampen the warning sound of violent acts like mass shootings. ""The noise that a gun makes is a safety feature for those around the gun, whether it's a lawful instance of somebody hunting or it's somebody engaging in a terrible mass shooting,"" said Robert Spitzer, political science professor at the State University of New York and author of ""Guns Across America."" Related: New pistol with built-in silencer debuts ""You always read about people who hear that noise and who are able to flee or to hide, precisely because they are tipped off by that noise,"" he said. He said the primary motive for removing regulations from silencers is not to protect hearing -- because hearing protection is already available -- but simply to sell more silencers. ""If the Hearing Protection Act, as it's called, is passed by Congress, signed by the president, enacted into law, I think you'll find an explosion in the purchase of silencers,"" he said.

1247394260,2017-02-07 07:46:10,White House's 'under-reported' terror list includes many well-known attacks,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/07/white-house-list-donald-trumps-undereported-terror-list-paris-attacks-berlin-truck-killings,en,False,"politics and government,united states politics and government,armament, defense and military forces,news and news media,terrorism,crime and criminals,united states armament and defense,united states international relations,international relations",623382,Guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us,"Trump administration attempts to back up president’s claim that media is deliberately ignoring terror attacks by releasing list riddled with errors First published on Tue 7 Feb 2017 05.52 GMT The White House has distributed a list of 78 terrorist attacks to support Donald Trump’s claim that the media is failing to properly report them. But the list includes many atrocities that received blanket western media coverage including the Paris Bataclan attacks, the Nice truck killings and the San Bernardino shootings.  Many others including the Sydney siege and Germany’s Christmas market attack received wide international coverage. The list also includes multiple errors and spelling mistakes, including “San Bernadino”, and excludes numerous terror attacks across the Middle East. The release comes after the US president told military leaders in Tampa, Florida, on Monday that there have been attacks all over Europe but “in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report it”. He added: “They have their reasons, and you understand that,” but did not expand. Later the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, was asked about specific attacks that had not been reported, to which he replied: “We’ll provide a list later. There’s several instances … There’s a lot of instances that have occurred where I don’t think they’ve gotten the coverage it deserved.” That list, released to media outlets including the Guardian, included a “timeline” of domestic and international incidents from September 2014 to December 2016. Some, such as last year’s mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, and the killing of 129 people in Paris in November 2015, received huge coverage. But officials claimed that “most” of the attacks were not adequately reported by western media outlets, CNN reported. The list hops from Afghanistan to Algeria to Australia but, without explanation, does not mention Israel, where incidents included a bus bombing in Jerusalem last year, carried out by a 19-year-old Palestinian, that injured 20 people. A December 2016 cut-off also excludes the Québec City mosque attack from the list, an attack Trump was publicly silent about, despite condemning on Twitter the Louvre attack in Paris several days later. The murder of British backpacker Mia Ayliffe-Chung in an Australian hostel last year was also included on the list, even though extremism had been ruled out as a motive by both police and the victim’s mother. In an open letter to Trump, Rosie Ayliffe accused Donald Trump of using “fake news” about her daughter’s death to further the “persecution of innocent people” by falsely claiming she was the victim of a terrorist attack. “My daughter’s death will not be used to further this insane persecution of innocent people,” she wrote. The document also includes spelling mistakes such as “attaker” instead of “attacker” and “Denmakr” instead of “Denmark”. There have been similar errors in official communications in recent days, including references to Theresa May as “Teresa” and a reference to Malcolm Turnbull as the “president” of Australia when it should be “prime minister”. The catalogue begins with an attack by Abdul Numan Haider, who wounded two police officers in a knife attack in Melbourne in September 2014. It ends with an atrocity involving Anis Amri, who drove a truck into a crowded market in Berlin last December, killing 12 and injuring 48. Lindsay Walters, a White House spokesperson, claimed that the list demonstrates how terrorist attacks are losing perceived news value because of their frequency. “The real point here is that these terrorists attacks are so pervasive at this point that they do not spark the wall-to-wall coverage they once did,” she said via email. “If you look back just a few years ago, any one of these attacks would have been ubiquitous in every news outlet, and now they’re happening so often – at a rate of more than once every two weeks, according to the list – that networks are not devoting to each of them the same level of coverage they once did. “This cannot be allowed to become the ‘new normal’, and the President, for one, is not going to be satisfied until the American people are much safer and more secure.” Earlier, Spicer told reporters travelling on Air Force One that Trump believes attacks are not “unreported” but “under-reported”. He said: “He felt members of the media don’t always cover some of those events to the extent that other events might get covered.” But David Gergen, a political analyst and former adviser to four US presidents, condemned Trump’s remarks. “I think this is one of the most outrageous claims the president has made, among many, because it really says, basically, that the press is not doing its job because it has its own political agenda,” he told CNN. “It doesn’t want you to know the truth about how dangerous terrorism is. It doesn’t want to be out there, it’s just pulling a leftist agenda on you, which is clearly not true.” Gergen added: “He engages in these falsehoods without producing any serious evidence. The list includes San Bernardino, as if the press didn’t cover that sufficiently. It’s just astonishing and it’s beneath the dignity of the presidency and I think it tears at the fabric of what holds us together as a people when we can’t trust each other, we can’t trust the White House, and he’s telling us we can’t trust the press. This is the way democracies come unravelled.”"

His refusal to admit gun laws had anything to do with the Sandy Hook school massacre earned him the title of the “craziest man on earth”. Today, LaPierre sits at the left hand of the president. Trump seems eager to flatter the National Rifle Association’s executive vice-president and CEO, the leader of the group that became one of his most loyal champions and spent more than $30m to back his candidacy.  In his second week as president, Trump called LaPierre to the White House for a special meeting of conservative leaders. Securing a new supreme court nominee who would guard the court’s favorable rulings on gun rights had been the NRA’s highest election priority, and Trump had just delivered it. The president asked LaPierre to introduce himself. “Wayne, I would say they know you,” said Trump, referring to the group of conservative leaders. “Perhaps they know you better than they know me.” LaPierre laughed, as did others around the room. “I doubt that,” he said. The photograph of LaPierre and Trump turned towards each other, the president eagle-eyed and benevolent, LaPierre’s face scrunched in a wide grin, is already being used by gun violence prevention groups as a fundraising tool. Trump has promised to support a sweeping pro-gun agenda, and the NRA has told its members that it’s finally time for the group “to go on offense”. But LaPierre’s ascendancy marks more than a shift towards ever looser gun laws. It’s a triumph for the political strategy that LaPierre perfected, one that has frequently been derided as extreme and paranoid. Trump won the White House, and is now governing the country, using the same playbook as LaPierre: always attack, never apologize and treat the news media as the opposition party. “If you want to understand some of the approach and personality of Donald Trump, I think you look at what Wayne LaPierre has been doing for a long time. He’s a little bit of a test run of what Trump been doing,” said Arkadi Gerney, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and longtime gun control advocate. Asked what Trump and LaPierre have most in common, Gerney said, simply: “Lying.” LaPierre’s spokesman, Andrew Arulanandam, declined to comment. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the president’s relationship with the NRA. LaPierre and other NRA leaders have long argued, even as the gun control movement has set increasingly modest aims, that Democrats’ real goal is confiscation of Americans’ firearms. LaPierre claimed that a narrow expansion of background check laws after Sandy Hook would be turned into a national registry of gun owners, something that is prohibited by federal law, and that the final background check legislation explicitly said it would not do. “The gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill,” a furious Barack Obama said after the legislation failed to advance in the Senate. “They claimed that it would create some sort of ‘big brother’ gun registry, even though the bill did the opposite. This legislation, in fact, outlawed any registry. Plain and simple, right there in the text. But that didn’t matter.” LaPierre’s antagonism towards the mainstream media and liberal politicians is rooted in some real failings. News reporting on American gun politics is sometimes marked by condescension of and ignorance towards gun owners. Democrats have continued to champion some anti-gun measures that have little evidence behind them. The assault weapon ban, for instance, is a symbolic policy that even a senior Obama administration admitted would be unlikely to save many lives. But for decades, LaPierre has also pushed an apocalyptic view of the United States as besieged by terrorists and violent criminals. Trump and his administration have embraced a similar dark vision of “American carnage”, which runs counter to crime data that show decades of increasing safety and declining violence. Trump has seized on a real recent uptick in murders as a devastating development. His new attorney general suggested this week, to the astonishment of America’s crime experts, that he believes the increase is a “dangerous permanent trend”. Like Trump, LaPierre has been criticized by liberals as a power-player who rakes in millions by fearmongering and railing against the establishment. Both men have been painted by the left as manipulators who fail to represent the true interests of their base, a view undermined by their continued popularity. When confronted with the dark side of America’s gun culture, LaPierre has gone on the offensive. Days after the Sandy Hook shooting in December 2012, which left 26 students and educators dead, LaPierre’s combative pro-gun press conference was widely derided as tone deaf and out of touch. In response to 20 first-graders being shot to death by a disturbed young man with a military-style rifle, LaPierre denied that guns were the problem. “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,” he told a room packed with reporters. LaPierre slammed “our nation’s refusal to create an active national database of the mentally ill”, and put the blame for the shooting on violent video games and Hollywood films, not the easy access to guns by deeply disturbed young men. To respond to the country’s mass shooting problem, he proposed a program to put armed police officers in every school in America. LaPierre almost dared the room of reporters to respond to his speech with “shocking headlines”, and they did. One Republican commentator called the speech “very haunting and very disturbing”. Chris Christie, then a potential Republican presidential contender, told a reporter: “I don’t necessarily think having an armed guard outside every classroom is conducive to a positive learning environment.” Billionaire gun control advocate Michael Bloomberg slammed LaPierre for offering a “paranoid, dystopian vision of a more dangerous and violent America where everyone is armed and no place is safe”. Despite the political fallout from this speech, the NRA would ultimately win out in the battle to block new federal gun control laws after Sandy Hook – a victory that cemented the group’s political influence, and its status as one of the most hated organizations for the left. Over the next years, despite a steady drumbeat of mass shootings, Congress refused to pass any new gun control legislation. Obama would continue to call out the NRA for pushing “conspiracy” and “the imaginary fiction in which Obama’s trying to take away your guns”, as he put it in 2016. He told a CNN town hall that year that he had repeatedly invited the NRA to speak with him, “but the conversation has to be based on facts and truth”. The NRA had simply declined to participate in the televised conversation about guns in America. Under previous Republican presidents, the NRA had been in the good graces of the White House. In 2000, an NRA official claimed that the group was so close with George W Bush that if he won, “we’ll have a president where we work out of their office – unbelievably friendly relations.” But LaPierre’s fierce anti-government rhetoric has at times alienated some Republican leaders. In 1995 LaPierre sent out a fundraising letter about the threat of “jack-booted government thugs”, a letter that came shortly before anti-government extremists carried out a terror attack in Oklahoma City. In response, former President George HW Bush publicly resigned from the NRA. “Your broadside against federal agents deeply offends my own sense of decency and honor; and it offends my concept of service to country,” the elder Bush wrote. “It indirectly slanders a wide array of government law enforcement officials, who are out there, day and night, laying their lives on the line for all of us.” LaPierre later apologized, saying the words were misunderstood. With Trump, the NRA is once again celebrating the optics of being a key ally of the White House. Trump came to the presidential campaign with little record as a gun rights champion. He once supported a ban on assault weapons. But NRA leaders endorsed him early, and stood with him through a careening candidacy that included his claim that “second amendment people” might be able to stop Hillary Clinton from appointing supreme court judges if she were elected, an offhand comment widely interpreted as a threat of violence or assassination. “We saw through the media deception, and recognized him for who he was: the most openly pro-second amendment presidential candidate in history,” LaPierre said in a recent video address to members. “They made a bet on an extreme candidate, and it paid off,” Gerney said. Gun control advocates are now sharing the photograph of LaPierre in the White House to rally their supporters for the coming fight over more expanded, permissive gun laws. After Sandy Hook, LaPierre “lied to the faces of grieving Americans and tried to convince them that the only thing capable of keeping them safe is a gun”, Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat and one of Congress’s most vocal gun control supporters, said in a statement. “That has never been true and it will never be true. “When you exaggerate and you mislead people and you fearmonger and you intensify people’s beliefs and divide people,” that strategy “may overwhelm a more disorganized, better-informed majority perspective”, said Gerney, the longtime gun control advocate. “But, at some point, if the more diverse majority coalition can coalesce, then you may have discredited yourself from being at the table.”","Donald Trump seems eager to flatter the National Rifle Association’s executive vice-president and CEO, once described as the ‘craziest man on earth’ Last modified on Thu 7 Jan 2021 00.07 GMT Four years ago, Wayne LaPierre’s face was plastered across New York’s tabloid covers as a “gun nut” and a “loon”.

I also believe March is one of the months of the year in which Republicans in the House and Senate act like total reality-denying jerks, the others being January, February, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November and December.  Plus: as of today we've made it through one-sixth of 2017.  Slap another gold star on your tuchus and...Forward! JEERS to “the speech.” I'm going out on a huge limb here, because it's still Tuesday morning and yet I'm already writing my summary of Trump's speech to a joint session of Congress: it sucked. A bunch of hokum and bullshit wrapped up in nationalistic language that might as well have come from the Aryan Mad Libs for Dummies. It was stilted, stunted, uninspired, woodenly delivered, and pointless. On top of that, no one shouted ""You lie!"", meaning the slur has only been shouted at one president---the black one.  Now folks on both sides will go back to their respective corners and continue proving that the United States is a failed experiment in representative democracy for the foreseeable future.  On the other hand, this was great… We're wearing suffragist white for today's #JointSession as part of our pledge to fight for equal pay, family leave & more! #WomenWearWhite pic.twitter.com/C9hngmQV4T And this… The media was fooled, but this woman brought receipts. pic.twitter.com/T8vMkXZaO7 We now return you to our regularly-scheduled resistance. CHEERS to going two for three. Got some results from the trio of special elections in Connecticut yesterday: Connecticut Results 2nd District state senate race: Democrat Doug McCrory beat Republican Michael W. McDonald and two write-in candidates by a bruising margin. 32nd District state senate race: Republican state Rep. Eric Berthel defeated Democrat Greg Cava in a district Trump won by 60%. 115th District House race: Democrat Dorinda Borer crushed Republican Edward R. Granfield. Turnout was only 18 percent. Net result: the state Senate remains tied at 18 Ds and 18 Rs. And how nice to see a McCrory in office who's not evil. CHEERS to the swingiest swing state in all of Swingdom. I was hatched at Mercy Hospital in Mount  Vernon, Ohio in August of 1964, and that makes me a dyed-in-the-wool Buckeye. So it goes without saying that today I'm wishing a HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my home state---214 years young.  Seven mostly-crappy presidents from Ohio were elected, and you all wisely stopped nominating us after Harding kicked the bucket. It's the only state whose flag is a pennant. And we're the proud birthplace of Steven Spielberg, Neil Armstrong, John Glenn, Orville Wright,Clark Gable, Gloria Steinem and one or two others. Oh, and in the interest of fairness I should also mention that some people say Nebraska was admitted to the union on this date in 1867. Can't say I'm familiar with it, but I'll take 'em at their word. CHEERS to justice.  Hey, kids!  Some racist assholes who thought it'd be hilarious to terrorize some black kids during a birthday party by waving confederate traitor flags and threatening to shoot them are actually going to prison. For a long time, too… They will serve 13 years and six years in prison respectively, local media report. Superior Court Judge William McClain said the two were ""motivated by racial hatred."" They are part of a group of at least 15 people charged over the incident in which cars were driven along the street flying the Confederate battle flag in Douglasville, west of Atlanta, in July 2015. The crime occurred shortly after a mass shooting inside an African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina by a white supremacist gunman. […] Torres and Norton were found guilty of threatening to kill some of those attending the child's party while shouting racial slurs at children. Torres was said to have been carrying a shotgun, according to prosecutors. The two radical Christian terrorists cried when they were sentenced. And no one knows how the hell they did it, but their tears came out shaped like Jefferson Davis's head. CHEERS to helping hands.  Happy Peace Corps Week!  The organization that Kennedy built turns 56 today, and it's still crankin' out the good works. This year they gave a shout-out to the top schools that have contributed the most Corps volunteers: For the first time in three years, the University of Wisconsin–Madison reclaims the top spot among Peace Corps’ Top Volunteer-Producing Colleges and Universities list. There are currently 87 Badgers serving in 40 countries around the world. For years, UW-Madison has consistently sent some of the largest cohorts of volunteers overseas and has maintained its place as the No. 2 all-time volunteer producer with 3,239 alumni having served since 1961. Among small schools, Denison University tops the list, making significant strides this year by jumping 13 spots from No. 14 in 2016. American University finally nabs the No. 1 medium volunteer-producing university title, having been just shy of the top spot for the past two years. See the full list here.  Fifty-six years later, it's still ""the toughest job you'll ever love."" Especially if you bring a few cases of Bacardi along.  And limes. Without limes it's intolerable. - Ten years ago in C&J: March 1, 2007 CHEERS to...Marryland!!! Today's the day Governor Martin O'Malley puts pen to parchment in the Old Line State: The legislation, making Maryland the eighth U.S. state to legalize gay and lesbian nuptials, heads to Governor Martin O'Malley's desk for his signature at a ceremony at 5 p.m. on Thursday, his office said. The Democratic governor has supported the measure and promised to sign it once it was passed by lawmakers. The state Senate voted in favor of the bill last week after it was passed by the House of Delegates. Of course, the crowd for whom equality is a four-letter word in Maryland is already swarming to try and put a referendum on the November ballot to overturn the law. Their bumper sticker slogan: ""Over My Dead Divorce Papers!"" - And just one more… CHEERS to anticipation. All eyes are on Harpursville, New York, where April the giraffe is fixin’ to give birth again---her fourth calf.  It's your turn to monitor the livestream for us… We'll relieve you tomorrow morning at this same time. Please don’t blink. Have a happy humpday. Floor's open...What are you cheering and jeering about today? - Today's Shameless C&J Testimonial: ""Yes, I don’t like Cheers and Jeers. Nobody likes that."" ---George W. Bush - "

Caitlyn Jenner coming out as transgender in 2015 didn’t change her party affiliation as a Republican. She was vocally supportive of both Ted Cruz and Donald Trump through last year’s campaign, and even reportedly tried to convince her stepdaughter Kim Kardashian to vote for Trump over Hillary Clinton. But the Trump administration’s move to overturn an Obama-era directive urging schools to ensure bathroom and locker room access to transgender students in schools was a bridge too far for Jenner. In a video statement she posted on Twitter on February 23, Jenner told transgender kids that they “are winning,” and that the “bullies” trying to put them down are “sick” and “weak.” She went on to shout out the lawsuit of transgender teen Gavin Grimm — who will be taking his case to use the boys’ bathroom to the Supreme Court in March — and called out one member of the Trump administration specifically. “Apparently,” Jenner continued, “even becoming attorney general isn’t enough to cure some people of their insecurities.” Well @realDonaldTrump, from one Republican to another, this is a disaster. You made a promise to protect the LGBTQ community. Call me. pic.twitter.com/XwYe0LNUOq Finally, Jenner addressed the president himself, “from one Republican to another.” “This is a disaster,” she said. “You can still fix it. You promised to protect the LGTBQ community. Call me.” It’s true that Trump made promises. After the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando last June, Trump said on the campaign trail that the targeting of LGBTQ people was “no good” and “we’re going to stop it.” In July, he became the first Republican nominee to mention the LGBTQ community in his speech at the Republican National Convention, even if briefly. And on the issue of North Carolina barring transgender people from using the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity, Trump said last April on the Today show that the state was having a “lot of problems” and that people should just “use the bathroom they feel is appropriate.” When Matt Lauer followed up by asking if that meant Trump would be fine with Caitlyn Jenner walking into Trump Tower and using the women’s bathroom, Trump confirmed that was “correct.” Jenner, for her part, seems to have taken Trump at his word, saying last year that Trump “seems very behind the LGBT community.” Now, as my colleague German Lopez put it, Trump has proved that his support for the LGBTQ community only goes as far as it will be helpful to him, punting crucial transgender protections as a states’ rights issue. But given the notoriously anti-LGBTQ politicians Trump has surrounded himself with, from Vice President Mike Pence to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, it’s not exactly surprising — a fact many Twitter users were quick to point out to Jenner. @Caitlyn_Jenner  Listen!

Swedish publication TheLocal.se talked with terrorism expert Magnus Ranstorp, a researcher at Sweden’s National Defense University, who says that Trump's claims of ""under-reported"" terrorist incidents are simply crude propaganda aimed at making American citizens much more fearful of terrorist attacks than they need to be. ""The easiest way to describe this is classic fake news from Trump's White House,"" he said. ""This is nothing to do with the truth, it’s an influencing operation. Propaganda, targeted at the American population."" Ranstorp was particularly dismayed that the Trump administration included minor incidents on its list of terror attacks, including a case of arson committed in the city of Malmö, Sweden that only resulted in minor smoke damage. ""These things have been reported at a local level, as many of them are instances of local news, for which there would be a limited international appetite,"" Ranstorp said. ""Then there's also the question: if you aren't sure if it was a terror-related issue, or something else, why would you report it as terror?"" According to a report from Forbes' Dan Alexander, the children of Donald Trump are hoping that the sale of the lease of the Trump International Hotel in Washington DC, for a reported $400 million goes through because it will bail them out of a ""rotten investment"" first proposed by Ivanka. Earlier in the week the Wall Street Journal reported that the lease for Trump International -- which has been nothing but a money-loser for the family -- might be purchased by a Miami-based investment firm known as CGI Merchant Group.           A Melania Trump pal who was appointed to the prestigious Kennedy Center board by former president Donald Trump recently left Washington amid scandal, after sending a series of text messages to DC power players accusing a woman he had a relationship with of being a prostitute. Paolo Zampolli once represented Melania Trump in her modeling career, and introduced her to Donald Trump in 1998.                British soul diva Adele on Friday released comeback single ""Easy On Me"", in which she shares with the world details of the traumatic six years she has endured since last releasing a record. In that period, the 33-year-old megastar said she suffered a ""year of anxiety"" in which her marriage fell apart.            Copyright © 2021 Raw Story Media, Inc.

This year, some of it actually stands a chance of passing. The worst by far is a bill filed in both the House and Senate that would eliminate all “gun-free” zones in the state. If passed, persons with concealed-weapons permits would be able to carry firearms to pro sports events, bars, police stations, K-12 public schools, public colleges and universities, courthouses, polling places, government meetings, seaports, and airport passenger terminals. To single out just one of the many pathways to random bloodshed, Republican lawmakers seem determined to make handguns accessible wherever mass quantities of alcohol are being consumed. What would normally be a sloppy fistfight in the stands at a Dolphins game could literally be a .45-caliber shootout next season. And if you think campus keg parties aren’t lively enough, throw a couple of loaded Glocks into the mix. Polls show widespread opposition to abolishing gun-free zones, a view shared by college officials, business leaders, and many in law enforcement. But the politicians pushing for more firearms in public are serving a higher master: the NRA. Its unabashed darling in the Senate is mild-mannered Dennis Baxley, who is, fittingly, an undertaker by trade. His Ocala funeral parlor could see an uptick in business if guns are allowed in bars. On the House side, Speaker Richard Corcoran insists criminals and mass shooters are attracted to gun-free zones because they know civilians there won’t be armed. Lawmakers say the Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando and the shooting at the Fort Lauderdale airport might have been prevented if the victims had been carrying weapons. This Charles Bronson fantasy is avidly promoted by the NRA. It relies on the false premise that anyone with a concealed-weapons permit is both calm enough and skilled enough to fire a handgun in crowded mayhem and actually hit the right person. The airport mass shooting, committed by an unhinged legal gun owner, took less than 90 seconds. The victims, some on their way to meet a cruise ship, had just gotten off a Delta flight. Even if any of them had brought a weapon, it would have been packed inside their checked luggage, as was the shooter’s semiautomatic Walther. The killing was over before many of the bags landed on the carousel. So much for the Bronson scenario. It took an army of cops to bring down the Pulse shooter (another licensed gun owner), yet we’re supposed to believe he could have been taken out by a single armed club patron, pointing a handgun in dimly lit clamor at a fast-moving assailant firing an assault rifle. Well, maybe in the movies. NRA-backed lawmakers won key committee assignments in the new Legislature, which means that several of this session’s bad gun laws have a better-than-usual chance of passing. One such bill, opposed by prosecutors, makes it easier for shooters to claim a Stand Your Ground defense. It resurfaces now, as a retired Tampa police captain is on trial for fatally shooting a man during a confrontation in a movie theater. The victim was armed with a bag of popcorn and a cell phone. Even if the state’s gun-free zones are abolished, companies and private business owners can’t legally be required to allow customers with weapons on their property. Never fear — one GOP senator has a devious compliance tactic. Sen. Greg Steube of Bradenton, a favorite pet of the NRA, has filed a bill aimed to punish the many retailers, restaurants, nightclubs, theme parks, movie theaters and other businesses that prohibit firearms. Among the big names potentially affected would be Disney, Costco, and Whole Foods. Steube’s measure would allow anyone holding a concealed-weapons permit to sue a gun-banning establishment if he or she gets shot, or otherwise assaulted, on the premises. The legal claim would be that they could have protected themselves had they been armed. It’s a tort lawyer’s dream. If your drunken stepbrother sneaks a stolen pistol into a bar and shoots you in the ass, you get to sue the bar because you were deprived of the chance to shoot him first. That scenario fits Will Ferrell better than Charles Bronson, but it’s closer to reality than the NRA can ever admit. Know first. The opinions that matter.

You may not be paranoid. A new round of documents regarding government surveillance was unveiled by WikiLeaks on Tuesday, alleging that the Central Intelligence Agency hacks smartphones, computers and connected TVs to spy on American citizens and others around the world. (The CIA declined a request for comment.) To be clear, the techniques released in these documents are “very targeted,” said Sydney, Australia-based security researcher Troy Hunt. “Authorities would want to have a very good reason to use those techniques and the vast majority of people are outside the scope of what they’d be used for,” he said. Still, the revelations are not the first to suggest the government is surveilling citizens — in fact, they aren’t much different from the documents National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked in 2013, according to Mark Weinstein, a privacy advocate and chief executive officer of social network MeWe. He said each new round of revelations fuels the growing anxiety U.S. citizens have about being watched. “People are feeling an overwhelming sense of being creeped out by the aggregate of these stories,” he said. For average citizens starting to think about how to keep their communications out of reach of Big Brother, here are some of the ways to lock down devices and keep government entities, advertisers and corporations out of your daily lives. Use encrypted communication To avoid surveillance — by governments or others users — you should switch to more secure apps for messaging, like Signal, which is free for download on iTunes and Google Play. The app, which is recommended by Snowden himself to avoid surveillance, allows users to send encryption-protected information to others who also use the app and collects and stores very little data about users. WhatsApp, for example, is also encrypted but does store metadata — the information about who you are messaging and where, and is owned by Facebook 
        FB,
        +1.23%
       . (Facebook did not reply to request for comment.) Similarly, iMessage is encrypted by default, but Apple 
        AAPL,
        +2.02%
       still stores metadata on user conversations for up to 30 days and can hand the information over to law enforcement with a warrant. Messaging on iPhone is also only encrypted between two iPhone users, so texting Android users will revert messages to unencrypted SMS. Apple had a standoff with law enforcement over equipping devices with so-called “back doors” to enable them to access user information. The issue came to a boiling point when Apple refused to help the Federal Bureau of Investigation unlock the iPhone of the man who carried out a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. in 2016. No method is 100% secure, as the documents released Tuesday allege that the CIA has been able to access phones directly, bypassing encryption. This means they could install keyloggers or other surveillance tools directly onto user devices, intercepting communication at the source. “Signal, WhatsApp and iMessage are all encrypted end to end and the techniques for ’circumvention’ are akin to looking over someone’s shoulder as they type their messages into a secure platform like these,” Hunt said For nonmobile devices, users can implement PGP, a protocol that stands for “Pretty Good Privacy,” to encrypt and protect email. Cover up your webcams The documents released by WikiLeaks allege that the CIA built hacking tools that could remotely control devices including iPads, iPhones, Android devices and computers — hacking the camera and microphone to secretly record video and sound. A simple, cheap way to put a stop to this is to cover the camera with electrical tape or a Post-it Note. In fact, Snowden did just that in “Citizen 4,” the 2014 documentary made about him. Any opaque material works, but there are also a number of novelty stickers sold online to cover everything from computer cameras to iPad and iPhone devices. Buy stickers from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which fights for legislation that protects civil liberties against surveillance, and you can support internet freedom for the world while implementing your own. Update your devices Keeping your devices updated is a basic way to prevent hacking and other security breaches. Phones that are not updated are much more likely to be compromised, as a number of high-profile bugs have shown in recent years. In 2015 a flaw was discovered in 95% of Androids that allowed the phones to be hacked with a simple text, and a similar iPhone flaw was found just months before that. Apple can push out fixes to users remotely, but Google doesn't — making it all the more important to click that pesky “update your device” pop up whenever you see it. Don’t miss: 7 ways to keep your smart home from being hacked “You have to take care of basic cyber hygiene,” said Michael Kaiser, head of the public-private partnership to educate the public on digital privacy and security at the National Cyber Security Alliance. “Keep software up-to-date, and use strong passwords and two factor authentication.” Secure your smart TV (or don’t buy one) One of the hacks allegedly implemented by the CIA that WikiLeaks data revealed acts as a bug on Samsung TVs, allowing the agency to record citizens even after they had turned the TV off. Users can disable the features on Samsung that allow outsiders to snoop under ‘settings.’ Scroll to support, then ‘terms and policies’ and turn off voice-related services on the TV. However, Weinstein said the only sure way for users to prevent this is to unplug the TV completely when it is not being used — or avoid buying smart TVs at all. Users may run into issues with DVR and other “off-TV” capabilities, but without camera or audio capabilities, TVs will be less likely to monitor consumers. Buy a “dumb” TV and use a device like Apple TV that collects less information. A number of models come without video, microphones and other extras. Cover your tracks on social media Even without the government looking over our shoulders, social media makes it easy to give away a lot of privacy on our own, posting vacation photos and other personal details. Going completely dark on social media — deleting Facebook and Instagram accounts and moving to a cabin in the woods to avoid tracking — may be too extreme for the average consumer. It’s better to “start with what we can do,” said Weinstein. This includes steps as simple as switching from Google 
        GOOG,
        +2.55%
       to DuckDuckGo, a search engine that doesn’t track users. Users can also switch to a Tor browser, which uses encryption to allow people to surf the web without being tracked. While the WikiLeaks allegations center on government surveillance, Weinstein said, they are contributing to an awareness of how often we are watched in places that were once private, like the living room. “This is a lot bigger than ‘I have nothing to hide,’” Weinstein said. “This is about the fundamental right to enjoy your life without having someone over your shoulder watching. It’s a very interesting moment as people realize worldwide we have become the product, not the customer they serve.”"

592907396,2017-03-12 18:11:29,Lauren Southern is the Alt-Right’s Not-So-Secret Weapon,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/lauren-southern-is-the-alt-rights-not-so-secret-weapon,en,False,,300613,VICE,http://www.vice.com/en_us,"It’s early February, and hundreds of Canadians have gathered to protest President Donald Trump’s refugee ban in front of the U.S. consulate in downtown Toronto. A young woman stands with a camera operator on the edge of the crowd, waiting for her security guard to arrive. The hood of her down-filled coat pulled over her head, she’s hiding her instantly recognizable Barbie-blonde hair, and watching quietly, occasionally looking down at her phone, as protesters chanted a few hundred metres away: “No Muslim ban on stolen land.” As one of the most popular hosts for Canada’s alt-right media torchbearer, the Rebel, Lauren Southern has frequently put herself in crowds of people whose views are fundamentally at odds with her own. She’s made a habit of parachuting into spaces where visible minorities are speaking out about their rights and demanding they explain their political positions and teach her why she’s wrong. Southern — who announced on Thursday that she is parting ways with the Rebel and “going independent” — sees herself as a commentator, tasked with countering “the mass amount of left wing media we have that pretends to be impartial in Canada.” In a series of interviews with VICE News over the last month, she opened up about her views, her critics, and how she’s built her profile. Once her bouncer arrives at the Toronto rally, she quickly springs into action, removing her hood and making a bee-line towards protesters holding what she sees as the most outlandish signs. Almost immediately, she is recognized by a protester who politely confronts her about the Rebel’s coverage of a mass shooting in a Quebec mosque earlier this year, in which Alexandre Bissonnette, a white man who reportedly expressed anti-refugee views, allegedly killed six Muslims as they prayed. Early reports had mistakenly identified a Muslim man as a suspect but unlike other news outlets, the Rebel didn’t correct the record until the following day. “She corrected that information, if you paid attention to the next news report, which you apparently didn’t,” Southern tells the woman, defending her then-colleague Faith Goldy, who in her reports continued to raise questions about what authorities may be hiding. “And then she corrected that information, if you paid attention to the next news report, which you apparently didn’t.” This tactic of seeding doubt and raising questions that counter the dominant narrative in mainstream media has proven fruitful for the Rebel, which is just over two years old. Founded by anti-establishment and right-wing muckraker Ezra Levant, the organization has a roster of 28 hosts and contributors, rakes in millions of views every month on YouTube, and is influential enough that a rally held in Toronto in opposition of a motion to condemn Islamophobia also drew four contenders for leadership of the federal Conservatives. It’s not clear what led Southern and the Rebel to part ways. The young pundit declined to get into details in her announcement and Levant wished her well on Twitter. But there’s no question she had become one of its most powerful weapons. I’m curious to see what’s next for Lauren Southern. I wish her the best. @Lauren_Southern Southern boasts 229,000 Twitter followers, more than double that of her former boss Levant; has a bestselling book, called Barbarians: How The Baby Boomers, Immigration and Islam Screwed My Generation, endorsement of American right-wing diva Ann Coulter; and has scored a slew of high profile TV appearances and speaking gigs. Her antics have been as unorthodox as they have been controversial. Southern has shown up at a Slutwalk protest holding a sign that read “there is no rape culture in the West.” She has faked transitioning genders as a pretext to interview transgender activists. She has called Black Lives Matter a “divisive, violent movement that has fascistic tendencies,” falsely claiming they’ve caused more deaths in the last 30 years than the Ku Klux Klan. The Libertarian Party suspended Southern as a candidate in 2015 after her Slutwalk stunt, but reinstated her following backlash from her supporters. “The first few times I did this, I lost friends, I won’t lie. I lost friends that never wanted to talk to me again, and that was devastating,” Southern told VICE News. “There was a petition made to have me kicked out of my political party and I saw people that I was good acquaintances with sign that petition and say I was an evil, hateful person, and that struck deep, that really hurt.” “I saw people that I was good acquaintances with sign that petition and say I was an evil, hateful person, and that struck deep, that really hurt.” She’s gotten over it, she said. Now, more than ever, she’s recognized on the street, and once in awhile, she said, someone will ask for a selfie. She might not have the same name recognition as white supremacist Richard Spencer, disgraced former Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos, or her fellow right-wing vlogger Tomi Lahren. But she runs in those circles — a Canadian addition to the re-emergent band of provocateurs espousing age old extreme views, in a shiny, youthful package. Outside of a protest atmosphere, Southern is disarmingly charming and quick-witted, with an expert grasp of her own talking points. And as I — a South Asian woman, sitting directly across from her — challenged her on her positions, she made no effort to tone down how she feels, speaking at a volume high enough for anyone near us at a Queen Street West bar to hear, smiling and occasionally cracking jokes. “This is perfect assimilation, you and your family would be a great example of assimilation,” she told me, when I revealed I was born into a Muslim family, although I’m not religious. “I think observing the Muslim community in Canada is very different than observing the Muslim communities that really have these problems with extremism, which is in Europe,” she said, adding that the migrant population in Europe is made up of people who haven’t been vetted, who are “going straight into ethnic and cultural enclaves.” “What happens when one part of the mosaic gets bigger than the others? You can say goodbye to your French and English and Native culture, that were the three leaves of the Canadian red ensign … People move here for our culture, people love our culture, and I’d like to keep that culture.” The fear that immigrants will spoil the culture of “freedom and Western values” in Canada — Judeo-Christian ethics, classical liberalism, free speech, and egalitarianism, according to Southern — is a common thread that runs through her work, as is a superficial understanding of the issues that she passionately rants about to her sizeable audience. “People move here for our culture, people love our culture, and I’d like to keep that culture.” This approach has incensed minority groups, like Muslims, who have already seen a spike in hate crimes against them in recent months, and some of whom have gone as far as to start bridge-building campaigns to teach non-Muslims about their religion. “There should always be space for critical voices in the media landscape. The problem is when misinformation, one-sided coverage, and/or outright fake news is used to advance or reinforce a particular view of the world,” said Amira Elghawaby of the National Council of Canadian Muslims. “Southern’s commentaries and coverage have attempted to evoke fear in Canadian audiences about the presence of Muslims in Western nations,” said Elghawaby. “Lopsided and false narratives provide a one-sided view of immigration and refugee issues and will leave those who aren’t critically thinking about the issues to assume that Muslims can only have a negative impact on our communities.” Southern, the daughter of a web designer and a secretary at a medical clinic, speaks with the confidence of someone who’s been groomed for her current position, even though she’s only been a commentator for a few years. The Surrey native attended a Christian private school until she was about 13, and as a teen, she had ambitions of becoming a video game designer. But Southern was always a politics junkie, and was introduced early on by her father to American Conservative commentators like Dennis Prager, a public moralist who has spent his career trying to uphold Judeo-Christian values in American society. “Lopsided and false narratives provide a one-sided view of immigration and refugee issues.” And while Southern’s conservative Christian parents never told her to be either of those things, debating her father on political issues was a consistent part of her home life, she told VICE News during another interview at a west end Toronto coffee shop. Unlike many who are pushed to the fringes of the right by one particular life event or a news story that enrages them, Southern insists that for her, the process was gradual and that her views are still evolving. “It was always him asking questions that led me to different opinions,” she said, recalling how she’d come home from school and tell her dad what she’d learned — about the oppression of Indigenous peoples by Europeans, for example — and how her dad would ask questions, like: “Do you think there were no diseases here before Europeans arrived?” Southern dropped out of the University of the Fraser Valley’s political science program in Abbotsford, B.C. after two years, calling it a waste of money to pay for knowledge she could get on her own. But even in those two short years, she made a name for herself as a fearless spokesperson for views her peers saw as “absurd.” “Around [the university] I got really into the basic bitch Ayn Rand kind of libertarianism,” said Southern. While in school, she co-hosted Liberty Now, a show on the campus radio station across from a student who leaned more socialist. The two would get into heated debates on air on everything from the value of art to the alienation of the modern worker, like a university-level Hannity & Colmes. Southern’s perspective was clear from the start, according to station manager Aaron Levy, but her relationship with others at the station, who fell mostly on the opposite side of the political spectrum, was always friendly. “You could go your whole life being like, Lauren’s nice, if you don’t mention politics.” “You could go your whole life being like, Lauren’s nice, if you don’t mention politics,” said Alex Rake, who knew Southern from around campus before he learned about her political views. “When she worked at the restaurant, she’d give us free lollipops and stuff, and then the anti-feminism video came out.” said Rake. Rake, then the editor of the opinion section of the campus newspaper, said Southern once submitted a piece on why trigger warnings were unnecessary, which after three weeks of editing — Southern pushed back hard on edits on the piece, which was “offensive on purpose” and had numerous research errors, according to Rake — never ended up being published. How Southern went from irksome student to alt-right phenom is closer to fate. She was in the process of applying to become a military intelligence officer when she attended a conference in Toronto, organized by Levant, who noticed her challenging his slate of speakers with tough questions on pipelines and ethical oil. A few months later, as the Rebel rose from the ashes of Sun News Network, Levant remembered Southern and reached out, she said. Levant did not respond to a request for comment for this story. The first video she made, which now has 1.1 million views, was her diatribe against feminism. It was only after the feminism rant received hundreds of thousands of hits seemingly overnight that “people had the ‘we created a monster’ feeling,” Levy told VICE News. “We saw the direction things were going in and what she could possibly mean for the movement — given the kind of personality she has and that she’s photogenic and what not — that she was a danger to progressives in that she’s charismatic and seems to have done her homework,” he added. Southern, who said she would’ve preferred a life of anonymity, abandoned her military aspirations for a career as a thundering critic of the left, taking the platform the Rebel would give her to promote her political ideals. “Nothing of the modern left impresses me.” While the Rebel’s audience skews older and male, Southern seems particularly concerned with another demographic — younger, politically disengaged women, who are “tired of being called basic and having their political opinions ignored.” She views the left today as a movement “being torn apart by insane identity politics, and people who want to berate white males all day,” she said. “Nothing of the modern left impresses me.” And while she’s willing to debate her ideas, Southern says most people fail to present her with clear and concise arguments. Others, like many Muslims she’s tried to bring on her show, flat out refuse to engage in the discussion. It’s a question many on the left are struggling with collectively: Is there a point in engaging with the alt-right, and trying to change their minds when, at their extreme, they question the rights of some minorities to even exist in the West? Is simply acknowledging that their perspectives exist a way of giving their views more oxygen? “A lot of people I talk to are people in the political sphere, in the alt media sphere,” Southern admitted, adding that she’s an introvert who doesn’t go out much. But she insisted she’s not insulated from other opinions. Her best friend is a staunch liberal, and the two have heated political arguments on a regular basis, she says. And while her go-to news sources do include the Drudge Report and Breitbart, she reads a bit of everything. Most of her friends are white — “I grew up in an area that was more than 85 percent European” — but she doesn’t believe she has a bias against people of colour. “Yes, I have friends who are people of colour,” she said. One friend is Muslim, but has right-wing views, and often agrees with her, according to Southern. A close friend in university was Nigerian, “an absolutely badass chick.” And then there’s the internet. “I’ve got a lot of Asian friends that I talk to in my chat groups, especially,” she said. “A lot of meme groups. A lot of right-wing meme groups. I’ve got a lot of Asian friends.” “I’ve got a lot of Asian friends that I talk to in my chat groups, especially.” Her book devotes a lot of ink to Islam. In a chapter called “How Islam is ruining everything” Southern splits Muslims up into three different categories: the cultural Muslim, who was born into a Muslim family but doesn’t know much about their faith; the scholar, who is open to criticisms of Islam and the idea of reform; and the zealous Muslim who “would never question Allah, or his faith, and generally regard any insult against their religion as cause for violence.” But most of what she’s learned about Islam has been speaking with ex-Muslims and Muslims — many conversations with Uber drivers, according to Southern — and polls. Southern makes sweeping generalizations using statistics that are taken out of context, claiming for example that at least 20 percent of Muslims in Europe sympathize with terrorists. Two polls from the past four years do suggest that somewhere between five to 15 percent of residents in Muslim-majority countries had a “favourable” or “positive” view of the Islamic State — yet other polls show similar levels of support within the general population of the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. The reality is a bit more complicated, and those with expertise in the field of opinion polling have urged the public to take those polls with a grain of salt. Polls have shown wildly divergent results from country to country and carry relatively high margins of error, at 4 percent or more. Commentators like Southern also fail to grasp the nuance of the region — that Sunni Muslims from northern Syria may consider IS more ‘favourable’ than the Assad regime. “So if you’re a police officer and you see a black man with a gun towards you, yeah, I’m going to shoot,” Southern took similarly incomplete information to disparage Black Lives Matter.  
“The majority of these shootings are police officers getting shot by armed black men, so if you’re a police officer and you see a black man with a gun towards you, yeah, I’m going to shoot,” said Southern, also arguing that white Americans are more likely to be shot by police than black Americans. Southern dismisses the anger of BLM supporters as a result of “indoctrination” by activists and mainstream media. Her statistics are disingenuous at best. While more white Americans were killed by police last year in total, the likelihood of a black Americans being shot and killed by a police officer is 2.5 times higher, according to a Washington Post database of police shootings. “Black people are convinced by the media that they’re living in a system where everything white people do is trying to oppress them,” Southern said, adding that it’s white people and Asians, who she said discriminated against through affirmative action initiatives. But when Southern rails against Black Lives Matter, it’s rarely about what they’re fighting for. Instead, she focuses on their tactics or their personal lives, using it to paint the entire movement as “an ethnic terrorist organization.” “We can’t allow them to define the story, and that is what they are strategically attempting to do, and what they have successfully done in some cases,” said Black Lives Matter Toronto cofounder Sandy Hudson. “People need to refuse that easy, anti-intellectual bullshit.” ARVE Error: Element ID could not be build, please report this bug. Southern’s determination to cling to her position when presented with facts that crack her arguments was on display outside the Deploraball in DC on inauguration day, as she unwittingly interviewed two employees from Slate. “Do you know what percentage of Muslims are terrorists?” Aymann Ismail, Slate’s video editor, asks her. “No,” Southern responds. “But I know there’s a large percentage that are quite radical.” And so begins an extended exchange in which Ismail and his colleague school Southern on Sharia law, its dramatically different interpretations, and how it’s Muslims who are bearing the brunt of, and fighting, the war against ISIS. Ismail dominates the conversation, and Southern asks him for a card so that they can talk later online. He pleads with her to listen when someone from a different faith or culture explains their views. “Yes, but you guys have different views amongst you,” she says, as he shakes his head in frustration. Back at her alma mater, her former coworkers wonder if they missed their chance to sway Southern away from the hard right. “We talk about, fuck, how can we convert her? What would it take to change her mind?” “We talk about, fuck, how can we convert her? What would it take to change her mind?” said Levy. “How valuable would she be as the hard right person who decided that she’s been following the wrong agenda all this time?” Levy praised the debating savvy possessed by Southern and young commentators of her ilk. “They’re young attractive people who are making, what seems to a lot of people, reasonable arguments,” he said. He points to her Facebook page for examples of “many young people who idolize her political perspective and fetishize who she is as a person and as a woman and jump on everything she says … Clearly, there’s a tide shifting right now.” By signing up to the VICE newsletter you agree to receive electronic communications from VICE that may sometimes include advertisements or sponsored content."

Filed under: It also teaches you how guns work Check out all of Polygon's coverage from Boston at PAX East 2017 Last week I accidentally shot myself in the face while playing a virtual reality game called The American Dream. At this year’s PAX East in Boston, a friendly young man named Nicholas McDonnell shook my hand while an associate helped me into an Oculus Rift headset and a pair of Touch controllers. Once in VR, I found myself seated in a bullet-shaped car on a kind of carnival ride. A 1950’s style narration began, trumpeted by a cutout of the family dog. It promised to show me the wonder of a future living with guns. Over the next ten minute demo, I proceeded to do things with firearms that no sane person would ever do. As an infant, I answered flashcard questions by shooting the correct answer out of my mother’s hand. While working at my first factory job, I emptied magazine after magazine into a conveyor of pastries, trying to knock a hole out of the middle to make the perfect bagel. Later, I cleared the dishes off the counter by plinking them like a tin can perched on a fencepost. To interact with buttons in the environment, I either had to shoot at them or boop them with the muzzle of the gun. To reload, I slammed the butt of the gun into buttons on the sides of my bullet-shaped car. That launched ammunition into the air, beginning a slow-motion bullet time sequence where I had to catch the flying magazine in the receiver. Reloading both guns at the same time, I’ll admit, felt pretty cool. Seeing rounds ricochet off the walls in front of me and zing back directly towards my face in VR, however, felt less cool. “The American Dream is about a two or three hour experience,” said McDonnell, co-founder of developer Samurai Punk. “You go through starting out as a baby to different elements of life, like childhood and being a teenager. You go to the prom. You take your date out to dinner. You get married and do lots of other things. So it’s about doing normal stuff that everyone in America does, but with guns.” It’s fairly obvious satire, and only a portion has been unveiled so far. I spent all my time with a pair of 1911-style pistols, but McDonnell told me that there would a variety of weapons in the final game. A live-action trailer shows a Thompson sub-machinegun, for instance. There’s just one problem. In testing the game, the team at Samurai Punk discovered that many players didn’t know the first thing about guns. So they had to get the game to teach people how to load and fire a pistol. First, they created little red flags that pop out of the chamber when the magazine is empty, prompting a reload. As the magazines fly through the air, some players tried to catch them in the ejector port instead of the receiver. So now empty magazines fall, very visibly, out the bottom of the gun in order to show people where they go. In addition to a brief education on loading a gun, users will get two to three hours practice in rapidly acquiring a sight picture. So, in the hope of turning people off of gun ownership, Samurai Punk may actually make them a better shot. “That was almost by accident,” McDonnell said. “It’s very unfortunate. And honestly, I don’t want people to get better at guns. I want people to play this game and then put the game down and never want to play it again. And to find out how exactly we’re going to achieve that, you’re going to have to play for the final version to discover. That’s all I can basically say about what the game. “Whether or not it’s going to actually teach people to get better [at shooting]? I doubt it. This is VR after all. It can only teach you so much.” There’s of course the small issue of McDonnell and his team all being from Australia, a country that enacted a strict set of gun control laws after a mass shooting in 1996. I asked him how he felt being an outsider, and making a very public critique of American gun culture. “We’re not trying to critique America as much as we are using America as a lens to critique guns in video games and guns in media,” McDonnell said. “America is just a really good way to start that conversation. But we’re not shitting on America. We’re not shitting on anyone.” The American Dream will be out later this year for Oculus Rift, the HTC Vive and PlayStation VR. No price point has been announced.     Filed under:"

                    Ted Bridis, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON — The Obama administration in its final year in office spent a record $36.2 million on legal costs defending its refusal to turn over federal records under the Freedom of Information Act, according to an Associated Press analysis of new U.S. data that also showed poor performance in other categories measuring transparency in government. For a second consecutive year, the Obama administration set a record for times federal employees told citizens, journalists and others that despite searching they couldn’t find a single page of files that were requested. And it set records for outright denial of access to files, refusing to quickly consider requests described as especially newsworthy, and forcing people to pay for records who had asked the government to waive search and copy fees. READ MORE: Obama administration sets new record for withholding FOIA requests The government acknowledged when challenged that it had been wrong to initially refuse to turn over all or parts of records in more than one-third of such cases, the highest rate in at least six years. In courtrooms, the number of lawsuits filed by news organizations under the Freedom of Information Act surged during the past four years, led by the New York Times, Center for Public Integrity and The Associated Press, according to a litigation study by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. The AP on Monday settled its 2015 lawsuit against the State Department for files about Hillary Clinton’s time as secretary of state, at AP’s request, and received $150,546 from the department to cover part of its legal fees. The AP has pending lawsuits against the FBI for records about its decision to impersonate an AP journalist during a criminal investigation and about who helped the FBI hack into a mass shooting suspect’s iPhone and how much the government paid to do it. Of the $36.2 million in legal costs fighting such lawsuits last year, the Justice Department accounted for $12 million, the Homeland Security Department for $6.3 million and the Pentagon for $4.8 million. The three departments accounted for more than half the government’s total records requests last year. The figures reflect the final struggles of the Obama administration during the 2016 election to meet President Barack Obama’s pledge that it was “the most transparent administration in history,” despite wide recognition of serious problems coping with requests under the information law. It received a record 788,769 requests for files last year and spent a record $478 million answering them and employed 4,263 full-time FOIA employees across more than 100 federal departments and agencies. That was higher by 142 such employees the previous year. A spokesman for former President Obama did not immediately respond to an email request for comment late Monday. The White House under Obama routinely defended its efforts under the information law in recent years and said federal employees worked diligently on such requests for records. MORE: How a senior Obama adviser views his record It remains unclear how President Donald Trump’s administration will perform under the Freedom of Information Act or other measures of government transparency. Trump has not spoken extensively about transparency. In his private business and his presidential campaign, Trump required employees and advisers to sign non-disclosure agreements that barred them from discussing their work. His administration has barred some mainstream news organizations from campaign rallies and one White House press briefing. And Trump broke with tradition by refusing to disclose his tax returns. Trump’s secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, is traveling to Asia this week on a small plane without a contingent of journalists or a designated pool reporter who would send reports to the broader diplomatic press corps, departing from 50 years of practice. Overall, in the final year of Obama’s administration, people who asked for records last year under the law received censored files or nothing in 77 percent of requests, about the same as the previous year. In the first full year after Obama’s election, that figure was only 65 percent of cases. The government released the new figures in the days ahead of Sunshine Week, which ends Sunday, when news organizations promote open government and freedom of information. Under the records law, citizens and foreigners can compel the U.S. government to turn over copies of federal records for zero or little cost. Anyone who seeks information through the law is generally supposed to get it unless disclosure would hurt national security, violate personal privacy or expose business secrets or confidential decision-making in certain areas.

However, Williams dismissed the report, saying the matter had been sensationalized and that the situation was under control. The incident took place last October, and at the time, Hannity also used the gun’s laser sight to aim at Williams, CNN Money reported, citing sources. The 55-year-old conservative host was only showing off, but the off-camera episode left Williams and others who were present disturbed, the report added. Read: Florida Seeks To Ban Assault Rifles And Ammunitions However, Williams tweeted late Thursday saying he did not feel he was put in danger and that he and Hannity continue to be “great friends.”   Hannity issued a statement to CNN Money saying he showed the unloaded weapon to Williams in a “professional and safe manner for educational purposes only.” “Every precautionary procedure that I have been trained in since the age of 11 was followed. I've had a conceal carry permit in five states for all of my adult life. Any other interpretation of this is outright false reporting,” Hannity reportedly said in the statement.   The matter was brought to the attention of executives at Fox News, according to the report. Hannity’s colleagues informed the network’s Co-President Bill Shine about the incident, CNN Money reported, noting that Shine is Hannity’s longtime friend. A statement by Fox News to CNN Money said Hannity has a license to “carry a gun in five states, including New York” and that the incident did not put anyone in danger. “The situation was thoroughly investigated and it was found that no one was put in any danger,” the statement read, adding that the incident was referred to the network’s legal and human resources departments. Hannity is a known supporter of pro-gun laws and opposed gun control measures under former President Barack Obama’s administration. He has also criticizing calls for new legislation against firearms after mass shooting incidents in the country."

When her investigation leads her a to mysterious grad student who forged a close bond with her husband, nothing in Claire's life will be the same.






Midnight Special
Jeff Nichols' contribution to the superheroes-for-grownups genre has buzz echoing from Los Angeles all the way to the Austin Convention Center.

The Other Half
Tatiana Maslany gets a much-needed break in ""The Other Half,"" as the actress was only hired to play one character -- a vacation from her clone-heavy ""Orphan Black."" Here she stars as a bipolar woman in love with a grieving man (Tom Cullen) attempting to live a normal life. 






Keanu
Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele are on the threshold of a major mainstream breakthrough. The announcement of the “work-in-progress” screening of their first feature film “Keanu"" made national headlines. The comedy centers around two friends who lose an adorable cat to a vicious gang.

A Stray
""A Stray"" packs a double punch of being both topical and potentially devastating. ""Captain Philips"" star Barkhad Abdirahman stars as a Muslim refugee in Minneapolis who tries outrun his past but then meets a stray dog.  






Tower
Keith Maitland's documentary seems on-trend given numerous titles at Sundance 2016 that deal with gun violence -- but does them one better by revisiting America's first contemporary mass shooting.

""I was a 20-game winner,"" he would joke, ""it just took me five years to do it."" Instead, it was in another role where the imposing, 6-foot-5 Green really made noise. ""When you think of big, with that deep voice, that booming voice, he could hold a team meeting, boy, he could scare you right out of your seat,"" Cleveland manager Terry Francona recalled. Green, the tough-talking, no-nonsense skipper who in 1980 guided the Philadelphia Phillies to their first World Series championship, died Wednesday. He was 82. The Phillies said Green died at Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia. He had been in poor health for a while. Green spent 62 years in baseball as a player, manager, general manager, team president and other roles. ""He was a big man with a big heart and a bigger-than-life personality,"" Phillies Chairman David Montgomery said in a statement. As a pitcher, Green went just 20-22 in the 1960s. His most notable distinction on the mound might have been giving up the only grand slam launched by all-time hits leader Pete Rose. In 1980, with Rose playing first base on a team that included future Hall of Famers Mike Schmidt and Steve Carlton, Green guided the Phillies to a very elusive crown, ending a drought that stretched back nearly a century. ""The Phillies lost a prominent member of their family yesterday,"" Schmidt said. ""He was our John Wayne figure through the strongest years of Philly baseball."" He sure got his team's attention midway through that championship season. After a loss in Pittsburgh left the Phils around .500, his clubhouse tirade was so loud that writers outside the locker room at Three Rivers Stadium swore they could hear every word. ""Baseball world lost a giant,"" Rose tweeted. ""Dallas was a hell of a guy and a real leader."" Green later managed the New York Yankees — where bombastic owner George Steinbrenner liked the idea of someone being able to stand up to him — and the Mets. ""Dallas was pure and simple a 'true baseball man,'"" the Mets said in a statement. Green also was the GM and president of the Chicago Cubs and made a shrewd trade to get a young infielder from the Phillies, future great Ryne Sandberg. The deal helped turn a long-dormant franchise into a club that came within one win of reaching the 1984 World Series. ""Dallas Green had an eye for talent. Our fans can credit him for acquiring and drafting several of the most accomplished players to wear a Cubs uniform, including Hall of Famers Andre Dawson, Greg Maddux and Ryne Sandberg, as well as All-Stars like Shawon Dunston, Mark Grace and Rick Sutcliffe,"" Cubs Chairman Tom Ricketts said in a statement. In 2006, the Phillies inducted Green into their Hall of Fame. He spent 46 years overall in the Phillies system and was an adviser to their last four managers, always known for his commanding presence and shock of white hair. Green was known for his rugged reputation and embraced it. Yet he was left in tears in 2011 when his 9-year-old granddaughter, Christina-Taylor Green, was shot and killed outside a grocery store in Tucson, Arizona, as she went to see U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Six people were killed in the mass shooting as Giffords met with constituents. ""I'm supposed to be a tough sucker, but I'm not very tough when it comes to this,"" Green said at the time. Francona witnessed the effect her death had on Green. ""I know when that happened with his granddaughter, the shooting, I know that that just tore him apart,"" he said. ""I saw him at a golf tournament for that, about a year and a half ago, and you could tell that just ate him alive."" ""I don't know if he was sick, but maybe he's happier now,"" Francona said. Born and raised in Delaware, George Dallas Green is survived by his wife of 59 years, Sylvia; four children; and five grandchildren."

Kasich offered Mayor John Cranley the state's assistance in investigating the Cameo nightclub shooting in a phone call Sunday morning, the governor told Bash. The rest of the interview focused on Kasich's opinions on the recent demise of the House Republicans' health care plan to replace Obamacare – which Kasich opposed largely because of its cuts to Ohioans on Medicaid – and his future political ambitions: He's not that interested in running for president in 2020. Kasich called Republicans and Democrats unwillingness to compromise on health care ""pathetic."" Both parties can't continue to dig in their heels and expect results. ""It doesn't work like that in our country. We're not a parliamentary system. And whenever you continue to operate like that, what you pass will never be sustainable,"" Kasich said. Maybe President Donald Trump will include Democrats in future negotiations, Kasich said. ""I think he's learning a lesson from this.

""It hurts my soul, especially being a music advocate in the city,"" said Kick Lee, a local music producer and composer who has worked on a number of feature films. As one of the few hip-hop nightclubs in the city, Cameo's crowded dance floor has attracted world-famous rappers. Lil' Wayne and Drake were spotted there in 2014. Photos show a cheerful Weezy, smiling among the throng in a white knit cap, while Drake chilled in the back calmly sipping a drink. Weekend killings in Cincinnati, Las Vegas are terrifying but not terrorism Gunfire erupts at Cincinnati nightclub; quarrel leaves 1 dead, 15 hurt News of the shooting hurts but won't destroy the local rap scene, Lee said. Cameo isn't the the biggest venue devoted to rap and hip-hop. OTR Live in Over-the-Rhine, which is operated by the same owner as Cameo, is bigger and regularly attracts big artists. And Cameo, in the East End, is more dance club rather than a concert hall. But the shootings could reinforce the perception that rap and hip-hop are dangerous and could strengthen the resistance by some to more clubs opening in the city, Lee said. Whoever is involved in the shooting doesn't represent the local rap and hip-hop scene, he said. ""We need more venues for hip-hop because there's that fear about what the hip-hop realm attracts,"" Lee said. Lee said he would often go to Cameo to support DJs and performers. He never felt threatened. Cameo is owned by Julian Rodgers, who has owned and operated a number of nightclubs around the city. He owned the former Mixx Ultra Lounge on Main Street. Rodgers also organized the Cincinnati Summer Jam last year that brought in artists T.I., Young Jeezy and 2 Chainz to BB&T Arena at Northern Kentucky University. Cameo opened in 2013 after the previous club in that space, a gay bar called Adonis, closed. Some described Cameo as popular but not central to the local music scene. It is more like a place for parties and after-parties from shows, said Gilbert Stowers. Stowers co-owns Black Owned Outerwear, one of several black-owned clothing stores that regularly sells tickets to events at Cameo. The club's Facebook page advertises birthday parties and DJ nights. ""It's typically a good time, so the shooting, the size of the shooting alone, was surprising,"" Stowers said. ""It is typically a music venue, hip-hop club."" Both Stowers and Lee remained positive about the future. Lee wants the community to come together to make hip-hop venues more welcoming. He hopes, in part, to do this by growing the local rap scene. He will launch a music accelerator to coach young rappers, producers and musicians on how to succeed in the music industry. ""This is not the end,"" Lee said."

""It was unbelievable,"" Burnett said. ""The hospital was so crowded, all the seats were taken in the emergency room. The emergency room was literally standing room only."" The pastor of House Of Hope Church in Over-the-Rhine said some of the victims are still in shock after 17 people were shot in the East End club at 1:30 a.m. Sunday. He said he's still piecing together what happened. Police have said a fight that began earlier in the day escalated inside the nightclub. 'From chaos, we have to bring a semblance of normalcy': Shooting victim tally rises to 17 “And unfortunately, the massacre began,” the pastor said. “Even if only one person died, to me, it’s still a massacre with folks getting shot up in the club.” O'Bryan Spikes, 27, of Winton Hills died after the shooting. Five victims remain hospitalized, two of whom remain in critical condition, police and hospital officials said Monday. Burnett explained the damage from the incident goes beyond those who were shot. “This affected kids, it affected parents, cousins, brothers,” Burnett said. “One gunshot victim starts a domino effect. It goes on for years tearing up families.” Burnett said gun violence in Cincinnati is bigger than just this one event. He said fatal gun violence leads to him counseling victims for years after presiding over funerals. “Something’s got to give,” Burnett said. “The city needs to say enough is enough and not just come out when it happens, but really roll up their sleeves and convict people who get caught with these guns.” Burnett said stiffer penalties for those caught with firearms and more community engagement with police would help. Cameo shooting shocks Cincinnati hip-hop community “As a community, we have to speak out,” Burnett said. ""Like we’ve been saying for years, for those who have been on the battlefield of gun violence, enough is enough. Let’s take back our city from guys that are doing these horrific crimes.” However, in the short term, the pastor is focused trying to help the victims and the community recover from the mass shooting. “My next step is to counsel them back into this reality that’s called life,” Burnett said. “It was a sad day, so my job is to try to counsel them back to their normal life. That’s hard to do.” Cameo nightclub shooting in Cincinnati: What we know now"

It was anything you can think of.” But at 1:30 a.m. Sunday, “anything” exploded to include a mass shooting at the Cameo nightclub that left one person dead and 16 others injured. In conjunction with city fire and police departments and the region’s other hospitals, the emergency team geared up. Cameo nightclub surrenders liquor license, cited several times by state In addition to working in emergency medicine, Calhoun also ensures the medical center is prepared to treat a lot of patients under such intense conditions. “We just had an evaluation a couple of weeks ago, and they take an extremely close look at everything you’re doing to make sure the community is getting what it should have,” Calhoun said. Keep up with local health news with the cincinnati.com app from the  Apple App Store  or Google Play. UCMC is the region’s only Level I trauma center, one of 11 across Ohio. The designation comes from the Ohio Department of Health then is certified through the American College of Surgeons. UCMC has been a Level I center since 1996. At Level I, the highest level of trauma response, the facility not only provides clinical care but research. UCMC, for example, helped figure out what drugs are best for someone having seizures in the back of an ambulance, Calhoun said. Calhoun said UCMC drills “on almost a weekly basis” on its trauma response. The hospital is linked in with first responders across the region as well as the other hospital systems and the airport so a coordinated response can meet the trauma. “We have very tight relations with a lot of community partners, so we actually became aware of this most recent incident directly from the officers involved,” Calhoun said. “We see them regularly, so we got this directly by word of mouth.” Pastor of Cameo shooting victims: Enough is enough The region’s hospitals and first responders communicate on an online link to share information and figure out who has the necessary resources. Calhoun said he did not need to call in extra help on Sunday morning – there was enough around the city ready to engage. Response organizers use a color code of red, yellow and green to determine which patients go where. That decision, Calhoun said, rests in the hands of the scene commander or incident commander. “Because we knew what was happening from people on the scene, we had a few minutes ahead of time, and a few minutes is a very large amount of notice under these circumstances, so we had time for a little huddle. We knew what areas needed to be ready, and that communication let us move very well.” Ambulances delivered Cameo victims to Bethesda North, Mercy Health-Anderson and the Christ Hospital, all of whom were treated and released. The most patients, nine, went directly to UCMC. Four were treated and released Sunday. Five others, including two in critical condition as of Monday afternoon, remained hospitalized. While nine people injured in one event may sound like a lot, Calhoun said, “There isn’t a maximum number of how many people we can care for. That’s one of the things that goes along with being a Level I trauma center.” Calhoun and other emergency planners aim to design a trauma center that can care for dozens of injured. “This incident, while extremely tragic, is not a mass-casualty incident as we define it,” he said. “We define mass casualties as ones that overwhelm the resources that are functioning normally.” Calhoun said the hospital had not yet conducted a full review of its performance Sunday, “but as far as the emergency-management aspect, it went very well.”"

An engine and medic unit were already on their way to Cameo night club, but the dispatcher wanted to know what else the District 4 fire chief would need once he arrived. Send an additional four medics and two more fire companies, Monahan said. There are 12 medic trucks in all of Cincinnati and 28 years with the department taught him dispatch calls are rarely as bad as first reported. He didn’t want to send so many units to Cameo that the rest of the city would be left without ambulance service unless they were absolutely needed. But this time the shooting call would turn out to be worse than first reported. Seventeen people had been shot, one of them fatally, making it the worst mass shooting in city history. “They told me six to 10 people were shot, but to me it didn’t matter if it was 6, 10, 12, 15,” Monahan said. The response would be the same. Get people out. Get them treated. Fire Union President Matt Alter praised Monahan and all the safety forces that responded. Pastor of Cameo shooting victims: Enough is enough ""They're making life and death decisions,"" Alter said. ""You have somebody's fate in your hand. But that's why you have a professional fire department, that's why we train."" Monahan, as incident commander, was coordinating multiple agencies and the hospital emergency response teams. ""He was at the epicenter,"" Alter said. ""As the fire chief said, at scenes like this, you are managing chaos. We go there to restore calm,"" Alter said. ""And that's what he did."" Two days after the shooting, inside a Westwood fire station, Monahan tells the story of the night in a very matter-of-fact voice. He explains first responders learn to take emotion out of the situation, even in large, chaotic moments. “In these situations we all feel for victims, but you have a job to do and citizens expect you to do that job,” he said. “You show up, get the facts, do what you can to get the best outcome,” Monahan added. “If you put emotion in there it’s going to cloud your judgment.” Monahan, stationed that night in Oakley because he was covering another firefighter's shift, headed to the scene. As he drove along Kellogg Avenue a medic unit was stopped at Delta Avenue where people who had fled the club with injuries flagged it down. Paramedics took those people to the hospital and Monahan continued on. Traffic was bumper-to-bumper, two lanes thick. And people trying to make U-Turns to avoid traffic were blocking all lanes. Monahan slipped into the line of police cruisers. Fire Lt. Aaron Sweeney was already on the scene and had been inside. His quick initial assessment was that one person, who would later be identified as O’Bryan Spikes, 27, was dead and three or four more people were injured. Spikes died from a single gunshot wound to the chest, according to Hamilton County Coroner Chief Administrator Andrea Hatten. “At that point you have to sort them out,” Monahan said. “In a matter of five seconds, you have to say, 'This guy is going, this guy is next, this person can wait.'” Even from outside, Monahan knew the number of injured was more than 10. The first of three Anderson Township medic units, who were located just up the road, arrived. Fairfax sent a medic unit too. Lt. Mike Gundrum was coordinating with the hospitals. Shooting victims are typically taken to University Hospital but they wouldn’t be able to take everyone. Those with minor injuries would go to three other hospitals. The firefighters still didn’t know the scope of the shooting. But they knew there were more people injured. Monahan asked Sweeney to go back in. Police swarmed the club, but at that point, neither of the firefighters knew if the shooter was still inside. In most shootings, they’d wait until the police department gave the nod indicating the scene was safe. Here, if they waited people would die. “We all believe we have obligation to go in,” Monahan said. “It’s a calculated risk. You get the victims out of there as fast as you can.” Will Cameo shootings result in more violence in Cincinnati? There had been a quick search of the premises for victims, but now with the most critically injured on their way to hospitals Sweeney and police officers did a second search for people who had perhaps hidden during the chaos. “You read things (about other mass shootings),” Monahan said. “At Pulse nightclub, people were hidden in bathroom or closet.” Inside was clear, but reports were coming in of injured people who fled but needed help. Monahan spotted a car near the entrance. Inside was a woman who had been shot. Anderson medics whisked her to the hospital. And down the road an officer found a person who had been fleeing but was injured. Monahan was getting reports of others who had driven themselves to hospitals. One made it to Short Vine Fire Station but needed help getting the rest of the way to the hospital. “You had that initial rush, boom boom boom, a lot of things happening,” Monahan said. “You’re managing the flow of ambulances.” There was one entrance and one exit so ambulances couldn't move quite as quickly as they would have liked. Medics not in use waited in the street. Monahan said getting everyone out of the club and into ambulances happened quickly, maybe taking a half hour. Then it’s time for them to get out of the way and into the hands of medical staff at area hospitals."

Briscoe Cain, R-Baytown observes Texas Homemade Pie Day on Feb. 16, 2017. The resolution includes a little history of pie: “Historians believe that pie originated with the ancient Greeks, who developed the first pastry shell; later, the Romans published the world's first pie recipe, which included rye-crusted goat cheese and honey, though fillings also included savory ingredients like meat and seafood; the English brought mincemeat pies with them as they crossed the ocean to America and the colonists continued the tradition, using dried fruit, cinnamon, and nutmeg to season the filling.” House Resolution 116 by Rep. John Frullo, R-Lubbock, congratulates Joseph Ralph DeWitt IV on his retirement as proprietor of Ralph’s Records in Lubbock. “Fostering a friendly, laid-back atmosphere that customers loved, Mr. DeWitt always hired musicians and fellow music fans and encouraged them to share their knowledge, ideas, and opinions; the industry changed dramatically over the years, but he was able to adapt, adding such items as CDs, DVDs, and video games; all the while, he retained his allegiance to vinyl records, and he was ready to take full advantage of the revival of the format in the current decade; through the years, he has also been a steadfast supporter of live music in the city.” House Resolution 394 marks the 80th anniversary of the New London School explosion in north Rusk County.

Greg Abbott to visit and give his State of the State speech back in January. After that, lawmakers let fly with congratulations, salutes and commemorations on a variety of topics, from a constituent's 100th birthday to the sports championships won by various schools, from awareness campaigns to the remembrance of community leaders who recently died, from recognition of local business people to a salute to homemade pie.

In this Feb. 14, 1996, file photo, New York Mets manager Dallas Green smiles as he holds an informal news conference in his office at the Mets' spring training complex in Port St. Lucie, Fla. (AP Photo/Kathy Willens) PHILADELPHIA – Dallas Green, the tough-talking manager who guided the Philadelphia Phillies to their first World Series championship, died Wednesday. He was 82. The Phillies said Green died at Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia. He had been in poor health for a while. Green spent 62 years in baseball as a player, manager, general manager, team president and other roles. ""He was a big man with a big heart and a bigger-than-life personality,"" Phillies Chairman David Montgomery said in a statement. As a major league pitcher, Green went just 20-22 in the 1960s. His most notable distinction on the mound might have been giving up the only grand slam launched by all-time hits leader Pete Rose. Instead, it was in the dugout where the gruff, 6-foot-5 Green really found his voice — and a booming one, it was. In 1980, with Rose playing first base on a team that included future Hall of Famers Mike Schmidt and Steve Carlton, Green guided the Phillies to the World Series championship, ending a drought that stretched back nearly a century. Midway through that season, he really let the Phils hear it after a loss in Pittsburgh left them around .500. His clubhouse tirade was so loud that writers outside the locker room at Three Rivers Stadium said they could hear every word. Green later managed the New York Yankees — where bombastic owner George Steinbrenner liked the idea of someone being able to stand up to him — and the Mets. Green also was the GM and president of the Chicago Cubs and made a shrewd trade to get a young infielder from the Phillies, future great Ryne Sandberg. The deal helped turn a long-dormant franchise into a club that came within one win of reaching the 1984 World Series. ""Dallas was pure and simple a 'true baseball man,'"" the Mets said in a statement. Green was known for his rugged reputation and embraced it. Yet he was left in tears in 2011 when his granddaughter, Christina-Taylor Green, was shot and killed outside a grocery store in Tucson, Arizona, as she went to see U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Six people were killed in the mass shooting as Giffords met with constituents. ""I'm supposed to be a tough sucker, but I'm not very tough when it comes to this,"" Green said at the time. Green is survived by his wife of 59 years, Sylvia; four children; and five grandchildren. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2021 FOX News Network, LLC.

They were still looking into the threats that had arrived in the mosque’s voice mail two weeks earlier. And they were still looking into the newer drawing of a pig and a mosque that had come in the mail, a rendering so childish and crude that despite the accompanying message — “KILL ALL MUSLIMS” — one of the mosque’s security guards said he couldn’t help but laugh when he saw it. But you can’t take chances with these things, the mosque’s leaders said. Not in the years since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and certainly not now, when many Muslims feel that suspicion — or even harassment — of those who practice their religion is officially condoned in the United States. “There’s a climate that says, ‘That’s okay, that’s acceptable now,’ ” said Johari Abdul-Malik, an imam at the Dar al-Hijrah Islamic Center in Fairfax County, Va., and the mosque’s outreach director. And although most callers will never act on their words, one must always consider the possibility that someone will. [A group that thinks Islam threatens America says it now has a direct line to the White House ] It was a Friday, the sixth since President Trump took office, when the FBI paid its most recent visit, and before the day was over, there was another strange incident at Dar al-Hijrah that left mosque leaders feeling deeply unsettled: a homeless man caught taking pictures of the premises with an expensive camera as hundreds of people streamed into the building to pray. Security escorted the man off the grounds, but they were never able to ascertain why he was taking pictures. Hate crimes against Muslims shot up 67 percent in 2015, according to FBI statistics released at the end of last year, and hate crimes overall since then appear on track to outpace that year, according to new statistics compiled by Brian Levin, a criminologist at California State University at San Bernardino who tracks hate crimes. Preliminary hate crimes statistics for half a dozen state and local jurisdictions across the country show a precipitous rise in 2016, a trend that appears to be continuing into 2017, Levin said Wednesday. “Hate crimes in New York City are up 113 percent from the same period last year,” he said. In Chicago, there was a 24 percent increase in 2016; in Seattle, 6 percent. [Hate crimes against Muslims hit highest mark since 2001] Hate crimes in Montgomery County, Md. — a 30-minute drive from Dar al-Hijrah — were up more than 42 percent in 2016, Levin said, and more than 40 percent of them were religiously motivated. “What I think is happening is we’ve seen a normalization of faith-based bigotry and it’s translating in a variety of different ways, one of which, unfortunately, is hate-crime spikes,” he said. Scores of Jewish institutions across the country, including schools and synagogues, have been the targets of bomb threats during the past two months. In separate incidents, vandals defaced headstones at three Jewish cemeteries. [As more Jewish facilities get threats, all 100 senators ask Trump administration for ‘swift action’] Law enforcement officials in Texas and Florida are investigating fires at three mosques, at least two of which have been ruled arson. Last month in Kansas, a white man shouting “Get out of my country” shot dead an Indian engineer, who he apparently believed to be from the Middle East. Near Seattle this month, a masked assailant wounded a Sikh man — a member of an Indian religious minority who are sometimes confused for Muslims because the men wear turbans — after shouting at him to “go back to your country,” and authorities are investigating it as a hate crime. Police in South Carolina are investigating the shooting death of an Indian man there the day before. Under pressure amid mounting threats against American Jews, Trump late last month publicly condemned the threatening calls to Jewish institutions and the attacks on cemeteries. He has said no such thing about attacks on Muslims, some of whom he has barred from entering the United States via an executive order that blocks immigration from several Muslim-majority countries. Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman, said in an email that “President Trump condemns hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms.” To Shaker Elsayed, Dar al-Hijrah’s lead imam, the harassment of American Jews is a bellwether of how bad things have gotten. “The Jewish community has been here for centuries, and if they’re being attacked, we shouldn’t feel safe at all,” he said. Elsayed immigrated from Egypt decades ago. At Dar al-Hijrah, the man with what sounded like a Tennessee accent and a man with an apparent Boston accent called on a Friday, but no one noticed their messages until the following Monday evening. The first message, left at 7:47 a.m. on Feb. 17, contained a quick slew of expletives and instructions to “get the f--- out of here.” The second caller, who left his message at 4:10 p.m., said, “You motherf---ers better leave the country because if you come to the U.S., and start training f---ing Muslim terrorists, we’re going to f---ing bomb you, you f---ing piece of s---.” The first voice mail came from a phone number that, in public records, links to a man living in the small, predominantly white town of Dayton in rural east Tennessee. The other matches a man living in the working-class town of Taunton, Mass., about 20 miles east of Providence, R.I. No one at the mosque called them back, and the FBI didn’t offer any insights. The FBI said it is aware of the threats reported by Dar al-Hijrah, and it confirmed that it responded. On March 3, agents sat down with mosque leaders in the quiet back room where they usually meet and told them what they already knew, Abdul-Malik said: The threats weren’t specific enough; they weren’t actionable; they didn’t name a time or place. So there would not be any charges filed. The leaders of Dar al-Hijrah have prepared for this moment. They have sought over the years to maintain an active relationship with the men and women charged with protecting them, even as many suspect that the FBI also spies on them. And a week before Trump assumed office Jan. 20, they invited the FBI to speak to their community. They hoped that it might provide mutual reassurance that everything would be okay under a new administration. Abdul-Malik brought Paul Abbate, then the head of the FBI’s Washington Field Office, up to the podium after a Friday sermon and clapped him on the back. “You see all these people in suits?” he said, smiling at the rows of silent congregants on the carpet. “They’re not here to arrest you. They’re my friends.” “The essence of our mission is to keep people safe,” Abbate said. “And we do that fairly and equally for everyone under the Constitution of the United States.” It was a nice gesture, some congregants said afterward, but it would have helped more if the message had come directly from the president. Dar al-Hijrah’s 3,000 regular congregants hail from more than two dozen countries, including Libya, Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen and Iran — the countries targeted under Trump’s new travel ban. The order is being interpreted at this mosque the same way it has been by civil rights organizations and in other Muslim communities across the country: as a ban on Muslims and, more broadly, as a statement that Muslims are not welcome in the United States. “Nobody has the feeling that because my country is not on the list that I’m safe,” Abdul-Malik said. “The feeling that they have is that ‘because I’m Muslim, the ban is going to affect me.’ ” To Abdul-Malik, that means the threats carry extra weight; an added likelihood that someone might act. [This is how the Trump administration could freeze out Muslims in America] Few mosques are as vigilant as Dar al-Hijrah, where guards and security cameras keep watch 24 hours a day. A perimeter fence has provided an extra barrier since 2015, when people with bullhorns showed up and began to shout slurs at families as they entered the center in the wake of a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., that killed 22 people and was carried out by a Muslim couple. The San Bernardino couple had no connection to the mosque. Dar al-Hijrah is one of the largest and most politically active mosques in the country, and its address and phone number are easy to find in a Google search. So, too, is the conspiracy website that describes the mosque as a front for terrorists, and the blog post by a man who claims to have conducted “researches” at the mosque and uncovered “violent materials.” Dar al-Hijrah has fought for 15 years to scrub its legacy, after FBI agents found that two of the 9/11 hijackers, as well as Fort Hood shooter Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, had worshiped there. The imam at the time, Anwar al-Awlaki, left the mosque and went on to become a proponent of extremist ideology from a hideout in Yemen; he was later killed in a U.S. drone strike. None of the callers to the mosque ever seem to mention these things. Often it feels more as if they are reacting to a terrorist attack that has just occurred 3,000 miles away, or to something they saw on the news the night before, said Colin Christopher, the mosque’s director of government affairs. Often, it seems as if people just want to call a mosque, and Dar al-Hijrah is the first thing that comes up. Several days after the deadly 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris — and after a man, reacting to those attacks, had burst into Dar al-Hijrah’s lobby and told people to leave the country and to accept Jesus — the mosque suffered hundreds of dollars in damage when someone tried to break through the gate in the middle of the night and tossed two smoke bombs and a molotov cocktail over the fence. None of the threats during the past year have materialized into violence, but those at the mosque fear someone one day might again take it a step further. It’s awful to know that you’re hated by some people, Elsayed said. But he has come to expect such things. “That’s a sad statement, but it’s true.” We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites."

She's yelling. There's noise in the background. It's seconds after 20 shots, possibly more, were fired inside Cameo nightclub, where she was with friends on Sunday morning. She calls 911. ""There is blood everywhere. He may not make it. Hurry up! Please. He got blood all over his body. There shouldn't be shooting at clubs. We was all just dancing, next thing you look around he's shot. Friends pick up and put him in a car ... damn, I don't really expect anyone to get (expletive) shot in a club."" It's one of 11 calls pleading for emergency assistance. Some are calm. Some carry the same theme of begging emergency workers to hurry. Some simply report there was a shooting. Cincinnati police released documents and audio files Wednesday pertaining to Sunday's Cameo nightclub shooting, where 17 people were shot, one fatally.

Of the 16 survivors, all but two have been released from area hospitals. The two that remain are in critical condition at University of Cincinnati Medical Center. Sixty-nine law enforcement and fire personnel responded to the Cameo scene, which began unfolding around 1:30 a.m., records show. Officers at the scene shouted to dispatchers, ""Everything you got! Expedite. Right now! Get me cars now!"" District 4 Fire Chief Marc Monahan, who coordinated the chaotic scene, told The Enquirer earlier this week the call came in that six to 10 people had been shot. It would turn out to be the worst mass shooting in the city's history. The initial call came in at 1:29 a.m. The club stayed open until 4 a.m. Police accounts say a couple of hundred people were inside at the time. People jumped out windows and ditched shoes, perfume and phones in the parking lot so they could move faster or hide in the bathroom, too far from the door. Some people suffered injuries while fleeing, trampled in the madness. By 1:31 a.m. police at the scene reported ""at least six victims."" At 1:45 a.m., two officers reported to dispatchers that they detained someone who was standing in the club with a gun. At 2:12 a.m., an officer reported to a dispatcher that a gun was recovered. There have been no arrests. Police Chief Eliot Isaac said Monday he is confident police will find the people responsible. In one 911 call, a caller tells the dispatcher, ""My friend's been shot. Hurry up! Hurry up!"" The dispatcher asks if the caller knows who shot his friend and the caller replies no. The caller can be heard asking someone if they should load the shooting victim into a vehicle. ""Do not move him. Hello? Please do not move him,"" the dispatcher says.

""I'm in the bathroom and they're saying they're shooting inside and outside. And I don't know what to do, I lost my friend."" Later, the caller asks the dispatcher, ""Is it done?"" Eight minutes after the initial dispatch call, a dispatcher reported, ""Any available unit in the city is responding at this time, plus county units."" Officers on the scene were finding people in cars and down the road. They had been shot but fled. One man was found shot under the entrance awning. Two others in a car. One man who had been shot in the head was picked up by an ambulance. Twelve minutes after the initial dispatch another victim was located in the nightclub's parking lot. Some victims drove themselves to the hospital. According to dispatch traffic, by 1:49 a.m. two shooting victims had walked into University of Cincinnati Medical Center. Twenty minutes later two ""walk-in"" shooting victims arrived at Bethesda North Hospital. More than 45 minutes after the initial call, another victim walked into the Short Vine fire station. Cincinnati City Manager Harry Black told the City Council on Wednesday that police officers investigating the Cameo nightclub shootings are ""making substantial and significant progress."" But, he urged patience. ""There are a lot of witnesses and a lot of evidence,"" Black said. Contributing: Anne Saker, The Enquirer"

They were attempting to hold Remington Arms, the parent company of the manufacturer of the weapon used in the attack, accountable for the damage inflicted by the deranged shooter. The court correctly found that the lawsuit was without merit because it flew in the face of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA). Now, five months later, the same group of plaintiffs is attempting to resurrect the suit from the dead according to local news. The 10 families whose lawsuit against the world’s largest dealer of AR-15 rifles was dismissed last year say their case should be reinstated, arguing that the Sandy Hook massacre was no accident. “The notion that what happened at Sandy Hook on December 14, 2012, was unimaginable is a lie,” argues the families’ lawyer, Josh Koskoff, in 50-page brief submitted to state Supreme Court this week. “Sandy Hook was simply gratuitous, senseless proof of what was already known: preparation is no match for an AR-15.” Generally, when you see a case such as this being dredged back up it’s because the attorneys for the plaintiffs have come up with some new, fresh approach which the judge might look more favorably upon. From the sound of things that’s not what’s happening here. The lead attorney, Joshua Koskoff, is making the same set of tired and already debunked arguments which were the premise for his suit initially. Arguing that Remington is somehow responsible for what is done with one of their products which was legally sold to an eligible purchaser is a dead-end. His other point is to continue claiming that the AR-15 rifle is a “weapon of war” which the manufacturer should never have been allowing into the hands of private citizens. Over at Bearing Arms, our colleague Bob Owens explains why the entire “weapons of war” argument is also a dry hole. Koskoff is of course lying, not to mention historically ignorant. Civilians have typically had much greater quality weapons with greater firepower than the military throughout most of American history, without significant issue. The first AR-15s were sold on the civilian market to sportsmen several years before the U.S. military adopted the M16 as a general-issue rifle. AR-15s have been sold to civilians for more than half a century, and they are not “weapons of war,” as no major military has ever issued them. The militaries of the world have always used selective-fire variants of the M16 rifle and M4 carbine that are restricted under the National Firearms Act of 1934, and which have not been manufactured at all for the civilian market in 31 years, thanks to the Hughes Amendment to the Firearms Owners Protection Act (FOPA) in 1986. Liberals who oppose Second Amendment rights would dearly love to see this case come back to life and succeed. Unable to actually remove the Second Amendment from our Constitution, the next best thing they could do would be to drive American manufacturers of firearms out of business. That’s obviously the goal here, since allowing a massive settlement against Remington Arms would open the door to a cascade of similar lawsuits against every other manufacturer in the country, if not the entire world. Fortunately for all of us, I don’t think we’ve reached the point where the judicial system will entertain such nonsense. At least not yet. This is yet another reason why we should be grateful that someone like Neil Gorsuch is going to be taking a seat on the nation’s highest court.  Copyright ©2021 HotAir.com/Salem Media.

The lawsuit argues that despite Omar Mateen’s history of violent threats and comments about terrorism, the 29-year-old was still able to carry out the massacre at the Orlando club last year because of negligence on the part of the security firm where he worked and because of assistance from his wife.

“This attack was easily preventable because it was predictable,” Antonio Romanucci, a Chicago-based attorney, said at a news conference announcing the lawsuit. Dozens of people who survived the attack, along with the estates of seven people killed at Pulse, are listed as plaintiffs in the complaint, which was filed Wednesday morning in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Mateen was killed in a shootout with police following an hours-long standoff with authorities, during which he remained with hostages in the club’s bathrooms and pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. The attack killed 49 people and injured more than 50 others, some of whom recalled being shot multiple times as Mateen sprayed bullets across the club. “A bullet had hit my pinkie,” Ilka Reyes, a plaintiff in the new lawsuit, said while describing her experience during the news conference Wednesday. “It was when I was being pushed to the ground that I noticed my finger was gone.” Pausing to wipe her eyes and appearing visibly shaken as she recalled the screaming inside the club, Reyes described being urged to try to keep quiet while she was on the ground. “I kept quiet, but it didn’t help,” she said. “Next thing I knew, there was a shadow next to me. And I was being shot in the back eight times. With every shot, my body jumped and I could feel blood coming out from my mouth.” The complaint names Noor Salman, Mateen’s widow, as one of the plaintiffs. The FBI arrested Salman in January and charged her with aiding and abetting terrorism. Echoing federal prosecutors’ arguments, the new lawsuit accuses Salman of “knowingly assisting” Mateen in planning the attack, helping him purchase firearms and ammunition and surveilling the club. Salman’s attorneys have argued that she was “physically and financially abused at the hands of Mateen,” saying in court filings that she was not aware of “her husband’s murderous plans.” An attorney for Salman declined to comment Wednesday because he had not yet read the new lawsuit. Mateen’s first wife said that he was “not a stable person” and that he repeatedly beat her. His behavior also drew the attention of the FBI, which opened a preliminary investigation after Mateen’s co-workers reported that he had claimed he was a member of Hezbollah and had family connections to al-Qaida. The co-workers also said that Mateen spoke of dying as a martyr and claimed to share acquaintances with the Boston Marathon attackers. The FBI ultimately closed its investigation into Mateen in early 2014 after investigators concluded he was not a threat. He also cropped up during a separate probe that year into an American who flew to Syria and died in a suicide attack linked to al-Qaida, but authorities found no clear ties between the men. In 2007, Mateen began working for the London-based security firm G4S, which has more than half a million employees and operates in about 100 countries. He became a licensed security guard with a permit to carry a concealed weapon. The new lawsuit argues that G4S wantonly ignored warning signs, including Mateen’s references to terror groups, the FBI investigation and his threatening comments. It also argues that the company could have had Mateen go through a new psychological evaluation or could have tried to have his firearms license revoked. In a statement, G4S said that while it continues to have sympathy for all of Pulse’s victims, the company “intends to vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit which it considers to be wholly without merit.” Romanucci, the lawyer who announced the lawsuit Wednesday, said the survivors and relatives are seeking monetary damages, but said that they have not determined a specific amount. Calling the toll from the attack “incalculable,” Romanucci said the lawsuit aims to seek justice and prevent other massacres, noting that he also hopes it can lead to changes in the way people like Mateen are able to buy mass amounts of ammunition and assault-style rifles. In an interview, Romanucci said the lawsuit focuses on Mateen’s wife and the company because they “had the most responsibility” for what happened. By focusing on an attacker’s family and workplace, the lawsuit differs from some of the high-profile litigation related to other recent mass shootings; those lawsuits have focused on other aspects of the slayings. After a gunman opened fire inside an Aurora, Colo., movie theater in 2012, dozens of victims unsuccessfully sued the theater company and argued that its security setup allowed the attack to happen. In Connecticut, relatives of people killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School the same year sued the gun manufacturers and sellers and argued that they are liable for the shooting. So far, those relatives have been rebuffed due to the federal shield law, which was passed by Congress in 2005 and provides broad protection to gun companies against liability suits; the relatives are appealing the case’s dismissal. Some relatives of the Pulse victims also filed a lawsuit late last year against Google, Twitter and Facebook, arguing that the companies played a role in the attack because they helped fuel the Islamic State’s growth.

Many traveled to the Middle East, where they might have become radicalized. Still, they would not be stopped by restrictions such as President Trump's travel ban targeting majority-Muslim nations, now on hold. Here are recent examples of homegrown terrorism in the United States by people born in the USA or brought to the country as an infant: Jan. 31, Denver: Shooting death of a transit officer by Joshua Cummings, 37, a Muslim convert and former Army sergeant. He has been charged with murder for the execution-style killing of Scott Van Lanken. Before the shooting, a group of Muslim leaders sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security warning that Cummings was on an “advanced path to radicalization.” June 12, Orlando: Shooting rampage at Pulse nightclub by Omar Mateen, 29, who was born in New Hyde Park, N.Y., to parents from Afghanistan. He pledged allegiance to the Islamic State during the attack that left 49 people dead before Mateen was killed by police. Dec. 2, 2015, San Bernardino, Calif.: Mass shooting at county office by Chicago-born Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and his Pakistani wife, 29. The couple killed 14 people at a holiday party and were later shot to death by police. Farook agreed with the Islamic State, according to his father. Dad: San Bernardino shooter agreed with ISIL, 'obsessed with Israel' July 16, 2015, Chattanooga, Tenn.:  Four Marines and a sailor were shot and killed at a Navy reserve center by Mohammad Youssef Abdulazeez, 24. He was born in Kuwait but came to the U.S. as an infant and attended Red Bank High School outside Chattanooga and graduated college as an engineer. “There is no doubt he was inspired, motivated by foreign terrorist organization propaganda,” FBI Director James Comey said. Abulazeez was killed by police. Sept. 25, 2014, Moore, Okla.: Alton Nolen, 30 at the time, was charged with first-degree murder for beheading a female co-worker at the Vaughan Foods store where he’d just been suspended. The FBI considered the case workplace violence, but Nolen was also a Muslim convert who posted images of Osama bin Laden and radical Islamic messages on his Facebook page. April-June 2014, Seattle and New Jersey:   Ali Muhammad Brown, a Muslim convert, was charged with four killings in three locations — a man in King County, Washington, on April 27, 2014;  two men as they left a gay nightclub in Seattle on June 1, 2014; and a murder and carjacking on June 25, 2014, in Essex County, N.J., that resulted in an indictment on a state terrorism charge. Brown told investigators that all four slayings were revenge against the U.S. for its “evil acts” at home and military action in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, and that he was motivated by his Muslim faith. Brown was earlier charged in a case of bank fraud between 2002 and 2004 that federal prosecutors said was to support the al-Shabab terrorist group in Somalia. Nov. 5, 2009, Fort Hood, Texas: Gunman at an Army base in Killeen, Texas, who killed 13 people was Army psychiatrist Nidal Hasan, now 46. He was raised in Virginia by parents who were Palestinian immigrants. Hasan was radicalized through the Internet and email exchanges with Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who led al-Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula. Hasan was convicted of murder in a court-martial and is awaiting execution. June 1, 2009, Little Rock: One soldier was killed and another wounded in a drive-by shooting in front of a military recruiting office by Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad, 31, born Carlos Bledsoe inMemphis.  He had converted to Islam and traveled to Yemen, where he said he wanted to join a holy war against the U.S. and Israel. He told investigators he wanted to kill as many U.S. military personnel as possible. Muhammad pleaded guilty in 2011. Source: USA TODAY research "

Nor does it mean it is ready for air on FNC.” John Moody, at the time Fox’s vice president for news, issued that missive after Fox & Friends co-hosts Steve Doocy and Brian Kilmeade highlighted for their millions of viewers a right-wing outlet’s quickly debunked report that then-Sen. Barack Obama had gone to school at an extremist Islamic madrassa as a child. “The hosts violated one of our general rules, which is know what you are talking about,” Moody told The New York Times. “They reported information from a publication whose accuracy we didn’t know.” Ten years later, the denizens of the program’s curvy couch still frequently don’t know what they are talking about. But now, their conspiracy theories and bogus claims are repeated by the White House as if they were credible reports from distinguished journalists. Under the Trump administration, the hosts and guests of Fox & Friends are setting the national agenda, thanks to their biggest fan, the president of the United States. Last week, Fox senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano stopped by the set of Fox & Friends and claimed that unnamed intelligence sources had told him that late last year, a British spy agency had surveilled now-President Donald Trump on behalf of then-President Barack Obama. The incident was typical for Napolitano, a 9/11 truther who regularly uses his Fox airtime to push paranoid conspiracy theories. But the response from the Trump administration was remarkable. Two days later, White House press secretary Sean Spicer cited Napolitano’s claim during a briefing. Since then: “There was a time when a guy like Judge Andrew Napolitano could make some marginal remarks on Fox News, and only a large plume of non-White House officials would take him seriously,” The Washington Post’s Erik Wemple noted Friday. “Perhaps a website or two would pick up on them. Then everyone would move on to other matters. … Warning to Judge Napolitano: People in power are now listening to you. They’re case-building off of your reporting.” If Trump can be said to treat Fox News personalities as his advisers, then the hosts of Fox & Friends are his kitchen cabinet. While the president regularly assails journalists as lying members of the “opposition party,” he praises Fox for producing “the most honest morning show” and calls its hosts “honorable people.” Trump has said that he may owe his presidency to his years-long weekly interview segment on Fox & Friends, telling the show’s hosts earlier this year that “maybe without those call-ins, somebody else is sitting here.” Since becoming perhaps the most powerful person on the planet, Trump has continued to regularly watch the morning show, sometimes for hours at a time. He frequently tweets along with the program, commenting on the stories he sees and retweeting the broadcast’s feed. And those presidential comments set the news agenda for the rest of the press. Given the president’s tendency to run with thinly sourced claims he gets from right-wing outlets, this is not a good sign. Doocy and Kilmeade, who have hosted since the show’s debut in 1998, regularly expose themselves asbigoted misogynists. (Ainsley Earhardt, the program’s third co-host for the past year, provides run-of-the-mill conservative-inflected Fox commentary.) Notably, Kilmeade has declared that “all terrorists are Muslims” (he later said he misspoke) and issued a shockingly racist rant about how Americans don’t have “pure genes” like the Swedes because “we keep marrying other species and other ethnics” (he subsequently apologized). Former Fox & Friends host Gretchen Carlson accused Doocy of engaging in “a pattern of severe and pervasive mistreatment” on and off air in her sexual harassment lawsuit against the network’s founder and chairman, Roger Ailes; while Ailes was pushed out, no public action was taken against Doocy. They are also two of the dumbest people in the news business. Lest you think I am exaggerating, please watch this clip of Trump’s favorite morning show hosts attempting to roast marshmallows over an open fire using a plastic spoon and their bare hands. Pay special attention to the look on Chris Wallace’s face as he observes the antics from a remote site with increasing disbelief, and eventually halts the segment to call them “dopes.”  The gullibility and stupidity of Fox’s morning hosts is now an issue of national import. They frequently push obviously false and easily debunked claims, often based on dubious reports from sources that lack credibility. Some past examples include: The Time A Federal Judge Scolded Them For Credulously Reporting A Parody Story. In 2007, just a few months after the hosts’ madrassa commentary spurred the network executive to warn them not to believe everything they see on the internet, they reported that a middle school student had been suspended for leaving a ham sandwich on a lunch table near Muslim students. At one point during the segment, Kilmeade said, “I hope we’re not being duped,” to which Doocy replied, “We’re not being duped. I’ve looked it up on a couple of different websites up there.” They were being duped; their source was a fabricated story from the hoax website Associated Content. Doocy subsequently issued a retraction and apology.  A federal judge later criticized the “gullible” hosts over the incident, saying their actions “should provide grist for journalism classes teaching research and professionalism standards in the Internet age.” The Time Doocy Claimed Obama Fabricated An Earthquake (He Didn’t). In March 2010, Obama said a proposal to adjust Medicaid reimbursement rates for states affected by natural disasters “also affects Hawaii, which went through an earthquake.” Doocy suggested that Obama had made the earthquake up, noting that previous Hawaiian earthquakes came in 1868 and 1975. His allegation came from Gateway Pundit’s Jim Hoft, the dumbest man on the Internet and, not surprisingly, a regular source of Fox & Friends stories; an earthquake struck Hawaii in 2006. The Time Fox & Friends Investigated Whether A Terrorist Ghostwrote Obama’s Autobiography. In March 2011, the program hosted WorldNetDaily columnist and noted conspiracy theorist Jack Cashill to discuss his claim that Obama’s first book, Dreams from My Father, was actually written by former Weather Underground member Bill Ayers. The Time Doocy Told Trump That Obama “Could End It Simply — Just Show [The Birth Certificate] To Us.” In a series of segments in March and April 2011, the hosts supported Trump’s fact-free claims that Obama had not produced his birth certificate. During their regular interview segment, Doocy responded to Trump’s false statement that President Obama “has not given a birth certificate” by saying, “He could end it simply — just show it to us, and it’d be over.” The Time The Show Invented A TSA Program To Test Airline Passenger DNA. The program ran a March 2011 segment suggesting that the Transportation Security Administration would soon begin testing airline passengers’ DNA at airports. Napolitano criticized the purported effort, saying it “offends the Constitution” and “feeds the government’s voracious appetite to control people”; Kilmeade defended TSA for “trying to stop illegal human trafficking.” Arguments about civil liberties aside, the entire story was made up, as Doocy acknowledged when he apologized for the “error” the next day. The Time Fox & Friends Claimed Obama Wanted To Apologize To Japan For Hiroshima. In October 2011, the hosts lashed out at Obama because he supposedly had wanted to apologize to Japan for the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima, but Japan had nixed the idea. The next day, Doocy sought to “clarify” the story by removing the portion of the story that had angered them, stating: “We want to be very clear. There was never a plan for President Obama to apologize to Japan. We should have been clear about that, and we’re sorry for the confusion.” The Time They Falsely Claimed Obama Met With A Pirate But Not Netanyahu. Channeling a story from The Drudge Report, the hosts claimed in September 2012 that Obama had time to meet with a man in a pirate costume for Talk Like a Pirate Day, but had been “too busy” to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In fact, the photo of Obama and the pirate that the White House had tweeted out the previous day had been taken three years earlier for use during that year’s White House Correspondents’ Dinner. Doocy and Fox & Friends subsequently acknowledged that fact on social media. The Time They Pretended Obama Wanted To Take Kevlar Helmets Away From Cops. After a police officer survived the June 2016 mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, FL, because he had been wearing a Kevlar helmet, Doocy suggested that the Obama administration had been “pushing to take away life-saving armor” like the helmet through a ban on the federal government transferring military equipment to police departments. Kevlar helmets are not on the list of banned equipment, as Doocy acknowledged in a clarification the next day. The Time Fox & Friends Pushed The Conspiracy Theory That Google Was Manipulating Search Results To Help Hillary Clinton. In June 2016, Kilmeade and Napolitano accused Google of “manipulating the search [results] for Hillary [Clinton] to bury the bad stuff.” Napolitano said that “we know” Google “has” manipulated search results relating to Clinton according to a “very extensive test,” and that the result is an example of “the Google, Eric Schmidt [executive chairman of Google’s board of directors], President Obama, Democratic National Committee, West Wing circle that we all know exists.” But, according to CNNMoney, “Despite what you might have seen online, Google is not manipulating its search results to favor Hillary Clinton.” The Time Doocy Pushed A Conspiracy Theory About A Murdered Democratic Staffer. In July 2016, Democratic National Committee (DNC) staffer Seth Rich was murdered while walking home in his Washington, D.C., neighborhood. Conservatives subsequently suggested that he may have been murdered because he had helped WikiLeaks gain access to the DNC’s email servers (his family condemned these conspiracy theories). Fox & Friends picked up the story, with Doocy stating on air, “Some on the internet are suggesting, wait a minute, was [Rich] the source of the WikiLeaks DNC leaks?” Now when Doocy and Kilmeade run credulous reports based on something they saw “on the internet,” the president is watching — and taking them seriously.

The shooting was reported after 1 a.m. at the nightclub named Cameo, in which the police believe more than one person fired shots, according to local reports. The Cameo nightclub has a history of gun violence, authorities said. Police said that in 2015, there were two shootings at the club, one on New Year's Day and the other in September, according to WLWT, an NBC affiliate.

There have been already 71 incidents of mass shootings in the U.S. this year, according to the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive. In 2016, there were nearly 340 mass shooting incidents in the U.S. and more than 400 people were killed and about 1,400 were wounded. In 2015, there were about 372 mass shootings. On June 12, 2016, Omar Saddiqui Mateen, 29, opened fire inside a gay nightclub in Orlando where at least 49 people were killed and more than 50 were injured. Mateen was killed by law enforcement officials who raided the club after a long standoff, according to reports. On March 9, 2016, two gunmen fired at a backyard barbecue party in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, killing five people, of whom four were women. The police said that once the shooting started, people tried to run inside the house but a second gunman opened fire from the side not allowing the people to run for protecting themselves, according to BBC. On Dec. 2, 2015, two heavily armed attackers, Syed Farook, 28, and Tashfeen Malik, 27, opened fire on a banquet at a social service center for the disabled in San Bernardino, California. Fourteen people were killed and more than a dozen others were seriously wounded, according to Dawn. On Oct. 1, 2015, Christopher Sean Harper-Mercer went on a deadly shooting rampage at an Oregon college, in which nine people were killed and nine others injured. The shooter died after a gun battle with police at the college, according to CNN.

        Kyle Blaine Last updated on March 12, 2016, at 1:18 p.m. ET Posted on March 12, 2016, at 11:26 a.m. ET Tension at Trump's events has been increasing for some time. This week, a Trump supporter in North Carolina was charged for punching a protester in the face at a Trump rally. A Breitbart reporter also this week filed a police report alleging Trump's campaign manager violently grabbed her at a Trump event in Florida. None of Trump's Republican rivals, when given the chance at the last debate, would directly condemn Trump for the actions at his rallies. However, in the aftermath of the Chicago protests, all three of them — Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and John Kasich — directly attributed the violence to Trump. .@TedCruz on #TrumpRally: Campaign creates bad environment when candidate urges supporters to engage in violence. https://t.co/risWkXFrpw “I think a campaign bears responsibility for creating an environment, when the candidate urges supporters to engage in physical violence to punch people in the face,” Cruz said. “The predictable consequence of that is that it escalates. Today is unlikely to be the last such instance.” “That’s not how our politics should occur,” he added. Cruz told reporters in Ballwin, Missouri: ""My answer is the same, I committed at the outset, I will support the Republican nominee whoever it is."" Pressed on how he could still support Trump as the nominee despite saying last night that he encourages a culture of violence, Cruz said ""I am encouraging every candidate and every campaign to appeal to our better angels.""  ""It's a choice every candidate makes,"" Cruz said. ""I understand people are angry."" Cruz said he understands that Trump ""feels like a vessel for that anger"" at Washington, but that ""Donald Trump is Washington."" Cruz did not answer follow-ups about why he would still support Trump as the nominee despite all he's said about him. .@marcorubio on increasing violence at Trump's events: “It shouldn’t surprise us” https://t.co/qnNUNEkB34 https://t.co/Yrd8wvHHDf ""Presidents can't just say whatever they want,"" Rubio said. ""There are consequences to the words of a president; there are consequences to the words of a presidential candidates as well."" He continued, ""When you have a candidate in Donald Trump who clearly has used language that appeals to anger, and in some instances has actually said to the crowd, 'You know, let's beat this person up, or let's do this, or let's do that,' so it shouldn't surprise us that we see a growing amount of violence at some of his events."" Rubio pointed out that there isn't an violence at his rallies, or any other Republican or Democratic campaign rallies. ""I do think Donald needs to realize and take responsibility for the fact that some of the rhetoric he has used could potentially be contributing to this environment,"" Rubio said. .@MarcoRubio: I still intend to support the Republican nominee ""but it's getting harder every day."" https://t.co/4rEnEzqKqC Asked if he could still support Trump as the nominee, Kasich told reporters, ""It makes it extremely difficult."" ​""The divisive rhetoric we are seeing should be of grave concern to us all. We all have our differences, and we know many people across the country feel angry. We need to address that anger together. All of us, no matter what party we belong to or what views we hold, should not only say loudly and clearly that violence has no place in our politics, we should use our words and deeds to bring Americans together. Last year in Charleston, South Carolina an evil man walked into a church and murdered 9 people. The families of those victims came together and melted hearts in the statehouse and the confederate flag came down. That should be the model we strive for to overcome painful divisions in our country."" ""The issue now is that Donald Trump has to be loud and clear and tell his supporters that violence at rallies is not what America is about and to end it,"" Sanders said.

595456711,2017-03-17 17:59:47,A March Madness subtext: The Carolinas switch roles,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/colleges/a-march-madness-subtext-the-carolinas-switch-roles/2017/03/17/55c00c84-0b3d-11e7-a15f-a58d4a988474_story.html,en,False,,2,Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,"They loaded the RV with beer and dips, hitting the road early Thursday. This had become an annual tradition: a group of friends gathering in some North Carolina city to cheer on the Tar Heels. One friend was in charge of drinks, another responsible for snacks. Preston Swiney, 64, supplied the RV and did the driving — Laurinburg, N.C., to wherever North Carolina was playing. This year’s trip was different, though, and on the way here they talked about it: In September, the NCAA stripped Swiney’s home state of all postseason events in response to North Carolina’s Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, a.k.a. House Bill 2 — which prohibits transgender people from using public restrooms for the gender with which they identify — and removed the men’s college basketball tournament regional from Greensboro and out of the state entirely. The Tar Heels, the South Region’s No. 1 seed, and rival Duke, the No. 2 seed in the East Region, would have to travel upward of four hours on the road. “I’m very sad, very disappointed about the whole thing, [in] what apparently is something that’s really, really hard to change,” North Carolina Coach Roy Williams said Thursday during a news conference in Greenville. Swiney would hit the road, too, driving his party to South Carolina, of all places, where less than two years ago the NCAA ended a similar postseason ban following the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the State House grounds after a racially motivated mass shooting in a Charleston church that left nine African Americans dead. Suddenly South Carolina, a state with so much complexity and charm, had become the more progressive Carolina; now North Carolinians were the ones digging in their heels — and, in some cases, feeling left out. [Live, interactive men’s college basketball tournament bracket] “It has really made North Carolina look bad,” said Swiney, and he knows the swapping of sports hosting privileges has done little to silence the political debates in either state. If anything, it has reignited them and compelled those on all sides to dig in. Some North Carolinians are embarrassed and frustrated; others are proud. Many South Carolinians are pleased to show off Greenville’s vibrant downtown and welcome postseason college sports for the first time since 2002. Others believe the state traded its principles for attention and dollars. “North Carolina made a courageous stand, and we did not,” said Lee Bright, a former South Carolina state senator who said no high-profile sporting event could make the removal of the Confederate flag more palatable. “I’m proud of North Carolina, and I’m ashamed of my home state. If it’s success by any means necessary, then we’re playing the game well.” Last year, the Raleigh regional — Swiney and his RV were there, he said — brought 19,600 visitors and $4.6 million into the local economy, according to statistics provided by the Greater Raleigh Sports Alliance. There is no such influx this year, and the Greensboro regional was North Carolina’s latest high-profile sports loss. The ACC moved its football championship game from Charlotte to Orlando, one of seven championships scheduled for North Carolina that would be moved, it announced in September. The NBA relocated its All-Star Game from Charlotte to New Orleans, and dozens of companies — Apple, eBay and General Electric among them — filed court documents in protest of HB2, the controversial bathroom law. The Williams Institute, a think tank in Los Angeles, estimated North Carolina’s refusal to repeal HB2 could cost the state $5 billion per year, including a steep drop in federal funding after the federal government declared the law violated the Civil Rights Act and Title IX. It already has cost some politicians their jobs, including former governor Pat McCrory, a Republican who lost his reelection campaign last fall to Democrat Roy Cooper. In the meantime, some residents have found themselves taking sides. Art Chansky, a longtime North Carolina author who has written about the intersection of sports and local politics, said that when he’s traveling he tries to avoid sharing where he’s from, the only way to avoid a thorny conversation. “They look at me like I said I’m from Mississippi or something,” Chansky said. “It has taken the state so long to build up a reputation for industry, for retirement, for everything. They’re losing millions and millions in tourist revenue in the state, but it’s more sort of a low-level disgust. It’s all rolled into one right now.” [Latest men’s basketball tournament news] Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski seemed to agree Thursday when asked about it. “I don’t want to get political right now,” said Krzyzewski, who, after leading his Blue Devils to five national championships and a dozen Final Fours, is one of North Carolina’s most powerful voices. “Look, it’s a stupid thing. If I was president or governor, I’d get rid of it. And I’d back up my promises, as unusual as that might be. Anyway, I don’t want to get too political.” Native South Carolinians know that feeling, especially when it comes to the still polarizing issue of the Confederate flag. Supporters maintain it’s a reminder of the state’s history and secessionist individualism before the Civil War; detractors see the “Stars and Bars” as a painful symbol of racism and segregation, one that, for decades, flew either on the State House dome or on the Capitol’s front lawn. The NCAA issued a boycott of South Carolina in 2001, prohibiting predetermined postseason events from being scheduled in the state, and the last time NCAA tournament games were played here was 2002. In June 2015, Dylann Roof — a 21-year-old whose Facebook page was adorned with various photographs of the Confederate flag — traveled from Columbia, the state capital, to Charleston and entered a landmark black church during a Wednesday night Bible study, where the Gospel of Mark was being discussed. Roof sat quietly before opening fire, killing nine members of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. He later confessed to the massacre and, before being convicted and sentenced to death in January, told a Charleston court in his closing argument that he “felt like he had to do it.” [Archives: Jury sentences Dylann Roof to death] Three weeks after the killings, the South Carolina legislature voted — albeit with some opposition — to remove the flag; the next day, the NCAA lifted its postseason ban, and in September, when Greensboro lost its NCAA regional, Greenville was granted it. “I wish I could celebrate it, but to know how we gained it . . .” Bright, the former state senator, said before trailing off. “I mean, what’s next? What does the corporate world, the secular world, what do they demand next?” Others, though, saw the flag’s removal and the reopening of economic opportunity as a time for bittersweet progress — if not an out-and-out celebration.  “I would feel a lot better about it if nine people hadn’t had to die to make it happen,” said Dick Harpootlian, a South Carolina attorney and former chairman of the state’s Democratic Party. If North Carolina’s loss was South Carolina’s gain, economically and perhaps historically, Harpootlian said it didn’t much feel like it. “Does North Carolina’s situation help us? It makes North Carolina look bad,” he said, “and it doesn’t make us look particularly good.” Swiney, though, said the change in his tradition’s location was intriguing, not frustrating. He and his friends could make plans early, part of the fun of this, and assign responsibilities: Who would bring the queso, and who would pick up breakfast foods? They gas up and drive into a new state, toward an unfamiliar city, park the RV at a nearby campground and toast the Tar Heels’ chances at a national championship. “We’re just enjoying it,” said Swiney, who nevertheless hopes North Carolina does what’s necessary to return postseason basketball to within its borders. “You’ve got to enjoy the small things in life.” Their plans, he said, were to eat and drink and passionately debate topics as meaningful as state politics — HB2, Swiney said, leads to “an exclusion of a class of citizens” — and as ultimately meaningless as a basketball team’s chances in the year’s tournament. Then they would wander around Greenville’s downtown and toward the arena, both freshened up for their big weekend — but never terribly far from the past. Bon Secours Wellness Arena is less than five blocks from the Museum and Library of Confederate History, where Roof once stood and posed for a photograph amid the half-dozen Confederate flags on display. Swiney would skip that, instead spending most of his Friday in the stands and, when it came to both his home state and his favorite basketball team, sit and hope for the future of North Carolina.

593852407,2017-03-14 16:04:30,Obama administration spent record $36 million in FOIA legal costs in final year,http://www.mlive.com/news/us-world/index.ssf/2017/03/obama_administration_spent_rec.html,en,True,,65422,mlive.com,http://mlive.com/,"FILE - In this Aug. 10, 2006, file photo, the State Department sign used as a backdrop at the State Department in Washington. The Obama administration in its final year in office spent a record $36.2 million on legal costs defending its refusal to turn over federal records under the Freedom of Information Act, according to an Associated Press analysis of new U.S. data that also showed poor performance in other categories measuring transparency in government. For a second consecutive year, the Obama administration set a record for times federal employees told citizens, journalists and others that despite searching they couldn't find a single page of files that were requested. (AP Photo/Charles Dharapak, File) WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Obama administration in its final year in office spent a record $36.2 million on legal costs defending its refusal to turn over federal records under the Freedom of Information Act, according to an Associated Press analysis of new U.S. data that also showed poor performance in other categories measuring transparency in government. For a second consecutive year, the Obama administration set a record for times federal employees told citizens, journalists and others that despite searching they couldn't find a single page of files that were requested. And it set records for outright denial of access to files, refusing to quickly consider requests described as especially newsworthy, and forcing people to pay for records who had asked the government to waive search and copy fees. The government acknowledged when challenged that it had been wrong to initially refuse to turn over all or parts of records in more than one-third of such cases, the highest rate in at least six years. In courtrooms, the number of lawsuits filed by news organizations under the Freedom of Information Act surged during the past four years, led by the New York Times, Center for Public Integrity and The Associated Press, according to a litigation study by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. The AP on Monday settled its 2015 lawsuit against the State Department for files about Hillary Clinton's time as secretary of state, at AP's request, and received $150,546 from the department to cover part of its legal fees. The AP has pending lawsuits against the FBI for records about its decision to impersonate an AP journalist during a criminal investigation and about who helped the FBI hack into a mass shooting suspect's iPhone and how much the government paid to do it. Of the $36.2 million in legal costs fighting such lawsuits last year, the Justice Department accounted for $12 million, the Homeland Security Department for $6.3 million and the Pentagon for $4.8 million. The three departments accounted for more than half the government's total records requests last year. The figures reflect the final struggles of the Obama administration during the 2016 election to meet President Barack Obama's pledge that it was ""the most transparent administration in history,"" despite wide recognition of serious problems coping with requests under the information law. It received a record 788,769 requests for files last year and spent a record $478 million answering them and employed 4,263 full-time FOIA employees across more than 100 federal departments and agencies. That was higher by 142 such employees the previous year. Overall, in the final year of Obama's administration, people who asked for records last year under the law received censored files or nothing in 77 percent of requests, about the same as the previous year. In the first full year after Obama's election, that figure was only 65 percent of cases. The government released the new figures in the days ahead of Sunshine Week, which ends Sunday, when news organizations promote open government and freedom of information. Under the records law, citizens and foreigners can compel the U.S. government to turn over copies of federal records for zero or little cost. Anyone who seeks information through the law is generally supposed to get it unless disclosure would hurt national security, violate personal privacy or expose business secrets or confidential decision-making in certain areas.

On the go? Click or tap here for a summary of what we know. How does a Level I trauma center respond to a mass shooting? Pastor of Cameo shooting victims calls for an end to the violence. Tap or click here for a guide on mass shooting terminology. Update, 10:42 a.m. Monday: Cincinnati Police Chief Eliot Isaac, while providing an update Monday morning at City Hall, said that an additional individual came forward Sunday evening claiming to have been struck by gunfire at Cameo nightclub, bringing the total injured by gunfire to 17. ""We are very confident we will find who is responsible for this,"" Isaac said. Isaac added during the morning Law Committee meeting at City Hall that he does not believe there is footage of the shooting from within the nightclub. Previous reporting: As clubgoers danced away a Saturday night, armed men apparently hoping to settle a daylong score opened fire inside East End’s Cameo nightclub in the bloodiest mass shooting in the nation so far this year. Though first responders performed rescue medicine, one man died of his injuries and 15 others were injured from gunshot wounds. The violence at 1:30 a.m. triggered a sweeping panic inside the packed club while patrons raced to flee. Once on the scene to triage victims, police and firefighters had to step over wounded bodies to determine which patients needed the most immediate care, Dan Hils, president of the Cincinnati Fraternal Order of Police, said. Through the day and into the evening, investigators scoured the city for the people responsible for the shootings. The Rev. Peterson Mingo of Evanston’s Christ Temple Church said he and other leaders of the African-American community have heard from citizens who “have been giving us names and we’re sending them to the police, and they say they’re cooperating.” At a news conference 10 hours after the shooting Mayor John Cranley and Police Chief Eliot Isaac said authorities were searching for more than one shooter, and they urged anyone with information on what Cranley called “this heinous crime” to contact police. Cameo shooting shocks Cincinnati hip-hop community “People were just going to have a good time, and they got shot. That is totally unacceptable,” Cranley said. City Manager Harry Black issued a statement saying the shooting was the culmination of a squabble “between two specific groups or individuals earlier in the day, escalating and ultimately leading to this tragedy.” Sunday afternoon, the space around the sprawling Cameo club was quiet; by then, the doors were locked and the crime scene tape already coiled in messy piles. Several personal items had been left behind -- a lone tennis shoe, a nice pair of flip-flops, mobile phones. A contrast to the location's reputation as an active dance club that had been patronized previously by national hip-hop acts. Isaac identified the dead man as O’Bryan Raphael Spikes, 27, of Winton Hills. He did not provide any further information about Spikes except that his family had been notified. Cameo had paid for four off-duty police officers to patrol the parking lot, and they were the first to respond to the shooting, Hils, the FOP president, said. “They saw a lot of the patrons running out in an absolute panic,” Hils said. “They were literally stepping over victims to get to more critically injured victims. So you’re talking about a very horrific scene there. They tried everything they could to save the one gentleman’s life. They performed CPR, the police officer did, but to no avail.” On Monday morning, two people remained in critical condition at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. Seven more people were treated at UCMC for injuries. Four have been released, and three others are in stable condition, said spokeswoman Kelly Martin. Two other gunshot victims were treated at Bethesda North Hospital, one at Mercy Health-Anderson Hospital and two at the Christ Hospital. Officials at facilities said those patients had been released by noon Sunday. Cranley flatly ruled out any connection to international terrorism, “But to the victims, what difference does it make? They have been terrorized by gun violence, and they are innocent victims. … This is a tragedy that has struck other communities, and now it has struck Cincinnati.” The Cameo nightclub incident is the nation’s worst mass shooting, for total number of victims, so far this year, according to Gunviolencearchive.org. The nation has had 71 mass shootings this year, the website reports. Cincinnati has experienced at least nine shootings of more than four victims in Cincinnati since 2013, the most recent before Sunday's on Feb. 28 when six people were shot at a Northside apartment building. Mass shootings in Cincinnati: Not as rare as you'd think The worst mass shooting in recent city history was Aug. 21, 2015, when two people were killed and five injured at the Elks club in Madisonville. One person died and seven were injured in a July 2016 shooting at a Hamilton bar. At the news conference, Isaac said the nightclub had also hired private security to use hand-held metal detectors to check for guns. But at least one patron said that by 12:30 a.m., the “wanding” for weapons had ended. Sherell Johnson, a Cincinnati native now living in Chicago, came home for a spring break weekend with family. She said she and her sister decided to go to Cameo with their boyfriends around 12:30 a.m. Sunday. By then, Johnson said, the line to get into the club was long, and a security officer at the door “wasn’t patting them down (for weapons). He was just accepting the money, telling people this is the no-wait line, they were paying $40 to $60 to get in that line.” While in line, Angel Cruz, Johnson's boyfriend, said he “had a bad feeling” and went back to their rental car. Johnson followed. The couple discovered the car was boxed in by another vehicle. Johnson went to the club’s door to get some help. At around 1:30 a.m., one off-duty police officer went inside the club to get help for the couple, “and that’s when the shooting started.” Immediately, Johnson said she dropped to the ground, and Cruz lay on top of her until the tide of fleeing people ebbed. They got back to their car, which was now unblocked. Kasich on Cincinnati nightclub shooting: 'Where is it safe to go?' “We left Chicago to get away from all that,” Cruz said. Isaac said first responders had difficulty getting to the club because patrons who had filled the parking lot were trying to leave the scene quickly. Sgt. Eric Franz said several victims tried to drive themselves to a hospital. At least two cars were abandoned on Kellogg Avenue when drivers decided they needed paramedics to complete the trip to the hospital. In his statement about the daylong dispute that apparently led to the shooting, City Manager Black also pointed out that the nightclub has a history of gun violence, including a shooting inside on Jan. 1, 2015, and a parking-lot shooting in September 2015. The owner of the club, Julian Rodgers, issued a statement on the shooting Sunday evening. ""On behalf of the Cameo Nightclub family and staff, I want to express how deeply saddened we are by this senseless shooting,"" Rodgers said. ""Our goal is and has always been to provide a safe environment for our patrons."" Rodgers said the club would remain closed while authorities investigate and offered his condolences for the victims. ""We will do everything in our power to cooperate and make sure the monsters that did this are caught and brought to justice,"" the statement said. At the Sunday news conference, Isaac said body cameras are not yet being used when police officers work off-duty. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has been working with the local officials in the investigation, Cranley and Isaac said. Cranley also said that in a morning phone call, Gov. John Kasich had offered state resources to solve the crime. One man inside the club described a ""big brawl"" before at least 20 shots were fired. ""It was a big gun because you heard it over the music,"" said Mauricio Thompson, who said he's from Cleveland. ""Everybody's running. Everybody scattered to get out of the club."" Cincinnati mayoral candidate Rob Richardson said on Twitter: ""This shooting hits close to home. I have younger family members who have attended this Cameo on a regular basis.” Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio said in a statement: ""While we are still learning the details surrounding this horrific tragedy, we thank our first responders for acting quickly and providing critical care for those at the scene. Jane and I extend our thoughts and prayers to the victims and their families. My office stands ready to help them and our law enforcement authorities in any way we can.""

The full-color poster asks one simple question as the case inches closer to the year anniversary with no arrest: Do you know you murdered us on April 22, 2016? It's the same question Tony Rhoden and his siblings, as well as relatives and those who knew the Rhoden, Gilley and Manley families have asked for nearly a year without an answer. Authorities continue to say they are actively investigating the eight-person homicide that, to date, has only fueled rumor and speculation about possible motives. And just last week, one family member said she again submitted to a lie detector test. Pictures of Tony Rhoden's family members, each shot to death in trailers on family land, are displayed prominently in the posters. Christopher Rhoden, Sr., and his former wife, Dana Manley Rhoden; and their three children, Clarence ""Frankie"" Rhoden, Hanna Rhoden and Chris Rhoden, Jr.; Christopher Rhoden's older brother, Kenneth, and their cousin, Gary Rhoden, were all found shot in the head in their trailers. Also killed was Clarence ""Frankie"" Rhoden's fiancee, Hannah Hazel Gilley. Related: Ohio AG: Killers of 8 familiar with family's properties Pike County: Death in the foothills Another courtroom battle may be ahead in Rhoden family massacre Family in Ohio massacre scoffs at sheriff's comments Tony Rhoden and other family members met with officials from the Attorney General's Office and the Pike County Sheriff's Office Wednesday afternoon, as they have each month since last April. The meetings are meant to answer their questions and provide information, but Tony Rhoden said there hasn't been a lot of information lately. ""You probably know more than we do,'' Tony Rhoden said, adding that he and his family understand the secrecy around the case is necessary to make an arrest and ultimately win a conviction. And while the lack of information is frustrating, the family supports law enforcement efforts. ""It's a long road, we understand that,'' he said. ""We have to be patient."" Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine has repeatedly said the case was complex and that it would take time to solve. Neither he nor Pike County Sheriff Charles Reader, have discussed a possible motive or if they have a suspect in the case. DeWine has said there is more than one killer and the killers likely knew the family. It's unclear if anyone from the state's Bureau of Criminal Investigation, which has at times had as many as 90 detectives, analysts and forensic scientists assigned to the case, remains in Pike County. However, last week the woman who discovered four of the victims submitted to her second polygraph test, she said. Bobby Jo Manley said during an interview at her home Wednesday that a BCI agent drove her to Columbus on March 14 to take the test. She said she passed the test. It's the second time she has taken the test and passed, she said. The first test was in Waverly, the seat of Pike County, and took hours, she said. Manley is the younger sister of victim Dana Rhoden. She said she didn't know if anyone else had been asked to take the tests, which are not admissible in court. ""I keep telling them I don't know who did this ..."" she said. ""I wish I did."" Manley said she is worried that the land her trailer sits on, which was owned by Christopher Rhoden, will get sold as part of the probate actions. But paperwork filed in Pike County Probate Court only lists assets for Christopher Rhoden Jr., Hanna Rhoden and Clarence ""Frankie"" Rhoden so far. Each had a $25,000 life insurance policy. A 2000 Ford Super Duty pickup truck is listed as an asset in Clarence Rhoden's probate action. The value of it, though, is unknown because it remains in state custody ""due to (the) circumstances of this matter."" Wilma McCoy, Tony Rhoden's sister, implored anyone with any information to contact police. ""Please, please come forward,"" she said. ""And if anyone would like to donate, please donate to Crime Stoppers to raise the reward for our loved ones."" Anyone with information related to the case is asked to call the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation at 855-BCI-OHIO (224-6446) or the Pike County Sheriff's Office at 740-947-2111. There remains a $10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and a conviction in the case.

          / CBS News BALTIMORE -- Disturbing new details have emerged about a foiled mass-shooting plot aimed at a Maryland high school, CBS Baltimore reports. Police uncovered a shotgun with ammunition, fireworks, and an arsenal of other materials for making bombs at the teen’s home in Thurmont, Maryland. They say 18-year-old Nichole Cevario, a Catoctin High student, intended on carrying out an attack at the high school. Police say Cevario had been planning the attack for months. “There is no doubt in our minds that we averted a disaster up there,” said Charles Jenkins of the Frederick County Sheriff’s Office. Police say Cevario’s father foiled his daughter’s deadly plot after he found her diary which listed details of the attack, including a date next week she planned on carrying it all out. “It was also clear in her diary that she planned to die during this event,” Jenkins said. Investigators say the teen had also recorded the school’s emergency procedures, and had specifically referenced the Sandy Hook and Columbine massacres. School officials, like many in the community, have been left in disbelief. “We had no indication whatsoever that there were any issues with this student,” said Michael Doerrer of Frederick County Public Schools. “You would never think that it would be her to do something like this. I knew something was up with her but I would have never imagined that it was this bad,” one student said. In an interview, the Frederick County sheriff said the diary tells a different story. “You could read the frustration, the emotional issues. Talking about how she could conduct this shooting, the fact that she may be the first female active school shooter in the country,” Jenkins said. Cevario was taken to the hospital for evaluation and remains hospitalized. Police stress that no weapons ever made it on school grounds. The teen faces a number of charges which could result in lengthy prison sentences.

U.S. District Judge Paul Byron reversed U.S. Magistrate Judge Donna Ryu’s decision to release Salman on $500,000 bond, reports said. Ryu said Salman, 31, is not a threat and there is no proof she has any ties to the Islamic State group or holds extremist views, but Bryon said he believes otherwise, noting Salman texted Mateen, asking, “Where are you?” The judge said the question could mean she, in fact, did not know where her husband was, or that she was asking which target he had attacked, WFTV, Orlando, reported. Read: Who Is Omar Mateen? Pulse Nightclub Shooter Was Security Guard Previously, Salman said the night of the shooting, Mateen was going to a friend’s house. Investigators said they believe Salman accompanied Mateen to City Place, Disney Springs and Pulse nightclub to scout for potential targets. The widow was charged last month with obstruction and providing aid to a terrorist organization, and was taken into custody by FBI agents at her home outside San Francisco where she had been living with her 4-year-old son.  Salman told police she was unaware of her husband’s motive in killing 49 people and wounding dozens on June 12. She made similar remarks to the New York Times in an interview in November. ""I don’t condone what he has done. I am very sorry for what has happened. He has hurt a lot of people,"" she said. However, investigators doubted her story. They interviewed Salman for days after the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history and agreed she was not honest about her husband’s plans to carry out the rampage. Mateen, 29, who died after a gunbattle with a SWAT team in the club, pledged allegiance to ISIS and tied the attack on the American bombings of Muslim countries. No trial date has been set for Salman, who has another hearing in California on April 10. She has pleaded not guilty to charges of aiding and abetting, and obstruction of justice. If convicted, she faces life in prison."

U.S. District Judge Paul Byron reversed the decision of a magistrate judge in Oakland last week to release Noor Salman on $500,000 bond and ordered her jailed pending trial on charges of aiding and abetting and obstruction. Acting upon a request from prosecutors, Byron said Salman hadn’t overcome a legal presumption that she was a flight risk or a danger to the community. “Upon consideration, this court finds that no condition or combination of conditions of pretrial release will reasonably assure the safety of the community or the reasonably assure the defendant’s appearance during the required court proceedings,” the judge wrote. Salman was never let go from jail while Byron considered the prosecutors’ request. Her attorney, Charles Swift in Texas, said in a statement that she maintains her innocence. “We are currently exploring all available legal remedies on her behalf,” Swift said. “Until all the facts come out in trial, we urge the community to withhold judgment.” Salman moved to California to be with family after last June’s massacre at the gay Orlando nightclub, and she had her first court appearance there even though charges were filed in Orlando. At the last of several Oakland hearings, U.S. Magistrate Judge Donna Ryu said it was “debatable” whether the government has enough evidence to convict Salman and ordered her released from jail until trial. Salman has pleaded not guilty to charges of aiding and abetting, and obstruction of justice. Prosecutors have said Salman accompanied her husband when he cased locations for potential terrorist attacks, knew ahead of time that he was planning the attack and misled FBI agents about what she knew about her husband’s plans. Salman’s husband, Omar Mateen, pledged allegiance to Islamic State during the attack at the Pulse nightclub last June 12. The deadliest mass shooting in recent U.S. history left 49 people dead and dozens more wounded. Mateen was killed by police during a shootout at the end of a three-hour standoff. The judge’s order offered new details about psychiatric tests given to Salman by a doctor that were ordered by the federal magistrate. The doctor concluded that Salman had post-traumatic stress disorder and also had a high probability of intellectual impairment, although the results weren’t definitive, according to the order. The judge’s order also said that Salman wasn’t given her Miranda warnings, which tell suspects they have a right to remain silent and have an attorney, when she was interviewed for 16 hours by FBI agents after the massacre. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office late Friday didn’t respond to an email asking how that would affect the case. Get the latest news delivered daily!

Lucy Richards, 57, was arrested about 4:40 p.m. and charged with failing to appear in court. Jail records list the arrest location as Brandon Regional Hospital. Richards remained without bail in the Hillsborugh County jail on a hold from the U.S. Marshals Service. Richards was due in federal court in Fort Lauderdale on Wednesday for a change-of-plea hearing and sentencing. But that morning, she called the Federal Public Defender's Office and said she would not be appearing in court. ""Miss Richards called my investigator and said she's not coming,"" Assistant Federal Public Defender Robert Berube told the judge. Berube said his client did not give a reason. Senior U.S. District Judge James Cohn issued an arrest warrant for Richards and canceled the hearing. He also revoked her bond. BACKSTORY: Sandy Hook father bemoans 'the darkness' as feds charge Tampa woman with threatening him Richards had been free on bond since she surrendered in court in December. She pleaded not guilty to four federal charges that she sent threatening email and voicemails to Lenny Pozner in January 2016. Each of the charges carries a maximum punishment of five years in federal prison. Richards may now face a prison term because she failed to show up and prosecutors could withdraw the plea agreement offer.

O'Bryan Spikes, nicknamed ""Lucky,"" was convinced by friends to go out after he'd planned to stay home Saturday and go to church in the morning. Instead, he ended up the only person dead of a gunshot wound to the chest in a shooting at the club. Sixteen others were injured in the shooting which ties with a November 2015 shooting in New Orleans as the 10th worst mass shooting in the United States since 2013. Police have made no arrests and say the investigation is ongoing. Coroner's office: Cameo victim died of single gunshot wound to chest ""He wasn't going to the club that night,"" said Bishop Darin Miller, pastor of Word of Life Christian Fellowship of Covington. ""He told his mom and his sister, 'I'm staying home.'"" Spikes planned to attend an 11:30 a.m. service on Sunday. Spikes' sister asked Miller to be their family's spokesman. They were grieving Tuesday in the wake of his killing. They declined to comment to news media. Miller's phone rang incessantly at around 2 a.m. Sunday, and he finally answered after the fourth call. It was a sister of Spikes. ""She told me, 'They shot my brother,'"" Miller said. She was with family at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, waiting and hoping that they'd find him there. But Spikes wasn't there. ""His body was still at the Cameo,"" Miller said. ""He never made it to the hospital."" The family learned sometime around 7 a.m., after spending hours in the hospital, that Spikes had been shot to death at the nightclub. Spikes was the father of three young children, who are with other family members, Miller said. Miller described the 27-year-old as a ""happy"" young man. ""I remember shaking his hand. I remember hugging him,"" Miller said of his encounters with Spikes at the church. ""He would be someone that I would be a friend to today. He was polite, respectful. ""He loved the music,"" Miller said, shaking his head and smiling. ""When he was here, he was engaged."" Will Cameo shootings result in more violence in Cincinnati? That wasn't often, Miller said, but one of his sisters recently told Miller she'd hoped that her brother would soon become more than an ""Easter"" Sunday church-goer. ""I said that's all right,"" Miller said. He was busy with phone calls all morning Tuesday, from people who heard the news of Spikes' demise. Miller was also planning a funeral service, though he had to find a church that could hold a lot of people. ""At least a thousand,"" he said. Miller said the visitation would take place April 8, from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. followed by the funeral. ​ It was clear through what Miller had heard since Sunday morning that Spikes was known, loved and missed. ""Many people liked him if not, they loved him."" Andrea Houston, who knew him since he was 14, was said it was too hard to say much about her longtime friend. ""He was a sweet, gentle person who loved life, his children and family,"" she said. ""He would give his last to a friend in need."" She wasn't with him when he died, but she said, I was actually on my way there when this horrible thing happened."" Meanwhile, friends and acquaintances sent their condolences to Spikes' family on a fundraising site that his sister set up. ""My heart goes out to the family. His children especially,"" one donor wrote. ""Prayers going up."" The Enquirer's Meg Vogel contributed."

The lawsuit was filed Wednesday in federal court in South Florida on behalf of more than four dozen of the survivors and family members of those killed at Pulse nightclub last June. Forty-nine people were killed during the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history at the gay nightclub. Dozens more were injured. The lawsuit claims wrongful death, negligence and other counts. Personal injury attorney Antonio Romanucci said Mateen's employer, international security company G4S, knew he was mentally unstable yet allowed him to carry a gun in his job as a security guard. Mateen had a firearm license through his job, Romanucci told The Associated Press in an interview. ""Mateen gave out so many warnings that someone should have reined this guy in,"" Romanucci said. ""They should have said, 'You are not stable. You shouldn't have a weapon.'"" While working as a security guard at the St. Lucie County Courthouse, Mateen was investigated by the FBI in 2013 after he told co-workers he had connections to terrorists and a mass shooter. He later told his bosses he had made that up to get his co-workers to stop teasing him about being Muslim and the FBI determined he was not a threat. A spokeswoman for the security firm, Monica Lewman-Garcia, said she couldn't comment without seeing the lawsuit. Romanucci said Mateen's wife, Noor Salman, knew her husband was going to carry out the killings. Salman currently is in jail awaiting trial. She has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of aiding and abetting, and obstruction of justice. Prosecutors have said Salman accompanied her husband when he cased locations for potential terrorist attacks and knew ahead of time that he was planning the attack. ""Rather than warn authorities, she kept it a secret and acted as his accomplice,"" Romanucci said. Salman's defense attorney in her criminal case did not respond to an email seeking comment. The most recent effort to hold an outside company liable for a mass shooting has failed, at least for the time being. A judge in Connecticut last fall dismissed a lawsuit brought against the manufacturer of the rifle used in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting massacre, saying a federal law shields gun manufacturers from most lawsuits over criminal use of their products. The Connecticut Supreme Court, though, has agreed to hear an appeal brought by the victims' families. The advantage of suing Mateen's employer, rather than the firearms manufacturer or seller, is that the victims don't have the obstacle of the federal law, said Sachin Pandya, a law professor at the University of Connecticut. But even if the plaintiffs can show Mateen's employer should have taken some precautions, ""you still have to show that what the employer failed to do caused the mass shooting,"" Pandya said. This isn't the first lawsuit to be filed by family members or victims of the Pulse massacre. Families of three patrons killed in the nightclub sued Facebook, Google and Twitter, claiming Mateen was radicalized through propaganda found through social media. A fund that was formed after the massacre has distributed almost $30 million to the survivors and family members of victims. UCLA law professor Adam Winkler said the plaintiffs are going to have to show that the security firm had a duty, failed in its duty and is responsible for what happened. With Salman, they are going to have to show that she was a co-conspirator or that her failure to report that her husband was dangerous led to the attack. ""This will be a very challenging lawsuit,"" Winkler said. ""Victims of gun violence are looking for second-best options and that is what this is.""

Tuesday, 14 March 2017 07:15 AM The Obama administration in its final year in office spent a record $36.2 million on legal costs defending its refusal to turn over federal records under the Freedom of Information Act, according to an Associated Press analysis of new U.S. data that also showed poor performance in other categories measuring transparency in government. For a second consecutive year, the Obama administration set a record for times federal employees told citizens, journalists and others that despite searching they couldn't find a single page of files that were requested. And it set records for outright denial of access to files, refusing to quickly consider requests described as especially newsworthy, and forcing people to pay for records who had asked the government to waive search and copy fees. The government acknowledged when challenged that it had been wrong to initially refuse to turn over all or parts of records in more than one-third of such cases, the highest rate in at least six years. In courtrooms, the number of lawsuits filed by news organizations under the Freedom of Information Act surged during the past four years, led by the New York Times, Center for Public Integrity and The Associated Press, according to a litigation study by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. The AP on Monday settled its 2015 lawsuit against the State Department for files about Hillary Clinton's time as secretary of state, at AP's request, and received $150,546 from the department to cover part of its legal fees. The AP has pending lawsuits against the FBI for records about its decision to impersonate an AP journalist during a criminal investigation and about who helped the FBI hack into a mass shooting suspect's iPhone and how much the government paid to do it. Of the $36.2 million in legal costs fighting such lawsuits last year, the Justice Department accounted for $12 million, the Homeland Security Department for $6.3 million and the Pentagon for $4.8 million. The three departments accounted for more than half the government's total records requests last year. The figures reflect the final struggles of the Obama administration during the 2016 election to meet President Barack Obama's pledge that it was ""the most transparent administration in history,"" despite wide recognition of serious problems coping with requests under the information law. It received a record 788,769 requests for files last year and spent a record $478 million answering them and employed 4,263 full-time FOIA employees across more than 100 federal departments and agencies. That was higher by 142 such employees the previous year. A spokesman for former President Obama did not immediately respond to an email request for comment late Monday. The White House under Obama routinely defended its efforts under the information law in recent years and said federal employees worked diligently on such requests for records. It remains unclear how President Donald Trump's administration will perform under the Freedom of Information Act or other measures of government transparency. Trump has not spoken extensively about transparency. In his private business and his presidential campaign, Trump required employees and advisers to sign non-disclosure agreements that barred them from discussing their work. His administration has barred some mainstream news organizations from campaign rallies and one White House press briefing. And Trump broke with tradition by refusing to disclose his tax returns. Trump's secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, is traveling to Asia this week on a small plane without a contingent of journalists or a designated pool reporter who would send reports to the broader diplomatic press corps, departing from 50 years of practice. Overall, in the final year of Obama's administration, people who asked for records last year under the law received censored files or nothing in 77 percent of requests, about the same as the previous year. In the first full year after Obama's election, that figure was only 65 percent of cases.

Police Chief Eliot Isaac declined to say whether police have identified possible suspects in the Sunday gun violence inside the Cameo club, a popular hip-hop music spot near the Ohio river east of downtown Cincinnati. But Isaac said police weren't actively looking for anyone as yet. ""We're gathering information ... we're making some progress,"" Isaac said after giving city council members an update on the investigation. Investigators believe multiple shooters were involved; police estimate more than 20 shots were fired, sending club patrons diving to the floor or scrambling away from a chaotic and terrifying scene. The FBI and federal firearms agents are assisting Cincinnati police. Isaac said a number of people have contacted police with information, including a person who came forward Sunday evening to report having been shot, raising the total number injured to 16 besides the 27-year-old man who was slain. Two of the 16 injured were in critical condition Monday. Three other people remained hospitalized in stable condition. The initial investigation indicated a dispute in the bar escalated into a gun fight around 1:30 a.m., the chief said. No club security footage of the shooting has emerged, he said. Isaac said some of the wounded could be key witnesses, and city officials urged any reluctant potential witnesses to help, saying they would be protected. Crime witnesses afraid to testify for fear of retribution have been a problem in some past Cincinnati cases. Isaac said the nightclub had metal detectors, or wands, but wasn't required to by law. Four police officers were working off-duty security details in the club parking lot, but he emphasized the club provides its own security inside. Late Monday night, Cameo club operator Julian ""Jay"" Rodgers released a statement saying the club would close its doors for good on Friday. ""Earlier this morning, Cameo received a notice to vacate the premises from the landlord and owner of the property,"" Rodgers said. ""Cameo notified the owner that although it had planned to move out in May due to the landlord's planned sale of the property, it will instead voluntarily surrender possession of the property immediately."" The club had voluntarily surrendered its liquor license earlier Monday. City officials say Cameo has been the scene of past violence, including a shooting inside the club on New Year's Day in 2015 and one in the parking lot in September of that year. Several city leaders pledged to find ways to prevent such violence, while acknowledging such outbreaks continue to occur in public venues across the country. Mayor John Cranley said the city has gotten outpouring of support from elected officials, including fellow mayors in other cities. ""I think they know that this could happen anywhere,"" Cranley said. Shootings at U.S. bars and nightclubs have rarely involved more than a handful people. But the Orlando, Florida, nightclub massacre last June that killed 49 people and injured 53 was the exception, making it the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. One teen died and eight others were injured in 2010 when gunfire broke out in the parking lot of a St. Louis club after a group was turned away from entering. Two teen girls died and seven other people were hurt in a 2009 shooting outside an underage nightclub in Portland, Oregon. In Cincinnati, four candles illuminated a makeshift memorial outside the club on a foggy Monday morning. A poster dedicated to O'Bryan Spikes, the man killed, said ""R.I.P. Lucky"" and ""Father Son Uncle Brother."" Seewer reported from Toledo.

The day will mark one year since a gunman murdered 49 people at Pulse, a gay nightclub, in what was the deadliest mass shooting in modern United States history. The attack sent shockwaves across the world, reverberating throughout LGBTQÂ communities. Pulse had especially deep roots in Orlando's gay Latino community, and many of the victims of the June massacre were LGBTQÂ people of color.Â The official announcement from the city about the upcoming OrlandoÂ United Day promised ""an opportunity to join with others in acts of love and kindnessÂ to continue the unity that followed the tragedy,"" including events ""to remember the victims and honor the survivors."" However, neither the statement nor the short videoÂ announcing the day make explicit mention of the LGBTQÂ community or the fact that Pulse was a gay club â something that people on social media were quick to call out. The slate of events planned for the day does make specific mention of LGBTQÂ people, though. An outline of events on the day's official website includes an unveiling of ""the legendary Sea-to-Sea Rainbow Flag,"" a tribute to Pulse victims that the city says ""has become a globally recognized symbol of the LGBTQ movement."" The day will also include a memorial reading of the names of the 49 victims of the attack. According to the Orlando Sentinel, the day was planned ""with the input of Pulse survivors and the LGBTQ community."" ""We don't want to focus on an act of terror, we want to focus on how we all came together,""Â Commissioner Patty Sheehan, who is leading the planning of the day, told the Sentinel.

You’ve lost your muchness.” “My muchness?” Alice replies, confused.  The Mad Hatter pins a finger onto her heart. “In there. Something’s missing.”  – from Alice in Wonderland (2010), with Johnny Depp and Mia Wasikowska   ...   I could blame Big Pharma.  I could blame it all on that shitty psychiatrist (heretofore called ""Bad Psych"") who had me ""try on"" psychotropic meds like ill-fitting jeans at TJ Maxx. Whose lack of pharmaceutical insight literally landed me in the mental hospital.  In the end, though, the blame falls on me. For seeking happiness in a few pills.   ...   150 mg Zoloft/day.  150 mg Lamictal/day.  100 mg Trazodone/day.  And those are just the three meds I've managed to taper off completely.  I'm still taking 1 mg Ativan per day (0.5 in the a.m.; 0.5 at night). The mental hospital had started me on 2 mg per day, and I've managed to cut that dose in half.  Ditto 75 mg Seroquel per night. The Bad Psych had started me on 150 mg and I've cut that dose in half as well.  The only medicine I'm planning on staying on (for now) is Effexor, which, to be honest, I should've stuck with from the very beginning.  I should count myself as lucky that I can afford psychotropic medication at all. That, even after being laid off, I have health insurance to have paid for this boatload of benzos and other meds. Millions in America can't afford to even get one prescription, let alone six.  One reason for this lack of resources for Americans with mental conditions is that our country still treats mental illness as a stigma. Therefore, psychological and psychiatric care isn't available to many Americans, even with health insurance.  But another, even more insidious and darker revelation about too damned many people in our country—many politicians, and the tens of millions who keep voting for these idiots—is that, unlike civilized countries like Canada, much of Europe, Japan, Costa Rica, Australia, and New Zealand, healthcare isn't considered a right, but a privilege. Too damned many people feel you're a shiftless loser if you don't have a job that grants you health coverage, and they don't want to pay for your lack of responsibility, natch. And some among that lot feel that free, or even affordable, government-subsidized health coverage, equates to ""reparations,"" and those poor, forgotten White Working-Class Voters™ ain't having any of that.  So I suppose I should count myself among the lucky ones, for having the financial means and the healthcare for psychotropic meds to be an option for mental health treatment. Why am I complaining?  Healthcare is a business, and in the American Free Market™, caveat emptor, baby. Let the buyer beware.  (As an aside, I remember caveat emptor from an old episode of The Brady Bunch, not an LSAT or anything lofty like that. But anyway...)   ...   I wanted to feel better, and I paid for it.  I've been living with depression, anxiety, and obsessive/compulsive disorder (OCD) for as long as I can remember. Even when I was a little girl, I was shuttled to shrinks to find out ""what was wrong with me."" I had zero social skills and had trouble making friends. I was moody and sensitive. All qualities I didn't outgrow, even as I grew older.  Until I turned 28, I'd gone through the revolving doors of therapists' offices, trying to figure out myself, my reason for being on Planet Earth, and why and how I felt and behaved the way I did. Nothing the cotillions of therapists suggested or ordered seemed to work. The advice didn't stick, the EMDR practice felt silly, the words of encouragement and self-empowerment seemed to waft into one ear and blow out the opposite. Relationships, jobs, and life in general seemed to crash and burn at my feet, leaving me an emotional mess and my family and friends (those who were left and still tolerated my shit for whatever reason) baffled at my inability to get my shit together.  Then, when I was 28, a therapist recommended that I go to a psychiatrist to see about getting me on a medication. I'd resisted taking medication for the usual reasons: it's a copout; it's depending on a pill to cure my mental state; it's antithetical to the pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps mentality with which I was raised. However, I was turning a corner professionally and I had just started dating who would later become my husband, and I had a tough time with the emotions involved in both. I decided to give it a try, so on Paxil I went.  The effects on my life from that one medication were dramatic. Gone, at least so I thought, were my insecurities about myself and my place in the world, my bitterness about not fitting in, and my constant ruminating about why I was having such a time of figuring out what the late Prince once called ""this thing called Life."" I could focus on other people and things besides being so absorbed in my own personal problems, my own conditions of depression and anxiety and OCD. The whole lot of those worries seemed to vanish overnight.  Why hadn't I gotten on medication sooner? I thought to myself every now and then. By taking this seemingly magical pill when I was early into college, I could've avoided those stupid decisions, or rather INdecisions, that had plagued my life, education, and career as a result of my neuroses. I could've avoided jumping into a bad first marriage when I was too young and immature to handle even dating. If only I'd much earlier gotten on a regimen of SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors).  Plus, the medication had taken away a huge heartache that had been consuming me through my twenties. While in college, and long after graduating college, I'd always imagined that I'd market a few of my completed screenplays to film companies or agencies and make enough money to get by—not a ton; I knew WGA minimums were pretty paltry for writers just starting out. That income would keep me afloat while I worked on the next few screenplays or on a few novels that I'd started but shelved after boredom and Real Life kicked in.  When life didn't work out that way, I'd get depressed. Like, mortally depressed, as if none of the other thousands of aspiring writers didn't face the same ennui and rejection that I had. During crunch time at my jobs, when I worked overtime to fatten someone else's paycheck, I'd despair in my silent tears and think as I worked, This isn't the life I envisioned for myself...   But after Paxil? No more whining and complaining about not making it as a writer. No more being depressed, or anxious, or obsessive about writing or anything else in my life that wasn't going the way I wanted it. What wasn't to love?  I was more than thrilled that the self-pitying angst of not ""making it"" as a writer had disappeared. However, along with it came a loss of creativity and an interest in writing altogether. Before Paxil, I'd stay up till 2 or 3 in the morning working away on my latest screenplay or short story; then I'd wake up a few hours later and head to my day job. After Paxil, I'd sit in front of a computer, type a few forced paragraphs of creatively bankrupt crap, and then give up and surf the Internet.  Before Paxil. After Paxil. Before/After. That's what I turned my existence into, a life of Before/Afters.  ...  As the Mad Hatter observed in the video clip from Alice in Wonderland at the beginning of this blog post, I lost a lot of my ""muchness"" as a result of the Paxil. The intensity of my depression and other mental conditions had been taken down a few notches, but so had the rest of what made me me.  ...  Several other undesirable side effects became apparent to me a few months into taking Paxil. My appetite increased, and I put on unwanted extra weight. Although my mood had improved and I'd stopped obsessing and ruminating over stupid stuff, I felt tired and sluggish—not motivated to do anything outside of going to work, sleeping, and eating.  I also felt...weirdly numb. Like I'd see a news story about a mass shooting in which a dozen people lost their lives needlessly, and I wouldn't feel anything. Not sadness or grief. Not fear or worry for the state of our broken country and our lax gun laws. Not even callous apathy, if I'd been a sociopath. I wouldn't feel anything. And that alone felt unsettling.  So I made a terrible mistake. I stopped taking the medicine without consulting with my doctor, without being aware that I needed to gradually titrate off the medication bit by bit.  That's when all hell broke loose. I couldn't sleep for days on end. Wracked with terrible anxiety, I felt constantly on the verge of a panic attack. I fixated on the stress of a new job and tormented both myself and my boyfriend in endless conversations that my boyfriend said sounded like they were meth-fueled. I almost lost my job, and my relationship with who was soon to be my husband, over what I'd soon discover was a very bad case of serotonin withdrawal syndrome.  After weeks of living like this, I consulted my doctor, who roundly scolded me for trying to quit the medicine cold-turkey. ""You need to taper off Paxil if you want to quit it. And I really don't think you should be quitting it about now."" He had me reinstate Paxil, and shortly after I took my first dose, it was as if the withdrawal symptoms had never happened. It was Before/After writ large.  I then resigned myself to living with Paxil's negative side effects, because the benefits outweighed what were reasonably minor hassles. When they became too burdensome, I asked my doctor for a different solution. He then switched me to Effexor, which turned out to have fewer side effects. Most notably, I could have human emotions again. Joy when it was appropriate to feel joy; sorrow when it was to feel the same.  Yet, like Paxil, Effexor dampened my writing creativity along with my enthusiasm for the craft I'd worked for many years to cultivate. For some reason, though, I didn't seem to mind. Trying for years to break into the highly-competitive screenwriting business hadn't given me any returns on investment, so, I reasoned, maybe giving it up wasn't a bad thing. I'd wasted so many years of energy and time writing fictitious stories about people who weren't real, and money on printing hundreds of query letters and an almost equal number of copies of screenplays and mailing them. Why not just chalk it up to experience and move on with my life in, you know, a real job?  Over the years, the Effexor seemed to lessen in its effectiveness at keeping my negative emotions at bay. I'd shellacked over what I'd thought was an impenetrable dome over my writing ambitions, but cracks started to form in the veneer when every lame attempt at ""just for fun"" slash fiction or membership in a writers' critique group rekindled my interest in what I believed to be my true calling.  So I increased the dose. Can't have those old longings and aspirations getting me in a depressed state once again to ruin everything—job, marriage, family, friendships.  The pills became my catch-all to solve life's problems.  Marriage becoming stale? Take another pill.  Infertility grief taking hold? Take another pill.  The stress of fostering and adopting children? Take another pill.  Career advancement coming to a screeching halt?  There's a pill for that.  A few years ago, I hit a crisis moment in several aspects of unresolved conflict I'd kept sweeping under the rug. I still felt grief and resentment over not being able to have a baby, coupled with the normal anxieties of going through the fostering-to-adopt process. That put strain on our marriage, even after we adopted our two (wonderful) sons from foster care. Plus, I had a few deep insecurities that became first difficult and then impossible to ignore, and that finally came to the forefront of my life.  So I went to see the Bad Psych. I told her my Effexor wasn't working anymore and asked her opinion on other options.  She put me on Brintellix. That didn't work.  She put me on Wellbutrin. That didn't work, at least not by itself.  She then put me on Cymbalta, which did seem to help a little, but I was scared by an account I'd read on the Internet that Cymbalta was nearly impossible to quit if needed.  So she put me on Lexapro, plus Latuda, an atypical antipsychotic with an off-label use as a mood stabilizer (even though I didn't have bipolar disorder), and augmented these two with Wellbutrin to help counteract some of Lexapro's side effects. I was having trouble sleeping with all of this mess, so she prescribed Valium to help with my insomnia.  Still, this supercocktail didn't work. In fact, I felt worse. My husband noticed that I seemed ""off"" while cooking at home or driving, and that I seemed distracted easily.  So after a few discussions (one of which turned into a full-on argument), my husband and I decided together that, under the assistance of the Bad Psych, I'd taper off the entire cocktail of meds and attempt to live medicine-free after I tapered off everything.  She tapered me off three different medications in seven weeks. As I've written in another blog post, that didn't work out too well.  Since writing that post about a year ago, I realize now that the woes hadn't resulted merely from Ativan, which is the benzo I'm still on. Seroquel's proving to be a meaner beast to cut, even harder than Ativan. I expect that tapering off the remainder of both of these meds (I'm only halfway there on each) will take at least another year or two, if not longer.  As I mentioned in the blog post above, I've long discontinued visits with the Bad Psych and have since worked with another, clinically more astute doctor who is helping me to very slowly wean off these things. She and I have agreed that I'll stay on Effexor at least in the interim, and we'll see how I handle getting off the Big Two (Seroquel and Ativan).  I just met with her this morning. Because I've just been laid off, we've agreed to hold on tapering any more meds, especially since my brain is in the process of healing after coming off the three psychotropics I've managed to discontinue thus far.  ...  Friends, family, and coworkers have told me not to get too hard on myself, not to beat myself up over putting my trust in a bad doctor and pharmaceutical system that let me down.  However, I can't help but thinking that I did this to myself. No one force-fed me the pills. I was well within my rights to do more research on these meds, but for whatever reason—laziness, an undeserving amount of trust in my doctor—I chose not to look into the small print.  Caveat emptor.  My husband, who is a saint for having had to live with me during this ordeal, and for having to live with someone who has depression to begin with, recommended that I try to manage my mental conditions with cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT. So I'm writing my way through a CBT workbook now, in the hopes that I can use my mind to overcome my mind, or at least overcome its weaknesses and perceived hurts.  I wish I had a more compelling, unifying way to conclude this blog, but all I can say is that I'm newly a skeptic of all things psychotropic.  And shame on me for ever wanting to find happiness in a damned pill."

Deondre Davis, 29, has been hospitalized since the March 26 shooting at the East End club that left 15 wounded and now two dead. Davis was charged with murder Thursday along with Cornell Beckley, 27, who is being held in the Hamilton County Jail on a $1.7 million bond. ""The family wants to fight to clear (Davis') name,"" Attorney Carl Lewis said. Lewis represented Davis on a slew of minor charges in the past, saying, ""He was one of my mischievous kids, not a hardened criminal."" Davis was at the club with family members to celebrate two birthdays. And he was friends with O'Bryan Spikes, 27, who died in the shooting, Lewis added. Lewis said the information he's gathered shows Davis had his hands out and was trying to mediate an argument that broke out when he was shot. Stories surface from Cameo mass shooting: Ordinary people, extraordinary violence Family members hurried him into a car to get him to a hospital but transferred him to a passing ambulance on Kellogg Avenue. His brother can be heard on a 911 call telling Davis to ""hold on, hold on."" Lewis said when Davis arrived at the hospital he was able to give a thumbs up and shake his head no when asked if he was in pain. But he went downhill from there. His kidneys failed, followed by other organs, Lewis said. The surviving victims of the Cameo shooting are: Rodney Espy, 30, Jraejah Warren, 28, Stephen Haley, 28, Rayshunda Higgins, 33, Jarrod Givens, 26, Ronald Lee, 33, Nathan McClendon, 27, Shannon Brown, 25, Jordan Harris, 24, Valor Stanley, 28, Bryant Stevenson, 28, Christopher Harris, 33, Michael Feagins Jr., 30, Khristian Howell, 25, and Regina Madaris, 33."

(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli)  Scott Dekraai, shown next to public defender Scott Sanders in October 2016, killed eight people in Seal Beach in 2011. (Photo by Ken Steinhardt, Orange County Register/SCNG)  California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said Wednesday he will continue to seek the death penalty against Scott Dekraai, who pleaded guilty to killing eight people and wounding another at a Seal Beach salon in 2011. Becerra’s office inherited Dekraai’s penalty trial in 2015 after a judge fired the Orange County District Attorney’s Office from the case – the deadliest mass murder in Orange County history – for fear the defendant’s rights were being violated. An appellate court upheld the ruling. “This tragic event has caused so much harm to far too many families,” Becerra said in a prepared statement. “After weighing the evidence, considering the law and the responsibilities of my office, I have concluded that the appropriate course of action is to seek the death penalty in this case.” Dekraai’s case has been stalled for six years by proven accusations from his defense attorney, Assistant Public Defender Scott Sanders, that police and prosecutors illegally used a jailhouse informant against Dekraai and others and withheld evidence. At least six other cases of murder and attempted murder have unraveled because of withheld evidence and problems with informants. Sanders is continuing his investigation in hopes that a judge will spare Dekraai the death penalty. “The Attorney General’s Office did not inform us directly of their decision, and we are certainly very disappointed in the path they have chosen,” Sanders said. “However, as will begin to show very soon, the misconduct that has poisoned this litigation is far more extensive than even known to the defense a few months ago. We look forward to fully adjudicating all of the issues relevant to this case.” Evidence found by Sanders has sparked separate investigations by Becerra’s office, the Orange County Grand Jury and the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division. District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said in a prepared statement that he “wholeheartedly” supported the attorney general’s decision. “Dekraai is a perfect example of why the death penalty exists and why I fought so hard to pass Proposition 66 to mend the death penalty,” Rackauckas wrote. “If the perpetrator of a mass slaughter of innocent people doesn’t deserve the death penalty, it’s hard to imagine a criminal who would.” The victims in the shooting were Michelle Fournier, Christy Wilson, Randy Fannin, Lucia Kondas, Victoria Buzzo, Laura Webb Elody, Michele Fast, and David Caouette. Dekraai also shot and wounded Hattie Stretz. Paul Wilson, whose wife was killed in the attack at Salon Meritage, said Wednesday he was “extremely disappointed” by the decision to continue seeking the death penalty. “I’m disappointed just with the time constraints we’ll be looking at, the complete mishandling byTony Rackauckas and his team,” Wilson said. “We’re looking at another two years minimum. It’s just exhausting on me, on my family.” Other relatives of the victims have said in the past they support the death penalty for Dekraai, a former tugboat crewman who pulled the trigger on his wife, Fournier, and her co-workers and customers because of a custody dispute.

In a statement, the department’s Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) said the funds would be granted on Wednesday and distributed by officials in Florida, where 49 people were killed at a gay nightclub in Orlando in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Shooter Omar Mateen was killed in a shootout with police after he took hostages during a three-hour standoff inside the Pulse nightclub. He also wounded dozens more people in the June 12, 2016 attack. “This award will reimburse victim services costs for operation of the Family Assistance Center in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, and ensure that victims, witnesses and first responders receive necessary services to help them adjust in the aftermath of violence, begin the healing process and cope with probable re-traumatization,” Marilyn McCoy Roberts, the office’s acting director, said in a statement. Similar funding was provided to help victims in other mass shootings in recent years, including in San Bernardino, California and Charleston, South Carolina, the department said in a statement.

          / AP WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration in its final year in office spent a record $36.2 million on legal costs defending its refusal to turn over federal records under the Freedom of Information Act, according to an Associated Press analysis of new U.S. data that also showed poor performance in other categories measuring transparency in government. For a second consecutive year, the Obama administration set a record for times federal employees told citizens, journalists and others that despite searching they couldn’t find a single page of files that were requested. And it set records for outright denial of access to files, refusing to quickly consider requests described as especially newsworthy, and forcing people to pay for records who had asked the government to waive search and copy fees. The government acknowledged when challenged that it had been wrong to initially refuse to turn over all or parts of records in more than one-third of such cases, the highest rate in at least six years. In courtrooms, the number of lawsuits filed by news organizations under the Freedom of Information Act surged during the past four years, led by the New York Times, Center for Public Integrity and The Associated Press, according to a litigation study by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. The AP on Monday settled its 2015 lawsuit against the State Department for files about Hillary Clinton’s time as secretary of state, at AP’s request, and received $150,546 from the department to cover part of its legal fees. The AP has pending lawsuits against the FBI for records about its decision to impersonate an AP journalist during a criminal investigation and about who helped the FBI hack into a mass shooting suspect’s iPhone and how much the government paid to do it. Of the $36.2 million in legal costs fighting such lawsuits last year, the Justice Department accounted for $12 million, the Homeland Security Department for $6.3 million and the Pentagon for $4.8 million. The three departments accounted for more than half the government’s total records requests last year. The figures reflect the final struggles of the Obama administration during the 2016 election to meet President Barack Obama’s pledge that it was “the most transparent administration in history,” despite wide recognition of serious problems coping with requests under the information law. It received a record 788,769 requests for files last year and spent a record $478 million answering them and employed 4,263 full-time FOIA employees across more than 100 federal departments and agencies. That was higher by 142 such employees the previous year. A spokesman for former President Obama did not immediately respond to an email request for comment late Monday. The White House under Obama routinely defended its efforts under the information law in recent years and said federal employees worked diligently on such requests for records. It remains unclear how President Donald Trump’s administration will perform under the Freedom of Information Act or other measures of government transparency. Trump has not spoken extensively about transparency. In his private business and his presidential campaign, Trump required employees and advisers to sign non-disclosure agreements that barred them from discussing their work. His administration has barred some mainstream news organizations from campaign rallies and one White House press briefing. And Trump broke with tradition by refusing to disclose his tax returns. Trump’s secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, is traveling to Asia this week on a small plane without a contingent of journalists or a designated pool reporter who would send reports to the broader diplomatic press corps, departing from 50 years of practice. Overall, in the final year of Obama’s administration, people who asked for records last year under the law received censored files or nothing in 77 percent of requests, about the same as the previous year. In the first full year after Obama’s election, that figure was only 65 percent of cases. The government released the new figures in the days ahead of Sunshine Week, which ends Sunday, when news organizations promote open government and freedom of information. Under the records law, citizens and foreigners can compel the U.S. government to turn over copies of federal records for zero or little cost. Anyone who seeks information through the law is generally supposed to get it unless disclosure would hurt national security, violate personal privacy or expose business secrets or confidential decision-making in certain areas.

From Charleston City Paper: Early last Friday morning, around 7 a.m., officers responded to W.L. Stephens Aquatic Center at 780 West Oak Forest Dr….That morning, an officer found the words “F**k Yall White De**l” written on the front door of a storage shed in black paint…  The following Monday morning, police reported to a nearby residence on Playground Road to find racial slurs painted on the home and profanity written on the owner’s vehicle. Three hours later, police responded to Cynthia Graham Hurd St. Andrews Library in reference to profanity and racial slurs painted on the building and the walkway. In addition to other messages, scrawled across the brick wall at the entrance of the library were the words “GO to H**L Black Women…F**K da Police,” according to an incident report. Authorities have not figured out if the scary incidents — involving painted profanity aimed at Black women, Whites, police officers and the government — are related, reports CNN.

Valerie McDaniel, who runs the Montrose Veterinary Clinic, and Leon Jacob, are being held in the Harris County Jail without bail Keep going for a look back at the most shocking Houston crimes of the last year. Shocking crimes An off-duty Houston police officer allegedly killed another driver around 6:30 a.m. Aug. 12 on Beechnut, near Westmoor, after leaving the Show Palace strip club. James Combs, 33, was accused of being intoxicated when he collided with a Chevrolet Corvette driven by Brian Manring, 36. Lawyer Nathan DeSai, 46, open fire on commuters in September. The Houston man allegedly targeted by his ex-wife and her boyfriend in an extensive murder-for-hire scheme said Wednesday that he is concerned about his ex-wife being free on bail. Marion ""Mack"" McDaniel obtained a protective order last week against his ex-wife, prominent Montrose veterinarian Valerie McDaniel, and her boyfriend, Leon Jacob, both of whom were arrested Friday. Valerie McDaniel, 48, has been released on a $50,000 bond while Jacob remains in the Harris County jail without bail. THE DETAILS: Houston couple hired hitman to kill their exes but got undercover cop instead ""With regard to Dr. McDaniel's release on bond, we are very concerned given she has little to lose at this point,"" said attorney Kyle Sanders in a written statement. ""However, we are confident the courts will continue to take the steps necessary to protect Mr. McDaniel, his daughter and their family."" The McDaniels, who have an 8-year-old daughter, divorced last year. Court records show that the Montrose veterinarian hired divorce attorney, Golda Jacob. A family member told the Chronicle that the divorce attorney introduced McDaniel to her son, Leon Jacob, a 39-year-old failed surgical resident. Golda Jacob has not returned calls for comment. There is no attorney of record on file in Jacob's criminal case. THE CHARGES: Vet, boyfriend charged with hiring hitman head to court Mack McDaniel has been at the center of a media firestorm after allegations surfaced Monday that his ex-wife tried to hire a hitman to kill him while her boyfriend paid to have his ex-girlfriend killed. Prosecutors said the pair was set to pay  $20,000 and two Cartier watches after seeing faked crime scene photos that Mack McDaniel and the ex-girlfriend staged with the Houston Police Department. The hitman was actually an undercover Houston police officer, however, and the couple were charged with solicitation of capital murder, a felony with a maximum punishment of life in prison. On Wednesday, Mack McDaniel said he would not be releasing any other public statement. ""Mr. McDaniel's focus is solely on the emotional well-being and physical safety of his daughter,"" attorney Sanders said. ""He does not intend to speak publicly about the events but he is thankful for the overwhelming support shown to him and his daughter. Brian Rogers covers Houston crime and courts.

Judge Fanon Rucker set his bond at $1.7 million, $100,000 for each shooting victim. • Two men are facing murder charges stemming from Sunday's mass shooting inside Cameo nightclub and Cincinnati Police Chief Eliot Isaac in a late-day news conference Thursday said, ""there will be more arrests to come."" Cornell Beckley, 27, of Westwood, was arrested at a Colerain Township home Thursday afternoon. The second suspect, Deondre Davis, 29, was injured in the shooting and remains hospitalized in critical condition at University of Cincinnati Medical Center. • Authorities on Wednesday released the names of the victims of the Cameo nightclub shooting. Injured were: Rodney Espy, 30, Deondre Davis, 29, Jraejah Warren, 28, Stephen Haley, 28, Rayshunda Higgins, 33, Jarrod Givens, 26, Ronald Lee, 33, Nathan McClendon, 27, Shannon Brown, 25, Jordan Harris, 24, Valor Stanley, 28, Bryant Stevenson, 28, Christopher Harris, 33, Michael Feagins Jr., 30, Khristian Howell, 25 and Regina Madaris, 33. O'Bryan Spikes, 27, was killed. • Three shooting victims were released from University of Cincinnati Medical Center Wednesday. Two more, as of Thursday afternoon, remain in critical condition at the hospital. • Since mid-January 2012, Cincinnati police responded to five reports of assaults, six reports of fights, six reports of shootings,14 disorderly conduct reports, one report of a gun, two reports of wanted individuals and 23 reports of thefts at address of Cameo nightclub. That is out of a total of 647 service calls made to the location in that 5-year period. • Club owner and manager Julian Rodgers announced Tuesday the club would not reopen. • The Ohio Investigative Unit, which handles the law enforcement portion of the liquor licensing process in the state, handed down several violations and citations after touring the club Sunday once it was cleared by police. Violations included the presence of marijuana at the bar. Also, the inspection uncovered mold in some of the beer coolers (and some on bottles) as well as fruit flies and gnats in some of the liquor bottles. • Cameo has voluntarily surrendered a liquor license, Cincinnati City Manager Harry Black told The Enquirer. The license was surrendered to the police department's vice unit. A CPD officer is on his way to Columbus to turn into to the State of Ohio, Black said. • Cincinnati Police Chief Eliot Isaac said during a morning update on the investigation into the shooting that another individual came forward to police Sunday bringing the total to 17 people shot at Cameo nightclub in the East End neighborhood around 1:30 a.m. EST. ""We are confident we will find who is responsible for this,"" Isaac said. • Isaac added during the morning committee meeting at City Hall that he does not believe there is footage of the shooting from within the nightclub. • Isaac's comments on the video surveillance slightly counter comments Rodgers made to WLWT Sunday, in which he said there were 15 to 20 security guards inside the club and camera systems ""in place."" It's unclear if the security cameras missed the shooting or if the footage had not been handed over to authorities yet. • One person confirmed dead, 16 others wounded and taken to five area hospitals. • Isaac identified the deceased victim as O'Bryan Rapheal Spikes, 27. Records indicate Spikes lived in Winton Hills. • Police believe there were multiple shooters. No arrests have been made. • Security at the club would screen patrons before entry, but multiple firearms made it through, police said. Club staff use metal-detecting wands to check customers before they enter the club, police said. • Sherell Johnson, a bystander outside the club, said security was not screening patrons as they entered the club. • “They were literally stepping over victims to get to more critically injured victims,"" Dan Hils, president of the Cincinnati Fraternal Order of Police, said of the first officers at the scene. • UC Health on Monday morning reported no change in the five shooting victims admitted Sunday: two critical, three stable. Seven more people were treated at UCMC for injuries. Four have been released, and three others are spending at least one night in the hospital in stable condition. • Two injured clubgoers were in stable condition at the Christ Hospital, said spokeswoman Kendall Herold. • Two other victims were treated and released at Bethesda North Hospital, said spokesman Joe Kelley. One patient was taken to Mercy Health-Anderson Hospital with a gunshot wound and was treated and released, said spokeswoman Nanette Bentley. She said another person got an injury leaving the scene, not a gunshot, and came to Mercy Health-West Hospital later in the morning. That person also was treated and released. •  An altercation at the club escalated, leading to the shooting, Isaac said. • The violence is not terrorism-related, according to Cincinnati police. • The club's owner, Julian Rodgers, issued a statement Sunday evening expressing condolences to the victims. ""We will do everything in our power to cooperate and make sure the monsters that did this are caught and brought to justice,"" Rodgers said. • The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms recovered an unknown number of firearms at the scene, an agency spokeswoman said. The ATF is running ""emergency traces"" on the origins of the guns. Update: Motive is still unclear but there are no indications this incident is terrorism related. • This is the worst mass shooting in the U.S. this year. A mass shooting is defined by four or more victims, according to the FBI. • There have been 71 mass shootings in U.S. this year, according to Gunviolenceresearch.org. • Since 2013, there have been nine mass shootings in Cincinnati. The previous worst mass shooting in Cincinnati history was Aug. 21, 2015, when two people were killed and five injured at the Elks lodge bar in Madisonville. • A man who was inside Cameo described seeing a ""big brawl"" before hearing at least 20 shots being fired. ""It was a big gun because you heard it over the music,” said Mauricio Thompson of Cleveland. “Everybody scattered to get out."" • Cincinnati City Manager Harry Black said: ""The Cameo club has a history of gun violence including a shooting inside the club on New Year's Day 2015."" • Jeff Ruby, owner of the Cincinnati steakhouses bearing his name, has offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the resolution of the case. • Ohio Gov. John Kasich said he has instructed state officials to offer any assistance to the Cincinnati-area law enforcement. Saddened to learn about last night's shooting in Cincinnati.

Apple will face a tougher crowd in court on Tuesday. Tim Cook told an appreciative crowd in Cupertino, California, on Monday that Apple would stand by its privacy protections in the face of a battle with the FBI. Apple isn't in court yet, but CEO Tim Cook made arguments for security Monday from the company's new-products shindig. Usually these events start with a recitation of cool product features and milestones. This time, Cook kicked things off by saying Apple never planned to face off with the government over its security, but that it isn't going to back down. ""This is an issue that impacts all of us, and we will not shrink from this responsibility,"" Cook said. Apple is fighting the biggest privacy battle of its history, one that could have repercussions for the rest of the technology sector and for consumers in general.  It may even turn into one of the most important legal battles over the future of both digital and US national security. To recap in a nutshell: A February 16 court order requires that Apple build a custom version of its iOS software to help the FBI unlock an iPhone 5C tied to December's San Bernardino, California, mass shooting. Apple has argued that the request is unconstitutional and could undermine security in millions of iPhones. The US Justice Department says Apple is motivated more to protect its brand and will weaken the government's ability to fight criminals and terrorists. On Monday, Cook spoke to a sympathetic crowd of Apple employees, executives and fans. ""I've been humbled and deeply grateful for the outpouring of support we've received from Americans all across the country,"" Cook said. On Tuesday, Apple will face a more critical audience in a Riverside, California, courtroom, where it will argue that it shouldn't be forced to make its phones less secure. Apple has offered encryption by default on its phones and tablets since 2014, meaning no information can be accessed without the device's passcode or a fingerprint. If an iPhone's drive is copied, the encrypted information will be unreadable. Tune back to CNET on Tuesday for full coverage from Riverside. See all the news from Apple's March 21 event.

Meek, 22, faced 27 to 33 months behind bars. Although giving him the minimum sentence, U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel said he hoped the prosecution and sentencing of Meek would deter others from failing to report a serious crime.  Roof and Meek formed a friendship in middle school but drifted apart in their high school years after Roof relocated. But they reconnected on Facebook months before the shooting. The convicted church shooter told Meek about his plan on a night when the two friends used drugs and played video games. Federal prosecutors said Meek lied to the FBI when he denied knowing about Roof’s plot. Meek also stopped a friend from contacting the police after the shooting. Meek ultimately signed a plea deal in which he admitted to his false statements and failing to report the June 2015 mass shooting. He also agreed to help authorities prosecute Roof, who was sentenced to death for killing nine worshipers. Gergel said he could only sentence Meek for failing to report Roof after the shooting. The judge explained that federal law does not permit him to punish Meek for not reporting the plot beforehand. “I’m really, really sorry,” said a tearful Meek at his sentencing, according to the Associated Press. “A lot of beautiful lives were taken.” Meek’s lawyer, Deborah Barbier, said he sent handwritten letters of apology to the families of each victim.

Dad: San Bernardino shooter agreed with ISIL, 'obsessed with Israel' July 16, 2015, Chattanooga, Tenn.:  Four Marines and a sailor were shot and killed at a Navy reserve center by Mohammad Youssef Abdulazeez, 24. He was born in Kuwait but came to the U.S. as an infant and attended Red Bank High School outside Chattanooga and graduated college as an engineer. “There is no doubt he was inspired, motivated by foreign terrorist organization propaganda,” FBI Director James Comey said. Abulazeez was killed by police. Sept. 25, 2014, Moore, Okla.: Alton Nolen, 30 at the time, was charged with first-degree murder for beheading a female co-worker at the Vaughan Foods store where he’d just been suspended. The FBI considered the case workplace violence, but Nolen was also a Muslim convert who posted images of Osama bin Laden and radical Islamic messages on his Facebook page. April-June 2014, Seattle and New Jersey:   Ali Muhammad Brown, a Muslim convert, was charged with four killings in three locations — a man in King County, Washington, on April 27, 2014;  two men as they left a gay nightclub in Seattle on June 1, 2014; and a murder and carjacking on June 25, 2014, in Essex County, N.J., that resulted in an indictment on a state terrorism charge. Brown told investigators that all four slayings were revenge against the U.S. for its “evil acts” at home and military action in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, and that he was motivated by his Muslim faith. Brown was earlier charged in a case of bank fraud between 2002 and 2004 that federal prosecutors said was to support the al-Shabab terrorist group in Somalia. Nov. 5, 2009, Fort Hood, Texas: Gunman at an Army base in Killeen, Texas, who killed 13 people was Army psychiatrist Nidal Hasan, now 46. He was raised in Virginia by parents who were Palestinian immigrants. Hasan was radicalized through the Internet and email exchanges with Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who led al-Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula. Hasan was convicted of murder in a court-martial and is awaiting execution. June 1, 2009, Little Rock: One soldier was killed and another wounded in a drive-by shooting in front of a military recruiting office by Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad, 31, born Carlos Bledsoe inMemphis.  He had converted to Islam and traveled to Yemen, where he said he wanted to join a holy war against the U.S. and Israel. He told investigators he wanted to kill as many U.S. military personnel as possible. Muhammad pleaded guilty in 2011. Source: USA TODAY research "

596630060,2017-03-20 19:06:05,YouTube still needs to actually apologize for (and fix) 'restricted mode',http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Mashable/~3/Styt6PYXnzE/,en,False,,5527,Mashable!,http://mashable.com,"YouTube is no stranger to backlash from its creator community. But one thing it has never been criticized for: Failing to be inclusive. After all, this is the platform home to over 51.1 million ""coming out"" videos and a Sundance Film Festival movie about transgender YouTuber Gigi Gorgeous. Those positive vibes toward the platform may have unraveled in just one weekend. On Friday, many members of YouTube's LGBTQ community turned on the platform after several popular creators pointed out how its ""restricted mode"" hides some of their videos. The video giant offered somewhat of an apology on Monday ... ""for the confusion."" But some creators and their fans -- Team Internet, they call themselves -- are questioning whether the response fits the offense in this case. The consensus: Nothing short of a policy change and a true apology will fix this. ""There is definitely a cognitive dissonance at play,"" YouTube star Tyler Oakley said in an email response. ""The execution of this policy goes against their long history of LGBTQ+ advocacy work."" According to YouTube guidelines, Restricted Mode is an optional feature on YouTube that is off by default. A person familiar with the setting said only a ""small subset of users"" enable it as a way to have ""a more limited experience."" When Restricted Mode is turned on, users can still see videos that explore and cover a variety of LGBTQ topics. There is no account penalty applied to content that is not available in Restricted Mode, and restricted videos can still be monetized. YouTube has been careful about how it presents its content in the past, responding to parental requests. After it first rolled out its YouTube Kids app, the ads ignited backlash from a handful of of children's advocacy groups who filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission in April asking it to investigate whether the app exposes young users to unwanted commercials. Since then, the platform ramped up its efforts to make its app more family friendly. Still, many creators feel restricted mode is YouTube's way of equating LGBTQ content as ""not family friendly."" Big digital influencers ranging from Oakely to unofficial YouTube voice of reason Hank Green, as well as musicians such as Tegan and Sara (whose videos were also affected), spoke up about the policy. The hashtag #YouTubeIsOverParty -- which first surfaced when creators were complaining about ""advertiser-friendly guidelines""  -- trended over the weekend. When asked for comment, a YouTube spokesperson said: “Restricted Mode is an optional feature used by a very small subset of users who want to have a more limited YouTube experience. Videos that contain LGBT topics are available in Restricted Mode, however, some videos that cover subjects like health, politics and sexuality may not appear for users and institutions that choose to use this feature."" The video giant didn't elaborate further on the ""more to come"" tweet from Monday. YouTube has long been an advocate of the LGBTQ community. The platform's very existence has served a great purpose for many LGBTQ people -- especially younger generations -- who have turned to the internet to find themselves. VidCon -- the annual event in June in Anaheim for internet stars and their fans -- had a more somber tone after the June mass shooting at Orlando nightclub Pulse and the death of YouTube musician Christina Grimmie, who was shot and killed at a fan event in Florida. Thousands sported ""Love is love"" wristbands, sold at VidCon to fundraise for Pulse victims. On the final day of the event, VidCon organizers sent out an alert on the event's app announcing that in three days they had raised $5,000 thanks to wristband purchases. That same month, YouTube announced its ""#ProudToBe"" initiative, created to celebrate people throughout the LGBTQ community and around the globe, and the platform disabled comments to avoid spreading hate. “Over the last year at YouTube, we’ve given a lot of thought about what we stand for, and we’ve identified a number of 'Freedoms' that we believe in and want to promote at YouTube,"" YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said at Vidcon.""This includes the Freedom of Expression: that YouTube gives everyone a voice. The Freedom of Information: that YouTube provides information to everyone around the globe. The Freedom of Opportunity: that anyone on YouTube can build a media business and the Freedom to Belong: that everyone can find connection and community.” She weighed in on the restricted-mode policy Monday, reassuring community members that she's ""pushing"" to ""investigate."" I wanted to reemphasize this message to our community. The LGBT community means a lot to YouTube and I'm pushing our teams to investigate. https://t.co/ywyc2sLiHV Sometimes the first cut is the deepest. While YouTube has had a strong relationship with LGBTQ users, fixing its error is going to take a lot more than a social media post. In creating the policy in the first place, the platform has essentially gone against its fundamental democratic motto: ""Broadcast Yourself."" ""I felt their response was a bit disingenuous,"" Oakley said. ""When you mess up, it's simple: don't make excuses, own your mistakes, vow to do better, and immediately do whatever you can to fix the damage you've done. I have yet to see any of that, so to me, nothing has been fixed."" Others like Hannah Hart questioned what YouTube does define as ""sensitive issues."" Some pointed out the hypocrisy in filtering LGBTQ videos but not anti-LGBTQ videos. Gigi Gorgeous -- whose face has been plastered across billboards promoting her new YouTube Red film -- also spoke out about the policy on Monday in a video titled ""#ProudToBeRestricted."" In her video, she said when she turned on restricted mode only her beauty and lifestyle videos show up, ""nothing personal -- none of my videos talking about my gender or sexual orientation."" ""Nobody really knows when it started which is really scary,"" she added. ""At the end of the day it kind of makes us -- the LGBTQ community -- look bad. I know that's not what they are trying to do."" She said it's scary because ""YouTube has always been a place where you can find someone just like you and now given that you can just turn on one button and the entire LGBTQ community can be taken away from you is really really really sad."" Some people on Twitter offered a simple solution: ""Make YouTube Gay Again."" Related Video: ‘Beauty and the Beast’ cast tell us their characters’ musical guilty pleasure More in

If you buy something from an Eater link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics policy. On a cool, cloudy Sunday morning, in the sprawling backyard of a bungalow not far from the Los Angeles River, a monthly event called Queers, Coffee & Donuts was in full swing. An oval patio table was set with a press pot of Counter Culture coffee and a pot of jasmine-coconut tea, carafes of almond milk and half-and-half, and orange juice for BYOB mimosas. A sign on a glass jar suggested that attendees could drop in a donation — $10 to pay for just themselves, or $20 to also cover someone else in need. On paper cups and coffee sleeves appeared a purple, ambiguously gendered winking face, the icon for Cuties: an organization, a newsletter, and soon, a coffee shop. When a new coffee shop opens in LA, press coverage usually focuses on a signature drink, an extremely expensive new piece of gear, or an eye-catching food option (chia pudding! Hot New Bakery’s #croissants!). Often, the design, location, and price point of that coffee shop will suggest an ideal customer: someone who is upper-middle class, versed in coffee, and usually white, straight, cisgender, and male. Maybe the star baristas are white, straight, cisgender, and male too. Maybe the stark white walls and blond wood and marble tables will suggest a $3 million house from a magazine, not a warm, comfortable rec room. Maybe the encyclopedic list of coffees by region will imply that this is a place for those who know, and play by, the rules. While some coffee projects are beginning to set aside these tropes, Cuties Coffee Bar will turn this dynamic wholly on its head. The shop’s co-founders, Virginia Bauman and Iris Bainum-Houle, say that its mission will not be to serve fancy coffee, but to build a queer-centered community space. It’s a move forward, but also backward: Coffee has a long history of fueling unofficial queer spaces, from mid-century coffee shops and diners that hosted gay, lesbian, and trans communities to funky, lived-in ’90s cafes. But as coffee has transformed into an art and a status symbol, and many LGBT people find safety and comfort in a broader array of spaces, this connection has weakened. Bauman, a transgender woman, and Bainum-Houle, who is a queer femme (a queer person who typically presents as feminine) and genderfluid, are inspired by their experiences in the larger queer community. Cuties is geared explicitly toward queer people and their allies, not coffee nerds — on the website and Indiegogo page, there’s nary a mention of barista championships or pour-over techniques. Instead, there are links to a queer events newsletter, the coffee shop fundraiser, and a nascent housing service. Just as Cuties is unique in the coffee world, it’s also a standout in the queer social ecosystem. Very few businesses, outside of the thinning ranks of gay bars and downright endangered LGBT bookstores, label themselves as queer-centric. There are coffee shops with gay or queer owners, and often they tend to draw a similar clientele — there have been a handful of times I’ve walked into a random coffee shop and discovered, to my delight, that it was full of queer people like me. But finding those places usually requires either in-group knowledge (Urth Caffé in West Hollywood helped inspire the cafe in The L Word, The Planet) or just plain serendipity. Cuties Coffee Bar will open this spring in East Hollywood, a diverse neighborhood home to Little Armenia, Thai Town, a large working-class Latino community, and a growing number of people priced out of nearby synecdoche-for-hipsterdom Silver Lake. The space, at Melrose and Heliotrope, was previously a coffee shop, and the co-founders have enough money to clean up the space and build a new bar, but they are currently trying to raise $50,000 on Indiegogo to update the interior in a more drastic manner. (The shop will open even if they don’t make their fundraising goal, if in a more bare-bones setting.) Bainum-Houle said that the process involves a lot of strategizing, “What can we do with paint? What can we do with fixtures that'll make the space a little bit more pretty and fun for people to go into?” Instead of the masculine-tinged minimalism that has become the default dress for a speciality coffee shop, the aesthetic will reflect Bainum-Houle’s and Bauman’s femme identities. Bainum-Houle, whose background is in the art world, is designing the space to recall the Art Deco 1920s and the 1970s, in part because they were two great eras in American queer life. At first glance, Cuties Coffee Bar is simply operating outside of the norms of the fancy coffee world. But Bauman is in fact very much part of it: She co-founded Tonx, the coffee subscription service later acquired by Blue Bottle, where she remained as director of digital product for a year after the acquisition. She left in 2015, partly to start Cuties, and partly because she found the tech world isolating. Cuties will have good coffee, Bauman promises, but it will not fetishize perfect product, or perfect taste. “Our barista isn’t going to read you for your drink choice,” Bainum-Houle said. In the backyard, Bauman cooked up big, fluffy doughnuts in a large stainless steel pot of oil set up over an outdoor stove. Along with coffee, the doughnuts accompanied guests as they flowed between small, ever-morphing groups. Some folks doodled with rainbow-hued colored pencils at the crafts table, while others settled around a fire pit ringed by couches and folding beach chairs. Still more clustered under a blue tarp as low clouds threatened rain. There were too many people for it to feel like a house party, but it was also a far cry from the scene at many gay bars, where patrons tend to arrive — and cluster — with friends they already know, or focus on pursuing romantic partners. “Cliques will form,” observed Leslie Foster, a filmmaker and longtime Queers, Coffee & Donuts attendee, but then Bauman and Bainum-Houle “come in and introduce people, quietly and subtly.” The emphasis on making connections embodies the larger Cuties mission: to center people across the entire spectrum of queer and trans identities, welcome their allies, and offer no agenda beyond what Bainum-Houle describes as “bringing people together and providing them a casual, friendly atmosphere where they could feel safe and welcomed.” Much of LA’s queer world is built around nightlife — which isn’t for everyone — or organizations serving a necessary but narrow purpose. It can be easier to find, say, a lesbian-only weekly workshop on radical self-care than a casual gathering place where queer people can make friends, flirt, or just comfortably and fully exist. Welcoming as many people as possible, including straight allies, can also be a powerful antidote to the closet, Bainum-Houle said. “Someone might not identify as queer or trans today, but there are so many stories of people being exposed to [queer culture] and realizing, Oh, that resonates with me.” The idea for Cuties was born in 2015, and originally the co-founders planned to take their search for a space slowly. Two events created a sense of urgency: the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, which killed 49 people, most of them queer and Latino, and the election of Donald Trump, who ran on a platform hostile to most marginalized people in America and whose administration has already begun to curtail the expansion of LGBT rights and protections that occurred during the Obama presidency. Bainum-Houle said that those twin shocks “sorted out our priorities real quick.” The focus shifted from opening a coffee shop with a food menu and a traditional build-out, to just making it exist. Bauman said, “Now we're just like, Let's open the doors in any way possible.” The need for queer-centered spaces is not abstract: Queer people are at higher risk for everything from workplace harassment to suicide in America. Trans and gender-nonconforming people are especially vulnerable, even more so if they are also nonwhite. The deep sense of community forming around Cuties is a response to that, both directly and indirectly. After gathering the pop-up’s guests in order to announce the latest updates to the Cuties Indiegogo campaign, Bainum-Houle invited the group to bid farewell to a longtime regular who was leaving Los Angeles to spend time “in the woods.” The whole group applauded. At Queers, Coffee & Donuts, several attendees told me that they hungered for the coffee shop, and the regular gathering space it would provide; already they wished Queers, Coffee & Donuts happened more often than once a month. Jude Vigants, a musician, said that he would come to Cuties Coffee Bar at least once a week. At the event, he was supported by another guest’s willingness to pay $20 instead of $10, a practice the coffee shop will continue in some form: The current plan is to offer more financially secure customers the option to buy a coffee for themselves and another “for the queue,” as Bainum-Houle describes it, building up an open tab to ensure people who cannot afford the $2 or $3 for a cup can still visit Cuties. This model embodies what Bauman describes as the shop’s mission to be “a capitalistic mechanism for taking money and distributing it to queer people, that is owned and held accountable by queers.” Both co-founders say that the work, challenging as it may be, is utterly fulfilling. For Bainum-Houle, it’s an opportunity to put years of art and events experience into the creation of a lasting community. For Bauman, moving from the dry, disembodied tech side of the coffee world to founding a small, queer-oriented business was a very conscious decision, sparked when she realized how disconnected she’d become from the city around her. Now, her desire to provide a model for queer and trans self-sufficiency is more powerful than ever. “I don't want to be uprootable,” she said. “I think that digging into the foundation of wherever you are is super important right now.” As it moved into the afternoon, the rain started in earnest. The swelling numbers of guests packed into the house, or huddled under overhangs, umbrellas, and tarps. No one complained about the rain, and conversations were as lively as ever. The one casualty was the deep fryer, and therefore, it seemed, the doughnuts. But then Bauman invited Josh Sugiyama, a photographer, to hold a large umbrella over the fryer while she worked. Bauman’s carefully prepared dough — made using a friend’s recipe, which calls for mashed potatoes and three rises — browned beautifully in the ghee. When the doughnuts came out, they were steaming hot and snatched up by guests, perfect warm treats in the cold rain. “I had thought we couldn’t have more doughnuts,” Bauman mused, looking over at Sugiyama, “but all I needed was for you to hold the umbrella.” Meghan McCarron is a senior editor at Eater.Maddie Chaffer is an illustrator based in Los Angeles.Copy edited by Rachel P.

Hacking, How Vulnerable Is Your Smartphone?",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/technology/cia-hacking-documents-wikileaks-iphones-tvs.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news,en,False,,1,New York Times,http://nytimes.com,"Advertisement Supported by By Steve Lohr and Katie Benner WikiLeaks on Tuesday released a significant cache of documents that it said came from a high-security network inside the Central Intelligence Agency. WikiLeaks called the documents Vault 7, and they lay out the capabilities of the agency’s global covert hacking program. What is the C.I.A. program? By the end of 2016, the C.I.A. program had 5,000 registered users, including government employees and contractors. And they had produced more than a thousand hacking systems. The agency’s arsenal, the documents indicate, included an array of malware ranging from viruses to clandestine “zero day” vulnerabilities in the software of major companies. The files have circulated among former United States government hackers and contractors in “an unauthorized manner, one of whom provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive,” WikiLeaks said. WikiLeaks said it was publishing the documents while redacting and anonymizing some passages, including the names of “tens of thousands” of C.I.A. targets. WikiLeaks said it was not distributing “armed cyberweapons.” How vulnerable is my smartphone? The software targeted by the hacking program included the most popular smartphone operating systems: Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android. The C.I.A. hacking initiative had a “mobile devices branch,” which developed an array of attacks on popular smartphones to infect and extract data, including a user’s location, audio and text messages, and to covertly activate a phone’s camera and microphone. Apple’s iPhone software, according to the documents, was a particular target, including the development of several “zero day” exploits — a term for attacking coding flaws the company would not have known about. Though Apple has only 15 percent of the global smartphone market, the intensive C.I.A. effort was probably explained by the “popularity of the iPhone among social, political, diplomatic and business elites.” Finding these vulnerabilities could in theory allow the spy agency to circumvent the kinds of security that stymied investigators who wanted to gain access to the password-protected iPhone of one of the attackers in the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. Google’s Android, the most widely used smartphone operating system, seemed to have received even more attention. By 2016, the C.I.A. had 24 weaponized Android “zero day” software programs. Did the C.I.A. directly target encryption software? The C.I.A. focused on smartphone operating systems in large part to intercept messages before they could be encrypted, according to the WikiLeaks documents. So by targeting the phone’s underlying software, the C.I.A. was looking to bypass the encryption of WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Weibo and other smartphone communications applications. They did not appear to find a way into the apps themselves. Were other kinds of devices targeted? The C.I.A. also targeted Microsoft’s Windows personal computer software, other internet-connected computers, and home and industrial devices running the Linux operating system, according to the documents. There was a specific program to penetrate and take control of Samsung smart TVs. The program, code-named Weeping Angel, was intended to convert new digital televisions into “covert microphones.” The malware was developed in cooperation with the British spy agency MI5, according to the documents. The Weeping Angel program puts the target TV in a “fake off” mode, according to the WikiLeaks documents. Then, with the owner believing the TV is turned off, the set works as a clandestine recording device, picking up conversations in the room and sending them over the internet to a C.I.A. server computer. And in October 2014, according to the documents, the C.I.A. was exploring technology to penetrate the vehicle control systems of cars. The documents do not detail the goal of the vehicle hacking program, but WikiLeaks speculated that it would “permit the C.I.A. to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations.” Has encryption software changed how the C.I.A. behaves? The leaked documents indicate that the broad use of encryption has pushed the C.I.A. to become one of the world’s foremost creators — and buyers — of malware. Much of the cache released by WikiLeaks appears to show how the agency has created or acquired a variety of tools to thwart tough encryption or intercept messages before encryption tools make them useless to the intelligence agency. What is new about the C.I.A. program? Using malware to hack into devices ranging from smartphones to webcams has been going on for years. Sometimes the intent is to steal information — like names, addresses and credit-card numbers for identity theft and fraud. Sometimes the goal seems to be to create havoc. Last year, for example, household and commercial webcams and router computers were taken over and used as launching pads to create so-called denial-of-service attacks that clogged portions of the internet and interrupted service for hours for people in parts of the United States. But the C.I.A. program seems to have been particularly sophisticated, far-reaching and focused on surveillance. Just how innovative the individual software techniques were will not be known until independent computer security experts and scientists at the companies whose software was probed can examine the malware and tactics involved. What time period is covered by the documents? WikiLeaks says the document dump will cover 2013 to 2016. The organization says this is the largest publication of intelligence documents in history. If the documents are accurate, did the C.I.A. violate commitments made by President Barack Obama? In 2010, the Obama administration promised to disclose newly discovered vulnerabilities to companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft. But the WikiLeaks documents indicate that the agency found security flaws, kept them secret and then used them for surveillance and intelligence gathering. Why is it so hard to keep these cyberweapons under wraps? Unlike nuclear weapons, which can be guarded and protected, cyberweapons are “just computer programs which can be pirated like any other,” WikiLeaks notes. “Since they are entirely comprised of information they can be copied quickly with no marginal cost.” There is a growing black market dedicated to trading these weapons, and government agencies from around the world will pay well for their discovery.

They are persistent if nothing else. The group has been the primary sponsor and supporter of a group of families who lost loved ones during the Newtown mass shooting and have been attempting (with zero success) to sue the manufacturer of one of the firearms used in the crime since 2014. Remington Arms (the parent company of Bushmaster) prevailed in that suit and then again when their appeal was denied. The judge correctly determined that the suit flew directly in the face of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) and was essentially without merit. But some people can’t seem to take no for an answer and now the group is trying to get the state supreme court to resurrect the suit once again. (Associated Press) Gun control advocates are asking the Connecticut Supreme Court for permission to argue against a judge’s decision last year to dismiss a wrongful-death lawsuit against the maker of the rifle used in the 2012 Newtown school shooting, saying the ruling would set a bad precedent… A survivor of the attack and the families of nine killed are appealing that ruling to the state Supreme Court in a case that centers on the few exceptions to the federal law. The suit seeks to hold Remington accountable for selling what their lawyers call a semi-automatic rifle that is too dangerous for the public because it was designed as a military killing machine. Gun control advocates recently asked the high court for permission to file briefs in the case, hoping to persuade the justices to reverse a potentially precedent-setting decision that could be used by gun makers to fend off lawsuits filed under the exceptions to the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. I always feel bad having to call out the plaintiffs in this case after all they’ve been through, but their attorneys, along with their friends on the Brady Campaign are leading them down an unproductive and ultimately disappointing path. They are also keeping wounds open which should have been allowed to begin healing by now and scraping everyone’s nerves raw. And to what purpose? Why drag them through all of this yet again when their “new” argument is precisely the same as the one which was already rejected? The attorneys are claiming that the previous ruling “sets a bad precedent” but it’s fairly obvious that the only thing “bad” about it is that they lost and didn’t get to cash in on some huge legal fees on Remington’s dime. This weapons of war argument they keep trying to make is a complete dud and fails even the most basic test of common sense. The military doesn’t actually use the weapon they are suing over, in part because it’s a fairly underpowered model, but also because it doesn’t have the full automatic capability and better firepower of the far superior models which our military actually does use. Every weapon is potentially a “weapon of war” if the soldier in question is desperate enough, including rocks and spears. That’s really not the issue behind the PLCAA at all. The question to be asked is if the weapon was properly functioning when sold and if it had all of the required safety features. If it does, then what a criminal or madman (both in this case) does with it is the responsibility of the shooter, not the manufacturer. I’m not sure if the plaintiffs have been made aware of it or not, but this isn’t some inaccurate reading of the PLCAA because the law was put in place precisely to stop people from doing what they are attempting. Will they be able to get the state supreme court to take a fresh look at this? I’d hope not, because the precedent clearly seems to have been set and fully explained in the lower courts. But this is Connecticut, after all, so you never know. There may be more chapters left to write in this sad and increasingly pathetic tale.  Copyright ©2021 HotAir.com/Salem Media.

                    PBS NewsHour Leave your feedback Soon after the Republican health care bill was pulled on Friday before any vote could take place, President Trump indicated he would shift focus to tax reform. But how will that process begin, and what challenges lie ahead? Wall Street Journal reporter Nick Timiraos joins Hari Sreenivasan from Washington, D.C., to discuss what comes next. HARI SREENIVASAN, PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND ANCHOR: Yesterday afternoon, soon after the Republican healthcare bill was pulled before any vote took place, President Trump indicated that the focus will now shift to reforming the tax code.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin echoed that sentiment at an event earlier in the day, saying he would push for comprehensive tax reform for individuals and corporations before the congressional recess in August.  Mnuchin said that the president wants a tax cut for the middle class, not the top 1 percent. Just how that process will begin and how complicated it will become are open questions. Joining us from Washington, D.C., to discuss what lies ahead for tax reform is Nick Timiraos of ""The Wall Street Journal."" So, Secretary Mnuchin says, it is easier than reforming health care to reform the tax code? NICK TIMIRAOS, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes, that's — that's what he said.  And, you know, there's an argument that he made which was along the lines of, look, taxes are something the Republicans are on the same page on.  Everybody is going to want lower taxes.  It's a visceral thing for Republicans. I think the challenge here is that the health care debacle has reminded everybody that the details do matter, right, because Republicans for years took vote after vote on repealing Obamacare.  It was something everybody said they wanted to do, just the same as all Republicans say we want to lower taxes, we want to lower the corporate tax rate, to make investment and U.S. businesses more competitive. The problem is going to be the same.  The details matter.  And we don't have a lot of details yet from the administration. So, you know, the ball is kind of on the tee for them here to swing away and propose something, but we don't yet really know exactly what they want.  And once you put those details out there, you give people, you know, a target to start shooting at. SREENIVASAN: One of the proposals we've heard repeatedly from Republicans is to lower the corporate tax rate from, say, 35 percent to 20 percent.  But that comes with its own consequences. TIMIRAOS: Right.  You lose a lot of revenue.  And Republicans are talking about doing this using the same kind of procedural vehicle legislatively that would allow them to bypass the 60-vote threshold in the Senate so that they can do this on a party line vote.  But that procedural hurdle carries its own kind of complicated set of rules, including you can't add to deficits beyond 10 years. SREENIVASAN: Does it get harder to do this after health care? TIMIRAOS: Well, Speaker Ryan said that on Friday.  He said that this does get harder because there were certain taxes in Obamacare that they were going to repeal.  They're not going to repeal those now. I think it adds to the urgency here.  There will be a greater impetus because Republicans are going to want to show they can get something done.  And President Trump is going to want to have a bill to sign. I think the other question is — you know, you were talking about tax reform.  There is a difference between tax reform and tax cuts.  And you hear the president a lot talk about how he just wants to cut heck out of taxes.  He wants a big tax cut.  That is different. And so, you know, it could be that the administration decides, look, we're just going to try to cut taxes here.  We'll deal with the deficits later.  You know, we'll propose maybe growth estimates that show that the deficits won't matter as much because we're going to grow the economy more. But that's another area where you're not quite sure yet if Republicans are all on the same page. SREENIVASAN: All right.  Nick Timiraos of the ""Wall Street Journal"" joining us from D.C. — thanks so much. TIMIRAOS: Thanks for having me. Watch the Full Episode Mar 25 By PBS NewsHour Mar 25 By PBS NewsHour PBS NewsHour

590470878,2017-03-07 06:00:12,One Small Town's Plan to Prevent Another Mass Shooting,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/motherjones/main/~3/0Q9q2Srr29s/mass-shooting-hesston-kansas-threat-assessment,en,False,,1112,Mother Jones,http://www.motherjones.com/,"Mark FollmanMarch 7, 2017 Travis Heying/The Wichita Eagle/AP  On a breezy, unusually warm morning in late October, about 60 cops, mental health counselors, pastors, and business leaders are gathered inside a community center in Newton, Kansas for an intensive training. They sit mostly stone-faced around folding tables with coffee and pastries as Dr. Russell Palarea launches into a close analysis of the 1999 cult comedy Office Space. He explains why the behavior of Milton Waddams—a memorably pathetic cubicle dweller who suffers multiple indignities at the hands of his coworkers—holds the key to preventing a mass shooting. Palarea cues a series of clips that show Milton muttering under his breath about a prized red Swingline stapler taken from him by his bullying boss. As the film progresses, Milton’s socially awkward affect begins to turn more hostile. Eventually, he slinks into the boss’s office to repossess the stapler. Palarea pauses the video to underscore the telling escalation: “He’s taken matters into his own hands. He’s moved from idea to action.” By the final clip, Milton has burned down the office building and decamped to a beach resort in Mexico, where he mumbles about slipping strychnine into the guacamole. The dark comedy cracks a couple of smiles, serving both as an icebreaker and an initial lesson on the behavioral warning signs of an attack—an obsessive grievance, oblique threats about killing. Palarea, a forensic psychologist based in Washington, D.C., is a leading practitioner of threat assessment, an emerging field in which mental health and law enforcement experts work together to identify and deter individuals who may be poised to commit violent attacks. At his invitation, I’d come to this rural, heavily Mennonite region about 30 miles north of Wichita to observe him train an unprecedented group: Virtually every person in the room was connected to the events of February 25, 2016, when a disturbed employee at the lawnmower plant in nearby Hesston went on a rampage, killing three people and wounding 14 others.  In today’s era of active-shooter drills, leaders here in Harvey County didn’t want to focus just on how to respond in the event of another attack; they wanted to understand what led to the rampage and do what they could to ensure that another one, however unlikely, wouldn’t occur. They had learned about Palarea’s work after reading a 2015 story I wrote about an innovative strategy to prevent mass shootings and flew him in to teach them the fundamentals of threat assessment. Palarea has been in the threat assessment field for more than two decades, consulting with teams for the military, federal agencies, colleges, and corporations. When working in these various settings, he told me, he’s always emphasized the same theme: “You need to worry about this happening here.” But the theme in Harvey County was new: “Let’s heal from this and make sure it doesn’t happen again.”  I’d also come to Kansas to gain a deeper sense of the impact from the mass shooting, long after the news cameras were gone and the rest of America had moved on. Though the experience was still raw for many at the training, participants also expressed a sense of empowerment, in part because threat assessment defies the conventional wisdom that nothing can really be done to prevent mass shootings. “As a clinician, when you are confronted with the fact that there might be harm or danger, it’s isolating,” Karla Roth, a mental health counselor, told me. “To know that you can work together and not be alone in it—that’s hopeful.” Roth was among a small team from Prairie View Hospital in Newton that had rushed to Hesston to help in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. Initially, she didn’t know the status of her husband and son-in-law, who both worked inside the Excel facility. “It was horror. Then when I found out that they were OK, I just had to help,” she said. “This is a peaceful, quiet, want-to-live-in place. To have it happen here is something no one would have ever thought.” As the sun began to sink across the hayfields, Harvey County Sheriff Townsend “T.” Walton took me for a ride in his cruiser. He retraced a chaotic path that started around 5 p.m. that day. A burst of calls had come over the radio in the span of just a few minutes—one, two, and then three shootings. Gun violence had been relatively rare in Walton’s three decades of law enforcement in the region—and never anything like what he was hearing now. “In my head I’m going, ‘Is this terrorism?'” he recalled. It was just two months after the massacre in San Bernardino, California. “I’m not thinking, ‘This is a guy who just got served a protection-from-abuse letter and he’s flipped out.'”  Thirty-eight-year-old Cedric Ford was a recent transplant to Newton who worked the paint line at Excel. He had a criminal record in Florida and had come to the attention of local authorities for beating up his girlfriend. About three hours before the attack, “everything was totally normal” and Ford seemed “happy as all could be,” remarked a coworker who’d chatted with him in the Excel parking lot. Soon afterwards, sheriff’s deputies showed up at Excel to serve Ford with a protection order obtained by his girlfriend, apparently triggering his plan to go on a killing spree. Ford drove home, binged on meth and booze, and got back into his car with an AK-47 assault rifle and Glock handgun. Walton slowed down just past the intersection of 12th Street and Meridian, where he’d reached Ford’s first victims. Paramedics were rushing a middle-aged man with a blood-soaked shoulder out of a pickup truck strafed with bullet holes. The man’s two grandchildren cowering in the rear of the cab were, amazingly, unharmed. Just up the road, Ford had slammed his car to a halt in the road in front of his next victim, a 74-year-old woman who refused his demand to relinquish her vehicle. Miraculously, she also survived unscathed, ducking into the passenger seat as Ford fired through the driver’s side window. Ford succeeded in taking a truck from his third victim; the young man he shot in the leg along Old Highway 81 likely would have died if a sheriff’s deputy hadn’t arrived moments later with a tourniquet. (It is unclear why Ford went on the carjacking spree. His mental state was impaired and volatile, but he also may have been having trouble with his car.)  Walton was handling triage near 12th and Meridian when the radio erupted again: There was an active shooter inside Excel. Emergency dispatchers were quickly overwhelmed with nearly 50 calls from the plant. Walton immediately contacted his chief deputy: “Get ahold of everybody we have and send them to Hesston.” As police vehicles and ambulances screamed toward the town, Hesston police chief Doug Schroeder had already reached Excel and found pandemonium. The large glass doors at the front of the plant had been shot out. Scores of employees were fleeing across the parking lots, some helping wounded coworkers. Schroeder didn’t know who was shooting inside the mammoth facility, or where. But like most law enforcement leaders trained in the post-Columbine era, he knew he could not hesitate: An active shooter fires an average of every four seconds. And hundreds of people were still inside the building. Schroeder entered through a side door, his Colt AR-15 rifle in hand. He saw blood trails on the floor both to the left and the right. It was quiet. He went right, toward the main entrance, and began to hear gunfire. He moved through several more hallways to an office area, where he encountered a frightened employee. As they began to speak, the glass window in the door next to them shattered. Ford was just on the other side. “I’m going to get you,” Schroeder recalled him saying. The terrified employee bolted as the barrel of Ford’s rifle poked through the doorway. Ford came through the door and chased after the employee, unaware that Schroeder was just behind him. Schroeder took aim with his rifle and fired four shots. As Ford spun and went down, he raised his pistol and fired at Schroeder. He missed. “I saw the shell casings being ejected from the handgun, but I didn’t hear the shots,” Schroeder recalled. Many employees were hiding in nearby offices and Ford was carrying plenty more ammo when he was killed. There is no way to know how many lives were saved by the 41-year-old police chief, who waved off a flurry of praise and said he didn’t want his service to be defined by this one tragic event. “He’s a humble man,” Walton remarked as we pulled out of the Excel parking lot. “But he was a hero to me, and without a doubt to the hundreds that got to go home that night.” Excel employs about a thousand people, and many in this sparsely populated region are connected to someone who works at the plant. I visited Subrina Luke, a big-hearted woman with a wide smile, at her small apartment near the Wichita airport. She recalled how she was feeling grumpy when her fiancée Josh Higbee dropped her off at her job that morning: She was short on sleep and had forgotten her usual morning beverage, and she’d closed the car door without even saying goodbye. She was surprised when Higbee walked into the LensCrafters where she worked about 15 minutes later. “What are you doing here?” “Just bringing you a drink.” “You didn’t have to do that,” she said, cracking a grin. “Yes I did, woman. You would have been calling me for one.”  He kissed her goodbye. They’d been together for almost two years, sharing an apartment and raising Higbee’s spry four-year-old son from a prior relationship, who called Luke his mommy. A few hours later, the 31-year-old Higbee headed up the road to Excel. He mostly disliked his job as a welder on the second shift but was glad to be pulling in $23-plus an hour for his family. The first call came from their four-year-old’s babysitter, whose boyfriend also worked at Excel. “There was a shooting at the job,” she said. Luke’s heart dropped, but the babysitter knew no details and Luke wouldn’t be able to reach Higbee during his shift. She tried to focus on helping her customers. Her phone kept buzzing. During a break, she answered a call from one of Higbee’s coworkers. “I’m sorry,” the woman told her, “but Josh is gone.”  “I think I screamed so loud everyone in the mall heard me,” Luke recalled, fighting through tears as we sat in her living room, sunlight jagging through the window blinds. Higbee’s son, now five, was playing in the bedroom with a pastor who’d been helping Luke and the boy through the recovery process. The youngster seemed to be doing remarkably well, bounding over to me to show off a favorite toy and hugging Luke affectionately before going off to play while we talked. Luke reflected on being robbed of her partner, and the boy of his father. “He’s not going to get to see him graduate high school, he’s not going to even get to see him on his first day of school,” she said. “That’s what hurts the most, is what his dad is going to miss and what he’s going to miss.” She recalled when the boy grasped that Higbee wasn’t coming home again. “When you have a five-year-old break down and cry that he misses his dad, that is the most heartbreaking thing you can ever experience,” she said. “I picked him up and I said, ‘I miss him too, and I’m here for you when you need me.'” Luke struggled to recount her experience but said she was compelled to share it. People needed to know about who gets left behind and what they face, she said. “They should have psychological evaluations on everyone that owns a gun,” she continued. “I know that sounds crazy, but they have a way of telling people who are sane and not sane by things that they say. Not everyone should have a gun.” Why did the shooter do it? And could he have been stopped? Those twin questions haunt the survivors of every mass shooting, and they are always difficult to answer. Several hours into the threat assessment training, Palarea asked the community leaders whether they were comfortable discussing their own recent case. He’d confided to me over dinner the night before that he wasn’t sure he should even go there, given how fresh the attack still was. And there likely wouldn’t be any satisfying answers to those core questions. Nonetheless, the group agreed to proceed. The discussion was brief and somewhat circumspect (and not for public disclosure), but it underscored behaviors and circumstances to watch out for—domestic violence, drug abuse, menacing comments—and how to communicate more effectively among local agencies and institutions about individuals of concern. With the encouragement of event organizers, Palarea also decided that he would not leave out his most graphic training material. Ford’s attack was the latest in a long history of similar workplace violence. Palarea gave an in-depth analysis of a 1988 case in Sunnyvale, California, where Richard Farley went on a rampage at the technology company ESL Incorporated, killing seven coworkers and wounding four others. One of the survivors, Laura Black, had rejected Farley’s romantic advances; after he continued harassing her and turned abusive, ESL fired him. This was another case where a restraining order appeared to have triggered the plan for an attack: The day before the order obtained by Black was to go into permanent effect, Farley struck. Palarea highlighted how ESL’s termination of Farley had obviously turned out to be an inadequate solution to the threat—and may have worsened it. He showed a clip of an interview conducted with Farley after he was taken into custody. Once ESL had fired him, Farley stated coldly to investigators, “They lost control of me.” Punitive measures may well be necessary in response to aberrant behavior, Palarea explained, but understanding and dealing with the root grievance remains crucial.  A few months before the rampage at Excel, Ford had posted a video on Facebook: The footage showed him standing at the side of a road, firing dozens of rounds from an AK-47 into an empty field. Was it just a guy harmlessly blowing off some steam, or something more ominous? Perhaps a threat assessment team could have gained insight into Ford’s mental state and motivations. “It’s a matter of the community keeping eyes and ears open for concerns,” Palarea explains, “and reporting those concerns to authorities, whether school administrators, workplace threat assessment teams, or the police.” Once a tip comes in, a local threat assessment team scrutinizes the subject’s behavior and circumstances for signs that person could be contemplating an attack. Indicators can include the acquisition of weapons, surveillance of a target, or communicating threats about intended victims, whether directly or indirectly (as is more commonly the case). “Once we get a heads up, we can intervene,” says Palarea. “We can get the person mental health treatment if it’s appropriate. We can help the person resolve conflict in a positive way instead of using violence as a solution to the problem. We can get the people the help they need, to prevent these things from happening.”  Misty Elder-Serene, a director at Prairie View Hospital who arranged the training, told me that the community’s interest in threat assessment stemmed in part from its social ethics: Though rural Kansas is gun country, the heavily Mennonite region is also marked by a culture of pacifism and commitment to social justice, she said. Those crosscurrents prompted some interesting conversations after the mass shooting—not so much a debate about gun violence as a discussion about “how can we heal, and how can we be safe.” The concept of threat assessment resonated with its imperative to better understand and manage people who could turn dangerous. “It’s easy to just divide it into, ‘Oh well, it’s a gun problem’ or ‘It’s a mental health problem,'” remarked Dr. Mary Carman, a VP of psychological services at Prairie View. “It’s not. It is 12 problems, at least, that have to be addressed.” Some in the community expressed a striking degree of compassion for the killer. At a church in Hesston on the Sunday evening after the attack, the service included four candles: three for those murdered, and a fourth for Ford. One person who was wounded, speaking to a reporter from his hospital bed, talked about seeing the look in Ford’s eyes and understanding how much pain he was in. Several leaders at the training expressed the hope that their response to the tragedy might serve as a model for other communities upended by mass shootings. Carman, who has worked in mental health for more than three decades, noted that Prairie View Hospital was founded by World War II-era conscientious objectors who’d served in so-called insane asylums, where people with mental health issues were often treated brutally. The hospital’s founders felt there had to be a more humane and effective way to deal with disruptive, troubled people. “I think that passion still permeates the [local] culture,” Carman told me. Ford’s attack was shocking, “but we can do something. We can learn more about it. We can help teach others. Some of this can be prevented. Let’s not just sit here and do nothing.”  Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

702296457,2017-03-31 17:09:28,Meet The Man Leading The NRA's Push For Guns In Schools,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/meet-the-man-leading-the-nra-s-push-for-guns-in-schools,en,False,,113,Talking Points Memo,http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com,"At the National Rifle Association’s press conference on Friday, the group’s Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre called on Congress to “immediately” put armed police officers in every school, and rejected any suggestion that the nation’s gun laws needed to change in the wake of last Friday’s mass shooting in Newtown, Conn. At the end of his defiant remarks, LaPierre also announced the NRA’s plan to develop a National School Shield Emergency Response Program, a “multifaceted” education and training program “available to every school in America free of charge.” LaPierre said the NRA had selected former Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-AR) to lead the effort, and serve as its national director. “School safety is a complex issue with no simple, single solution,” Asa said in his brief remarks. “But I believe trained, qualified, armed security is one key component among many that can provide the first line of deterrence as well as the last line of defense.” Hutchinson is a former U.S. Attorney, chairman of the Arkansas Republican Party, and congressman from Arkansas. In 2001, after being elected to his third term in Congress, President George W. Bush appointed Hutchinson to be the administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration. In 2003, Hutchinson was tapped to become the first under secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. By 2005, he was out of government, joining Venable, the D.C. law firm, as a senior trial counsel and a partner within firm’s litigation division. Since then, he’s formed a consulting business, Hutchinson Group, and a law firm, The Asa Hutchinson Law Group, which is based in Arkansas but maintains a D.C. office. Among Hutchinson clients, past and present, listed on the Hutchinson Group’s website are Xe Services, the private security company previously known as Blackwater and now known as Academi. It also lists Science Applications International Corporation, or SAIC, a major federal contractor and a company which in March agreed to pay New York City $500 million for its role in a project that U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara called “corrupted to its core by one of the largest and most brazen frauds ever committed against the City of New York.” Hutchinson has long been supported by, and a supporter of, the NRA and other gun groups. During an unsuccessful run for Senate in 1986 against Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-AR), Hutchinson was endorsed by the Gun Owners of America of Washington, which called him a “staunch supporter of the right to keep and bear arms.” According to the Sunlight Foundation, Hutchinson received more than $30,000 in contributions from the gun lobby during his years running for state and federal office. During a brief period in which he was registered as a lobbyist, in 2007, one of Hutchinson’s clients was Point Blank Body Armor, which bills itself as “the world’s leading manufacturer of body armor.” During Friday’s press conference, LaPierre argued that there would be time “for talk and debate later.” “This is the time, this is the day for decisive action,” LaPierre said. In a very different setting, a at a hearing on gun control legislation in May 1999, Hutchinson, then still in Congress, made a different argument. “One of the reasons I came to Congress, like others, was to address serious national problems,” Hutchinson said, according to a transcript. “The problem of teen violence certainly fits within this category. It is right that this Congress take action reasonably calculated to reduce juvenile violence, increase school safety and to encourage restraint by those who expose our youth to a culture of death and destruction. The question is: How do we do this? First of all, I think it’s important that we recognize that the ready answer is not usually the right answer; that the quick fix leads to quicksand rather than to a solid foundation.” Contempt proceedings against Stephen Bannon will begin on Tuesday, the House Jan. 6 Committee announced. Jeffrey Bossert Clark, the former Trump DOJ official who sought to use the power of the federal government to block… It was getting late in the day on Sunday, Jan. 3 in the Oval Office."
684565722,2017-03-23 08:00:00,Trump Co-Chair Paid for Kids’ School With Campaign Cash,http://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-co-chair-paid-for-kids-school-with-campaign-cash,en,False,,1707,Daily Beast,http://www.thedailybeast.com/,"SEARCH Candidates aren’t allowed to spend campaign funds to pay for their lifestyle—which, Duncan Hunter found out, includes videogames and private-school tuition. Donald Trump’s point man in the House of Representatives improperly used campaign funds on videogames and his children’s private Christian school, according to Federal Election Commission filings. And his staff’s explanations for the expenses are not particularly explanatory. From Sept. 21 through Dec. 16 of last year, Duncan D. Hunter, the Republican congressman from California who endorsed Trump in February, used $1,302 he raised for his reelection campaign on videogame fees. An additional $1,650 was spent on Christian Unified Schools, a private school district in San Diego that serves evangelicals. Joey Kasper, Hunter’s chief of staff, told The Daily Beast it was all a big misunderstanding that was in the process of “being resolved.” “I’ve got answers for you,” Kasper said. And he did, although they didn’t really help to clarify anything. Hunter has been in Congress since 2009, when he succeeded his father, Duncan Hunter Sr., who left his office to run, unsuccessfully, for president. The younger Hunter had put himself through college by founding a Web-design company and then, after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, he joined the Marines, serving two tours in Iraq. According to his financial disclosures, Hunter does not have much personal wealth to speak of. According to Kasper, it was Hunter’s 13-year-old son, also named Duncan, who was to blame for the 67 charges, totaling $1,302, from Steam Games. It’s a gaming platform that allows users to play dozens of different games—including seven versions of Call of Duty—on their computers. The issue of the videogames, Kasper said, was “complicated.” That was an understatement. First, Kasper did his best to explain that he wasn’t sure if Hunter’s son had taken his father’s campaign credit card from his wallet without his knowledge, or if the congressman had directed him to take a credit card from his wallet to pay for the games and he mistakenly took the wrong one. Kasper then claimed that, in fact, all charges from Steam Games after the initial charges in October—which amounted to $310.18 from the 13th through the 26th—were fraudulent, and Hunter’s campaign credit card was subsequently “shut down” in December “in large part because of this.” However the card made its way to the younger Hunter’s remote-control-holding hands or the hands of a fraudster, the result was that the campaign spent rather a lot of money on videogames over the course of just a few months, which is illegal. The only way buying videogames with campaign cash could be legal, according to Paul Ryan of the Campaign Legal Center, would be in a hypothetical situation like the following: “if he bought videogames for his campaign headquarters to entertain the children of his adult volunteers while the adults phone-banked.” By FEC law, candidates are prohibited from putting campaign funds to personal use. Kasper told The Daily Beast, “It’s not the congressman who’s playing them,” but Hunter, who memorably vaped on the floor of the House in February, is himself an outspoken defender of violent games. In 2013, after a mass shooting, he penned an op-ed for Politico titled, “Target Parenting, Not Games, for Violence,” in which he argued that “videogames are often, but wrongly, identified as a catalyst for violence.” But perhaps they are a catalyst for recklessly using your campaign credit card for personal expenses, because the matter of the $1,650 given to his children’s school had an even murkier explanation from his office. “That was actually a donation,” Kasper said. The campaign treasurer, Chris Marston, Kasper claimed, had “mistakenly” assumed it was tuition, and so he listed it on the FEC report with the notation, “PERSONAL EXPENSE—TO BE PAID BACK” when, according to Kasper, it didn’t need to be paid back. But Kelly Smith, the administrative assistant to the superintendent of Christian Unified Schools, told The Daily Beast that she didn’t “recall” any donation from Hunter or his campaign. While on the phone, Smith reviewed the files of charitable donations. “It’s not under Hunter for Congress,” she said. She then looked it up under Hunter’s name. “No,” she said, “I didn’t get anything from him.” Later, Kasper contacted The Daily Beast to clarify that “it looks like” what happened was, the payment to the school “showed up on the credit-card statement as being for a tuition payment.” But because the tuition for Hunter’s kids totals $2,200 a month, according to Hunter’s wife—far more than the $1,650 payment made with the campaign credit card—it wouldn’t make sense for it to have been a tuition payment. It was, Kasper said, a charitable donation to “the annual fund for sports for the school,” but something went wrong—the funds were diverted to “the general fund” Hunter has with the school, which does, in fact, cover tuition for his children, according to what Kasper told The Daily Beast. “I don’t know how this works out the next day or two,” Kasper said, “but they’re going to look to transfer that out of the general fund and into a sports fund.” That, he said, explains why there was no record of a charitable donation made by Hunter’s campaign to the school—because, in fact, he used campaign funds to pay his children’s tuition. But now, Kasper promised, Hunter is going to fix it. On April 4, the FEC’s senior campaign finance and reviewing analyst, Bradley Matheson, sent a letter to Hunter’s treasurer threatening “an audit or enforcement action” if he did not respond to its query about the personal expenses. “Requests for extensions of time in which to respond will not be considered,” the FEC warned. One experienced campaign-finance attorney told The Daily Beast that despite the assertion from Hunter’s staff that all of this was just a “routine” mix-up, it was actually an extraordinary screwup. “I've never seen a ‘mistake’ like this in 26 years of doing FEC work,” the attorney said. “It's a good example of why you shouldn’t be using campaign funds to make donations to organizations that provide services to a family member. It is possible that this was a mistake by the school—but it’s certainly not a routine one.” “There’s nothing nefarious there,” Kasper told The Daily Beast, and it seemed like he really meant it."
604737896,2017-03-30 10:24:00,Inside the Fight Over Guns on Campus,http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/inside-the-fight-over-guns-on-campus-w473960,en,False,,5521,Rolling Stone,http://www.rollingstone.com,"Welcome, How a group of students teamed up with the gun lobby to get firearms in the classroom at over 200 colleges – and counting Reporter On the first day of class at UT Austin, August 2016, a ""Cocks Not Glocks"" group highlights ""the absurdity"" of state laws that allow guns in public places, like campuses, but not sex toys. Sandy Carson/ZUMA On a sweltering day last August at the University of Texas at Austin, a flock of 30 undergrads are settling into a frigid lecture hall when teaching assistant Nick Roland enters with his crimson-red tee hugging a holstered Glock 23. Three weeks earlier, Senate Bill 11, also known as “campus carry,” went into effect in Texas, allowing students on 38 public campuses to carry concealed, loaded handguns to class. Roland, 32, is pursuing a Ph.D. in history after a tour in Iraq. Before that, he was an undergraduate at Virginia Tech in 2007, during the deadliest school shooting in modern history; among the 32 students killed was Roland’s hallmate. “l’ll never forget that day,” he says. Lean and handsome, with a crop of boyish brown hair, Roland says his gun has led to some tense discussions with grad students, a phone call from a parent and near-unanimous opposition from his colleagues. His class lecturer, Robert Icenhauer-Ramirez, told me, “I just hope someday the legislature allows guns to be carried into their offices.” (Handguns actually are allowed in the capital building.) But none of this has kept Roland from carrying his gun most days to class, where the title of the course is projected in large letters at the front of the room: CIVIL WAR. Related

						5 Festivals That Ended in Disaster					



						How True Is 'Respect'? Fact-Checking the Aretha Franklin Biopic More than 200 colleges across the U.S. allow campus carry. Since SB 11 became law, statutes have gained a foothold in two more states, Tennessee and Ohio, and various legal actions have inched versions of campus carry into five others – including Oregon, Pennsylvania and Virginia. This year, 12 other states are considering similar legislation. “It’s a disturbing trend,” says Andy Pelosi, executive director of the Campaign to Keep Guns Off Campus. “They’re picking up one state a year.” With few exceptions – notably, Texas – the public overwhelmingly opposes guns on college campuses (a recent poll in Florida puts opposition at 62 percent), as do a majority of chancellors, university presidents, parents, students, professors and, notably, campus police. But as Adam Winkler, a law professor at UCLA, says, “Because colleges have seen these high-profile mass shootings, campuses have become the fundamental battleground over guns and self-defense.” UT Austin, one of the country’s premier public universities and a liberal enclave in the red-state South, marked campus carry’s greatest achievement yet – and its fiercest point of opposition. On the first day of class, a student group called “Cocks Not Glocks” distributed approximately 5,000 dildos in protest of SB 11, highlighting a discrepancy in Texas law that bars sex toys in public but not handguns on campus. Students gathered under the UT Tower, as young women tossed dildos with the frenzy of a humanitarian mission. “If they’re packing heat,” one sophomore protester yelled, hoisting a giant dildo with both hands, “then we’re packing meat!” UT Austin was also the site of the first campus mass shooting in American history. In 1966, Charles Whitman, an engineering student at UT, hauled a trunk of rifles, pistols and shotguns to the 28th floor of the campus’ iconic tower, and meticulously gunned down 48 people over the course of an hour and 36 minutes. Roland notes that a few armed civilians had fired up at Whitman. “What we can hopefully do is give people the ability to fight back,” Roland says. After class, I visit with Roland at the weathered gray house he is sharing with a housemate and a pit bull named Dolly Parton. He leads me into his room – a shrine of sorts, with all four walls covered by Virginia Tech regalia – and hauls out his collection: a customized AR-15, 30-round magazines and a Romanian training rifle. At his desk, he swivels around with a loaded Remington 870 shotgun. “It seems like common sense to try to have some” – he searches for the words – “different options.” He racks the slide with a startling shuck. “This is an issue I happen to be very passionate about,” he says. “I want someone to look me in the eyes and tell me why, as an individual, I can’t exercise a particular self-defense option.”   Shortly after the Virginia Tech shooting, in 2007, Republican presidential candidate Fred Thompson suggested the massacre might have been averted had other students been armed. The comment was met with national ridicule; even the NRA’s Wayne LaPierre disavowed the idea. But for a small group of conservative college students, mostly in the South and West, it was a rallying cry. One of them, an undergrad at the University of North Texas, launched a Facebook group: Students for Concealed Carry on Campus, or SCCC (later shortened to SCC). Its first stunt – an “empty holster protest” – was picked up by Glenn Beck on CNN. “The only people with guns in schools are the bad guys,” Beck thundered – which was news, surely, to many thousands of campus police. Months later, Northern Illinois University had a campus shooting. “Suddenly, we were the hottest ticket in town,” says Scott Lewis, an SCC founder in Texas. “Within a week, we’d been on Good Morning America, Fox News, CNN.” The exposure, he says, “was addictive.” The concealed-carry movement had spent two decades advancing citizens’ rights to carry a handgun in almost every state; SCC was pushing to expand those rights into classrooms and other school facilities. “Why am I allowed to carry at a local movie theater, but not the campus theater?” asks Lewis. “That’s the case we made.” The group attracted interest from the Second Amendment Foundation, a fringe gun-rights group that is currently suing the State Department on behalf of the inventor of the 3D-printed gun. SAF’s founder, Alan Gottlieb, who is 69, hosted some of the SCC members at a 2007 conference outside Cincinnati and saw a “perfect marriage” with the pro-gun millennials. Before a crowd of elderly white men, SCC’s college-age leaders were greeted like rock stars. “Not old, white, bald guys!” Gottlieb says. “It was great!” By 2009, SCC had expanded its chapters and gained the support of the NRA. But that same year the group lost its first battle in Texas – outflanked by opponents at UT, led by grad student John Woods, who had lost his girlfriend in the Virginia Tech shooting. “I couldn’t believe these people were trying to use our tragedy to push this agenda,” Woods says.  But an idea for how to bypass state legislatures soon struck another SCC member, Jim Manley, who was then a 26-year-old law student at the University of Colorado. On behalf of the SCC, Manley filed a pre-emption lawsuit, which can overturn local gun bans on the grounds that they are “pre-empted” by state laws that safeguard gun rights; Gottlieb’s SAF claims to have struck down 600 ordinances with the technique. “I graduated in May,” Manley says with a chuckle, “and in December, I sued my alma mater.” The case, Regents v. SCCC, eventually went before the Colorado Supreme Court, and was decided in March 2012. Because Colorado’s concealed-carry law omitted “campuses” on its list of exempt spaces, the court found, guns had to be allowed on public campuses throughout the state. Manley got the news while exiting a plane in Denver. “I opened it on my phone,” he says, “and just yelled in the airport.” The floodgates opened: Wisconsin, Mississippi, Kansas, Idaho and Arkansas each passed campus-carry bills. By the time Lewis’ efforts in Texas paid off last year – after three failed attempts – the NRA was calling the legislation “NRA-backed campus carry.” “Let’s be candid about it,” says Gottlieb. “If we go back five years, the concept of getting states to pass laws to carry guns on college campus was a dream. Well, now it’s a reality. It’s happening.” Since 1977, household gun ownership—a predictor of youth gun
purchases—has diminished 34 percent. “Campus Carry,” Gottlieb says, “will get
people on campus who say, ‘Hey! I’ve been around guns now, they don’t scare me
anymore – there’s a good side to a gun. And I’m going to get one.’” In Gottlieb’s analysis, two iconic events buoyed support for gun rights: September 11th, and the Supreme Court’s landmark Heller decision, in 2008, which overturned local bans on handguns. Now, he says, the right student in the right classroom at the right time could change the American gun debate immeasurably. “If the person with a gun stopped a campus shooting, support for gun rights would jump, and I think the increase gain would stay,” he says. “It would spread like wildfire.”  A day after “Cocks Not Glocks,” I navigate UT’s Liberal Arts Building to find the office of Jennifer Glass, a sociology professor who filed for an injunction to halt SB 11 (it failed) and has since sued the university with two other professors. “Hi,” Glass says when I arrive at her door. Under the law, faculty must verbally inform visitors their office is gun-free – every time – so she quickly adds, “No guns are allowed in my office. If you are not carrying, please come in.”  With Midwestern directness, Glass sums up the new rules under SB 11: Students aren’t obligated to answer whether they’re armed.; guns must remain near their owners – a backpack or purse is fine; UT managed to restrict guns from parts of dorms and some offices, but elsewhere students can keep a bullet in the chamber, ready to fire. Glass suggests the risks are a high price to pay in the name of avoiding another Virginia Tech. “We’re talking about black-swan events – exceedingly rare,” Glass says. “A gun could go off accidentally, or be used by a student on drugs or alcohol. All because you’re afraid of a mass shooter?” Government data suggests homicide rates on campus are minuscule, about one percent of the general public’s. “We know classrooms are among the safest places that people can be,” Glass says. But there are about 43 firearm accidents every day across the country, a statistic borne out at a handful of campus-carry universities. In 2011, at UT Austin, a fraternity brother was arrested for firing his rifle inside the house’s laundry room. In 2012, a Utah student’s gun went off, wounding him in the leg. In 2014, a professor at Idaho State shot himself during class. SCC members cite data showing no uptick in crime at universities with campus carry, but student license holders, it turns out, are still students: Harvard researchers have found that students who keep guns are more prone to impulsive decision-making and dangerous habits, like drunk driving. “Arming young people who tend to drink and do crazy things,” says the study’s author, David Hemenway, “seems like a recipe for disaster.” To avoid the threat of guns, some students and faculty have found creative sanctuaries. I leave Glass’ office for the Cactus Café, an on-campus bar. The dildo protest had roared near the entrance, but inside the mood is sedate. In a corner, Robert Oxford, a sandy-haired graduate student in the history department, quietly grades papers. “Welcome to my office hours,” he says. Bars are among the few spaces exempted from campus carry – just like in the Old West, guns have to be left at the door of the Cactus Café. Oxford describes the growing paranoia on campus. “We now have this added drama, this unknown, whether anyone has a gun,” he says. “And we’re not allowed to ask. It puts the whole classroom on edge.” A young woman joins our corner, 23-year-old Andrea Fuentes, a recent graduate who declined to attend UT’s film school due to SB 11. This week, she is saying her goodbyes. “This could be the last time I’m on campus,” Fuentes notes. “In the last semester, the only mood I’ve been able to see is from people who are terrified.”  Outside the Cactus Café, I meet Dave Palla, a 21-year-old senior with curly blond hair and a fraternity-rush T-shirt. He has a license to carry. “They think we’re too dumb, or something, to be responsible,” he says, “which in my case is 100 percent not true.” Palla tells me about a UT sophomore who stormed the library with an AK-47 in 2010, before killing himself on the sixth floor. By all accounts, the response from police and SWAT teams was nearly perfect – they arrived in under four minutes, the result of millions of dollars in training spent after Virginia Tech. But if something similar happens, Palla isn’t taking any chances. “I’m not going to be sitting around,” he says, “with nothing that I can do about it.”  In nearby San Marcos, I meet Dr. Pete Blair, a former cop who now runs ALERRT, one of the most elite training facilities in the U.S. for active-shooter drills. Since Virginia Tech, law-enforcement professionals and private citizens have made trips here, running through simulations with actors playing the likes of Seung-Hui Cho or Adam Lanza. As gunshots boom outside his dusty trailer office, Blair describes the “nightmare scenario” that haunts every officer: friendly fire. Imagine, for instance, an armed student had responded to the gunman in the UT library. “He wants to be a good guy and do the right thing,” says Blair. So the student runs inside, only to confront another armed student responder. They might simultaneously fire. Or they begin screaming until police arrive, who also might mistakenly shoot. Or the students find the assailant, and miss. Blair described a recent police firefight in Times Square in which two bystanders were struck – NYPD officers, some of the best-trained in the country, average about 34 percent accuracy. “Anytime a weapon discharges, that bullet’s going to go somewhere,” says Blair. “That somewhere could be an innocent person.” In fact, during the 2010 library shooting, Austin’s police chief, Art Acevedo – who testified against SB 11 – ordered plainclothes officers to stay outside the building in order to avoid confusion. “In the past, if you saw someone on campus with a firearm,” he says, “we could assume that, more than likely, it’s a violation of law. Now it’s a totally different set of circumstances.”  Across the U.S., campus-safety experts warn of ways an active-shooter intervention can go south. During a 2009 experiment run by the Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, police department (in partnership with ABC News), students at Muhlenberg College were given standard firearms training, then handed practice Glocks and placed in a classroom. When a mock shooter stormed the room, the armed students were consistently mowed down in seconds – shot in the head and chest, often before anyone could unholster a gun. “My heart is still pounding,” one of the students later said. Another described how little prior training had helped: “It’s just completely different.” There has yet to be a recorded case of a school shooting stopped by an armed civilian, though two incidents came close. In 1997, a high school student in Pearl, Mississippi, shot nine classmates, killing two; the shooter was fleeing in his car when an assistant principal confronted him with a handgun. Then there was the 2002 case at Appalachian Law School, a small campus in Virginia. After a disgruntled student shot four students and two faculty members, he walked to the front pavilion, lowered his emptied gun and kneeled. Two other students – both off-duty cops – ran to retrieve guns from their cars. Meanwhile, two unarmed students tackled the assailant, with the gun-wielding pair close behind. State police lauded the unarmed bystanders, but gun-rights advocates spun the event as an instance of guns on campus stopping an active shooter. “I’m a gun advocate, but it really irritates me that people are trying to use this as a plug,” one of the unarmed students, Ted Besen, said afterward. “The NRA is minimizing the tragedy that happened here.” According to a report that ALERRT coauthored with the FBI, which cataloged 14 years of active-shooter incidents, 26 cases were stopped by a civilian – 21 unarmed, five armed (the five included four off-duty security guards and a former Marine). A 2014 campus shooting at Seattle Pacific University ended when a student charged the shooter with pepper spray. “Congresswoman Giffords, when she was shot, the [shooter] stopped to reload, and the guy tackled him,” says Blair, whose ALERRT Center teaches a defense protocol called Avoid-Deny-Defend for unarmed civilians. “When you start talking about training someone for combat shooting, that’s a whole other level of training.”  Last summer in Maryland, police chiefs convened for the Campus Safety East summit, where hundreds of officers sat through glum presentations like “New Perspectives on Active-Shooter Training.” When I ask a dozen attendees at one seminar, “Strategies for Unarmed Security,” who among them supported campus carry, the question is met with silence. “As a gun guy, I generally favor concealed carry,” says Lt. John Weinstein of NOVA College in Virginia. “There are permit holders who could shoot the hair off a gnat’s ass, but there are a lot of people who can’t, and these same people are running around college campuses.” A bear of a man with a long nose and a crisp mustache, Weinstein is an NRA supporter who left a gig as a professor of international relations to become a cop. A few weeks after the conference, I visit him at his tiny Virginia office. As opera plays on the computer, Weinstein presents a granular case against campus carry, from the dynamics of weaponry to the odds of a classroom shooting (“34.6 times 10 to the minus seventh”). “As an archconservative,” he says at one point, “it pains me to be making the argument of the left.” Weinstein explains, for example, what went wrong in the Muhlenberg experiment. “At around 150 to 175 heartbeats per minute, you start to lose your peripheral vision, lose your auditory acuity, and your body goes into survival mode,” he says. “I’m in a crowded classroom, my hands are shaking because my heart is beating, I’ve lost my peripheral vision, I don’t know who’s on either side of me, I have audio exclusion, and now I’m going to take a shot?” He shakes his head. “The chances are greater you’re hitting another evacuee.” Back at the ALERRT Center, Blair directs me past the booming gun range and into a spacious hangar containing simulated school and office spaces. ALERRT leaders tell me that UT Austin is “seriously considering” a program to train undergraduates here in armed-response drills. Texas is one of the few states that require time at a gun range for a concealed-carry license. But in 2013, the state cut its training requirement in half, from ten hours to five – a course I passed easily, having never before touched a gun. A well-known loophole allows Texas citizens to get a license after viewing a 30-minute YouTube video and parting with $19.99. The workaround is valid in 31 states.  In the hangar, a swarm of men in green camouflage and police baseball caps glide in delicate packs, squinting down rifle barrels. Today’s drill, a “breach exercise,” is inspired by Virginia Tech. A squad of six burly men surround a steel door. A blast of metal on metal erupts, and the squad leader, gripping a 12-gauge shotgun, hustles his unit into the faux conference room. “If there are going to be people with firearms on campus,” Blair says, “then we can get them the highest level of training.”  Days after the dildo protest, pro-gun activists released a video depicting female protesters shot in the head (SCC denounced it). Across campus, anonymous students left bullet casings outside classrooms; a sliver of paper inside one read, “Triggered?” That week, a 21-year-old student flashed his gun in the Perry-Castañeda Library, a clear violation. Then, in mid-September, a student’s gun misfired in a dorm room at Tarleton State, one of the 38 public-college campuses in Texas enacting SB 11. SCC, which had previously rebutted its opponents for failing to provide evidence of misfires, rushed a press release attributing the event to a “period of adjustment.” Roland was still undeterred. “Looking at the big picture,” he says, “being able to potentially defend ourselves with firearms is a better situation than the reverse.” No one, not even the SCC, knows exactly how many American campuses now allow guns. Universities are required by law to disclose basic safety information, but that doesn’t include statistics on campus carry, such as accidental discharges, gun-flashing, or whether a school allows guns in the first place. Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., has introduced legislation to change that, requiring universities to publish gun policies for prospective students. “That’s a big hole,” says Ellison. “Students and families need to be able to make a rational choice about their exposure to guns.” In the meantime, campus carry continues to pick up states. Last December, Gov. John Kasich signed a campus-carry bill in Ohio. Unlike Texas’, Ohio’s law allows for an opt-out clause; campus carry is no longer illegal, but universities set their own rules. SCC’s new entity, the SCC Foundation, is financing more insurgent lawsuits, and leaders believe they’ve found up to 30 states where universities could allow guns. Last month, Arkansas’s governor, Asa Hutchinson, signed the first Campus Carry law of 2017. (Hutchinson thanked an NRA representative on hand at the bill ceremony for the group’s support.) Next up: legal battles in Georgia and Iowa. “There seems to be more of an appetite by the gun lobby for these bills,” Pelosi says. “They smell blood.”   In This Article:

According to the AP, one person was killed, and more than a dozen were wounded.  City manager Harry Black released a statement saying that authorities believe a conflict on Saturday led to the shooting. As of this morning, there was no suspect in custody. Ohio Gov. John Kasich wrote on Twitter,  ""[I was] saddened to learn about last night's shooting"" and that he was offering the state's assistance with follow-up. Assistant Police Chief Paul Neudigate tweeted that there was only one reported shooter, however, police were investigating whether others were involved. Update: Motive is still unclear but there are no indications this incident is terrorism related. — LtC. Paul Neudigate (@PaulNeudigate) March 26, 2017 Police initially believed that there were ""at least a couple of shooters"" at Cameo. Only one body was removed this morning, around 6 a.m., and the AP reported that the The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was at the scene. Public response on Twitter to the tragedy criticized Neudigate for calling the shooting non-terror related, and many tweeted that the police department's determination of whether the crime was to be classed as a terrorist act or that of a ""crazy"" person was racist - and based on skin color. @PaulNeudigate and now we wait pic.twitter.com/HkAqRdmd0L — ️ (@Xhakaology) March 26, 2017  @PaulNeudigate It's so sad that skin colour will decide whether it was terrorism or mental illness. — Naughtius Maximus (@AlexMcUK) March 26, 2017  CNN reports this is the worst mass shooting (for total number of victims) so far in 2017, according to Gunviolencearchive.com. There have been 71 in the US this year, and in Cincinnati, there have been at least nine since 2013. The most recent was February 28, when six people were shot at a local apartment building. One local business owner is trying to help police catch the shooter, and he's doing it on Twitter. According to local news station WLWT5, restaurateur Jeff Ruby is ""offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person responsible for the shooting death.""

Her night started as a celebration of her 29 years on this earth, an excuse to dance and party with friends. It ended with her crawling as low to the blood-spattered floor as she could, one elbow pulling her across, then the other. She used a stranger as a human shield from flying bullets as she prayed to God to find a way outside. “I’m thinking, ‘Am I going to die tonight? Is this my last day?’” said Alexandra Bryant, one of the dozens whose Saturday night outing exploded into the bloodiest mass shooting in Cincinnati history – and the worst so far this year in America. The backdrop was Cameo nightclub, an aluminum-sided hangout with a backyard pool and a storied history that, by day, looks an unlikely setting for the chaos Bryant and other club-goers described to The Enquirer. Days later, it appears Cameo is no more, its liquor license surrendered and doors shuttered. Two men face charges with more arrests to come, Cincinnati Police Chief Eliot Isaac said. But the stories behind the East End shootout last Sunday that left one dead and 16 others wounded are just starting to surface. -- The dead man was known as “Lucky.” Bryant – whose friends call her Lex – had known of him since childhood. But 27-year-old O’Bryan “Lucky” Spikes wasn’t at Cameo to celebrate Bryant’s birthday. He’d reluctantly come with other friends who’d talked him into clubbing. That’s one of the things Bryant loved about Cameo: She could always count on running into people she knew. It’s why she and her best friend opted to go after Bryant's plans to party in Detroit fell through. The two hung out all day at the mall, where Bryant bought the shirt and heels she’d wear that night to the club. They'd almost ditched the plans at the last minute when the white pants Bryant put on didn’t fit right, prompting her to turn around and go home to change. Maybe the pants were a sign. Bryant called her friend. “Do you really want to go?” she asked. Her friend didn’t want to pull the plug on the party, so she left it up to Bryant. With Future blasting from the stereo, they pulled into Cameo’s parking lot about 10 p.m. “We was jammin’,” Bryant said. “Just ready to get there and have some fun.” -- The building on Kellogg Avenue has been a lot of things over the years. Several years back, it was Adonis, a gay club whose swimming pool was regularly featured on LGBTQ lists of must-visits in Cincinnati. Years earlier, it was Michael G.'s Restaurant and Banquet Hall, where people celebrated weddings and birthdays. Since 2013, it’s been Cameo, a hip-hop nightclub whose dance floor attracted world-famous rappers like Lil’ Wayne and Drake. Club-goers said the place routinely was packed despite the sometimes-hefty cover charges – people arriving late Saturday paid about $50 to get in, witnesses said. But Bryant and her friend arrived early enough to get in free. They walked in and saw a bunch of people they knew. Cameo is like a small town that way, she said: Everyone knows everyone. “When we got there, everything was cool,” she said. “Cameo is known for Saturday night. … The club was rocking. It was nice. It was fun. We takin’ pictures. We snappin’.” Bryant mingled with her favorite drink in hand – Patron on the rocks with a splash of lime – and posted a short video to Snapchat at 11:57 p.m. In it, she and her friend sang along to the music. “It’s about me this weekend,” Bryant wrote, followed by three kissy-face emojis. Ninety minutes later, she was scrambling for her life. -- Brawls break out at Cameo sometimes, she said, but they’re usually shut down quickly or at least shuttled out into the parking lot. And besides, police were on hand. The club routinely paid for off-duty Cincinnati cops to help patrol outside. This fight would be different. Somewhere around 1:30 a.m., Bryant heard the DJ call for help: ""Security to the dance floor, security to the dance floor."" No one came. Then she heard someone scream: “He’s got a –” The rest of the sentence was drowned out by gunshots. The music stopped and people froze, but the lights never came on. Bodies started falling like dominoes, Bryant said. Panicked people scrambled to escape in the darkness, unable to see where they were running or on whom they were stepping. Bryant was pinned by a man who fell during the first burst of gunfire. She froze, clinging to him like a human shield. When there was a break in the shooting, she pushed him off and tried to get out. Later, she would hear him say that he’d been shot.  Bryant didn’t know him, but his clothes are seared in her memory: white baseball jersey with red lettering on top, red-and-white Jordans on his feet. She didn’t realize until she got home that his blood stained her birthday clothes. “I had that man blood on me, but I don’t even know who he is,” she said. -- Bryant crawled toward the club’s back exit, away from the gunfight. She made it, but then realized she and many others were trapped by fences in the pool area behind the club. Some people were trying to bust down the wooden fence separating them from the parking lot. Bryant watched a girl grab a woven chair from the poolside and followed suit. She propped the chair next to the fence, hurled over her purse, and then stood on the chair to climb over. She sprinted toward her car as police cruisers raced into the parking lot. People hugged and cried and screamed. Inside, gunshots continued. Bryant’s cell phone shows two outgoing calls at 1:34 a.m. to “Mama.” Her sleeping mother didn’t rouse, so Bryant sent a two-word text to thwart the panic that would surely overwhelm her when she finally awoke to the horrific news: “I’m OK.” By this time, the shooting was well known to Cincinnati police. Public records released four days after the bloodshed show that dozens of phone calls had poured in. Male subject shot in the head. Three subjects down. Victim shot in back and stomach. Female victim shot in the leg. At least 5 or 6 critical chest wounds. Outside in Cameo's parking lot, 38-year-old Angel Cruz threw his body atop his girlfriend, 29-year-old Sherell Johnson, as a crush of people ran to their cars. Johnson and Cruz had been in line to go inside the club but aborted the plans because Cruz got a ""bad feeling"" and insisted they bail. ""God was giving us a sign to leave,"" Johnson said later. Not everyone was so fortunate. -- Spikes’ family, through a pastor-turned-spokesman, said Sunday they’d learned by 2 a.m. that he was among the injured. They gathered at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, thinking he might be in surgery. About 7 a.m., they finally learned he’d never made it to the hospital at all, Bishop Darin Miller said. Spikes had been shot dead – a single bullet to his chest – at the club. He lay there for hours before his body was transported to the Hamilton County Coroner’s Office. On Thursday, police announced murder charges against two men: Cornell Beckley, 27, arrested at his Westwood home, and Deondre Davis, 29, still in critical condition at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. Chief Isaac told reporters that the men were part of an argument that escalated with people sneaking guns into the bar and opening fire. Spikes' family has declined to speak to the media. A number of others touched by the violence have been reluctant to talk. As such, much about the shooting remains murky, including the severity of the victims' wounds. In addition to Davis, police have identified the remaining wounded as Rodney Espy, 30; Jraejah Warren, 28; Stephen Haley, 28; Rayshunda Higgins, 33; Jarrod Givens, 26; Ronald Lee, 33; Nathan McClendon, 27; Shannon Brown, 25; Jordan Harris, 24; Valor Stanley, 28; Christopher Harris, 34; Michael Feagins Jr., 30; Khristian Howell, 26; Regina Madaris, 33; and Bryant Stevenson, 28. Stevenson's mother, 51-year-old Deborah Stevenson, said she learned her son had been shot from one of his friends. Her stomach locked up as she jumped out of bed, got dressed and raced to the hospital. ""I only got one son,” Stevenson said. When she reached Bethesda Hospital, she said police wouldn’t let her talk to her son because they had to interview him first. Her stomach didn’t unclench until she spotted him sitting upright in a hospital bed. “I saw his face,” she said. “That’s all that matters … He’s alive.” He’d been shot in the foot and, like Lex Bryant, had crawled from the club on his hands and knees. He’s in pain and hobbling on crutches. “We can rub that foot all our life – rub it, soak it. He could be dead right now at this moment,” she said. “Thank God he’s not.” -- By Thursday, the scene at Cameo was eerily peaceful. Outside, a goose had made a nest just feet from the colorful makeshift memorial of balloons and stuffed animals and candles that served as a reminder of the crime scene inside. One of the candles was left by Lex Bryant on Tuesday. She lit it for Lucky. She showed two of her friends the fence she’d scaled. The chair she’d used to hoist herself to freedom was still propped against the other side. She spotted a bottle of perfume in the grass and realized it was hers. It had spilled from the purse she’d catapulted over the fence. “My perfume!” she shouted. Yet it all felt surreal, like a nightmare or a horror movie. She used to love going to Cameo maybe once a month. It’s nice to put on some heels, have a drink and dance with friends. It's nice to go someplace where everyone knows everyone. But she’s done with clubs now. And she doubts she’s alone. “I feel like this city is never going to be the same,” Bryant said. “I feel like this, right here, really woke our city up.” As she speaks, she’s jumpy, spooked by construction noises. She’s blessed to be alive, she said, but she isn’t OK. Her sister suggested counseling. Bryant resisted at first, but her resolve is weakening. She’s read and heard news reports about countless mass shootings but said you can’t know what it’s like until it’s you in the room. Until you hear the pop of a gun and don’t know where to run. Until you’re crawling across the floor through blood, praying for a way out, wondering if you’ll live to see another birthday.

The government says Apple has helped it extract data from iPhones roughly 70 times in the past, but Apple has never done what a court is ordering it do now: create software to crack its own security features for the FBI. An FBiOS, if you will. By
      
        Hamza Shaban Posted on February 19, 2016, at 6:23 p.m. ET For more than two months, FBI technicians have been locked out of Syed Rizwan Farook’s phone, and they're desperate for a key. Standing in the way of federal law enforcement is an iPhone’s passcode, a string of numbers and letters, perhaps random, perhaps not, that holds behind it the possibility of advancing the investigation into the mass shooting in San Bernardino that left 14 people dead. With enough tries, and enough time, the FBI could unlock the device, by guessing every possible passcode combination. But another security tool poses an obstacle: after 10 incorrect password attempts, the iPhone wipes itself clean, a self destruct feature that would erase stored data and any hopes of finding new leads or identifying co-conspirators: Who did Farook speak to and where has he been? With their technical options seemingly exhausted, the federal government has turned to the law, and to previous cases where Apple, the phone’s manufacturer, has helped retrieve information from confiscated devices. But these prior cases are different from the San Bernardino investigation in important ways — in what the government was demanding of Apple, and the existing tech by which the company would satisfy those demands. In one active case in New York, involving a person suspected of distributing methamphetamine, the government acknowledged that “Apple has repeatedly assisted law enforcement officers in federal criminal cases by extracting data from passcode-locked iPhones.” But what’s crucial here is the phrase “extracting data” and what that means in a practical sense. Apple can, in fact, pull certain types of data from their phones, even when the device is locked, but those iPhones must be running older versions of their operating system. In the New York case, the device in question runs on iOS 7, which enables Apple to pull information from the phone onto a separate hard drive — all without having to unlock it. In this case, and in previous cases where Apple has complied with a court order targeting an encrypted device, the company was able to access the data even as the device was locked. The iPhone from San Bernardino, however, runs on iOS 9. And under the new operating system, the previous extraction process no longer works. It’s been designed away. As the encryption technology available to consumers has advanced, the areas of iPhones protected by security tools have grown, leaving less data vulnerable to malicious attacks, and, as it happens, more resistant to government surveillance, even when sanctioned by a judge. What makes San Bernardino different from New York, and to previous cases, Apple has argued, is that the government is now asking the company not merely to extract information, but to create new software to suppress security features, to unlock the iPhone at issue — a sort of FBiOS. In the New York case, a federal prosecutor estimated that Apple has previously assisted the government in accessing iPhones 70 times. But the company maintains that previous cases involved deploying existing software, and not manufacturing an encryption backdoor. Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, described the government’s demands in stark terms. “Specifically, the FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating system, circumventing several important security features,” he wrote in an open letter this week. “In the wrong hands, this software — which does not exist today — would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone’s physical possession.” Government lawyers have asked Apple to assist the FBI in bypassing the 10 passwords wiping feature, and to disable a time delay that kicks in limiting the number of passwords that can be attempted back to back. Then, with the iPhone’s defenses lowered, federal law enforcement could then engage in a “brute force” attack, trying every password combination until the right one is discovered, using a powerful computer to dramatically speed up the process. According to the Justice Department’s request for the court order, an FBI technician checked the phone's most recent iCloud back-up, and the data erase feature was turned on then, and he suspects that it remains active. In the DOJ’s latest motion in the San Bernardino case, the government argued that Apple’s non-compliance is nothing more than a publicity stunt “based on its concern for its business model and public brand marketing strategy.” While the Justice Department claims that FBiOS would be created for the purposes of accessing the San Bernardino iPhone alone, Apple insists it would be possible to use it on others, and indeed there are perhaps hundreds of encrypted devices in the government’s possession, and many beleaguered law enforcements officials eager to break into them. For Apple, much of Silicon Valley, and civil liberties groups, this legal dispute extends far beyond one device. Security and privacy experts have argued that San Bernardino may set precedent for not only U.S. law enforcement seeking privileged access, but for foreign governments looking to suppress free speech and hobble political dissent. (Apple’s allies say if the U.S. government thinks this precedent wouldn’t be exploited by China and Russia, they’re fooling themselves. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton made similar remarks at a town hall event Thursday.) From the perspective of law enforcement, facing violent criminal threats both here and abroad, Apple’s opposition doesn’t represent a commitment to consumer protection so much as it reveals a kind of selfish, post-Snowden brand management. In their eyes, Apple seems fixated on its own self image, on marketing itself as an entrepreneurial pillar of privacy, to the detriment of public safety. The government also rejects the notion that designing new, security-suppressing software would put a hardship on the company. “While the order in this case requires Apple to provide modified software, modifying an operating system — writing software code — is not an unreasonable burden for a company that writes software code as part of its regular business.” But where the Justice Department sees grandstanding, Apple sees an unprecedented power grab, a Rubicon crossing of sorts: of government testing the limits of just how far it can push American tech. For Apple and its allies, this is what makes San Bernardino different from New York, and from every other case.

594225861,2017-03-15 09:32:40,'Not about religion': how Trump officials have attempted a travel ban rebrand,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/15/trump-administration-travel-ban-muslim-religion,en,False,,1751,Guardian US,https://www.theguardian.com/us,"Challengers argue the ban’s intent has been to discriminate based on religion or nationality, but supporters of it are trying to classify it as something else Last modified on Fri 9 Feb 2018 18.48 GMT At midnight on Thursday, Donald Trump’s renewed executive order restricting travel from six Muslim-majority nations was scheduled to go into effect. More than 15 months have passed since, in the wake of a horrific mass shooting in San Bernardino, then candidate Trump announced his intention to impose a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States”.  The statement, which some at the time deemed radical enough to end his chance at the presidency, was never seriously walked back by Trump or his campaign in the intervening months, right through his victory in the 2016 election. In June 2016, for example, Trump reiterated at a campaign rally: “I called for a ban after San Bernardino and was met with great scorn and anger. But now … many are saying that I was right to do so.” This profession of a Muslim ban is at the heart of legal challenges now making their way through courts across the US. Challengers argue that, regardless of what Trump and his administration officials actually said, his intent was and always has been to discriminate based on religion or nationality – to block Muslims from entering in particular, in violation of the US constitution. In the intervening months, Trump and his surrogates’ statements have been mixed. It wasn’t until after Trump actually signed an immigration order resembling the ban he had once proposed that there emerged a concerted effort by the administration to classify it as something else. “This is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting,” Trump said in January after his first executive order was stayed in a series of federal court rulings. “This is not about religion – this is about terror and keeping our country safe.” There was within the administration some initial flip-flopping about the use of the word “ban” during the order’s rollout. The president “made very clear that this is not a Muslim ban, it’s not a travel ban”, Spicer said during a press briefing, despite Trump referring to the order that same week as a “very, very strict ban”, and despite similar language on official administration materials and websites. The semantics of “ban” aside, the administration has mostly been in lockstep since January in rebranding Trump’s executive order as something far and away from his bombastic campaign promise to explicitly profile by religion. “These seven countries. What about the 46 majority-Muslim countries that are not included?” Kellyanne Conway asked Fox News’ Chris Wallace in the same interview where she famously referred to a non-existent “Bowling Green Massacre”. “It totally undercuts this nonsense that this is a Muslim ban,” she continued. But there have been startling missteps from the administration in promoting this narrative as well. Trump’s cybersecurity adviser, Rudy Giuliani, gleefully summarized his involvement in drafting the initial executive order in late January during a Fox News appearance. “I’ll tell you the whole history of it: when he first announced it, he said ‘Muslim ban’,” Giuliani said. “He called me up, he said: ‘Put a commission together, show me the right way to do it legally.’” Giuliani said he brought together lawmakers and expert lawyers, “and what we did was we focused on, instead of religion, danger”. Giuliani went on to distance the policy from an outright ban on Muslims, but chose a curiously revealing way of doing so, describing the executive order as a “way to do [a Muslim ban] legally”. In a February interview with Rolling Stone, Trump advisor Stephen Miller also defended the ban, arguing that “there is no religious exclusion, test or establishment of any kind, shape or form whatsoever”. Miller continued: “We should seek to admit people who will be able to embrace the open and tolerant values of US society.” But while Miller is technically correct about there being no explicit religious test in the order, it is also true that the original order included prioritizations for refugees from “religious minorities”. Since all the countries indicated by the order are majority Muslim, those exceptions essentially allowed officials to consider processing entry for any citizen of the seven nations who was not Muslim. Later in the month, during a town hall event, Miller said the revised executive order the administration was drafting was intended to address the specific complaints that the judges raised with the order, but not alter its intent – a fact that civil rights groups leading the inevitable challenges against the new order in court are likely to latch on to. “One of the big differences that you are going to see in the executive order is that it is going to be responsive to the judicial ruling which didn’t exist previously,” Miller said at the town hall. “And so these are mostly minor, technical differences. Fundamentally, you are still going to have the same, basic policy outcome for the country.”"

Judge Paul G. Byron of Federal District Court in Orlando overruled a federal magistrate judge in Northern California who found this month that the woman, Noor Salman, 30, posed no danger to the community nor was a serious flight risk. In his order on Friday canceling Ms. Salman’s release, Judge Byron said that her mother and an uncle own an apartment in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, governed by the Palestinian Authority, where Ms. Salman had previously stayed. Ms. Salman, who was living with her mother in the San Francisco Bay area after the Orlando massacre, was arrested in California on charges of obstructing justice and aiding her husband, Omar Mateen, in his attempt to provide material support to a terrorist organization. She is accused of concealing prior knowledge of her husband’s plans to carry out the attack and of concocting a cover story for him. Mr. Mateen, 29, an American citizen of Afghan descent, was killed by the police at the end of a three-hour shooting rampage on June 12 at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando. During the attack, he paused to call 911 to profess his allegiance to Islamic State militants, officials have said. He killed 49 people and wounded 53 others. It was the deadliest mass shooting in modern United States history and the most lethal terrorist attack on American soil since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Ms. Salman has said she was a victim of domestic abuse by Mr. Mateen and was unaware of his intentions to attack the nightclub. The federal magistrate judge, Donna Ryu, cast doubt on the weight of the government’s evidence against Ms. Salman in her March 1 order, clearing the way for Ms. Salman’s conditional release on $500,000 bond to the custody of her uncle in Rodeo, Calif. That release order was stayed by Judge Byron the next day. Judge Byron’s order on Friday means that Ms. Salman will remain in detention pending the outcome of the case. A hearing has been set for April 10, at which time the government will seek to have her transferred to custody in Florida. Ms. Salman’s lawyer, Haitham Amin, acknowledged that the judge in the federal court district in Florida where Ms. Salman is charged has the final say on the matter of her pretrial detention. “That’s just the way it works,” he said.

The gunmen remained at large following the shooting at the Cameo nightclub in Cincinnati that Police Chief Eliot Isaac said was packed with revelers. ""Several local men got into some type of dispute inside the bar and it escalated into shots being fired from several individuals,"" Isaac told reporters. ""As a result, there were 16 people that sustained gunshot injuries, one of which is deceased,"" he said, adding that one victim was in ""an extremely critical condition."" Isaac named the man killed at the scene as 27-year-old Obryan Spikes. Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley said there was ""no evidence that this was a terrorist attack."" ""However, to the victims, what difference does it make? They've been terrorized by gun violence, innocent victims,"" he said. ""It's important for everyone to understand that people were just going to have a good time and ended up getting shot. That is totally unacceptable."" Police began receiving calls about shots being fired at the club at about 1:30 am (0530 GMT), according to Isaac. No arrests have yet been made, and Isaac could not confirm whether any of the injured were among the shooters. ""The investigation is in its very early stages,"" the police chief said. Authorities in the Midwestern city called on anyone with information that could help the probe to come forward.   According to its Facebook page, Cameo admits ""grown and sexy"" partygoers aged 21 and over on Saturday nights. ""It was a young crowd and we have had incidents in the past, but this is the worst by far,"" Captain Kimberly Williams, the district's police commander, told CNN. She said there was ""a lot of chaos when the shots went off."" Cameo was the site of two shooting investigations in 2015, local news station WLWT reported. Someone was shot in the foot there on New Year's Day, and a shooting victim was found in the parking lot in September, WLWT said. Ohio Governor John Kasich said his office was offering help to local authorities. ""You see things like this and you begin to wonder, where is it safe to go?"" he said on CNN. Although authorities said there was no evidence of terrorism, the attack inevitably raised memories of last year's rampage at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. That mass shooting -- which left 49 dead and 68 wounded -- was the deadliest terror attack in the United States since September 11, 2001. The gunman, Omar Mateen, pledged allegiance to the Islamic State jihadist group in a call to police during the assault.   But shootings are a common feature of life in America, where the right to bear arms is protected by the US Constitution. Cincinnati, a city of 300,000 people nestled along the northern banks of the Ohio River, had 66 homicides in 2016, all but nine of them as a result of firearms. This year has seen a spike in gun violence, with 57 shooting victims in the city as of Thursday last week, compared to 31 during the same period last year. Elsewhere in the United States, a gunman opened fire Saturday on a double-decker bus on the Las Vegas Strip, killing one person and wounding another. Police said the suspect appeared to have ""mental issues."" More notorious gun crimes in recent years included the rampage carried out by 21-year-old white supremacist Dylann Roof, who shot to death nine people during a Bible study session at a historically African American church in Charleston, South Carolina on June 17, 2015. And a massacre at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut on December 14, 2012 claimed the lives of 20 children and six adults. Gunman Adam Lanza, who had a history of mental illness, also killed his mother and went on to commit suicide. The tragedy sparked calls for stricter gun control laws, but bills banning assault weapons and expanding background checks on gun purchases were defeated in the US Congress. bur-rob/acb Facebook © AFP 2021 Newsmax, Moneynews, Newsmax Health, and Independent.

                since The charge was one of 38 brought against Cornell Beckley, 27, who faces 230 years in prison if convicted on all charges in the shooting, Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters told a news conference in Cincinnati. ""We identified him (Beckley) through multiple sources as the initial shooter,"" Deters said. A second suspect, Deondre Davis, 29, who was charged with murder while critically injured, died Tuesday morning at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, according to police. Bryan Spikes, 27, died shortly after the March 26 shooting at the Cameo Nightlife club in which 16 other people were injured. Beckley pleaded not guilty at an arraignment hearing in Cincinnati Municipal Court last week on the initial charge and is being held on a $1.7 million bond. Davis and Beckley would have faced identical indictments had Davis lived, Deters said. A third gun was found in the club and police are searching for a third shooter. The gunfire, which sent hundreds of patrons fleeing and ducking for cover, erupted from a dispute inside the club between two groups from different neighborhoods, Deters said. Beckley climbed onto the club's stage and began shooting at around 1:30 a.m., prosecutors said. Davis started shooting after Beckley opened fire. The club had persistent problems with violence, according to police. The club's owner surrendered his liquor license and the club was closed, police said on Thursday. Unlike last year's Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando, Florida, in which 49 people died, making it the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, there were no indications the Cincinnati shooting was ""terrorism-related,"" according to authorities. ""People say this was a mass shooting. It was a shoot-out,"" Deters said. Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley called the incident the worst mass shooting in the city’s history. One victim remains in critical condition, Deters said. (Reporting by Timothy Mclaughlin in Chicago; Editing by James Dalgleish) For you For you"

597643162,2017-03-22 16:32:51,British writer bewildered by backlash after offering ‘atheist prayers’ for attack victims,http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/03/22/british-writer-bewildered-by-backlash-after-offering-atheist-prayers-for-attack-victims/,en,False,,22088,Blaze,http://www.theblaze.com,"British writer Laurie Penny, a contributing editor for the New Statesman, seems flabbergasted by the response she’s received after offering “atheist prayers” in response to the deadly terror attack near Parliament. Penny, whose byline regularly appears in the U.K.'s Guardian, took to Twitter Wednesday afternoon, following the assault that, according to police, left four dead and at least 20 injured, to say her “thoughts and atheist prayers [are] with everyone in Westminster right now.”   That comment immediately sparked quite a backlash online. When one person asked why she chose to tout her atheism “in the context of such a horrific event,” Penny said she didn’t want to be “inaccurate” by simply saying “prayers.”  At that, the responses poured in.           After receiving myriad criticisms for her tweet, Penny, seemingly confused by the backlash she had received, returned to the social media platform to say she was not intending to “insult people of faith” and accused her detractors of starting a “petty internet flamewar” in the wake of such a horrible event.        While Penny’s “atheist prayers” are certainly unique, messages of faith following attacks are nothing new. In  the past, conservatives have been mocked by Democrats and the media for offering prayers in the wake of tragedy — specifically, gun-related tragedy.    After the 2015 shooting in San Bernardino, California, Huffington Post Editor Sam Stein wrote: “Every time multiple people have been gunned down in a mass shooting, all these officials can seemingly do is rush to offer their useless thoughts and prayers.” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) echoed the Huffington Post editor’s words in a tweet about the “thoughts and prayers” being offered by his Republican counterparts. Instead of praying, Murphy called for increased gun control.   And following the 2015 mass shooting at an Oregon community college, Stein attacked conservative politicians again for “reliably and reflexively reach[ing] for the most casual response possible: condolences of 140 characters or less to nobody in particular.” Yet, as the Daily Caller pointed out, Murphy and Stein have offered “thoughts and prayers” of their own many times before. According to The Atlantic, this tactic against conservatives quickly became known as “prayer shaming” and was used to push for gun control laws:  Only time will tell if “atheist prayers” are considered to be just as toxic by the left.

ORLANDO, Fla. – A Florida businessman is raising scholarship money for gay students to honor the 49 patrons killed last June in Orlando's gay nightclub shooting massacre. Barry Miller said Monday that The 49 Fund is to award 10 scholarships annually, each worth $4,900. Students would have to self-identify as ""out,"" have a GPA of 3.0 and attend an institution of higher learning fulltime. Survivors of the Pulse nightclub attack or deceased victims' relatives would receive special consideration, said Miller, who is working on the project with the GLBT Community Center of Central Florida and the Central Florida Foundation. Gunman Omar Mateen pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in the attack last June 12. The deadliest mass shooting in recent U.S. history also left dozens wounded in addition to the 49 killed.

The investigation continues into the worst mass shooting in the city's history, in which 17 people were shot, one of them fatally. O'Bryan Spikes, 27, died at the scene. Cornell Beckley, 27, of Westwood, was arrested at a Colerain Township home Thursday afternoon. The second suspect, Deondre Davis, 29, was injured in the shooting and remains hospitalized in critical condition at University of Cincinnati Medical Center. Isaac said the altercation started inside Cameo nightclub in the East End. At 1:29 a.m. March 26 the argument turned into a gunbattle, involving more than two people. ""This did begin with an altercation inside the nightclub,"" Isaac said. ""It deteriorated into a fight and escalated into individuals being able to sneak guns into the bar and shots being fired."" Sixteen shell casings and three guns were recovered, according to police accounts. Despite earlier information distributed by the city that the shooting was initiated by an altercation earlier in the day, Isaac said the department did not have confirmation that happened. In addition to Davis, another victim remains hospitalized in critical condition. Davis’ father, Jackie Davis, held a news conference outside University of Cincinnati Medical Center Thursday night saying he was shocked at his son’s arrest. The family had gathered around the television when they heard arrests were made, but when Davis was named he said, “to see my son named was mind-blowing.” “My son is innocent,” Jackie Davis said. Davis’ father described his son as “always smiling.” Davis has surgery scheduled for Friday morning. He is not responsive and is on a ventilator, according to family attorney Carl Lewis, who was with the family Thursday night. The victims include 14 men and three women. The surviving victims are: Rodney Espy, 30, Davis, 29, Jraejah Warren, 28, Stephen Haley, 28, Rayshunda Higgins, 33, Jarrod Givens, 26, Ronald Lee, 33, Nathan McClendon, 27, Shannon Brown, 25, Jordan Harris, 24, Valor Stanley, 28, Bryant Stevenson, 28, Christopher Harris, 33, Michael Feagins Jr., 30, Khristian Howell, 25 and Regina Madaris, 33. Most of them, Isaac said, were patrons of the club and not involved in the fight. ""It's very good news out of a very bad situation,"" Mayor John Cranley said. ""This is a tragedy of epic proportions. It's the worst mass shooting in the history of the city...  we have to figure out a way to get guns off the street and teach people not to resolve disputes with guns."" Wednesday's release of 911 call recordings offered a chilling glimpse into what occurred inside Cameo nightclub. ""There is blood everywhere,"" one caller said. Many pleaded for dispatchers to ""hurry up"" and send help. One caller summed up the night this way: ""There shouldn't be shooting at clubs. We was all just dancing, next thing you look around he's shot."" Beckley has a prior conviction for gun violence. He served a prison term after he was convicted on two counts of aggravated assault in 2008, according to court records. Police said Beckley pulled a rifle from his trunk on McPherson Avenue in East Price Hill and fired three shots at a man on Oct. 24, 2007. The bullets missed the man, but two of them continued through his grandmother's bedroom window nearly striking her, court records state. Davis has three prior drug convictions. He was sentenced to probation in 2013 for permitting drug use in connection with heroin trafficking. Cameo nightclub manager Julian Rodgers relinquished his liquor permit Monday and has closed the club. People were seen carrying things out of the building Thursday afternoon."

        BuzzFeed News Last updated on March 6, 2016, at 10:36 p.m. ET Posted on March 6, 2016, at 7:27 p.m. ET * Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders got into a heated, feisty debate on Sunday night in Flint, Michigan just days before that state will vote in its Democratic primary. * Most of the two-hour session on CNN focused on the water poisoning of Flint and domestic issues and economic inequality, which gave Sanders a chance to trumpet his bread-and-butter lines and positions from the campaign trail. * Sanders, though, did get testy a few times when Clinton tried to talk while he was answering. His snaps got picked up widely on social media, especially when he said, ""excuse me, I'm talking."" * Read BuzzFeed News's coverage of the water crisis here. * Clinton for the first time, according to the moderators, called for Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder to resign over the water crisis. Sanders has taken that position before. * Clinton also hit Sanders hard for his opposing a 2009 bill that, in part, aimed to save the auto industry — which has its roots in Michigan and especially Detroit. * Both candidates stumbled when asked about their support of the Violent Crime Control act of 1994, which was signed by President Bill Clinton and has been blamed for the mass incarceration of black people. * Sanders, when asked, also gave his most lengthy comments to date on his Jewish faith. * The two did agree on one thing: They both said they'd be better off running the country than the Republicans. * Clinton has the momentum in the race and the delegate count. But Sanders came off two wins on Saturday and another on Sunday, in Maine. Both candidates voices were noticably hoarse from the campaign trail. This was a new call for Clinton, moderator Anderson Cooper said. ""I believe the governor of this state should understand that his dereliction of duty was irresponsible. He should resign,"" Sanders said. ""We are here in Flint. I'm very grateful that my request that we hold this debate, be held here, so we can continue to shine a very bright spotlight on what has happened in this city. I agree, the governor should resign or be recalled, and we should support the efforts of citizens trying to achieve that,"" Clinton said. Bernie Sanders to Rick Snyder: Resign: https://t.co/7fcZw94gCN Clinton stopped short of saying she would fire anyone specific, but she did say she would call for an investigation into ""who knew what at what time"" and then act accordingly. Sanders was more unequivocal, saying ""President Sanders would fire anyone who knew what was happening and didn't do what was appropriate."" Asked whether they believe those responsible for the crisis should go to jail, Clinton said that was up to the ""legal system."" Sanders said he would call for an investigation and ensure that those who were responsible would be ""held accountable."" Here's the ""excuse me, I'm talking"" exchange .@BernieSanders to @HillaryClinton: ""Can I finish, please?"" buzzfeed.com Words Clinton aides are using in spin room to describe Sanders' tone tonight: ""desperate"" &amp; ""disrespectful"" #DemDebate Martin asked what the candidates would do to keep factory jobs from moving overseas. It led to a heated back-and-forth about their positions on free trade, economic bailouts, and their relationship to Wall Street. Clinton said that she would implement a system of ""carrots and sticks,"" including forcing companies that want to leave cities that have given them tax breaks to pay an ""exit fee."" Sanders said Clinton had supported the ""disastrous trade policies"" that had pushed those same factories out of places like Flint or Detroit. Clinton then retorted that Bernie had voted against the 2009 bailout that she said saved the state's auto industry. The two then broke into speaking over each other. Sanders accused Clinton of supporting that bailout to save her ""Wall Street friends."" Clinton responded that she had voted for the bailout to save the auto industry, acknowledging that bailout included provisions she didn't like. ""If everyone had voted the way he did,"" Clinton said of Sanders, ""I believe the auto industry would have collapsed, taking 4 million jobs with it."" The candidates then got into an argument into whether Clinton should release the transcripts of the speeches she has given to financial institutions, often for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Clinton said she would release them ""when everyone else does."" Sanders then said he had already released the transcripts of his speeches to Wall Street — because he's never given any. Here's a clip of that moment: Sanders gets animated: ""I release it! Here it is! There ain't nothin! I don't give speeches to Wall Street"" The bank, by the way, is a government organization that finances exports of U.S. goods. Sanders, who argues the bank is a form of corporate welfare and referred to it as the ""Boeing bank,"" was the lone Democrat to vote against reauthorizing the bank, siding with Republicans like Ted Cruz. Clinton supports the bank, arguing it is critical to U.S. manufacturing Sanders, when pressed on breaking with Democrats to oppose the bank, said Democrats aren't always right. ""Well let me break the bad news,"" Sanders said. ""Democrats are not always right. Democrats have often supported corporate welfare. Democrats have supported disastrous trade agreements. Now on this issue, I do not support corporate welfare."" Moderator Don Lemon asked Clinton whether she believes the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994 — a set of law enforcement measures put forth by her husband that is widely believed to have contributed to the mass incarceration of black people — was a mistake. ""Why should black people trust you to get it right this time?"" Lemon asked Clinton. ""Are you going to ask Senator Sanders the same question?"" a visibly irked Clinton replied. She then quoted her husband, saying the bill ""solved some problems but created others."" Sanders then responded to the same question to say he'd voted for the bill because it contained ""good stuff,"" such as a ban on assault rifles and provisions to protect women from domestic violence. He acknowledged that the bill had also contained ""bad stuff."" Earlier in the debate, the father of Abigail Kopf, 14, who was injured in the recent mass shooting in Kalamazoo, Michigan, asked the candidates what they would do to prevent such tragedies from happening again. The father said he didn't wanted to hear anything about mental health or background checks because ""those things don't work."" Father of Kalamazoo shooting victim at the debate: ""She's now laughing and giggling but she has a long road” ahead Clinton replied that, as president, she would work to close loopholes that allow people to purchase guns before their background checks are complete. She also said that ""giving complete immunity to gun manufacturers and sellers was a terrible mistake."" Sanders touted his legislative record, saying he has a D-score from the National Rifle Association. However, the senator said he did not think holding gun manufacturers accountable for crimes committed with the weapons they make would be a mistake. ""That would mean the end of gun manufacturing in America,"" Sanders said. Clinton then interrupted Sanders, who angrily asked her whether he could finish. Clinton went on to ask viewers to imagine what it would be like to send their first grader to school with ""a little back pack on his back"" and then learn that someone had shot him to death with an AR-15. ""Compare the substance of this debate with what you saw on the Republican stage last week!"" Clinton said. Sanders concurred with Clinton, saying that he would call for large spending on mental health if elected. ""When you watch those Republican debates, you know why we need to invest into mental health!"" Earlier Sanders also referred to Trump, saying ""I hate to say the word 'huge'"" — because it sounds like Trump's ""yuuuuge."" Clinton, noting she was the only candidate who has received more votes than Trump, said, ""I think that Donald Trump's bigotry, his bullying, his bluster are not going to wear well on the American people."" Sanders said he would ""love"" to take on Trump, and cited polls showing him beating Trump by a bigger margin than Clinton. ""I think we are exciting working class people, young people who are prepared to stand up and demand that our government represents all of us, and not just the few."" Denise Ghattas, a retired school administrator, asked Sanders how relevant God was in his life. Cooper followed up asking about an AP article about Jewish people in the U.S. being irked by Sanders not prominently mentioning his faith. ""When we talk about God,"" Sanders said, ""what we are talking about is what all religions hold to be true, and that is to do unto others what you would like them to do unto you. I'm here tonight because I believe that."" ""Because I believe, morally and ethically, that we do not have the right to turn our backs on children here in Flint who are being poisoned or on veterans who are sleeping in the street."" Sanders went on to say that his Jewish identity was an essential part of his life. ""I am very proud of being Jewish,"" he said. ""My father's family was wiped out by Hitler in the Holocaust. I know what extremist politics mean."" Clinton says she prays daily and frequently. ""I am a praying person and if I hadn't been during the time I was in the White House I would have become one,"" she said.

Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley said there was no evidence of “a terrorist attack,” as with last year’s Pulse nightclub slaughter in Orlando, Florida that killed 49 people in the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. “However to the victims, what difference does it make?” Cranley said. “People were just going to have a good time and ended up getting shot.” No arrests had been made hours after the shooting took place around 1 a.m. EDT (0600 GMT) as hundreds of people partied inside Cameo Nightlife. The club has a history of gun violence, including two shootings in 2015, City Manager Harry Black said in a statement. Authorities believe multiple gunmen were involved in the Sunday morning shooting, which grew out of “some kind of dispute” inside the bar, Police Chief Eliot Isaac said. The disagreement may have been started earlier in the day, Black said. “At this point it’s unclear exactly what instigated the shooting,” police Captain Kimberly Williams said at a televised briefing. “Just a lot of chaos when the shots went off.” Four police officers, who were providing security in the parking lot when the shots rang out, ran into the club and treated victims, the chief said. In addition to those hit by gunfire, several people sustained minor injuries attempting to flee. Police did not have a good description of the suspects, in part because witnesses were reluctant to cooperate, Williams told WCPO television. The man who was killed was identified by authorities as 27-year-old O’Bryan Spikes. Two of the injured were in critical condition, a University of Cincinnati Medical Center spokeswoman said. The others hit by gunfire were in stable condition in other area hospitals, and some were treated and released. On Sunday, former Arizona Congresswoman Gabby Giffords tweeted condolences and issued a call to action to stop “these senseless and heartbreaking shootings.” Giffords was herself the victim of a shooting spree in 2011 that killed six people and wounded 13 others. Our hearts are in Cincinnati today. We have to do more to stop these senseless and heartbreaking shootings. https://t.co/laz1rt5X4C Ohio Governor John Kasich sent his condolences and offered state help in the case. “Saddened to learn about last night’s shooting in Cincinnati,” Kasich said on Twitter. “Our prayers are with the victims and families of all of those involved.” Cameo Nightlife’s Facebook page says it features “College Friday’s” for students 18 and older and “Saturday’s 21+ grown and sexy night.” The club, a large single-story structure, is a 7-mile (11 km) drive from downtown Cincinnati near the southeast corner of the city, the heart of the second largest metropolitan area in Ohio with more than 2 million residents.

592202660,2017-03-10 18:14:41,Orlando nightclub gunman's widow ordered to remain jailed,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-orlando-shooting-idUSKBN16H2RO?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews,en,False,,4442,Reuters,http://www.reuters.com,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Lisa Fernandez 3 Min Read (Reuters) - A federal judge in Florida on Friday revoked the bail and release order previously granted the widow of the gunman who killed 49 people at an Orlando nightclub, ruling that she remain jailed for the duration of criminal proceedings against her. U.S. District Judge Paul Byron of Orlando overruled a federal magistrate in Northern California who found earlier in March that Noor Salman, 30, posed no danger to the community or serious flight risk. In his order canceling Salman’s release, Byron said that her mother and uncle own an apartment in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, governed by the Palestinian National Authority, where Salman has previously stayed. Salman, who was living with her mother in the San Francisco Bay area after the Orlando massacre, was arrested in California on charges of obstructing justice and aiding her husband, Omar Mateen, in his attempt to provide material support to a terrorist organization. She is accused of concealing prior knowledge of her husband’s plans to carry out the attack and of concocting a cover story for him. Mateen, a U.S. citizen of Afghan descent, was killed by police at the end of a bloody three-hour shooting rampage last June at the Pulse, a gay nightclub, during which he paused to call emergency-911 dispatchers to profess his allegiance to Islamic State militants. It was the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history and the most lethal attack on American soil by Islamist militants since the suicide hijackings of jet airliners on Sept. 11, 2001. Salman has said she was herself a victim of domestic abuse by Mateen and was unaware of his intentions to attack the nightclub. U.S. Magistrate Judge Donna Ryu cast doubt on the weight of the government’s evidence against Salman in her March 1 order clearing the way for her conditional release on $500,000 bond to the custody her uncle in Rodeo, California. That release order was stayed by Byron the following day. Byron’s order on Friday means that Salman will remain in detention pending the outcome of the case. A hearing has been set for April 10, at which time the government will seek to have her transferred to custody in Florida. Salman’s lawyer Haitham “Sam” Amin acknowledged that the judge in the Florida federal court district where Salman is charged has the final say on the matter of her pretrial detention, saying, “That’s just the way it works.” Additional reporting and writing by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; editing by Grant McCool Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Omar Mateen and his wife Noor Salman. (Fox News) ORLANDO, Fla. – A personal injury attorney representing dozens of survivors and victims' relatives from the Orlando nightclub massacre filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the gunman's employer and wife, claiming they could have stopped Omar Mateen before the attack but didn't. The lawsuit was filed Wednesday in federal court in South Florida on behalf of almost five dozen of the survivors and family members of those killed at Pulse nightclub last June. Forty-nine people were killed at the gay nightclub in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Dozens more were injured. The lawsuit claims wrongful death, negligence and other counts. Personal injury attorney Antonio Romanucci said Mateen's employer, international security company G4S, knew he was mentally unstable yet allowed him to carry a gun in his job as a security guard. Mateen had a firearm license through his job, Romanucci told The Associated Press in an interview. JUDGE AGREES TO FREE WIDOW OF ORLANDO SHOOTER ""Mateen gave out so many warnings that someone should have reined this guy in,"" Romanucci said. ""They should have said, `You are not stable. You shouldn't have a weapon.""' While working as a security guard at the St. Lucie County Courthouse, Mateen was investigated by the FBI in 2013 after he told co-workers he had connections to terrorists and a mass shooter. He later told his bosses he had made that up to get his co-workers to stop teasing him about being Muslim and the FBI determined he was not a threat. ""We all deserve to know why Mateen's threats were met with silence,"" said Juan Jose Cufino Rodriguez, who now must use a wheelchair because of injuries he received in the shooting. A spokeswoman for the security firm, Monica Lewman-Garcia, said the lawsuit is without merit and that the company intends to vigorously defend itself. Romanucci said Mateen's wife, Noor Salman, knew her husband was going to carry out the killings. ORLANDO NIGHTCLUB GUNMAN'S WIFE PLEADS NOT GUILTY, BLOWS A KISS IN COURT Salman currently is in jail awaiting trial. She has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of aiding and abetting, and obstruction of justice. Prosecutors have said Salman accompanied her husband when he cased locations for potential terrorist attacks and knew ahead of time that he was planning the attack. ""Rather than warn authorities, she kept it a secret and acted as his accomplice,"" Romanucci said. Salman's defense attorney in her criminal case did not respond to an email seeking comment. The most recent effort to hold an outside company liable for a mass shooting has failed, at least for the time being. A judge in Connecticut last fall dismissed a lawsuit brought against the manufacturer of the rifle used in the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, saying a federal law shields gun manufacturers from most lawsuits over criminal use of their products. The Connecticut Supreme Court, though, has agreed to hear an appeal brought by the victims' families. The advantage of suing Mateen's employer, rather than the firearms manufacturer or seller, is that the victims don't have the obstacle of the federal law, said Sachin Pandya, a law professor at the University of Connecticut. But even if the plaintiffs can show Mateen's employer should have taken some precautions, ""you still have to show that what the employer failed to do caused the mass shooting,"" Pandya said. This isn't the first lawsuit to be filed by family members or victims of the Pulse massacre. Families of three patrons killed in the nightclub sued Facebook, Google and Twitter, claiming Mateen was radicalized through propaganda found through social media. A fund that was formed after the massacre has distributed almost $30 million to the survivors and relatives of victims. UCLA law professor Adam Winkler said the plaintiffs must show that the security firm had a duty, failed in its duty and is responsible for what happened. With Salman, they will have to show that she was a co-conspirator or that her failure to report that her husband was dangerous led to the attack. ""This will be a very challenging lawsuit,"" Winkler said. ""Victims of gun violence are looking for second-best options and that is what this is.""

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Omar Mateen and his wife Noor Salman. (Fox News) ORLANDO, Fla. – A personal injury attorney representing dozens of survivors and victims' relatives from the Orlando nightclub massacre filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the gunman's employer and wife, claiming they could have stopped Omar Mateen before the attack but didn't. The lawsuit was filed Wednesday in federal court in South Florida on behalf of almost five dozen of the survivors and family members of those killed at Pulse nightclub last June. Forty-nine people were killed at the gay nightclub in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Dozens more were injured. The lawsuit claims wrongful death, negligence and other counts. Personal injury attorney Antonio Romanucci said Mateen's employer, international security company G4S, knew he was mentally unstable yet allowed him to carry a gun in his job as a security guard. Mateen had a firearm license through his job, Romanucci told The Associated Press in an interview. JUDGE AGREES TO FREE WIDOW OF ORLANDO SHOOTER ""Mateen gave out so many warnings that someone should have reined this guy in,"" Romanucci said. ""They should have said, `You are not stable. You shouldn't have a weapon.""' While working as a security guard at the St. Lucie County Courthouse, Mateen was investigated by the FBI in 2013 after he told co-workers he had connections to terrorists and a mass shooter. He later told his bosses he had made that up to get his co-workers to stop teasing him about being Muslim and the FBI determined he was not a threat. ""We all deserve to know why Mateen's threats were met with silence,"" said Juan Jose Cufino Rodriguez, who now must use a wheelchair because of injuries he received in the shooting. A spokeswoman for the security firm, Monica Lewman-Garcia, said the lawsuit is without merit and that the company intends to vigorously defend itself. Romanucci said Mateen's wife, Noor Salman, knew her husband was going to carry out the killings. ORLANDO NIGHTCLUB GUNMAN'S WIFE PLEADS NOT GUILTY, BLOWS A KISS IN COURT Salman currently is in jail awaiting trial. She has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of aiding and abetting, and obstruction of justice. Prosecutors have said Salman accompanied her husband when he cased locations for potential terrorist attacks and knew ahead of time that he was planning the attack. ""Rather than warn authorities, she kept it a secret and acted as his accomplice,"" Romanucci said. Salman's defense attorney in her criminal case did not respond to an email seeking comment. The most recent effort to hold an outside company liable for a mass shooting has failed, at least for the time being. A judge in Connecticut last fall dismissed a lawsuit brought against the manufacturer of the rifle used in the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, saying a federal law shields gun manufacturers from most lawsuits over criminal use of their products. The Connecticut Supreme Court, though, has agreed to hear an appeal brought by the victims' families. The advantage of suing Mateen's employer, rather than the firearms manufacturer or seller, is that the victims don't have the obstacle of the federal law, said Sachin Pandya, a law professor at the University of Connecticut. But even if the plaintiffs can show Mateen's employer should have taken some precautions, ""you still have to show that what the employer failed to do caused the mass shooting,"" Pandya said. This isn't the first lawsuit to be filed by family members or victims of the Pulse massacre. Families of three patrons killed in the nightclub sued Facebook, Google and Twitter, claiming Mateen was radicalized through propaganda found through social media. A fund that was formed after the massacre has distributed almost $30 million to the survivors and relatives of victims. UCLA law professor Adam Winkler said the plaintiffs must show that the security firm had a duty, failed in its duty and is responsible for what happened. With Salman, they will have to show that she was a co-conspirator or that her failure to report that her husband was dangerous led to the attack. ""This will be a very challenging lawsuit,"" Winkler said. ""Victims of gun violence are looking for second-best options and that is what this is.""

He was 82. The Phillies announced his death but did not provide a cause. Mr. Green spent 62 years in baseball as a player, manager, general manager, team president and in other roles. As a pitcher, the 6-foot-5 Mr. Green went just 20-22 in the 1960s. “I was a 20-game winner,” he would joke, “it just took me five years to do it.” His most notable distinction on the mound might have been giving up the only grand slam launched by all-time hits leader Pete Rose. In 1980, with Rose playing first base on a team that included future Hall of Famers Mike Schmidt and Steve Carlton, Mr. Green guided the Phillies to the team’s first World Series crown, ending a drought that stretched back nearly a century. He got his team’s attention midway through the championship season after a loss in Pittsburgh, giving a clubhouse tirade so loud that writers outside the locker room at Three Rivers Stadium swore they could hear every word. In the World Series, his Phillies defeated the Kansas City Royals in six games. Mr. Green later managed the New York Yankees and New York Mets. He also was the general manager and president of the Chicago Cubs, and made a shrewd trade to get a young infielder from the Phillies, future Hall of Famer Ryne Sandberg. The deal helped turn a long-dormant franchise into a club that came within one win of reaching the 1984 World Series. “Dallas Green had an eye for talent,” Cubs chairman Tom Ricketts said in a statement. “Our fans can credit him for acquiring and drafting several of the most accomplished players to wear a Cubs uniform, including Hall of Famers Andre Dawson, Greg Maddux and Ryne Sandberg, as well as All-Stars like Shawon Dunston, Mark Grace and Rick Sutcliffe.” Mr. Green, who spent 46 years overall in the Phillies system and was an adviser to their last four managers, was notable for his commanding presence and shock of white hair. He was inducted into the team’s hall of fame. Dallas Green was born Aug. 4, 1934, in Newport, Del., and began his professional career after attending the University of Delaware. He pitched for the Phillies from 1960 through 1964, then had brief stints with the Washington Senators, Mets and Phillies again before retiring as a player in 1967. He began managing in the minor leagues the next year. He took over the Phillies’ managerial job in 1979. Mr. Green also was known for his rugged reputation, and he embraced it. Yet he was left in tears in 2011 when his 9-year-old granddaughter, Christina-Taylor Green, was shot and killed outside a grocery store in Tucson, as she went to see U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D), who was meeting constituents. Six people were killed in the mass shooting, and Giffords was seriously wounded. “I’m supposed to be a tough sucker, but I’m not very tough when it comes to this,” Mr. Green said at the time. One of his former players, Terry Francona, now manager of the Cleveland Indians, witnessed the effect her death had on Mr. Green. “I know when that happened with his granddaughter, the shooting, I know that that just tore him apart,” he said. “I saw him at a golf tournament for that, about a year and a half ago, and you could tell that just ate him alive.” Survivors include his wife of 59 years, Sylvia; four children; and five grandchildren.

Virginia is a purple state. Its statewide elected offices—governor, Lt. governor and attorney general—are all held by Democrats. To the casual observer or someone outside Virginia politics, one would expect the Democrats to also hold at the very least, a slim majority in the General Assembly. They would be wrong. Not only do Republicans hold the majority in the General Assembly, they hold an overwhelming majority. As in states like North Carolina, Texas, Florida and Indiana, to name just a few of the most egregious offenders, Virginia Republicans hold artificial control of the state legislature thanks to gerrymandering. While Democrats were asleep at the switch in 2010, the Koch brothers’ money quietly engineered this coup and were able to cheaply buy elections in rural areas like Virginia’s 9th district. Tea Party darling Morgan Griffith was the beneficiary of hundreds of thousands of their Citizens United dollars. Even he was surprised he’d unseated a popular incumbent, and the Koch brothers saw it as an enormous return on a comparatively small investment. Now, thanks to gerrymandering, statehouses across the country are carved into districts so skewed it would be almost impossible for a Democrat to win (and the other way around in a few rare cases). Maps of many of the districts look like snakes and toilet bowls. If every Democrat in the district voted and a good number of Republicans stayed home, it still wouldn’t make a difference. It’s why 79 out of 140 seats in the 2015 Virginia state election were uncontested. It was even worse in the House of Delegates, where 62 out of 100 of the races only had one name on the ballot. Author Andy Parker and his wife, Barbara, get a thumbs-up from an activist as they take part in a protest and vigil against gun violence on the third anniversary of the Sandy Hook mass shooting, outside the National Rifle Association headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia December 14, 2015. A Democratic state senator friend told me recently that there are no moderate Republicans left anymore. “There are only two kinds now,” he said. “The crazy ones, and the ones pretending to be crazy.” Some of the pretenders used to be moderate and reasonable. But thanks to redistricting, they have nowhere to go but further to the right. “I’ve had Republican colleagues tell me, ‘I’d love to work with you on guns, but if I do I’ll get ‘Cantored,’” he said, referring to Eric Cantor’s defeat at the hands of the Tea Party’s Dave Brat. And this is what goes on not just in Virginia, but nationwide. So as Everytown, Brady, Americans for Responsible Solutions, Moms Demand Action, Newtown Alliance, Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, et. al. keep advocating, and shaming the cowards who want guns everywhere, I’ve come to realize that the only way to make a significant dent on issues like guns, health care, climate change, or the laundry list under assault by those “crazy or pretending to be” is vote them the hell out of office. Even with the groundswell of anger, it will not realistically happen unless we get redistricting, and with the intractability of Republicans, it will only happen through the courts. With that in mind, I encourage not just GVP organizations, but all with a stake in a better, safer country to come together as one to bring lawsuits (as Virginia has done) and fight for nonpartisan redistricting. It addresses McAuliffe’s question about GVP groups working in unity. In the process, perhaps we can liberate moderate Republicans so they may be moderate again—so long as they are not already extinct. Without redistricting, trying to elect a Democrat in a gerrymandered district is truly Einstein’s definition of insanity.

But at least one leader within the city's African-American community hopes this time might be different, even though the shootings might have been sparked by an ongoing conflict. “This is just crazy. The community is in an uproar,” said the Rev. Peterson Mingo of Evanston’s Christ Temple Church. “We’ll be out there talking and listening to folks. But no one wants this kind of thing to happen – we all want to feel safe."" He's optimistic that could make a difference this time. “There are a lot of people distancing themselves from this and don’t want to be tied to it, so they are letting people know who was associated with it,” Mingo said. “People have been giving us names and we’re sending them to the police, and they say they’re cooperating.” Mingo said that he and other leaders of the African-American community will be working over the next few days to ease tensions to prevent further retaliation. 16 shot, 1 killed at Cameo nightclub in Cincinnati; suspects still at-large He also said there were several rumors flying around as to how the shootings started, but none could be substantiated. Cincinnati Police officials said Sunday there were multiple shooters. The violence broke out as part of a dispute inside the nightclub that might have started earlier in the day, or even earlier than that. ""I'm not going to spread those around,"" Mingo said, ""but it's unfortunate this would all start as a fight on a dance floor."" All told, 16 people were shot, one fatally. Two more are in critical condition as of press time. The city experienced such a spiral of violence two years ago, when there were a near-record number of shootings. Mingo and others said one shooting would beget another one. Revenge and retaliation were the norm. What's behind the rise in Cincinnati shootings? In fact, many said a single shooting in April 2015 in Over-The-Rhine led to nearly a dozen more that year. ""This is the kind of thing that leads to a downward spiral,"" Ohio state Sen. Cecil Thomas, D-North Avondale, said at the time. That cycle has become common in other major cities such as Chicago, although there is no indication shootings or homicides are on the rise in the nation as a whole, national experts say. ""But to someone who just lost a loved one, the trends don't matter,""  said Jim Bueermann, president of the Police Foundation, a nonpartisan police research group based in Washington, D.C. ""This becomes a community issue that needs to be solved with more than just more cops on the street."" Another expert says most mass shootings -- defined as four or more people shot in one instance -- are like the violence that broke out at Cameo. ""These are not just folks going berserk or terrorists,"" Northeastern University criminology professor James Alan Fox said. ""In many cases, these are deliberate and planned, but it's more out of anger or revenge. This one may or may not fit that description, but it fits in where groups are in dispute and violence remains an option. ""And if I were the Cincinnati police,"" Fox added, ""I'd be worried this would continue."" That could add to this year's rise in shootings and homicides. After hitting a five-year high in 2015, shootings declined last year only to go up so far this year. So far this year, Cincinnati has seen 15 homicides. Another issue that hasn't changed, however, is the relative ease of acquiring a gun. In 2014 and 2015, the Cincinnati Police Department partnered with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to expand a local task force created to take illegal guns off the street. The effort, which included adding two new CPD officers to the task force, resulted in more than 1,000 guns seized in 2014 and 2015. Up-to-date statistics on guns seized locally weren't yet available for 2016, But agents and officers said the rise in guns seized wasn't an indication there were more guns on the street. ""You can pretty much get a gun whenever you want,"" Mingo said. ATF officials were on scene Sunday morning at the nightclub. Agency officials said ATF had seized an unknown number of guns and were doing ""emergency traces"" to determine their origins. In addition, agents submitted any found bullets into the National Integrated Ballistics Network, which can track guns nationally by the ballistics reports from bullets found at crime scenes. Cameo nightclub shooting in Cincinnati: What we know now CPD has its own ballistics network machine at the Hamilton County Coroner's Office, which was reinstalled last year after the department lost it because of a lack of funding. Such a trace will discover the gun's initial legal owner. Agents will then need to conduct interviews to track it from there. It is unclear, however, what information would be made public since Congress shut off access to such reports earlier this decade. Mingo says the efforts in the wake of the Cameo shootings should be focused on reducing any further violence. ""Even though this happened down on Kellogg Avenue, we can't just say this was just affecting one neighborhood,"" Mingo said. ""This could have effects through all the neighborhoods."""
770804233,2017-03-07 06:00:00,A mass shooting shocked this small town. Now it's using a cutting-edge plan to prevent another.,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/03/mass-shooting-hesston-kansas-threat-assessment/,en,False,,1112,Mother Jones,http://www.motherjones.com/,"Mark FollmanMarch 7, 2017 Travis Heying/The Wichita Eagle/AP  On a breezy, unusually warm morning in late October, about 60 cops, mental health counselors, pastors, and business leaders are gathered inside a community center in Newton, Kansas for an intensive training. They sit mostly stone-faced around folding tables with coffee and pastries as Dr. Russell Palarea launches into a close analysis of the 1999 cult comedy Office Space. He explains why the behavior of Milton Waddams—a memorably pathetic cubicle dweller who suffers multiple indignities at the hands of his coworkers—holds the key to preventing a mass shooting. Palarea cues a series of clips that show Milton muttering under his breath about a prized red Swingline stapler taken from him by his bullying boss. As the film progresses, Milton’s socially awkward affect begins to turn more hostile. Eventually, he slinks into the boss’s office to repossess the stapler. Palarea pauses the video to underscore the telling escalation: “He’s taken matters into his own hands. He’s moved from idea to action.” By the final clip, Milton has burned down the office building and decamped to a beach resort in Mexico, where he mumbles about slipping strychnine into the guacamole. The dark comedy cracks a couple of smiles, serving both as an icebreaker and an initial lesson on the behavioral warning signs of an attack—an obsessive grievance, oblique threats about killing. Palarea, a forensic psychologist based in Washington, D.C., is a leading practitioner of threat assessment, an emerging field in which mental health and law enforcement experts work together to identify and deter individuals who may be poised to commit violent attacks. At his invitation, I’d come to this rural, heavily Mennonite region about 30 miles north of Wichita to observe him train an unprecedented group: Virtually every person in the room was connected to the events of February 25, 2016, when a disturbed employee at the lawnmower plant in nearby Hesston went on a rampage, killing three people and wounding 14 others.  In today’s era of active-shooter drills, leaders here in Harvey County didn’t want to focus just on how to respond in the event of another attack; they wanted to understand what led to the rampage and do what they could to ensure that another one, however unlikely, wouldn’t occur. They had learned about Palarea’s work after reading a 2015 story I wrote about an innovative strategy to prevent mass shootings and flew him in to teach them the fundamentals of threat assessment. Palarea has been in the threat assessment field for more than two decades, consulting with teams for the military, federal agencies, colleges, and corporations. When working in these various settings, he told me, he’s always emphasized the same theme: “You need to worry about this happening here.” But the theme in Harvey County was new: “Let’s heal from this and make sure it doesn’t happen again.”  I’d also come to Kansas to gain a deeper sense of the impact from the mass shooting, long after the news cameras were gone and the rest of America had moved on. Though the experience was still raw for many at the training, participants also expressed a sense of empowerment, in part because threat assessment defies the conventional wisdom that nothing can really be done to prevent mass shootings. “As a clinician, when you are confronted with the fact that there might be harm or danger, it’s isolating,” Karla Roth, a mental health counselor, told me. “To know that you can work together and not be alone in it—that’s hopeful.” Roth was among a small team from Prairie View Hospital in Newton that had rushed to Hesston to help in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. Initially, she didn’t know the status of her husband and son-in-law, who both worked inside the Excel facility. “It was horror. Then when I found out that they were OK, I just had to help,” she said. “This is a peaceful, quiet, want-to-live-in place. To have it happen here is something no one would have ever thought.” As the sun began to sink across the hayfields, Harvey County Sheriff Townsend “T.” Walton took me for a ride in his cruiser. He retraced a chaotic path that started around 5 p.m. that day. A burst of calls had come over the radio in the span of just a few minutes—one, two, and then three shootings. Gun violence had been relatively rare in Walton’s three decades of law enforcement in the region—and never anything like what he was hearing now. “In my head I’m going, ‘Is this terrorism?'” he recalled. It was just two months after the massacre in San Bernardino, California. “I’m not thinking, ‘This is a guy who just got served a protection-from-abuse letter and he’s flipped out.'”  Thirty-eight-year-old Cedric Ford was a recent transplant to Newton who worked the paint line at Excel. He had a criminal record in Florida and had come to the attention of local authorities for beating up his girlfriend. About three hours before the attack, “everything was totally normal” and Ford seemed “happy as all could be,” remarked a coworker who’d chatted with him in the Excel parking lot. Soon afterwards, sheriff’s deputies showed up at Excel to serve Ford with a protection order obtained by his girlfriend, apparently triggering his plan to go on a killing spree. Ford drove home, binged on meth and booze, and got back into his car with an AK-47 assault rifle and Glock handgun. Walton slowed down just past the intersection of 12th Street and Meridian, where he’d reached Ford’s first victims. Paramedics were rushing a middle-aged man with a blood-soaked shoulder out of a pickup truck strafed with bullet holes. The man’s two grandchildren cowering in the rear of the cab were, amazingly, unharmed. Just up the road, Ford had slammed his car to a halt in the road in front of his next victim, a 74-year-old woman who refused his demand to relinquish her vehicle. Miraculously, she also survived unscathed, ducking into the passenger seat as Ford fired through the driver’s side window. Ford succeeded in taking a truck from his third victim; the young man he shot in the leg along Old Highway 81 likely would have died if a sheriff’s deputy hadn’t arrived moments later with a tourniquet. (It is unclear why Ford went on the carjacking spree. His mental state was impaired and volatile, but he also may have been having trouble with his car.)  Walton was handling triage near 12th and Meridian when the radio erupted again: There was an active shooter inside Excel. Emergency dispatchers were quickly overwhelmed with nearly 50 calls from the plant. Walton immediately contacted his chief deputy: “Get ahold of everybody we have and send them to Hesston.” As police vehicles and ambulances screamed toward the town, Hesston police chief Doug Schroeder had already reached Excel and found pandemonium. The large glass doors at the front of the plant had been shot out. Scores of employees were fleeing across the parking lots, some helping wounded coworkers. Schroeder didn’t know who was shooting inside the mammoth facility, or where. But like most law enforcement leaders trained in the post-Columbine era, he knew he could not hesitate: An active shooter fires an average of every four seconds. And hundreds of people were still inside the building. Schroeder entered through a side door, his Colt AR-15 rifle in hand. He saw blood trails on the floor both to the left and the right. It was quiet. He went right, toward the main entrance, and began to hear gunfire. He moved through several more hallways to an office area, where he encountered a frightened employee. As they began to speak, the glass window in the door next to them shattered. Ford was just on the other side. “I’m going to get you,” Schroeder recalled him saying. The terrified employee bolted as the barrel of Ford’s rifle poked through the doorway. Ford came through the door and chased after the employee, unaware that Schroeder was just behind him. Schroeder took aim with his rifle and fired four shots. As Ford spun and went down, he raised his pistol and fired at Schroeder. He missed. “I saw the shell casings being ejected from the handgun, but I didn’t hear the shots,” Schroeder recalled. Many employees were hiding in nearby offices and Ford was carrying plenty more ammo when he was killed. There is no way to know how many lives were saved by the 41-year-old police chief, who waved off a flurry of praise and said he didn’t want his service to be defined by this one tragic event. “He’s a humble man,” Walton remarked as we pulled out of the Excel parking lot. “But he was a hero to me, and without a doubt to the hundreds that got to go home that night.” Excel employs about a thousand people, and many in this sparsely populated region are connected to someone who works at the plant. I visited Subrina Luke, a big-hearted woman with a wide smile, at her small apartment near the Wichita airport. She recalled how she was feeling grumpy when her fiancée Josh Higbee dropped her off at her job that morning: She was short on sleep and had forgotten her usual morning beverage, and she’d closed the car door without even saying goodbye. She was surprised when Higbee walked into the LensCrafters where she worked about 15 minutes later. “What are you doing here?” “Just bringing you a drink.” “You didn’t have to do that,” she said, cracking a grin. “Yes I did, woman. You would have been calling me for one.”  He kissed her goodbye. They’d been together for almost two years, sharing an apartment and raising Higbee’s spry four-year-old son from a prior relationship, who called Luke his mommy. A few hours later, the 31-year-old Higbee headed up the road to Excel. He mostly disliked his job as a welder on the second shift but was glad to be pulling in $23-plus an hour for his family. The first call came from their four-year-old’s babysitter, whose boyfriend also worked at Excel. “There was a shooting at the job,” she said. Luke’s heart dropped, but the babysitter knew no details and Luke wouldn’t be able to reach Higbee during his shift. She tried to focus on helping her customers. Her phone kept buzzing. During a break, she answered a call from one of Higbee’s coworkers. “I’m sorry,” the woman told her, “but Josh is gone.”  “I think I screamed so loud everyone in the mall heard me,” Luke recalled, fighting through tears as we sat in her living room, sunlight jagging through the window blinds. Higbee’s son, now five, was playing in the bedroom with a pastor who’d been helping Luke and the boy through the recovery process. The youngster seemed to be doing remarkably well, bounding over to me to show off a favorite toy and hugging Luke affectionately before going off to play while we talked. Luke reflected on being robbed of her partner, and the boy of his father. “He’s not going to get to see him graduate high school, he’s not going to even get to see him on his first day of school,” she said. “That’s what hurts the most, is what his dad is going to miss and what he’s going to miss.” She recalled when the boy grasped that Higbee wasn’t coming home again. “When you have a five-year-old break down and cry that he misses his dad, that is the most heartbreaking thing you can ever experience,” she said. “I picked him up and I said, ‘I miss him too, and I’m here for you when you need me.'” Luke struggled to recount her experience but said she was compelled to share it. People needed to know about who gets left behind and what they face, she said. “They should have psychological evaluations on everyone that owns a gun,” she continued. “I know that sounds crazy, but they have a way of telling people who are sane and not sane by things that they say. Not everyone should have a gun.” Why did the shooter do it? And could he have been stopped? Those twin questions haunt the survivors of every mass shooting, and they are always difficult to answer. Several hours into the threat assessment training, Palarea asked the community leaders whether they were comfortable discussing their own recent case. He’d confided to me over dinner the night before that he wasn’t sure he should even go there, given how fresh the attack still was. And there likely wouldn’t be any satisfying answers to those core questions. Nonetheless, the group agreed to proceed. The discussion was brief and somewhat circumspect (and not for public disclosure), but it underscored behaviors and circumstances to watch out for—domestic violence, drug abuse, menacing comments—and how to communicate more effectively among local agencies and institutions about individuals of concern. With the encouragement of event organizers, Palarea also decided that he would not leave out his most graphic training material. Ford’s attack was the latest in a long history of similar workplace violence. Palarea gave an in-depth analysis of a 1988 case in Sunnyvale, California, where Richard Farley went on a rampage at the technology company ESL Incorporated, killing seven coworkers and wounding four others. One of the survivors, Laura Black, had rejected Farley’s romantic advances; after he continued harassing her and turned abusive, ESL fired him. This was another case where a restraining order appeared to have triggered the plan for an attack: The day before the order obtained by Black was to go into permanent effect, Farley struck. Palarea highlighted how ESL’s termination of Farley had obviously turned out to be an inadequate solution to the threat—and may have worsened it. He showed a clip of an interview conducted with Farley after he was taken into custody. Once ESL had fired him, Farley stated coldly to investigators, “They lost control of me.” Punitive measures may well be necessary in response to aberrant behavior, Palarea explained, but understanding and dealing with the root grievance remains crucial.  A few months before the rampage at Excel, Ford had posted a video on Facebook: The footage showed him standing at the side of a road, firing dozens of rounds from an AK-47 into an empty field. Was it just a guy harmlessly blowing off some steam, or something more ominous? Perhaps a threat assessment team could have gained insight into Ford’s mental state and motivations. “It’s a matter of the community keeping eyes and ears open for concerns,” Palarea explains, “and reporting those concerns to authorities, whether school administrators, workplace threat assessment teams, or the police.” Once a tip comes in, a local threat assessment team scrutinizes the subject’s behavior and circumstances for signs that person could be contemplating an attack. Indicators can include the acquisition of weapons, surveillance of a target, or communicating threats about intended victims, whether directly or indirectly (as is more commonly the case). “Once we get a heads up, we can intervene,” says Palarea. “We can get the person mental health treatment if it’s appropriate. We can help the person resolve conflict in a positive way instead of using violence as a solution to the problem. We can get the people the help they need, to prevent these things from happening.”  Misty Elder-Serene, a director at Prairie View Hospital who arranged the training, told me that the community’s interest in threat assessment stemmed in part from its social ethics: Though rural Kansas is gun country, the heavily Mennonite region is also marked by a culture of pacifism and commitment to social justice, she said. Those crosscurrents prompted some interesting conversations after the mass shooting—not so much a debate about gun violence as a discussion about “how can we heal, and how can we be safe.” The concept of threat assessment resonated with its imperative to better understand and manage people who could turn dangerous. “It’s easy to just divide it into, ‘Oh well, it’s a gun problem’ or ‘It’s a mental health problem,'” remarked Dr. Mary Carman, a VP of psychological services at Prairie View. “It’s not. It is 12 problems, at least, that have to be addressed.” Some in the community expressed a striking degree of compassion for the killer. At a church in Hesston on the Sunday evening after the attack, the service included four candles: three for those murdered, and a fourth for Ford. One person who was wounded, speaking to a reporter from his hospital bed, talked about seeing the look in Ford’s eyes and understanding how much pain he was in. Several leaders at the training expressed the hope that their response to the tragedy might serve as a model for other communities upended by mass shootings. Carman, who has worked in mental health for more than three decades, noted that Prairie View Hospital was founded by World War II-era conscientious objectors who’d served in so-called insane asylums, where people with mental health issues were often treated brutally. The hospital’s founders felt there had to be a more humane and effective way to deal with disruptive, troubled people. “I think that passion still permeates the [local] culture,” Carman told me. Ford’s attack was shocking, “but we can do something. We can learn more about it. We can help teach others. Some of this can be prevented. Let’s not just sit here and do nothing.”  Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

Some 200 ordinary people went out for a night of music and fun but instead found themselves dodging bullets. That’s terrorism. Maybe not according to the common definition, but for those inside Cameo who felt intense fear for their lives, it's doubtful that definitions mattered in that moment. We hear a lot from politicians these days about the threat of a foreign enemy, yet terrorism happens every day on city streets around the country. This madness has to stop. Too many lives are lost every year in Cincinnati and nationwide to savage, mindless and inhuman gun violence. Mass shootings in America, tragically, are becoming too commonplace. We no longer wonder if a shooting will happen but rather when and where. Unfortunately, the latest and largest one in the United States this year just landed on Cincinnati's doorstep. In this time of tragedy, let's not yield to the typical knee-jerk reactions that focus solely on the race of the individuals involved or call for the closing of business establishments. The reality is no business or neighborhood is exempt from this type of reckless behavior. Sunday’s shooting could just as easily have happened at a local mall, restaurant or community event should these warring factions have collided there. What Cincinnati needs now is for its leadership and the community to come together and think this issue through, holistically. We need to find the most effective solutions to prevent these types of tragedies from happening here again. There is no single magic solution. And, yes, it is going to involve some soul searching by each of us. We have to wrestle with how we have become a society where some resort to guns as a first option for settling disputes. As Councilwoman Yvette Simpson said Monday, much of this violence is the result of people’s inability to handle and resolve conflict reasonably and rationally. Any positive movement forward has to start with greater cooperation with police. Someone knows who killed O’Bryan Spikes. Yet, witnesses remain tight-lipped. Every day a killer remains free is another day a grieving family is denied justice and closure and others in the city are placed in danger. If Cincinnati is ever going to see a reduction in gun violence, the anti-snitch culture that exists in some corners of the community has to die first. There is honor, not cowardice, in getting killers off the street. We recognize the code of the street and the risk of retribution. But the city has taken smart, bold steps through its Cincinnati Citizens Respecting Our Witnesses program to protect citizens who come forward with information. City Council and police can also work with local businesses – particularly bars and nightclubs - to ensure they have the best safety measures in place. Perhaps the city, in collaboration with business owners, should develop certain safety standards that are required for operations. Taking away liquor permits and shutting down a single bar won’t solve the problem; not when another establishment will simply come along and take its place. Metal detectors, security cameras, adequate security staff and even mandatory background checks of all employees might be some suggested standards. Everybody who goes out on the town for a night of fun, whether to a ballgame, restaurant, movie theater or nightclub, should have a reasonable expectation of leaving those venues alive. Anything to the contrary, as Mayor John Cranley said, is unacceptable."

Jones, who operates the website Infowars, had suggested that Comet Ping Pong in Washington, D.C., was hiding child sex slaves in its basement as part of a pedophilia ring supported by top Democratic politicians. No evidence ever emerged that such activities took place — the restaurant doesn’t even have a basement, as gunman Edgar Welch found out when he searched the premises. Jones cited government emails released by WikiLeaks that some people suggested contained “code words for human trafficking and/or pedophilia.” In a statement posted to his website and read Friday in a video broadcast, Jones blamed other outlets and social media sites for the “not appropriate” level of attention given to the restaurant and its owner, James Alefantis. “Neither Mr. Alefantis, nor his restaurant Comet Ping Pong, were involved in any human trafficking as was part of the theories about Pizzagate that were being written about in many media outlets and which we commented upon,” he said. Jones further conceded that his “commentaries” about the suspected scandal relied upon “third-party accounts of alleged activities and conduct at the restaurant,” as well as upon two unidentified reporters that he said “are no longer with us.” The radio host has endorsed several conspiracy theories, including claims that former President Barack Obama illegally wiretapped Donald Trump, that the U.S. government carried out the Sept. 11 terror attacks, and that the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School was a hoax. Jones’ apology came the same day that Welch, 28, pleaded guilty to a federal charge of transporting a firearm and ammunition, as well as a charge of assault with a dangerous weapon. The North Carolina man shot an AR-15 rifle two or three times when he visited the eatery in December, The Washington Post reports. He also had .38-caliber revolver with him when he entered the restaurant. Welch told The New York Times after his arrest that he was a listener of Jones’ program. This family of 5 wore matching Pizzagate outfits. pic.twitter.com/ADyZhN8MLV Alefantis said he has continued to receive threats from people who aren’t convinced that the pedophilia ring is a hoax. On Saturday, one day after Welch entered his guilty plea, protesters outside the White House demanded a formal investigation into the rumored scandal. A similar protest was held outside Comet Ping Pong last week, Alefantis said. “Honestly I wouldn’t wish this on anyone,” he told the Times. “These lies and falsehoods spread about me and my restaurant exist all over the place. The damage that has been done to my company and business and my community, all will remain forever.” Next up: lead Pizzagate theorist Titus Frost. Implying there's something secret in court papers for Comet Ping Pong shooter. pic.twitter.com/lCodi2dENN The timing of Jones’ apology suggests that he is more concerned about facing legal action than righting a wrong, The Washington Post pointed out. Jones said Alefantis wrote to him in February, demanding an apology and retraction of his broadcasts and postings on Pizzagate. Texas law dictates that Jones, who is based in Austin, had exactly one month to respond to Alefantis’ letter to avoid facing punitive damages in a libel suit. That deadline was Friday, the Post reported. Alefantis said in a statement that he was pleased with Jones’ apology and admission to having “repeatedly spread falsehoods about me and my restaurant,” but added that he wishes this action was taken months ago. A spokeswoman for Alefantis told the Post that the restaurant owner and his attorney are continuing to evaluate their legal claims.

It’s more complicated than that, but people of color seem to be shot by police in disproportionate numbers. By
      
        Peter Aldhous Posted on December 7, 2015, at 8:00 p.m. ET Demonstrators protest the death of Laquan McDonald On Monday, the Department of Justice announced a civil rights investigation into the Chicago Police Department, following the fatal shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald. Video of McDonald’s last moments, shot 16 times by a white officer, made a stark contrast with images of a handcuffed Robert Lewis Dear, the white suspect in the shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs — as activists were quick to point out. “We’ve been killed for far less,” tweeted DeRay Mckesson, an outspoken figure within the Black Lives Matter network. The #PlannedParenthood shooter is peacefully detained after shooting 5 officers. 

We've been killed for far less. In reality, “active shooter” incidents like the Planned Parenthood killings — as well as the mass shooting that devastated San Bernardino, California, less than a week later — are just too rare to provide useful information about how police respond to suspects of different races. In September 2014, the FBI released a study of 160 incidents in which a suspect was “actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people.” It didn’t address the question of race. But one of the authors, Pete Blair of Texas State University, provided BuzzFeed News with a more detailed breakdown of the outcomes. Out of 34 black suspects in the dataset, 10 were shot by police, compared to 25 out of 126 suspects of other races, who were mostly white. Proportionately, that means more black suspects were shot by police: 29% versus 20% for other races. But because the numbers are so small, this difference could be due to chance. What’s more, police responding to someone who is known to have killed or wounded, and who is still armed and dangerous, have very different rules of engagement compared to officers operating routinely on the streets. “By definition, the suspect has fired a weapon at someone. This, in general, makes the use of deadly force acceptable,” Blair told BuzzFeed News by email. Data gathered by major newspapers provides a better measure of the concerns raised by Black Lives Matter. The Washington Post is compiling information on people shot by police in 2015, including their race and whether they were armed. Of the 867 deaths the paper has logged so far, and for which there was information on race, 27.1% were black, 17.9% Latino, 51.1% non-Latino white, and 1.4% Asian. The latest estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau indicate that 13.2% of Americans are black, 17.4% Latino, 62.1% non-Latino white, and 5.4% Asian. This suggests that black Americans are disproportionately likely to be fatally shot by police. However, it’s hard to say from these simple percentages whether a typical encounter between police and a black suspect is more likely to end up with a shooting than if the suspect is white. That’s because black Americans also have disproportionately more interactions with police. One way of measuring this is through arrests: The latest data compiled by the FBI indicates that 28.3% of people arrested in 2013 for the crimes it monitors were black, and 16.6% were Latino — not so different from the percentages for fatal shootings by police. But as the animation below shows, in situations in which the suspect was unarmed, or where they were not clearly attacking the police or members of the public, the percentages by race skew further from the general population. Of the 82 unarmed suspects in the Washington Post’s data on fatal shootings by police, 37.8% were black and 20.7% were Latino. Data on police killings compiled by the Guardian paint a broadly similar picture: Of the 91 suspects shot by police that the paper classified as unarmed, and for which there was information on race, 36.3% were black and 19.8% were Latino. The Washington Post has also recorded whether or not each incident was an “attack in progress.” To meet this definition, the incident had to involve a suspect shooting at the police or members of the public, pointing a gun at them, or otherwise launching a violent assault — which could include an assault with a motor vehicle. The numbers for 231 incidents in which the suspect was not clearly launching an attack, and their race was known, again suggest that minorities face a greater danger of being fatally shot by law enforcement: 29.9% of these suspects were black, and 27.7% Latino.

597517547,2017-03-22 15:34:44,Massacre victims make grave accusation against gunman's employer,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/omar-mateen-employer-noor-salman-sued-nightclub-shooting-victims/,en,False,,1752,CBS News,http://www.cbsnews.com/,"Watch CBSN Live  March 22, 2017 / 11:53 AM
          / AP ORLANDO, Fla. -- A personal injury attorney representing some of the survivors of the Orlando nightclub massacre and families of the victims filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the gunman’s employer and wife, claiming they were able to stop Omar Mateen before the attack but didn’t. The lawsuit was filed Wednesday in federal court in South Florida on behalf of more than four dozen of the survivors and family members of those killed at Pulse nightclub last June. Forty-nine people were killed during the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history at the gay nightclub. Dozens more were injured. The lawsuit claims wrongful death, negligence and other counts. Personal injury attorney Antonio Romanucci said Mateen’s employer, international security company G4S, knew he was mentally unstable yet allowed him to carry a gun in his job as a security guard. Mateen had a firearm license through his job, Romanucci told The Associated Press in an interview. “Mateen gave out so many warnings that someone should have reined this guy in,” Romanucci said. “They should have said, ‘You are not stable. You shouldn’t have a weapon.’” While working as a security guard at the St. Lucie County Courthouse, Mateen was investigated by the FBI in 2013 after he told co-workers he had connections to terrorists and a mass shooter. He later told his bosses he had made that up to get his co-workers to stop teasing him about being Muslim and the FBI determined he was not a threat. A spokeswoman for the security firm, Monica Lewman-Garcia, said she couldn’t comment without seeing the lawsuit. Romanucci said Mateen’s wife, Noor Salman, knew her husband was going to carry out the killings. Salman currently is in jail awaiting trial. She has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of aiding and abetting, and obstruction of justice. Prosecutors have said Salman accompanied her husband when he cased locations for potential terrorist attacks and knew ahead of time that he was planning the attack. “Rather than warn authorities, she kept it a secret and acted as his accomplice,” Romanucci said. Salman’s defense attorney in her criminal case did not respond to an email seeking comment. The most recent effort to hold an outside company liable for a mass shooting has failed, at least for the time being. A judge in Connecticut last fall dismissed a lawsuit brought against the manufacturer of the rifle used in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting massacre, saying a federal law shields gun manufacturers from most lawsuits over criminal use of their products. The Connecticut Supreme Court, though, has agreed to hear an appeal brought by the victims’ families. The advantage of suing Mateen’s employer, rather than the firearms manufacturer or seller, is that the victims don’t have the obstacle of the federal law, said Sachin Pandya, a law professor at the University of Connecticut. But even if the plaintiffs can show Mateen’s employer should have taken some precautions, “you still have to show that what the employer failed to do caused the mass shooting,” Pandya said. This isn’t the first lawsuit to be filed by family members or victims of the Pulse massacre. Families of three patrons killed in the nightclub sued Facebook, Google and Twitter, claiming Mateen was radicalized through propaganda found through social media. A fund that was formed after the massacre has distributed almost $30 million to the survivors and family members of victims. UCLA law professor Adam Winkler said the plaintiffs are going to have to show that the security firm had a duty, failed in its duty and is responsible for what happened. With Salman, they are going to have to show that she was a co-conspirator or that her failure to report that her husband was dangerous led to the attack. “This will be a very challenging lawsuit,” Winkler said. “Victims of gun violence are looking for second-best options and that is what this is.” For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app First published on March 22, 2017 / 11:53 AM © 2017 The Associated Press.

We've received your submission. THURMONT, Md. — An 18-year-old student meticulously planned a mass shooting at her high school in which she intended to die, authorities in Maryland said Monday. A shotgun, ammunition and bomb-making materials including nails and fireworks were found at Nichole Cevario’s home in Thurmont on Thursday, Frederick County Sheriff Charles Jenkins said at a news conference. There is no evidence that anyone else was involved, Jenkins said. One of the teen’s parents notified Catoctin High School officials Thursday of a potential threat of violence and Cevario was removed from the classroom and turned over to investigators, the Frederick County sheriff’s office said in a statement. Cevario was later taken from the school to a hospital for an emergency evaluation and remains hospitalized, officials said. “This attack was prevented by the parents, who stepped forward,” Jenkins said. Cevario’s journal “clearly spelled out” detailed plans for an attack she had been working on for some time, including a timeline of the attack with her expectations for each stage, officials said. She had set April 5 as the day of the attack, the sheriff said. She was acquiring the materials and compiling details about school emergency procedures associated with drills conducted by school staff and on the school resource deputy. Cevario’s diary showed “evidence of mental health issues, emotional issues,” Jenkins said. There was no indication that bullying was an issue, but the diary showed “a lot of frustration in her personal life,” Jenkins said. Investigators don’t believe anyone was working with Cevario and they think they’ve eliminated any threat to the school and community, officials said. While explosive materials were located during the investigation, they weren’t combined in any form that created an explosive device. Investigators have obtained an arrest warrant charging Cevario with possession of explosive material with intent to create a destructive device and possession of incendiary material with the intent to create a destructive device. They say the warrants will be served when she is released from the hospital. A man who answered the phone at Cevario’s home and her attorney, Alan Winik, declined to comment. Share Selection"

          / AP PARIS -- A Frenchman once convicted of recruiting jihadi fighters stabbed a police commander to death outside his suburban Paris home, recording the attack and posting it on Facebook Live, French officials said Tuesday. The commander's partner and the attacker were found dead inside the home after a three-hour standoff with police. The couple's 3-year-old was in the house in Magnanville, about 35 miles west of Paris, but was unharmed. A police official said that at one point in the video the attacker puzzled over what to do with the child. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria's Amaq news agency cited an unnamed source as saying an ISIS fighter carried out the attack late Monday. While the extremist group has not officially claimed responsibility, French President Francois Hollande said it was ""incontestably a terrorist act"" and that France faces a threat ""of a very large scale."" Two people close to the attacker, identified as 25-year-old Larossi Abbala, were detained, authorities said Tuesday. They gave no details about them. France has been on particularly high alert as it hosts Europe's top sporting event, the monthlong European Championship soccer tournament, and is still under a state of emergency after the November ISIS attacks in Paris that killed 130 people. Hollande held an emergency security meeting Tuesday. ""France is not the only country concerned (by the terrorist threat), as we have seen, again, in the United States, in Orlando,"" he said. Abbala was from the nearby suburb of Mantes-la-Jolie and was sentenced in 2013 to three years in prison for recruiting fighters for jihad in Pakistan, according to two police officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to be publicly named discussing investigations. Two other security officials who also spoke on condition of anonymity said Abbala recorded a video during the knife attack. One official said the assailant posted the video on Facebook Live, the social media site's live feed. ISIS' Amaq news agency released a video later Tuesday showing Abballa that appeared to have been filmed inside the home of the slain couple as security forces closed in. In the video, Abballa says: ""I just killed a police officer and his wife."" He adds: ""The police are currently surrounding me."" The video was edited, and the victims do not appear. Neither does the couple's young son. A Facebook profile bearing the name Larossi Abballa -- which vanished from the internet early Tuesday -- showed a photo of a smiling, bearded man. Two recent posts featured videos critical of Israel and Saudi Arabia. The last publicly available post was a mock-up of the European Championship logo, highlighting what the poster said were masonic and occult symbols. ""Some will say we see evil everywhere!"" Abballa said in a message posted about 18 hours before the attack. On Tuesday, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve visited the police station in the suburb of Les Mureaux where 42-year-old Jean-Baptiste Salvaing worked. Police did not identify his partner but said she was an administrator for police in Mantes-La-Jolie. Cazeneuve said more than 100 people seen as potential threats have been arrested in France this year, including in recent weeks. France, like other countries in Europe, has seen a series of stabbings aimed at police officers or soldiers and carried out by Muslim radicals. ISIS has encouraged its supporters to stage such attacks. In Paris, the Eiffel Tower was lit up Monday night in the colors of a rainbow to honor victims of Saturday's mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, that killed at least 49 people. The gunman declared his allegiance to ISIS in phone calls to police, but his motives remain unclear.

594981962,2017-03-16 18:12:32,House Passes Bill To Help Vets With Mental Illness Buy Guns,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2017/03/16/house-bill-vets-guns_n_15414206.html,en,False,,27502,HuffPost,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/#,"Senior Congressional Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― The House of Representatives passed a bill Thursday to allow thousands of veterans who are disabled or have mental health conditions to buy guns. Under a law signed by President George W. Bush in the wake of a mass shooting at Virginia Tech in 2007, federal agencies such as the Veterans Administration were required to add the names of people deemed “mentally defective” to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, to block them from buying weapons. The VA defined such individuals as those who receive monetary benefits, and have a fiduciary because they lack “the mental capacity to manage his or her own financial affairs regarding disbursement of funds without limitation, and is either rated incompetent by VA or adjudged to be under legal disability by a court of competent jurisdiction.” There are an estimated 174,000 veterans who have been added to the background check system for many different reasons. The VA estimated in 2015 that about 19,000 of those people suffer from schizophrenia, 15,000 have severe post-traumatic stress, 11,000 suffer from dementia, about 5,000 are diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, and 4,000 are severely depressed. The bill, dubbed the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act, stops the VA from referring any of those veterans to the background check system. It passed 240 to 175, on a nearly party-line vote. Democrats who opposed the measure admitted that some veterans who could safely own weapons were caught up in the system, and said they would be open to a more carefully tailored measure that wouldn’t simply allow every veteran who has a mental illness to buy weapons. “I support veterans and I support veterans’ rights to defend themselves, but I don’t support crazy people having guns whether they are veterans or not,” Rep. Alcee Hastings (D-Fla.) said. “It’s just that simple.” Democrats especially pointed to high rates of veteran suicide, noting that of the approximately 20 veterans who take their own lives every day, about two-thirds of them do it with a gun. “There is a veteran suicide crisis in the country, a crisis that is enabled by the easy access to firearms,” said Rep. Elizabeth Esty (D-Conn.), who offered a counter-proposal that did not pass. A bipartisan group of retired generals, including David Petraeus, Michael Hayden and Stanley McChrystal, was also critical of the bill. “For these individuals, possession of a firearm could be fatal,” they wrote in a recent letter to leaders of both chambers of Congress. “The Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act would put at risk the safety of these veterans and our communities by changing the standard for gun prohibition, so the VA’s determinations would no longer stop a veteran from obtaining a gun,” they wrote. “Instead, the names of veterans already in the background check system would be erased, putting them at much greater risk of self-harm. This would be irresponsible, dangerous, and life threatening to those who need access to care, not weapons.” Republicans argued that the current rules deprive veterans of their Second Amendment rights without due process, although the recently passed 21st Century Cures Act added new steps to ensure veterans can challenge the VA’s decision to add them to the NICS. Rep. Phil Roe (R-Tenn.), the measure’s main sponsor, said he was “personally devastated” by the alarming veteran suicide rate, but that taking guns away from distressed vets was not the answer. “Denying veterans who have fiduciaries their constitutional rights will not end veteran suicide,” Roe said. “And it’s unfair to paint all veterans who may need a fiduciary with the same broad stroke, and to assume that just because someone needs assistance with their financial affairs that they may also be violent and a danger, or that they’re contemplating suicide. That’s just plain wrong.” The National Rifle Association praised the legislation, and urged the Senate to pass a similar bill there. “The constitutional rights of our veterans must be strongly protected,” said Chris W. Cox, executive director, NRA-ILA. “Needing help managing your money does not make you a danger to society. The NRA is pleased with the House vote today and we look forward to the Senate taking action soon.” This is the second major move the GOP has made this year to ensure that people with mental health conditions can buy guns. Congress passed a bill last month that blocked the Social Security Administration from referring the names of people who are mentally ill and unable to manage their affairs. This story has been updated to include comment from Cox. Senior Congressional Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how."

          / CBS News Congressional Republicans have been using an obscure law from 1996 to take an ax to rules finalized by federal agencies toward the end of the Obama administration -- and their elimination could have long-lasting effects. They’ve been relying on the power of the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to nullify regulations that, for example, would have provided communities with information about how to protect surface water from coal mining operations -- or one that would have directed the Social Security Administration to report the records of people with severe mental illnesses to the background check system used by licensed firearms dealers. So far, President Donald Trump has signed into law “resolutions of disapproval” that have now overturned seven Obama-era rules. Lawmakers have aggressively used the CRA to target these new regulations because they only have 60 days in session, from the start of the new Congress, to take advantage of the law’s authority to expedite the reversal process. That means Congress has until about mid-May to use this law to reverse agency-issued rules that they oppose. Any rules that were issued from mid-June 2016 to when President Obama left office in January are eligible to be targeted. During that period, more than 450 rules were finalized, according to Sam Batkins, director of regulatory policy at American Action Forum, who has closely tracked these regulations. “We’re seeing it used now in particular because I think President Trump has been very clear since the campaign that he would like to see fewer regulations,” said Susan Dudley, director of George Washington University’s Regulatory Studies Center. “I think that has been an invitation to Congress to look at regulations they’d like to disapprove.” The GOP has also focused on this tool, Dudley said, because the end of a president’s term is always marked by “an uptick in regulatory activity.” “It means it’s a target-rich environment because there are more regulations issued during the last six to eight months of a president’s term generally than otherwise,” she said. Republicans on Capitol Hill have already set a new record with their CRA-related activity. Until now, using the CRA to reverse a rule had only been done once before -- by President George W. Bush -- for a rule issued under the Clinton administration. It was issued by the Labor Department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration on standards for ergonomics in November 2000. The following March, the new Congress passed a CRA resolution to reverse the rule and Bush signed it into law. Resolutions of disapproval through the CRA only require a simple majority in both chambers to pass and is not subject to the filibuster. Beyond just the cancellation of the rule, there are consequences to consider. Once the rule is reversed, such a rule “may not be reissued in substantially the same form” ever unless Congress were to authorize it in the future. One of the seven rules reversed by Mr. Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress was part of the implementation of a 2007 law passed in the aftermath of the Virginia Tech mass shooting. It would have allowed the Social Security Administration to provide information to the gun background check system of people who have so severe a mental disability that they can’t perform any kind of work -- even part-time work -- and who were determined not to be able to manage their own benefits. “It was important because there is a significant lack of information about people who shouldn’t be able to just walk into a gun store and just pass a background check,” said Lindsay Nichols, senior attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. “The Social Security Administration is essentially now barred from looking at this issue anymore. They can’t rethink it, there’s no chance to amend it. The only opportunity to fix the problem depends on Congress.” In defense of Congress eliminating the rule, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s, R-California, office argued that “being disabled and needing help managing finances certainly shouldn’t limit a person’s Second Amendment rights.” Congress also overturned a rule, that has not yet been signed by the president, that was issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that was meant to protect bears, wolves and other carnivores on federal public lands from Alaska’s aggressive “predator control” policy on federal refuges. Another rule that has been nullified, that’s awaiting Mr. Trump’s signature, had been issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that would have prevented internet service providers from tracking their customers’ online behavior without their permission. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, spoke about the GOP effort to reverse the rule under the CRA on the House floor Tuesday. She argued that Republicans who disagreed with it could have gone back and tweaked it or have had it sent back to the FCC to be revised instead of using the CRA to destroy it. “This is about profit from America’s most intimate, personal information without our knowledge or our consent,” she said. “Republicans’ use of the Congressional Review Act will do permanent damage to the FCC to keep America’s personal information safe.” Carol Andress, director of legislative operations, climate and air at the Environmental Defense Fund, described the CRA as an “extraordinarily blunt instrument.” “The CRA has consequences far beyond that particular rule-making. It really does have a very dramatic effect,” Andress said. “The CRA has more to do with Congress wanting to, in my opinion, use a meat ax or a sledgehammer, rather than a scalpel, and to try to accelerate and instead of doing it thoughtfully.” Some of the other rules nullified by the president and Congress include two issued by the Department of Education that were related to teacher preparation and student aid funding as well as accountability regulations. Another rule that was reversed had been issued by the Defense Department, NASA and the General Services Administration which was designed to increase efficiency and cost savings in federal contracting by improving contractor compliance with labor laws. Surprisingly, Batkins, at the American Action Forum, noticed that Republicans have not used the CRA to target Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules. “We haven’t had a single EPA rule under the CRA yet,” he said. “Obviously, there are different ways to address past regulations, but I think after Election Day when the CRA became alive again after its 16-year dormancy period, if you told most people two education rules will be struck down, but zero EPA rules will be examined, I think that would have surprised a lot of people.” One of the hurdles, however, to reversing EPA regulations might just be securing enough votes in the Senate. The one concerning gun limits for the severely mentally ill received some bipartisan support in the Senate, passing with 57 votes in favor of reversing it. “Otherwise, it’s been fairly partisan and I think that’s sort of the big limiting factor to a lot of these CRA resolutions -- just getting 51 votes in the Senate,” he said. The administration has been using other tools to roll back EPA rules. On Tuesday, the president signed a sweeping executive order to initiate the process of dismantling environmental regulations implemented under Obama that were intended to aggressively combat climate change. In an interview with conservative radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt, Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, was asked if he would ever been in favor of Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price purposely issuing regulations that would normally be issued by a Democratic administration so that Congress could nullify them and prevent the department from ever revisiting them. “Yeah, you know, no one’s ever pitched that idea,” Ryan said. “I’ve never thought about that. That’s pretty clever.” Rebecca Shabad is a video reporter for CBS News Digital. First published on March 30, 2017 / 6:00 AM © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

All rights reserved First Look Institute is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. A concerted effort by the CIA produced a library of software attacks to crack into Android smartphones and Apple iPhones, including some that could take full control of the devices, according to documents in a trove of files released by WikiLeaks Tuesday. The attacks allow for varying levels of access — many powerful enough to allow the attacker to remotely take over the “kernel,” the heart of the operating system that controls the operation of the phone, or at least to have so-called “root” access, meaning extensive control over files and software processes on a device. These types of techniques would give access to information like geolocation, communications, contacts, and more. They would most likely be useful for targeted hacking, rather than mass surveillance. Indeed, one document describes a process by which a specific unit within the CIA “develops software exploits and implants for high priority target cellphones for intelligence collection.” The WikiLeaks documents also include detailed charts concerning specific attacks the CIA can apparently perform on different types of cellphones and operating systems, including recent versions of iOS and Android — in addition to attacks the CIA has borrowed from other, public sources of malware. Some of the exploits, in addition to those purportedly developed by the CIA, were discovered and released by cybersecurity companies, hacker groups, and independent researchers, and purchased, downloaded, or otherwise acquired by the CIA, in some cases through other members of the intelligence community, including the FBI, NSA, and the NSA’s British counterpart GCHQ , the documents indicate. One borrowed attack, Shamoon, is a notorious computer virus capable of stealing data and then completely destroying hardware. Persistence, a tool found by the CIA, allows the agency control over the device whenever it boots up again. Another acquired attack, SwampMonkey, allows CIA to get root privileges on undisclosed Android devices. “This is a very impressive list,” tweeted former GCHQ analyst Matt Tait, noting that at least some of the attacks appeared to still be viable. Matt Green, cryptographer at Johns Hopkins University, agreed the leak was “impressive,” but concluded there weren’t many “technically surprising” hacks. This lack of originality may have stemmed from a desire on the part of the agency to avoid detection, judging from one document contained in the trove, in which apparent CIA personnel discuss an NSA hacking toolkit known as Equation Group and its public exposure. It was also previously known that the CIA was targeting smartphones; drawing on top-secret documents, The Intercept in 2015 reported on an agency campaign to crack into the iPhone and other Apple products. In addition to the CIA’s efforts, an FBI hacking division, the Remote Operations Unit, has also been working to discover exploits in iPhones, one of the WikiLeaks documents, the iOS hacking chart, indicates. Last February, while investigating the perpetrator of a mass shooting in San Bernardino, the FBI attempted argued in court that Apple was obligated to give the FBI access to its phones by producing a weakened version of the device’s operating system. If the WikiLeaks documents are authentic, it would appear FBI and other elements of the intelligence community are already deeply involved in discovering their own way into iPhones. The compromise of the documents also calls into question government assurances in the San Bernardino case that any exploit developed by Apple to allow the FBI access to the killer’s phone would never be exposed to criminals or nation states. The CIA and FBI hacking revelations originate with a trove of more than 8,000 documents released by WikiLeaks, which said the files originated from a CIA network and date from 2013 to 2016. The CIA declined to comment on the documents, which also disclose techniques the CIA allegedly developed to turn so-called smart televisions into listening devices. Apple did not respond to a request for comment, and Google declined to comment, though indicated it was actively investigating the revelations. It’s unclear who might have given WikiLeaks access to the documents; a summary of the material hosted on the site implies it came from a whistleblower who “wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons.” But the leaker could also be an outsider, including one employed by a foreign power. “This could be as much about Russia as CIA or WikiLeaks,” tweeted Jason Healey, Senior Research Scholar at Columbia University’s School for International and Public Affairs “A continuation of teardown of U.S. government.” German iOS security researcher Stefan Esser, according to a chart in the file database, developed an iOS exploit named “Ironic,” which gives access to the operating system kernel — though the hack “died” when iPhones were updated to iOS8, the chart appears to indicate. Esser, in an email to The Intercept, said he is not one to comb through classified documents or comment on them — but noted CIA had apparently “used public research of mine about a vulnerability that Apple required four attempts at fixing” in iOS. Esser’s bug was already public when CIA included it in its database. He also noted that a training slide he presented during a security conference in 2015 was also included in the dump. WikiLeaks discussed, without referring to any specific document, access levels CIA has to encrypted applications, including popular Open Whisper Systems’ application Signal — though the documents do not indicate CIA has broken the app’s end-to-end encryption. Rather, it suggests the CIA can “bypass” the encryption by hacking into the phone itself, then reading everything on it, including data stored within any app — including messages from Telegram, WhatsApp, and other secure messaging apps. If a phone itself is compromised, there’s little to be done to prevent an attacker from accessing what’s on it. Some of the attacks are what are known as “zero days” — exploitation paths hackers can use that vendors are completely unaware of, giving the vendors no time — zero days — to fix their products. WikiLeaks said the documents indicate the CIA has violated commitments made by the Obama administration to disclose serious software vulnerabilities to vendors to improve the security of their products. The administration developed a system called the Vulnerabilities Equities Process to allow various government entities to help determine when it’s better for national security to disclose unpatched vulnerabilities and when it’s better to take advantage of them to hunt targets. At least some civil liberties advocates agree with the WikiLeaks assessment. “Access Now condemns the stockpiling of vulnerabilities, calls for limits on government hacking and protections for human rights, and urges immediate reforms to the Vulnerabilities Equities Process,” Nathan White, senior legislative manager for digital rights group Access Now, wrote in response to the new leak in a press release.

While expressing support for a political mechanism to remove dictator Bashar al-Assad, Çavuşoğlu did not affirm Erdoğan’s statement expressly stating that Turkey’s army had entered Syria “to end the rule of the tyrant Assad, who terrorizes with state terror.”  “From the beginning, our target has been very clear. We have been in Syria to defeat Daesh and to clear many cities in Manbij from Daesh and make those areas Daesh-free or terrorist-free zones.” He added, “our position regarding Assad has also been very clear. Assad has killed more than 600,000 innocent people,” he said, noting that the Syrian dictator has used chemical weapons “including chlorine gas to carry out these atrocities.” Turkey has been accused of playing a “double game” on the Islamic State in Syria. President Erdoğan has been accused of helping the terrorist organization in their fight against Kurdish rebels and Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad. An ex-Islamic State militant told Newsweek in 2014 that the Islamic State saw Turkey as its ally: “ISIS commanders told us to fear nothing at all because there was full cooperation with the Turks.” The man, who was named “Sherko Omer” for his safety, said, “ISIS and Turkey cooperate together on the ground on the basis that they have a common enemy to destroy, the Kurds.” Last year, Al-Monitor reported, “The Cumhuriyet daily’s editor-in-chief Can Dundar and Ankara representative Erdem Gul landed behind bars Nov. 27 for reporting that Turkish intelligence shipped weapons to radical Islamists in Syria. Though they were released three months later, they eventually received jail terms for revealing state secrets.” In October 2015, nearly 130 people were killed in Turkey after two suspected Islamic State bombers attacked a rally put on by a group of pro-Kurdish, leftists, the first of a string of bombings and mass shooting the Islamic State has taken credit for within Turkey. In November, Erdoğan announced that Turkey was in Syria “to end the rule of the tyrant al-Assad who terrorizes with state terror.” He insisted that his forces were not in Syria for “any other reason.” Several days later, Erdoğan reportedly clarified his statement in what was seen as backpedaling of his admission to seeing that Assad’s regime is toppled, saying instead that his troops are only in Syria to target “terror organizations.” In the month of March 2016 alone, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has documented the deaths of 2,658 people, including 588 civilians. There were 125 children killed in the conflict. They died in bombings, by mortars, IEDs or random gunfire. Çavuşoğlu asked, “Are we going to legitimize such a regime?” Asked whether removal of Assad is currently possible without leaving a power vacuum ripe for exploitation by Iran and Hezbollah, Çavuşoğlu said, “there will be no vacuum if the political process works.” He added, “while we are defeating Daesh on the ground, we need to focus on political solutions,” which include talks in both Astana and Geneva. Pressed further and asked if he still felt this way considering Iran’s role in the region, which has been instrumental in causing instability, he added, “Iran’s role there is very clear. It’s dominating not only in Syria but also dominating the politics in Iraq. Therefore, if we only target Daesh, we will be serving the interests of Iran and Hezbollah and other groups on the ground. I don’t think we prefer this.” Breitbart News reported that the Pentagon, which has been working with the Syrian Kurdish YPG and the Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga to take Daesh down, has cast some doubt on Turkey’s role in taking Daesh out in the northern reaches of Syria. “We have made clear… that we are open to a Turkish role in the continued operations to defeat ISIS in northern Syria,” We haven’t come to an agreement about what that role will be or if there will be one,” Pentagon spokesman Col. John Dorrian said. “But we talk to Turkey through military channels and I believe at diplomatic levels every day.” He added, “I think I’d like to leave it at we would expect Kurds to be involved. And that’s probably about where we’re at.” Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNaz. This article has been edited since publication.

(Photo by Carolyn Cole/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) Salman was arrested on Jan. 16 in her mother's home in Rodeo,  where she and her 4-year-old son were staying. She was indicted four days earlier by a federal grand jury in  Orlando on two criminal charges. The charges are aiding her husband in providing material support  to a foreign terrorist organization, namely the Islamic State; and  obstructing justice by misleading local police and the FBI when she was  questioned in the hours following the attack. Because Salman was arrested within the jurisdiction of the U.S.  District Court for Northern California, her initial court appearances were in  federal court in Oakland. On March 1, Ryu ruled that she could be released on a $500,000  bond into the custody of her uncle, Abdallah Salman of Rodeo, under  conditions of home confinement except for court hearings. But on March 10, U.S. District Judge Paul Byron of Orlando, the  trial judge assigned to the case, overruled Ryu and denied bail. He agreed  with prosecutors' claim that Salman is a danger to the community and a flight  risk. Salman is now appealing Byron's ruling to the 11th U.S. Court of  Appeals in Atlanta. Salman, one of four daughters in a family of Palestinian descent,  was born in Richmond and grew up in Rodeo. She met Mateen on an online dating  site and moved with him to Fort Pierce, Fla., when they married. After the nightclub shooting, Salman lived with an aunt in  Mississippi for several months before moving to her mother's house in Rodeo. Salman was entitled under court rules to have further hearings in  federal court in Oakland to confirm her identity and determine whether she  should be transferred to Florida. She waived those rights in her court filing  on Tuesday. Prosecutors contend Salman accompanied her husband on three trips  to case possible shooting sites and was aware that her husband left their  home on the evening of June 11 with a rifle and a backpack full of  ammunition. Defense attorneys maintain that she was abused by Mateen, has  learning disabilities, has no strong religious or political views and was not  aware of his plans."

Two nonfiction books tackle the timely issue of inequality: one from the point of view of constitutional governance, the other from the perspective of your dental health. Philatelists and oenophiles, we’ve got you covered: “The One-Cent Magenta” tracks the travels of the most valuable stamp in the world, while “Cork Dork” chronicles the oft-hungover adventures of a would-be sommelier (and pairs nicely with something sweet). Radhika JonesEditorial Director, Books CORK DORK: A Wine-Fueled Adventure Among the Obsessive Sommeliers, Big Bottle Hunters, and Rogue Scientists Who Taught Me to Live for Taste, by Bianca Bosker. (Penguin Books. $17.) Bosker was an editor at The Huffington Post when she became obsessed with the world of sommeliers and decided to change her life. For 18 months, she shadowed renowned wine fanatics, hoping to understand their obsession and to become a certified sommelier herself. Her book is the result of her immersion in that world. Our critic Jennifer Senior wrote: “Bosker’s journey into this sodden universe is thrilling, and she tells her story with gonzo élan.” THE CRISIS OF THE MIDDLE-CLASS CONSTITUTION: Why Economic Inequality Threatens Our Republic, by Ganesh Sitaraman. (Knopf, $28.) Inequality is one of the defining challenges of our time, but beyond unfairness, what is its ultimate threat? Sitaraman argues in his fine book — both a history and a call to arms — that the Constitution is premised on the existence of a thriving middle class, and that the current explosion of inequality will destroy it. TEETH: The Story of Beauty, Inequality, and the Struggle for Oral Health in America, by Mary Otto. (New Press, $26.95.) If the idea of death from tooth decay is shocking, it might be because we so rarely talk about the condition of our teeth as a serious health issue — or a serious class issue. This health journalist’s history of dentistry illuminates the class line between those who spend thousands of dollars to perfect their smiles and others who suffer from, and even die of, preventable tooth decay. QUICKSAND, by Malin Persson Giolito. Translated by Rachel Willson-Broyles. (Other Press, $25.95.) A Swedish teenager on trial for her involvement in a mass shooting instigated by her boyfriend is the focus of this courtroom procedural, the first of the author’s four novels to be translated into English. As the facts of the case are revealed, so are the economic and racial tensions underlying the contemporary Swedish setting. THIS LONG PURSUIT: Reflections of a Romantic Biographer, by Richard Holmes. (Pantheon, $30.) Holmes is well known as the biographer of Shelley, Coleridge and others. “He does for biography what Cheryl Strayed did for the Pacific Crest Trail,” Stacy Schiff writes in our review. The third of his books about the art of writing other people’s lives examines some familiar and other lesser-known figures as well as his own ecstatic practice. THE ONE-CENT MAGENTA: Inside the Quest to Own the Most Valuable Stamp in the World, by James Barron. (Algonquin, $23.95.) A scrap of reddish paper with faded lettering and clipped corners starts out in 1856 with a face value of a penny. A century and a half later, it’s worth $9.5 million. A Times reporter’s account of this unique 19th-century stamp is a window into the romance — and obsession — of stamp-collecting. TIES, by Domenico Starnone. Translated by Jhumpa Lahiri. (Europa, paper, $16.) The husband of the woman who has been identified as Elena Ferrante offers an emotionally powerful novel about a fraying marriage that is a sort of sequel to Ferrante’s “Days of Abandonment.” Lahiri provides a fluid translation and a brilliant introduction explaining her own preoccupation with the book. ILL WILL, by Dan Chaon. (Ballantine, $28.) Chaon’s dark, disturbing literary thriller encompasses drug addiction, accusations of satanic abuse and a self-deluding Midwestern psychologist. Chaon dismantles his timeline like a film editor, building the narrative with short, urgent chapters told from different perspectives.

In the early hours of Monday morning, police stepped in to quell the dispute between Allen Cashe and his girlfriend, Latina Herring, at a Sanford, FL, gas station. Then hours later they responded to a 911 call for an “aggravated battery” and found Cashe arguing with Herring outside on the front yard of her home, WFTV 9 reported. Just after 6 a.m. that day, the police were summoned once again, but this time they found a blood bath. “The scene was one of the worst scenes our investigators have ever walked into,” Sanford police spokeswoman Bianca Gillett told reporters. “It was horrific.” Police say Cashe had shown up that morning armed with an AK-47-style assault weapon, kicked down the door and shot and killed Herring. He then shot her father and her two sons, 7 and 8 years old, who were sleeping on the couch. The 8-year-old subsequently died. Fleeing the scene, Cashe opened fire on two strangers, including an 18-year-old high school student waiting at a nearby bus stop. That was Monday. One day before, in Cincinnati, OH, 17 people were shot at the Cameo nightclub when a “mini brawl” sparked gunmen to open fire on a crowd of approximately 200 revelers, according to WCPO Cincinnati. It marked the bloodiest shooting in the nation so far this year, according to Cincinnati.com and the Gun Violence Archive. “The hospital was so crowded, all the seats were taken in the emergency room,” one local pastor told The Cincinnati Enquirer. “The emergency room was literally standing room only.” The city’s mayor said the gun rampage marked “one of the worst days in the history of Cincinnati.” Here’s what was so strange about the media coverage for the mass shootings that unfolded within one day of each other, and which involved 23 shooting victims: There wasn’t very much news coverage at all, outside of the local press attention. For instance, The New York Times did not cover either gun rampage this week, according to search via Nexis. (Two AP articles were aggregated on the Times’ website.) Broadcast news coverage of the Cincinnati nightclub mass shooting and Sanford shooting was equally light, according to a review of transcripts in Nexis and Snapstream for the terms “Cincinnati” or “nightclub” and “Sanford.” The Florida shooting was mentioned on broadcast news just once, on ABC World News Tonight on Monday. CBS mentioned the nightclub tragedy just three times, including during Sunday’s evening news broadcast and again Monday morning during CBS This Morning and CBS Morning News. ABC ran two segments on Sunday on the shows Good Morning America and World News Sunday, while NBC mentioned the shooting on its Sunday and Monday editions of Today. The outlets appear to have moved on from 2017’s highest victim shooting as of Monday morning. The timid coverage of these shootings reminds us the extent to which horrific news, and specifically horrific gun-related news, gets quietly tabled and pushed aside. Gun violence in America represents a raging health epidemic, but you’d never know it based on the news coverage. That’s important because how can a nation have a debate about gun violence when even mass shootings aren’t thoroughly covered as big news? And please note this: Virtually all of the 23 victims in both the Florida and Ohio gun rampages were people of color. Is it possible the national news media would have devoted more time and resources to the Cincinnati gun rampage if it had occurred at a mostly white nightclub on a college campus? I certainly think it’s likely. Meanwhile, what else would have triggered wildly different media responses to the Sanford and Cincinnati killings? Answer: any hint of a terrorism angle. On that front, news consumers know the drill: When a mass shooting involves the possibility of terrorism, media outlets compete to see who can produce more reports and, usually, who can produce the most heated analysis. For instance, it sure seemed to me like cable news interest in the mass shooting at the Fort Lauderdale, FL, airport in January dropped when it became clear that the gun massacre was committed by a homegrown shooter unrelated to jihad terror. There’s obviously been a normalization over the years for mass shootings, as the lacking coverage from Sanford and Cincinnati indicates. And who benefits from that normalization? The National Rifle Association and the Republican Party, which supports the gun group’s every radical initiative. Of course the NRA and the GOP don’t want the press to treat gun violence as the health crisis that it is. And of course the NRA and the GOP do want to the press to casually look away as mass shootings unfold with random deadliness. The conservative movement is in favor of normalizing gun violence and of the media omitting context about the epidemic. Many conservatives don’t want the press to constantly connect the dots between American gun rampages, or to chronically mention that roughly 100,000 people are shot in America each year. Or that each week, approximately 1,565 patients are treated in emergency rooms for firearm-related injuries. Or that among the world’s 23 wealthiest countries, 87 percent of all children killed by guns are American children. Interestingly, just days before the deadly Florida and Ohio shootings, CNN.com did what more news outlets ought to be doing: It published a comprehensive piece that put American gun violence in perspective by detailing the extraordinary economic cost the country pays each year to treat our gun epidemic. Note that the death toll is likely to rise in coming years because “patients are now more likely to die from a gunshot wound than they were even 10 years ago,” presumably thanks to the increasingly powerful and sophisticated guns being manufactured and sold in the U.S. “To be blunt, instead of a 2-centimeter hole, you are seeing a 3-centimeter hole with more damage. And there are more wounds, so the team has to repair more damage,” the study’s author told CNN. Following the shootout in Cincinnati, where panicked clubgoers were forced to flee rampaging gunmen, the Cincinnati Enquirer stepped forward with a truth-telling editorial (emphasis added): We hear a lot from politicians these days about the threat of a foreign enemy, yet terrorism happens every day on city streets around the country. This madness has to stop. Too many lives are lost every year in Cincinnati and nationwide to savage, mindless and inhuman gun violence. Mass shootings in America, tragically, are becoming too commonplace. One way to address the madness is for the press to see the country’s gun violence for what it is ― a uniquely American epidemic.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. In this June 12, 2016 file photo, law enforcement officials work at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., following a mass shooting. (AP) The wife of the man responsible for a mass shooting last year at a gay Orlando nightclub has been turned over to U.S. marshals and is believed to be headed back to Central Florida, authorities said Thursday. Alameda sheriff's Sgt. Ray Kelly said Noor Salman left the Santa Rita jail Thursday and he said he believes she will be turned over to authorities in Florida. Salman's husband, Omar Mateen, pledged allegiance to the Islamic State during the attack at the Pulse nightclub on June 12, 2015. The attack at the nightclub, which is on the edge of downtown Orlando, is now considered the deadliest mass shooting in recent U.S. history. The shooting left 49 people dead and dozens more wounded. Salman, 30, agreed to be moved to Florida in a court filing submitted Tuesday to U.S. Magistrate Donna Ryu of Oakland. On Thursday, Ryu signed an order committing Salman to the jurisdiction of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida in Orlando and directing the U.S. Marshals Service to transport her there. Salman's lawyer, Charles Swift of the Texas-based Constitutional Law Center for Muslims in America, said today it will be up to the Marshals Service to decide when she will be transferred. ""I expect it to be fairly soon,"" said Swift. He said he could not comment further on the case. Salman moved to Northern California to be with family after last June's massacre at the nightclub, and she had her first court appearance in California even though charges were filed in Orlando. At the last of several Oakland hearings, U.S. Magistrate Judge Donna Ryu said it was ""debatable"" whether the government has enough evidence to convict Salman and ordered her released from jail until trial. But a A federal judge in Orlando revoked bond so she was returned to jail. Salman has pleaded not guilty to charges of aiding and abetting, and obstruction of justice. Prosecutors have said Salman accompanied her husband when he cased locations for potential terrorist attacks, knew ahead of time that he was planning the attack and misled FBI agents about what she knew about her husband's plans.

666707481,2017-03-10 13:55:01,Samantha Bee Asks the Right Questions About Orlando,https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/06/samantha-bee-asks-the-right-questions-about-orlando/486998/,en,False,television,1110,Atlantic,http://www.theatlantic.com/,"The Full Frontal host’s furious monologue on the massacre in Florida underscores her ascendency as the best political voice on late-night television. Since the departure of Jon Stewart from The Daily Show last August, the oft-repeated question has been who would step into his shoes and assume the role of America’s late-night conscience. The incredible evolution of Stewart from journeyman stand-up comedian to his generation’s Walter Cronkite was one Stewart himself mocked because he hosted, as he put it, “the fake news.” Nonetheless, his straightforward breakdowns of political hypocrisy and media obfuscation were a valuable service in an increasingly polarized cable-news world, and his retirement left a vacuum waiting to be filled—perhaps by none other than his former colleague Samantha Bee. Bee’s TBS show Full Frontal only airs once a week (Mondays at 10:30 p.m.), but unlike her peer John Oliver’s Last Week Tonight on HBO, she’s used her platform to quickly and adeptly react to current events with blunt language (Oliver will often zero in on less widely reported topics). Her seven-minute opening monologue addressing the mass shooting in Orlando has already spread across the internet since it aired Monday night—and its power comes from its stark candor. “Is it okay if, instead of making jokes, I just scream for seven minutes until we cut to commercial?” Bee asks. It’s not just okay—it’s exactly what her audience wants. In this new age of late-night TV, ratings matter less than having an online industry of viral content ready to react to every episode of your show. Dozens of websites got used to simply linking to Stewart’s segments on YouTube as a way to drive easy traffic, and the practice has also become commonplace for Oliver and Late Night’s Seth Meyers (less so for Stewart’s direct successor Trevor Noah, who has struggled to find his voice at The Daily Show). Since its acclaimed launch in February, Full Frontal has merited that kind of online attention, and TBS quickly extended its 13-episode order through the end of 2016. It still only airs weekly, a distinction Bee prefers because it lets her and her writers hone the message of every episode. The daily grind that Stewart faced at The Daily Show (which aired four times a week) may have contributed to his overall tone, which was far more arch and cynical, only rarely breaking to advocate for causes Stewart thought were particularly underserved (like the plight of 9/11 veterans). Bee is much more direct, and her segment on Orlando forcefully brushed aside the language of “thoughts and prayers” that many politicians lean on in times of crisis, advocating for more direct action. “Love does not win unless we start loving each other enough to fix our fucking problems,” she said, before laying out clear statistics about America’s lax gun control and its relationship to mass shootings. Bee explored the success of assault-weapons bans in countries like Australia, which enacted them after a series of mass shootings in the ’80s and ’90s, and has seen no mass shootings since. She railed against the wishy-washy speechifying of Florida Governor Rick Scott; she groaned at a particular line from Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who said, “This could have happened anywhere in the world. Unfortunately, today was Orlando’s turn.” “Orlando’s turn? Mass shootings are so normalized now that we’re taking turns?” Bee cries in response. “This wasn’t even Orlando’s first high-profile gun murder of the weekend. Stop thinking, and do something to improve our society!” In a recent interview with Vulture, Louis C.K. named Bee as the comedian he’s most excited to watch on television, saying that while lots of hosts are “talking about the same shit,” she’s “hitting a chord like nobody else,” an observation he credited to her polemical style, her ability to be fearlessly and unapologetically angry. “All of these guys, even Jon Stewart, who’s a fucking genius, he would get upset but he always stayed cool. Guys like to be a little above it ... Even after ranting, they suddenly calm down and smile,” C.K. said. “But Samantha doesn’t do that.” Indeed, Bee doesn’t do that—and that’s why her straightforward approach seems refreshing in such polarized political times. Comedians like Stewart helped redraw the lines between comedy and advocacy, and not only is Bee taking up his mantle, but she’s also doing something new with it. In a crowded media world, viewers appreciate directness, even from their entertainers. Bee’s voice stands out precisely because she’s not trying to appeal to broad common denominators. She knows her audience, and she knows how to appeal to them: by speaking loud and clear."

657538835,2017-03-17 12:51:11,"To reduce suicides, look at guns - Washington Post",https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/wonkblog/suicide-rates/,en,False,"medicine and health,murders and attempted murders,suicides and suicide attempts",2,Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,"washingtonpost.com
Â© 1996-2016 The Washington Post Help and Contact Us Terms of Service Privacy Policy Submissions and Discussion Policy RSS Terms of Service Ad Choices Limiting gun access could cut the suicide rate by over a third. The last year has shined a harsh light on two distressing realities of American life. Mass shootings are becoming more common. And more Americans are killing themselves. These disturbing trends share something in common, obvious in the first case and less so in the second: guns. In the past three months, America experienced the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history, with 49 people killed in Orlando, and new data showed that suicide rates have reached a three-decade high. Although mass shootings get most of the attention, experts say that the growing suicide rate reveals the much bigger effect of widespread firearm availability in the United States â and claims thousands more lives. In 2014, 42,773 Americans killed themselves according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Half did so with guns. Thatâs not only more than the number of Americans who were killed in mass shootings, itâs more than the number of people who were killed with guns in homicides and accidents combined. The fast-rising U.S. suicide rate is in sharp contrast to what's happening in most other developed countries, where suicide rates have declined significantly over the past decade. PCT CHANGE IN SUICIDE RATE SINCE 2000, AGE-ADJUSTED United States 20% +17% 10 United Kingdom 0 Canada -10 Australia France -20 2000 2006 2012 PERCENT CHANGE IN SUICIDE RATE SINCE 2000, AGE-ADJUSTED 20% United States +17% 10 0 United Kingdom Canada Australia -10 France -20 2000 2004 2008 2012 These figures are age-adjusted, meaning they account for how many people are at especially suicide-prone ages. Separating out the role of guns in facilitating these suicides, in relation to an array of psychological and cultural factors, is difficult. One way to estimate the impact, according to experts on guns and suicide, is to analyze the U.S. suicide rate in comparison with similar countries. Nobody knows what would happen if firearm availability in the United States resembled levels of other developed countries. But thereâs widespread agreement among experts that the suicide rate would decline significantly. To illustrate this point, we calculated what would happen to the U.S. suicide rate if the percentage of suicides involving firearms were similar to that of four other Western countries (Australia, Canada, France and Britain) for which data is available. Fifty percent of Americans who commit suicide do so with a gun. In our hypothetical, we assume that figure is just 9 percent â the average level of those four other Western countries. We then assumed the remaining 41 percent would try to commit suicide by other methods, such as suffocation or poisoning. Because none of these methods is as lethal as a gun, fewer people would succeed at committing suicide than if they used firearms. Of course, in reality, itâs possible some people in this 41 percent would not attempt suicide otherwise; we assume they all do to keep our estimate conservative. We calculate that the total suicide rate would decline by 20 to 38 percent, depending on the alternative methods used. (You can read more about our methodology, which was endorsed by three top suicide and guns experts.) = 50 SUICIDES The U.S. in 2014 If the U.S. were like other countries About 30,000 suicides 42,773 suicides Firearm suicides could decrease by 82 percent. Suicides overall could decrease by 20 to 38 percent. If the U.S. were like other countries The U.S. in 2014 = 50 SUICIDES About 30,000 suicides 42,773 suicides Firearm suicides could decrease by 82 percent. Suicides overall  could decrease by 20 to 38 percent. âIf we had a shift in the number of people who attempt to end their life with a firearm â who chose other means â we would very greatly reduce our suicide rate,â according to Daniel Webster, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. [Why white death rates for women in rural America are spiking] And for those who did not die, it's likely they would not try to commit suicide again. A 2002 review of 90 studies indicates that more than 90 percent of people who survive a suicide attempt wonât die from a later suicide attempt either. The lethality of guns The wide availability of guns in America matters for suicide because guns are more lethal than any other suicide method. According to CDC data, which includes suicide attempts that were serious enough that the person ended up in the emergency room or dead, 90 percent of people who shoot themselves die, but only 4 percent of people who poison themselves die. Other common suicide methods fall between these: 81 percent of people who attempt to suffocate themselves die and 32 percent of those who jump from significant heights are killed. Overall, 11 percent of all people who attempt suicide â and get far enough to end up in an emergency room and thus in the CDCâs data â die. Experts contend if you reduce a suicidal personâs access to firearms, itâs likely to save his life, even if he attempts suicide with a different method. This goes beyond the inherent lethality of the method; the time it takes to execute a suicide attempt plays a huge role in survival. With a gunshot, death is often instant. With an overdose, it can take hours for a person to die, creating more opportunities for a person to call for help or for someone to intervene. âAnything that builds in delay is working in your favor because that fever-pitch time when youâre actually willing to swallow the poison or pull the trigger is often fairly narrow,â said Cathy Barber, who directs a suicide-reduction campaign at the Harvard School of Public Health. [As white women between 25 and 55 die at spiking rates, a close look at one tragedy] The greater lethality of firearm suicides is apparent in the significant gap between male and female suicides. Men are much more likely to choose to use a gun, whereas women are much more likely to poison themselves. The result: Women attempt suicide 50 percent more often than men yet die from it a third as often. The graphic below shows the breakdown among five common suicide methods for each gender. Men use guns in 16 percent of attempts, leading to 55 percent of male fatalities. Women use guns in only 2 percent of attempts and make up 31 percent of female fatalities. Percent of men and women who attempt self-harm or commit suicide, by method MEN WOMEN The spiking suicide rate The rising suicide rate over the past 15 years is mainly driven by a growing death toll among white Americans. According to CDC data, between 1999 and 2014, the suicide rate among whites rose 42 percent. The rate has grown much faster among women than men, but because men commit suicide more often than women, their suicides still made up 69 percent of the increase. Firearm suicides increased 28 percent between 1999 and 2014 and accounted for 39 percent of the overall increase in such deaths. Other methods have increased across the board, too. Over the 15 years, the suffocation rate more than doubled, accounting for 42 percent of the total increase in suicides. Several experts were unable to name the reason behind the increasing frequency of suffocations. U.S. SUICIDES (POPULATION ADJUSTED) Controlling for population growth, about 10,000 more people died by suicide in 2014 than in 1999. 10,000 20,000 30,000 1999 2014 39 percent  42 percent  13 percent by firearm by suffocation by poisoning U.S. SUICIDES (POPULATION ADJUSTED) 10,000 20,000 30,000 1999 2014 Controlling for population growth, about 10,000 more people died by suicide in 2014 than in 1999. 39 percent 42 percent  13 percent by firearm by suffocation by poisoning Gun access is a risk factor for suicide Research shows that the longer it takes someone to obtain a weapon â such as if they have to go out and buy one or if the state has a mandatory waiting period â the more likely they are to decide against killing themselves or choose an alternative, less lethal method. âIf you have an impulse for suicide and you have easy access to a gun, youâre very likely to be successful at committing suicide. But if access to that means is not there, then the impulse may pass,â said E. Michael Lewiecki, a professor at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine who has researched suicide and public policy. [A group of middle-aged whites in the U.S. is dying at a startling rate] One 2006 study found that from the 1980s to the 2000s, every 10 percent decline in gun ownership in a census region accompanied a 2.5 percent drop in suicide rates. There are numerous other studies that show similar results. This pattern becomes clear when looking state by state. The states that have higher rates of gun ownership, where people have more access to guns, also have higher rates of suicide. Suicides are twice as common in states with high gun ownership than those with low gun ownership, even after controlling for rates of mental illness and other factors, according to a 2007 study. Gun Ownership Rate 5.2%  Suicide rate per 100,000 5.8  The pattern is clear in other countries, too. In 2006, the Israeli military enacted a policy preventing soldiers from taking their weapons home from the base on the weekends. Suicides among soldiers younger than 24 decreased by 40 percent. In Australia in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the government implemented a series of laws in an effort to reduce access to the most lethal methods of suicide, such as a gun buy-back program and regulations on cars making it harder to get a lethal dose of carbon monoxide. By the late 2000s, the suicide rate dropped nearly 40 percent. How government policy fits in Itâs difficult to know, of course, exactly how much gun-control measures could decrease access to guns and therefore divert suicidal Americans to less lethal methods. In a political climate where gun-control measures targeting criminals and suspected terrorists are contested, itâs hard to imagine legislators jumping at the chance to take guns away from, for instance, Americans who live with a severely depressed family member. Especially because the highest gun-access and the highest suicide rates tend to be in states with Republican-controlled legislatures. Even if legislators were prepared to reduce gun access, identifying at-risk individuals is challenging. [A new divide on American death] States across the country have programs focused on educating people, especially mental-health professionals and parents, about the risks of firearm suicides. Some government organizations have programs distributing trigger locks to gun owners. More recently, some states have allowed judges to begin issuing âgun violence restraining orders.â With these, individuals can go to civil court to get a gun temporarily confiscated from an owner who is a threat to himself or others. Many states have also implemented measures to keep guns away from teenagers, for whom suicide is the third most common cause of death. Minimum age requirements for purchasing weapons or requiring gun locks when children live in the house can have a significant impact. A 2004 study found that in the 18 states that introduced the gun locks rule, there was an 8.3 percent decline in teen suicides. Garden-variety gun-licensing laws can also have an effect, Webster said. Not only does obtaining a permit create a possibly life-saving delay, but âsome of the same risk factors for criminal action are the same risk factors for suicide â substance abuse, impulsive behavior, aggressive behavior, frankly being male.â So the permitting process may weed out suicidal individuals. But all of these laws make it more difficult for Americans without criminal records or suicidal thoughts to purchase arms, which makes them highly unpopular with gun rights advocates. These laws are wrongfully âassuming guns actually contribute to suicide,â according to John Lott, president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, which advocates for gun rights. In his view, they arenât a factor in the suicide rate, citing a survey by the right-leaning Cato Institute. He argues that, in the absence of guns, people will instead choose a different suicide method and carry it through to completion. In Lottâs view, these gun restrictions actually increase the total death toll, as they donât decrease suicide rates but leave people unarmed against violent intruders. âItâs just common sense that if someone can go to a store and buy a gun and get some ammunition and take it home in the next 20 minutes, that guy can go shoot himself,"" Lewiecki said. ""Itâs so easy to get that lethal weapon.â You can read about the methodology behind this piece here.

But none of those titles mattered when Hassan Aden landed on U.S. soil earlier this month in Trump’s America. All that mattered was that his name is Hassan. And that, apparently, was enough for U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers to question everything else about Aden’s life. Aden, 52, is a retired Greenville, N.C., police chief and a former deputy chief with the Alexandria police in Virginia. So why was a lifelong law enforcement official detained for an hour and a half at New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport when he returned from a trip to Paris? Was he being profiled because of his Muslim-sounding first name? [Former deputy police chief says he was detained because of his name] Hassan is an immigrant, the Italian-born son of an Italian mother and a Somali father. He has lived in this country for 42 years and is a naturalized U.S. citizen. He has a U.S. passport and TSA Pre-check. He’s been out of the country dozens of times without incident. Not this time. “This experience has left me feeling vulnerable and unsure of the future of a country that was once great and that I proudly called my own,” Aden wrote in a long Facebook post describing the unnerving detention. “This experience makes me question if this is indeed home.” A spokeswoman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection denied that officers were engaging in profiling. In an email to my Post colleague Faiz Siddiqui, she said the agency bars race and ethnicity from being considered in screening “in all but the most exceptional circumstances.” So what was exceptional about a retired cop coming home from celebrating his mother’s 80th birthday? One thing: his first name. Aden was treated shamefully. The America that stops Chief Aden, locks him in a room and judges him is an America filled with fear and ignorance, not “the land of the free and the home of the brave.” Want to say this is about terrorism? Give. Us. A. Break. This guy’s a cop. He knows what’s up. “Prior to this administration, I frequently attended meetings at the White House and advised on national police policy reforms — all that to say that If this can happen to me, it can happen to anyone with attributes that can be ‘profiled,’ ”Aden wrote. “No one is safe from this type of unlawful government intrusion.” An agent told him that “my name was used as an alias by someone on some watch list. He stated that he sent my information to another agency to de-conflict and clear me, so that I could gain passage into the United States . . . my own country!!!” After about an hour, another officer saw the situation, swooped in, pressed for status updates, cleared him within a half-hour and apologized. She understood what was going on. Something very similar happened twice in a month to Muhammad Ali Jr., son of the former heavyweight champion. Most recently, he was detained at Reagan National Airport on March 10. Chris Mancini, his attorney, said Ali was trying to board a JetBlue flight when security officials rejected his identification and repeatedly asked where he was from. No mention of a watch list. A name was all they had to go on. (And what a name. Duh.) The ultimate irony: Ali and his mother had come to Washington to lobby for an end to racial profiling. If names are now the criterion being used to keep America safe, let’s do it right and take a good look at other names of those who have terrorized our country. James. Men named James set the standard for homegrown terrorist shootings in America. We can start with James Earl Ray, the man who assassinated Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. One of the forefathers of the modern American mass shooting is James Oliver Huberty, who killed 21 people at a McDonald’s in San Ysidro, Calif., in 1984. Ever heard the term “going postal”? You guessed it — a trend brought to you by a James. In 1983, disgruntled postal worker James Brooks shot the postmaster and injured his supervisor in the Anniston, Ala., post office where he had worked. The former employee shooting up a workplace? Ah, yes, James D. Simpson killed five co-workers, including the bosses, in a Corpus Christi, Tex., office in 1995. And, of course, there’s James Holmes, who in 2012 shot up the audience in a dark movie theater in Aurora, Colo., killing 12 people. Wow. Maybe we can only keep America safe if we stop James. Every single one of them. No? So maybe stopping someone because their name sounds suspicious isn’t legal, moral or even American. Yup, that’s what I thought.

A young man was killed, authorities said. Fifteen others were wounded, one of whom remains in extremely critical condition. Chief Eliot Isaac of the Cincinnati Police Department said an argument among several men escalated into a shooting about 1:30 a.m. Sunday inside the club, located next to a smattering of bars and auto-parts stores a few miles outside downtown Cincinnati. What the fight was about or who was involved remains unknown. Police also do not know who the shooters are or whether they were shot, Isaac told reporters. No arrests have been made. Police ruled out the possibility of a terrorist attack. “To the victims, what difference does it make? They’ve been terrorized with gun violence. Innocent victims,” Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley told reporters during a news conference Sunday. “It’s important for everyone to understand that people were just having a good time and ended up getting shot. It’s totally unacceptable.” “This is going to be a long process for us to solve this crime — crimes, plural — and heal as a community,” Cranley added. Police: Shooting that wounded officers, killed man, occurred in gunfire exchange Police initially said 15 people were shot, but that number was later changed to 16. Earlier reports also indicated that only one gunman was involved, but Isaac confirmed later Sunday that the gunfire came from multiple shooters. Lt. Paul Neudigate, the assistant police chief, told NBC affiliate WLWT that many of the witnesses tried to get out of the club immediately after shots were fired, but he said investigators are interviewing those they’ve been able to identify. Many of the victims are in stable condition at hospitals or have been treated and released. Two are in critical condition at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer. One remains in “extremely critical condition,” Isaac said. Neudigate told WLWT that it’s one of the worst shootings he has seen in his nearly 30 years with the police department. Other incidents have been reported at the club in the past, but Sunday morning’s shooting “is the worst by far,” Capt. Kimberly Williams told WXIX. Williams also said that the club had a “very young crowd” at the time of the shooting. What we know about the Orlando nightclub mass shooting Cameo allows admission to anyone older than 18 on Friday nights, which cater to college students, according to the club’s Facebook page. Saturday nights are promoted as “grown and sexy” nights that cater to those 21 and older. “I don’t want to make speculations on what happened, but just keep an eye on your young people,” Williams told reporters at a news conference, according to ABC News. “I don’t know if this had to do with an argument or neighborhood issues or what. Just, I’m asking parents … know what your young people are doing.” Authorities said four police officers were already at the club providing security when shots were fired. They tried to revive one of the victims, but that person died, the Associated Press reported. Police have identified him as O’Bryan Spikes, 27. Isaac said officers typically provide security outside establishments that serve liquor. Jeff Ruby, owner of several restaurants in Cincinnati, Louisville and Nashville, is offering a $10,000 reward to anyone who can provide information leading to an arrest, the restaurateur announced in a tweet Sunday morning. Ohio Gov. John Kasich said he has instructed administration officials to offer assistance to investigators.

By ERIN DURKIN, ANNA GRONEWOLD and DEANNA GARCIA 10/15/2021 07:21 AM EDT Presented by Equinor Attorney General Tish James is scheduled to be in Buffalo today as part of her statewide “HealNY” tour to pass out settlement money aimed at combating the opioid crisis. Pretty standard Friday fare, right? Not this time. What ups the interesting factor for this particular appearance is that it’s on the home turf of Western New York’s favorite daughter, Gov. Kathy Hochul, who James is weighing a primary challenge against next year. Hochul is also scheduled to be in Erie County today. She doesn’t have any public events scheduled (yet). This is with the backdrop of frenetic campaigning in Buffalo’s mayoral race, a contest just weeks away that pits democratic socialist India Walton, who won the primary this summer, against incumbent Byron Brown, who launched a write-in campaign shortly after his loss. Other potential gubernatorial contenders have already made the Buffalo trip — New York City public advocate Jumaane Williams has been fundraising for Walton and Rep. Tom Suozzi last weekend came out in support of Brown. Over the past two weeks, James has kept her visits focused on opioid money (when she says “on-topic questions only,” she means it) and that’s likely the case today. She hasn’t endorsed either mayoral candidate, nor has Hochul. But the ultimate results of the mayoral race — which is dividing and defining Democrats across the state — could be a harbinger of what’s to come in 2022, our Bill Mahoney writes this morning. Candidates and operatives have questions: Do voters want an everyperson for executive office? How energized will white ethnics be against socialism? Will Black voters embrace the left? Can a write-in campaign be successful? Next month, Buffalo might have some of those answers, and anyone *maybe* thinking about just *possibly* eyeing a new office next year knows it. IT’S FRIDAY. Got tips, suggestions or thoughts? Let us know ... By email: [email protected] and [email protected], or on Twitter: @erinmdurkin and @annagronewold WHERE’S KATHY? In Erie County with no announced public schedule. WHERE’S BILL? Appearing on WNYC’s Brian Lehrer show. A message from Equinor: Can a wind turbine generate more than electricity? We believe it can. At Equinor, we’re planning to power 2,000,000 New York homes with homegrown, renewable energy that will also boost the economy and generate jobs. And we will do more. Equinor is a broad energy company with an ambitious net-zero target for 2050. We’re pursuing the Empire Wind and Beacon Wind offshore wind developments in the US and quickly becoming a leader in this growing industry.  “More suicides at NYC jails this year than past five combined, report says,” by New York Post’s Ben Feuerherd: “The number of prisoners who killed themselves while in the custody of the city’s Department of Correction in 2021 is more than the past five years combined, according to data released Thursday by a federal monitor. From January to September this year, five people in DOC custody committed suicide, compared to a total of four from 2016 to 2020, the federal monitoring team for the troubled Rikers Island wrote in a status report filed in Manhattan federal court.” “‘They Haven't Really Enforced It’: MTA Has Trouble Complying With New Vax-Or-Test Mandate,” by WNYC’s Stephen Nessen: “It’s been over a week and a half since the state required all MTA employees to either be vaccinated or submit a weekly negative COVID test result, and the agency appears to be having a hard time complying with the requirement. The MTA’s overall vaccination rate across the agency stands at 68%, as of Wednesday, although the agency said it could be as high as 75% because workers may not yet have uploaded their vaccine cards to the agency’s system. The agency also appears to be not checking whether unvaccinated workers have undergone a weekly COVID test.” “De Blasio: 84% of all NYC adults have received at least one COVID shot, 6 million vaccinated,” by New York Daily News’ Michael Gartland: “Six million New York City residents have received at least one dose of the COVID vaccine — a milestone Mayor de Blasio touted Thursday as ‘unbelievable.’ ‘This is a staggering figure. This is how we’re coming back,’ the mayor said. ‘What has it meant? As vaccinations have gone up, hospitalizations have gone down.’ To that point, de Blasio noted that the hospitalization rate for COVID stood at .69 per 100,000 city residents as of Thursday, a new low for the Big Apple. ‘We haven’t been this low since the beginning of the pandemic,’ said Dr. Mitchell Katz, CEO of Health + Hospitals, the city’s network of public hospitals and clinics.” — Democratic mayoral nominee Eric Adams said Thursday that he would consider a vaccine mandate for public school students provided the Food and Drug Administration has signed off on the jab for students’ respective age groups. “I won’t do it for those under 11 because it’s not approved,” Adams told Fox5 during a television appearance. “Federal monitor ‘gravely concerned’ over NYC jails’ ‘dangerous conditions’,” by PIX11’s Corey Crockett: “A new report issued by a federal monitoring team assigned to keep watch over New York City’s jail system says the conditions at the city-run correction facilities are 'dangerous' and 'gravely concerning,' posing a 'high risk of harm' to inmates and staff. The report, filed Thursday, went as far as to question the competency of department leaders and claim only systemic changed and court-ordered relief can change the Department of Correction’s 'significant deficiencies.' The federal monitor cited staggering statistics from the past 10 months: more than 700 reported “uses of force” by staff and more than 50 slashing or stabbings, along with other security and operational failures.” “Stunts, cats and crime: Sliwa’s colorful run for NYC mayor,” by The Associated Press’ Michelle L. Price: “The Republican insists his campaign this year is not a long shot, but more of a David-and-Goliath slingshot, with Sliwa as a streetwise 'man of the people' speaking out about crime and disorder. 'I’m the only Republican who can go into neighborhoods where the only Republican they’ve ever seen is Abraham Lincoln on a $5 bill and be well-received,' Sliwa told The Associated Press this week in an interview at his cat-filled apartment. 'I think most people don’t necessarily see me as a Republican. They see me more as a populist. ""That’s Curtis. We know him,""' Sliwa said. He says the fact that he won the Republican nomination despite having never voted for Trump is a sign he can improbably win over Democrats.” THE MILKEN INSTITUTE GLOBAL CONFERENCE 2021 IS HERE: POLITICO is excited to partner with the Milken Institute to produce a special edition ""Global Insider” newsletter featuring exclusive coverage and insights from one of the largest and most influential gatherings of experts reinventing finance, health, technology, philanthropy, industry and media.

Kathy Hochul’s campaign for a full term as New York governor. The group’s endorsement opens doors to deep-pocketed donors and seasoned campaign strategists across the country. But for Ms. Hochul, the state’s first female governor, it may prove more valuable as an early stamp of approval for female activists, donors and operatives as she attempts to freeze out potential rivals and head off a raucous Democratic primary next year. In its endorsement, Emily’s List cited Ms. Hochul’s management of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, as well as steps she has taken since assuming office in August to clean up a culture of intimidation and harassment that flourished in Albany under her predecessor, Andrew M. Cuomo.” SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND told us in July (pre-Gov. Kathy Hochul) she has no interest in the state’s executive mansion: You can still, “Count Kirsten Gillibrand out for the New York governor's race,” by USA Today Network’s Jon Campbell. “IG: Vaccine sign-up error caused by technical flaws, not cybercrime,” by Newsday’s Michael Gormley: “The state inspector general’s investigation of an incident in which more than 28,000 New Yorkers were able to gain premature appointments to COVID-19 vaccines before the general public found several technical flaws, but found no cybercriminals hacked the system. ‘The inspector general found no evidence that systems had been compromised by cybercriminals or that state employees or contractors who possessed advanced access to scheduling links leaked them to the public,’ the report stated. The investigation by Acting Inspector General Robyn Adair began in January after the state’s COVID-19 vaccine scheduling website had been accessed more than 24 hours before the website was to go online for the public. The report found a ‘misunderstanding’ among the system’s programmers and other workers that allowed public access to vaccine sites when New Yorkers tried to schedule a vaccine.” “Legislators Push to Make Phone Calls in New York’s Jails and Prisons Free,” by New York Focus’ Rachel M. Cohen: “Asked about the cost of the calls, Dukes began to cry. ‘It was very expensive,’ she said amid tears. ‘At times I didn’t eat lunch, or I denied myself other things. The fees that I incurred were enough for me to take a second job.’ Dukes said she tried to budget at least $200 a month. A new legislative effort in New York aims to address the exorbitant costs of communicating with incarcerated people, costs that bear heavily on family members and particularly low-income women and people of color. The yet-to-be introduced legislation would aim to make not just phone calls but also email and video conferencing free, modeled off a bill Connecticut enacted earlier this year, the first state in the country to do so. People incarcerated in New York pay some of the steepest rates for phone calls in the country."" #UpstateAmerica: Dutchess County’s Steve Schreiber put America’s biggest literal Fork in the Road at a Route 199 fork in the road.  “Trump must give videotaped deposition in protest lawsuit, judge orders,” by ABC News’ Aaron Katersky: “Former President Donald Trump must sit for a videotaped deposition next week as part of a lawsuit involving his anti-immigrant rhetoric, a judge in the Bronx ordered. A group of Mexican protesters said they were assaulted during a rally outside Trump Tower in September 2015 over the then-candidate’s comments that Mexican immigrants were criminals and rapists. The lawsuit named Trump, his campaign, his former head of security Keith Schiller, and others. ‘Donald J. Trump shall appear for a deposition October 18, 2021 at 10 a.m. ... or, in the event of illness or emergency, on another mutually agreed to date on or before October 31, 2021,’ Judge Doris Gonzalez’s order said.” “Ex-Giuliani pals touted photos with Trump while pressing wealthy Russian to invest in pot business,” by New York Daily News’ Chris Sommerfeldt: “Two former Rudy Giuliani associates showed off photos with former President Donald Trump while urging a Russian tycoon to invest in a marijuana business scheme, prosecutors revealed in court Thursday. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who helped Giuliani and Trump dig for political dirt on President Biden in Ukraine, sent the photos in encrypted text messages to Andrey Muraviev, a wealthy Russian investor, in the fall of 2018. The photos with the President were displayed to the jury during Parnas’s trial in Manhattan Federal Court.” — The trial took a bizarre turn when Parnas’s lawyer accused a prosecutor on the case of threatening to shoot him. — A teenage boy was sentenced to nine years to life in prison for the murder of a Barnard College student in Morningside Park. — The UFT wants a woman to be the next City Council speaker. — De Blasio said the City Council is behind the proposed removal of a Thomas Jefferson statue from its chamber. — A judge suspended a Long Island father’s visitation with his daughter unless he gets vaccinated for Covid-19 or submits to weekly tests. — De Blasio blamed the pandemic for his failure to pay lawyer bills dating back to 2017. — The NY Cat Film Festival and the NY Dog Film Festival are returning to Manhattan after a pandemic-induced hiatus. — Eight LIRR conductors were caught pocketing train tickets. — State budget director Robert Mujica called in to the Capitol Pressroom to explain the minimum wage increases in suburban and upstate regions. — It’s now illegal in New York to threaten to report someone’s immigration status. — Capital Region teachers are “not OK” as violence, staff shortages and poor facilities drive burnout. — A heralded Queens public pool central to the city’s failed 2012 Olympic bid has been shuttered since before the pandemic.

Along with Sub-Zero appliances, 13-foot ceilings and a rooftop sundeck, it comes with a lucrative perk: an annual property tax bill of just $157. Fifteen miles away, in the Bronx’s Throggs Neck neighborhood, a condo in a white building dotted with window air conditioners goes for $234,840. Its annual property tax bill: $3,917. The details of this particular comparison are stunning: The Williamsburg condo had an effective tax rate of 0.007% on its market value, while the Bronx condo’s was 1.7% — more than 200 times higher.” “NYCHA forced to change handicap policies with prospective tenants as part of settlement,” by New York Daily News’ Michael Gartland: “A family’s twenty-year search for a handicap-accessible apartment in public housing has ended in a court settlement that will force the city’s housing authority to change the way it deals with prospective tenants — and with the family who brought the lawsuit still searching for a home that fits their needs.

The Republican governor previously took Aramis Ayala, the elected prosecutor in central Florida's Ninth Judicial Circuit, off the case of a man accused of killing an Orlando police officer after she refused to consider capital punishment. Scott said he now was reassigning all 22 cases from Ayala, a Democrat whose district includes Orange and Osceola counties, to the state attorney in a nearby district ""in the interest of justice."" ""State Attorney Ayala's complete refusal to consider capital punishment for the entirety of her term sends an unacceptable message that she is not interested in considering every available option in the fight for justice,"" Scott said in a statement. Ayala took office in January and has a four-year term. Ayala's office issued a statement on Monday saying she remains steadfast in her position that Scott is ""abusing his authority and has compromised the independence and integrity of the criminal justice system."" Ayala last month cited ""legal chaos"" surrounding Florida's death penalty system as her reason for not pursuing the execution of Markeith Loyd, who is accused of killing an Orlando policewoman on Jan. 9, or anyone suspected in a homicide. Ayala's announcement outraged law enforcement groups, some state lawmakers and State Attorney General Pam Bondi. RELATED: Notable death penalty executions and people on death row Others rose in her defense. Last week, groups including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People organized a rally in the state capital of Tallahassee to show support for Ayala and prosecutorial independence. Roy Austin, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney hired by Ayala to fight her removal from the Loyd case, said in a telephone interview on Monday that Scott's move is unprecedented in the United States. Scott last month signed legislation tightening Florida law to require a unanimous recommendation by a jury before judges can impose the death penalty. The law is the state's latest effort to restart its death penalty process, which was put on hold last year after rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court and the Florida Supreme Court in separate cases.

""The Netherlands, after Brexit, after the American elections, said 'Whoa' to the wrong kind of populism,"" said the victorious incumbent Prime Minister Mark Rutte to a jubilant crowd late Wednesday. ""Today was a celebration of democracy, we saw rows of people queuing to cast their vote, all over the Netherlands — how long has it been since we've seen that?"" Early results showed that Dutch voters, a record 81 percent of whom came out to cast their ballot, delivered the victory to Rutte's center-right People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), awarding him 33 out of the 150 parliamentary seats. Wilders' Dutch Freedom Party (PVV) won only 20 seats, a letdown after the high expectations promoted in recent days. RELATED: Dutch Prime Minister The position of Wilders and his anti-immigrant, anti-EU party in the Dutch elections was anxiously monitored as a test of xenophobia and ethno-nationalism in the wake of Brexit in the United Kingdom, Donald Trump's presidency in the United States, and the resurgent anti-immigrant parties throughout the continent. The elections in the Netherlands, a socially liberal and economically stable country that is seen as a bellwether for the rest of Europe, comes ahead of parliamentary elections France in just a number of weeks, and ahead of Germany's elections in September. The German Foreign Ministry tweeted out a warm message of congratulations to the Netherlands, saying they've raised hopes for the future of a ""strong #Europe!"" Large majority of Dutch voters have rejected anti European populists. That's good news. We need you for a strong #Europe! #tk2017@MinBZ — GermanForeignOffice (@GermanyDiplo) March 15, 2017 Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni celebrated on Twitter that despite promises made by Wilders during the campaign, there would be ""No #Nexit. The anti-EU right has lost in the Netherlands. Together we will change and revive the European Union."" No #Nexit La destra anti UE ha perso le elezioni in Olanda. Impegno comune per cambiare e rilanciare l'Unione — Paolo Gentiloni (@PaoloGentiloni) March 15, 2017 The election results were also hailed by the country's mostly Muslim refugee population, which feared that Wilders' platform to shutter mosques and ban the Quran would further exacerbate their already tenuous position in the country. Wael, a Syrian refugee from Homs living in the Netherlands, told Vocativ that he was ""proud of the Dutch nation because it hasn't followed in the footsteps of Trump."" ""Normally whatever happens in the U.S. happens directly afterwards in The Netherlands,"" he said, adding that he hoped the new government would increase integration efforts. The elections brought success for a number of left-wing parties, including the progressive Democrats 66, which appeared to have won the most votes of any left-leaning party with 19 seats. RELATED: The uncertain future of 2017 ""During this election campaign, the whole world was watching us,"" said Democrats 66 leader Alexander Pechtold. ""They were looking at Europe to see if this continent would follow the call of the populists, but it has now become clear that call stopped here in the Netherlands."" Other left-wing parties included the GreenLeft party, which had increased its seats from four to 16; and ""DENK,"" a party founded by Turkish-Dutch members of parliament, which was set to take three seats. Dutch elections come amid a diplomatic row between the EU and Turkey. Last weekend, the Dutch government prevented Turkey's foreign minister from organizing a political rally in the Netherlands ahead of an April referendum that posited expanding Erdogan's authorities.

The investigation continues into the worst mass shooting in the city's history — 17 people were shot, one of them fatally. O'Bryan Spikes, 27, died at the scene. Cornell Beckley, 27, of Westwood was arrested at a Colerain Township home Thursday afternoon. The second suspect, Deondre Davis, 29, was injured in the shooting and remains hospitalized in critical condition at University of Cincinnati Medical Center. Cincinnati Police Chief Eliot Isaac said at a news conference Thursday that the altercation started inside the Cameo nightclub in the East End and turned into a gunbattle, involving more than two people. ""It deteriorated into a fight and escalated into individuals being able to sneak guns into the bar and shots being fired,"" Isaac said. Police release chaotic 911 calls from Cameo nightclub shooting Sixteen shell casings and three guns were recovered, according to police accounts. In addition to Davis, another victim remains hospitalized in critical condition. Davis’ father, Jackie Davis, held a news conference outside University of Cincinnati Medical Center on Thursday night, saying he was shocked at his son’s arrest. The family had gathered around the television when they heard arrests were made, but when Davis was named he said, “to see my son named was mind-blowing.” “My son is innocent,” Jackie Davis said. Davis has surgery scheduled for Friday morning. He is not responsive and is on a ventilator, according to family attorney Carl Lewis, who was with the family Thursday night. The victims included 14 men and three women. Most of them were patrons of the club and not involved in the fight, Isaac said. ""It's very good news out of a very bad situation,"" Mayor John Cranley said. ""This is a tragedy of epic proportions. It's the worst mass shooting in the history of the city ... we have to figure out a way to get guns off the street and teach people not to resolve disputes with guns."" Wednesday's release of 911 call recordings offered a chilling glimpse into what occurred inside the nightclub. ""There is blood everywhere,"" one caller said. Many callerspleaded for dispatchers to ""hurry up"" and send help. Beckley has a prior conviction for gun violence. He served a prison term after he was convicted on two counts of aggravated assault in 2008, according to court records. Davis has three prior drug convictions. He was sentenced to probation in 2013 for permitting drug use in connection with heroin trafficking. Cameo nightclub manager Julian Rodgers relinquished his liquor permit Monday and has closed the club."

Authorities foil alleged massacre planned for a DC-area school — -- A Maryland high school student is expected to face charges after a journal with a detailed plan for a mass shooting at her school was found in her home, in addition to a shotgun and bomb-making materials, authorities said. On March 23, the father of the suspect, Nichole Cevario, 18, told officials at Catoctin High School in Thurmont, Maryland, about a ""potential threat of violence towards the school,"" the Frederick County Sheriff’s Office said, and his daughter ""was immediately removed from the classroom and turned over to investigators."" Authorities searched Cevario's home where they found a shotgun with ammunition and ""bomb-making materials to include pipes with end caps, shrapnel, fireworks, magnesium tape, and fuse material,"" the sheriff’s office said today. Authorities also say they found a journal that ""clearly planned out a mass shooting,"" Frederick County Sheriff Charles Jenkins said at a news conference this afternoon. The journal, which listed the suspect's school and a date in April, had a timeline and her expectations for each stage, the sheriff's office said. The diary's first entry was Dec. 16, 2016, Jenkins said. Officials say the journal showed Cevario had been planning ""for some time and had been compiling intelligence on behavior activities of the school, noting emergency procedures associated with drills conducted by school staff and obtaining intelligence on the School Resource Deputy,"" the sheriff’s office said. ""It shocks the conscience to see that someone of that age could be thinking like this,” Jenkins said. There was never a weapon or explosive device on school property, authorities said, and the materials were never combined into an explosive device. Jenkins said all the items Cevario bought were legal. Authorities said no one else was involved or knew of the alleged plot. According to the diary, Cevario planned to die from the attack, officials said. When Cevario was removed from the school on March 23 it appeared that she posed a threat to herself and she was taken to the hospital, where she remains today, the sheriff's office said. The sheriff's office said she was struggling with mental health issues. Investigators secured an arrest warrant for possession of explosive material with intent to create a destructive device and possession of incendiary material with the intent to create a destructive device, the sheriff's office said. The arrest warrant will be served when she's released from the hospital, the sheriff's office said. The sheriff’s office expressed its appreciation for Cevario's father who reported the potential threat and said he has been cooperative with the investigation. The sheriff's office did not know if Cevario had retained a lawyer. In a video today on the school district's YouTube page, Dr. Terry Alban, superintendent of Frederick County Public Schools, thanked the ""courageous"" parents for stepping forward. ""Whenever you hear or see anything that raises concern, you need to trust us and come to us so that we can do the right thing and handle it just like we did in this case,"" Alban said. ""Those relationships, that trust, that's what enables the policies and the procedures that we have put in place to keep our school safe work. And they did."" The school district did not immediately respond to a call for comment. ABC News' Geneva Sands contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Wilson told ABC News this morning that a plea has been reached in Roof's state case, in which he is accused of nine murders, but said she will not release details about the plea agreement until the court hearing, which is set for April 10 at 1 p.m. In an email sent to victims' family members today, Wilson wrote, ""The plea is negotiated which means it is 'carved in stone.'"" Wilson told The Associated Press that Roof's guilty plea in state court will be in exchange for a life sentence in prison, avoiding a potential second death sentence.

In the email to victims' family members, Wilson wrote, ""Our goal is to provide an insurance policy to the federal conviction and sentence. The most effective way to do that is to secure a guilty plea for a life sentence and get the defendant into federal custody.""

590577316,2017-03-07 14:27:01,The New Travel Ban Is Still a Muslim Ban,https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/03/trump-muslim-executive-order-syria-yemen-refugee-bannon-breitbart/518808/?utm_source=feed,en,False,"politics and government,no index terms from nytimes,immigration and refugees,terrorism",1110,Atlantic,http://www.theatlantic.com/,"Trump’s new executive order preserves the central problems of the old one. On Monday, President Donald Trump signed a revised executive order on immigration, designed to correct the deficiencies of the last one that several courts have put on hold. Although it removes some of the red flags planted in his last order, which courts found would likely run afoul of the U.S. Constitution’s Establishment Clause, the new order is still basically a Muslim ban. It’s no more rationally based on national security than was the previous order. The new order attempts to resolve some of the legal disputes over the last one by removing the previous explicit exemption for religious minorities in the countries targeted by the suspension of the refugee program. It also no longer singles out Syrian refugees for exclusion, but continues to suspend all refugee resettlement in the United States for 120 days. The new order also removes Iraq from the earlier list of banned countries, but it continues to include six majority-Muslim countries: Iran, Somalia, Libya, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, with the justification that “the conditions in these countries present heightened threats.” Each of these countries, the order states, “is a state sponsor of terrorism, has been significantly compromised by terrorist organizations, or contains active conflict zones.” The order notably still does not include Pakistan, Afghanistan, or Saudi Arabia. What’s more, it continues to rely on the absurd justification that the situations in those countries affect “the foreign government’s willingness or ability to share or validate important information about individuals seeking to travel to the United States.” In other words, it penalizes refugees fleeing repressive governments because their governments won’t help vet their citizens’ claims of government persecution. The new ban ostensibly attempts to resolve the legal issues that led the original executive order to be stayed by several courts, but the new order doesn’t solve the central problem of the first one. The order still targets nationals of only Muslim-majority countries, with no reasonable national security justification. It’s still a Muslim ban. One need look only to leaked reports from Trump’s own Department of Homeland Security to see that the intent of his order has nothing to do with national security. In an internal report leaked in February, DHS analysts concluded that citizens from the six specified countries do not present any particular terrorism threat in the United States. On the contrary, it found that the majority of individuals implicated in terrorist-related activity in the United States have been U.S. citizens, not foreigners. A second DHS report leaked to the Rachel Maddow Show shows that most individuals found to have participated in terrorist plots in the United States became radicalized years after they came to the country. Their radical inclinations therefore could not have been detected at the border, DHS concludes. Indeed, one of the only examples of a refugee involved in an attempted attack in the United States involved a Somali man who came to this country at age two and was caught up in an FBI sting operation, where FBI agents gave him an inert device to detonate at a Christmas tree-lighting in Oregon. The Trump administration relies on this case for justification of its suspension of the refugee program. A Q&A sheet prepared by DHS for the new executive order describes this case but does not mention the boy’s age when he immigrated to the America, or the sting operation. The government’s own data reveal that the attempt to prevent terrorism in the United States by blocking people’s entrance based on nationality is nonsensical. The motive is not national security, but discrimination. Numerous statements by the president himself, and of his most senior advisors, reveal the order’s true intent. As the courts have made clear, that sort of context is critical to determining whether the order is constitutional. In December 2015, then-candidate Trump’s own website boasted: “Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on.” You can still find that statement on his website today. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly scapegoated Muslim immigrants for crimes they had nothing to do with. After a mass shooting that killed 49 people in Orlando, for example, Trump promised he’d stop immigration of Muslims to the United States, saying refugees and immigrants could be America’s “Trojan horse.” He added that his rival, Hillary Clinton, wanted to accept “hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of their children.” The Orlando shooting was committed by a 29-year-old American citizen born in New Hyde Park, New York. His father came to the United States in the 1980s from Afghanistan. Meanwhile, refugees entering the United States are subjected to lengthy, intensive screening—the most stringent security reviews of anyone allowed to enter the country. Trump has also claimed, without basis, that refugees from Syria “could be ISIS”; claimed in a presidential debate that the United States is admitting tens of thousands of “ISIS-aligned” Syrian refugees, and tweeted in Nov. 2015: “Refugees from Syria are now pouring into our great country. Who knows who they are—some could be ISIS. Is our president insane?” And last July, when asked if he was proposing an unconstitutional Muslim ban, Trump complained to Chuck Todd on NBC’s Meet the Press that “you can’t call it Muslim.” To achieve the same goal, he would be “looking now at territories”— i.e., the six named countries. Of course, the president’s senior advisors, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Trump’s chief strategist Stephen Bannon, have also warned of grave dangers of allowing Muslims to enter the United States. Sessions has frequently rung alarm bells on refugee admission, warning of frightening consequences of growing levels of “foreign born” in the United States. He said that the Obama administration had proceeded “with plans to admit hundreds of thousands of largely unvettable refugees from areas of the world that are producing terrorists and extremists,” and warned that Muslims are the fastest-growing group of migrants. “Altogether, we can expect to issue nearly 700,000 green cards—or lifetime residency cards—to migrants from Muslim nations over the next five years (as we did over the last five years),” Sessions said, quoted in Breitbart. “Terror groups have demonstrated that they will recruit from among this inflow.” Bannon, meanwhile, is notorious for fomenting anti-Muslim hysteria. He’s claimed we’re “at the beginning stages of a global war against Islamic fascism,” and blamed the turmoil resulting from the refugee crisis in Europe on the fact that the migrants were Muslim. “These are not people with thousands of years of understanding democracy in their DNA coming up here,” Bannon said. He told his radio audience in December 2015 that “over half” of Muslims in the Middle East believe in sharia, and added ominously: “One of the issues we have in Garland, Texas, is trying to stop these Sharia courts.” The claim that anyone was trying to establish Sharia courts in Texas was soon widely debunked, and earned the distinction of The Houston Chronicle’s “2015 Texas hoax of the year.” Of course, Bannon was also a founder and executive chairman of the right-wing extremist Breitbart News, which under his direction regularly published anti-Muslim stories with headlines such as: “Political Correctness Protects Muslims Rape Culture”; “The Huffington Post Whores for the Hijab”; “Silicon Valley’s Startup Culture Explains Why Mass Muslim Immigration Must Stop”; and “Man Bites Dog: Muslim is Nice to Non-Muslim.” He also championed the work of Pamela Geller, a political commentator who’s notorious for her anti-Muslim views. She published many of those views on Breitbart, in stories like “How Muslim Migrants Devastate a Community.” The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks and exposes hate groups, calls Geller “the anti-Muslim movement’s most visible and flamboyant figurehead.” Bannon himself has repeatedly publicly opposed admitting refugees from Muslim-majority countries. “Why even let ’em in?” he asked on his radio show in 2015, saying vetting would cost money. “Can’t that money be used in the United States?” he said. “Should we just take a pause and a hiatus for a number of years on any influx from that area of the world?” While supporters of the Muslim ban dismiss such statements as irrelevant to the White House’s current actions, they’re actually central to determining the administration’s intent. “It is well established that evidence of purpose beyond the face of the challenged law may be considered in evaluating Establishment and Equal Protection Clause claims,” wrote the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in affirming a district court’s stay on the original executive order on immigration. The purpose seems pretty obvious here, especially considering the government’s own findings that “country of citizenship is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of potential terrorist activity.” DHS also concluded that while terrorist groups operating in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, pose a threat to the United States, groups in Iran, Libya, Somalia, and Sudan “remain regionally focused.” Overall, DHS found that citizens of the countries banned in the original order are “rarely implicated in U.S.-based terrorism,” and that of the 82 individuals who either died in the pursuit of or were convicted of any terrorist-related offense attempted against the United States, more than half were U.S. citizens. The rest were from 26 different countries, with no one country representing more than 13.5 percent of the total. DHS found that “relatively few citizens” of the countries impacted by the executive order have access to the United States. The United States already has many controls at its border to prevent threats, and none are stricter than those applying to refugees, who often must wait two years or more to resettle in the United States. There simply is no basis for excluding all travelers from the six specified countries, even temporarily, or for excluding all refugees, most of whom are Muslim, for the purposes of national security. The Trump administration can restrict immigration if it wants to, and indeed, the executive has wide latitude to do so. But the president cannot exclude individuals based on their religion, as this order plainly does, without running afoul of the U.S. Constitution. This post appears courtesy of Just Security."
604529351,2017-04-05 14:34:24,Rebecca Solnit’s Faith in Feminist Storytelling,http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/rebecca-solnits-faith-in-feminist-storytelling?mbid=rss,en,False,"books and literature,women,reviews",1101,New Yorker,http://www.newyorker.com/,"To revisit this article, select My Account, then View saved stories To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories By Moira Donegan About a decade ago, the writer Rebecca Solnit was in the U.K. promoting “Storming the Gates of Paradise,” a book about politics, and she gave a live talk before an audience. Her interviewer, a man, asked her—unprompted—why she did not have children; when she demurred, he wouldn’t let the subject drop. “No answer I gave could satisfy him,” Solnit writes in her new collection of feminist essays, cheekily titled “The Mother of All Questions.” “His position seemed to be that I must have children, that it was incomprehensible that I did not, and so we had to talk about why I didn’t, rather than about the books I did have.” The anecdote is a self-conscious corollary to a famous incident in Solnit’s earlier feminist work, “Men Explain Things to Me.” In that story, a man summarized Solnit’s own book to her, based on a review he’d read, confidently oblivious that she was the author and incredulous that a woman could have more authority on a subject than he did. The story resonated with readers and became more famous than the book itself, popularizing the portmanteau “mansplaining” to describe women’s experiences of being presumed ignorant and unqualified by men. Search the hashtag on Twitter and you’ll find hundreds of stories of mansplaining, each recounted with palpable irritation and pain. During the height of the hashtag’s heyday, in 2015, a few women recounted being told by men how the menstrual cycle works. Another user, Alba Waterhouse, was told by a man how most effectively to learn a new language. “A monolingual man,” she clarified. “I speak four languages.” Often, the man’s own lack of qualifications or experience with the subject is what stings the most: the sense is that, no matter what a woman achieves, a man will always consider his gender to outweigh her credentials. “The Mother of All Questions” is filled with this sort of storytelling, with Solnit drawing anecdotes of female indignity or male aggression from history, social media, literature, popular culture, and the news. She talks about the men who explained to her that “Lolita” was an allegory after she expressed pity for the title character in an essay online; she talks about the young student at Bard College who was forced to sign a nondisclosure agreement before the school would allow her even to report her rape; she talks about Elliot Rodger, the man who committed a mass shooting, in 2014, because he was mad that women declined to sleep with him. The main essay in the book is about the various ways that women are silenced, and Solnit focusses upon the power of storytelling—the way that who gets to speak, and about what, shapes how a society understands itself and what it expects from its members. “The Mother of All Questions” poses the thesis that telling women’s stories to the world will change the way that the world treats women, and it sets out to tell as many of those stories as possible. Anecdotal storytelling of this kind has long been a tool of feminist organizing. Women have always confided to other women about their experiences of being mistreated by men—it’s easy to imagine that the first time this kind of story was told was the first time two women were left alone without a man in the room. For the women’s movement, storytelling first came into organized use, in the late nineteen-sixties, as so-called “consciousness-raising.” New Left women’s groups such as the New York Radical Women, the Chicago Women’s Liberation Union, and WITCH (Women’s International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell) began holding small, all-women meetings to discuss sexist oppression in their own lives. “First they complained about housework,” Solnit writes, recounting a conversation she had with the prominent West Coast feminist Susan Griffin. “And then they started talking about rape and violence and the grim stuff, breaking through the shame that had kept them silent and alone.” The meetings quickly became intimate; they took on an air of a confessional. Early consciousness-raising groups were overwhelmingly white and straight in ways that limited their analysis, but the members focussed on the class diversity among their ranks: early leaders such as Kathie Sarachild had gone to élite universities, while others were working class; the influential Irene Peslikis, for example, was a dropout who had grown up in immigrant Queens. The commonalities in their stories surprised them, and the shared experiences they discovered in those rooms became the foundation of how feminists of the second wave understood the nature of sexism. Then, as now, the anecdotes shared among women cut through the recondite rhetoric of social theory. The stories are simple, personal, and have clear moral direction. “I was grabbed in the street.” “I was beaten by my husband.” “I was raped.” “I was belittled, talked down to, and disbelieved.” There are as many experiences of womanhood as there are women, but every woman who hears these stories has had something similar happen to her. One useful working definition of a woman might be “someone who experiences misogyny.” Today the feminist anecdote is shared less often in formal consciousness-raising groups than in informal ones, under hashtags and in comment threads online. (Just this week, in response to sexual harassment allegations against the Fox News Host Bill O'Reilly, women have been gathering their own stories of workplace mistreatment on Twitter.) Solnit is particularly interested in the rise of the hashtag #yesallwomen, which was coined by a Muslim woman tweeting under the handle @gildedspine in response to Rodger’s anti-woman massacre. The hashtag went on to form a massive consciousness-raising discussion on Twitter. “Women began telling their stories of harassment, threats, violence, and fear, reinforced by each other’s voices,” she writes. (For her part, @gildedspine received a deluge of death threats from angry men, and for a time had to go into hiding.) Reading through the hashtag can be upsetting: women recount personal experiences of assault, rape, violence, and threats. They also express their own reflexive responses to these experiences, acknowledging that the constant threat of rape and violence is something they’ve become accustomed to. “#Yesallwomen because ‘I have a boyfriend’ is more effective than ‘I’m not interested’—men respect other men more than my right to say no,” one tweet read. The writer and editor Sasha Weiss, who wrote about the hashtag at the time for this Web site, tweeted, “Because if I know I will be out til after dark, I start planning my route home hours, even days, beforehand #yesallwomen.” “It was loud, discordant, and maybe transformative,” Solnit said of this online feminist outpouring. “Not necessarily new, but said more emphatically, by more of us, and heard as never before.” It can be troubling to consider just how pervasive and not-new this tradition of feminist storytelling really is; after all, if telling these stories had the power to change the way women are treated, why do we still have so many stories to tell? In the nineteen-seventies, this became a point of debate within the feminist movement, with women arguing over whether consciousness-raising was essential or tangential to affecting political change. At one point, Betty Friedan referred to the consciousness-raising groups as “therapy,” which she did not mean as a compliment. The tradition of the feminist anecdote encourages women to make their voices heard, but it is easy to see this long history of tweeting, consciousness-raising, and speaking out not as a victory but as a defeat. Reading “The Mother of All Questions,” I found that Solnit’s faith in feminist storytelling, in the notion that amplifying women’s voices might truly have the power to transform the world, sometimes exceeded my own. It seems, instead, that there have been centuries of women raising their voices only to find that patriarchy is enduring and indifferent. After all, having the power to speak is not the same as a guarantee that you’ll be listened to. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

According to the Sun-Sentinel, Lucy Richards, 57 was arrested in Tampa after a warrant was issued for her when she skipped a change-of-plea and sentencing hearing in federal court last Wednesday. Richards was taken into custody at a local hospital and had been free on bond since December when she pleaded not guilty to four federal charges that she sent threatening email and voicemails to Lenny Pozner. Pozner is the father of 6-year-old Noah who was killed in the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. According to court records, Richards told investigators she contacted Pozner because she became angry after browsing conspiracy websites stating the mass shooting that took the lives of 26 never happened or was a government ""false flag"" operation. ""You gonna die, death is coming to you real soon,"" Richards told Pozner in one voicemail. The failure of Richards to appear in court may void her plea deal and send her to federal prison.

594344073,2017-03-15 13:45:18,Courts hear arguments challenging Trump’s new travel ban,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheRawStory/~3/IOq1JcDgUOU/,en,False,"politics and government,law and legislation,suits and litigation,immigration and refugees,decisions and verdicts",1127,Raw Story,http://rawstory.com,"Court orders from judges in Maryland and Hawaii on Wednesday could decide the immediate fate of President Donald Trump's revised travel ban, which is set to take effect at 12:01 a.m. EDT (0401 GMT) on Thursday. Refugee resettlement agencies suing the government asked a federal judge at a hearing in Maryland on Wednesday morning to halt implementation of the ban, arguing it discriminates on the basis of religion and violates of the U.S. Constitution. The president's executive order, which the administration says is necessary for national security, temporarily bars the entry of most refugees as well as travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. Both the refugee agencies and the government's lawyers faced tough questioning in the Greenbelt courtroom from U.S. District judge Theodore Chuang, who drilled down on the question of who would be harmed by the order, signed by Trump on March 6. The agencies are asking the judge to enforce a temporary, nationwide halt to the ban while the case moves forward. Chuang said he would try to issue a written ruling on Wednesday, before the order is implemented, but said it might come after. The executive order replaced an earlier, broader order that was signed amid much fanfare a week after the Republican president's Jan. 20 inauguration and that was soon hit by more than two dozen lawsuits around the country. A federal judge in Seattle last month issued a nationwide halt to the first order in a decision was upheld by a U.S. appeals court. In response to the legal challenges, the new order was more narrowly tailored to exclude legal permanent residents and existing visa holders. It also provides a series of waivers for various categories of immigrants with ties to the United States. But critics have charged that the intent behind both policies was to discriminate against Muslims. Chuang asked the refugee organizations, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Immigration Law Center, who would be most adversely affected by the new policy. To move forward with the suit the groups have to prove harm, or ""standing."" ""This will have real world impact on our clients,"" said National Immigration Law Center attorney Justin Cox, adding that U.S. citizens with relatives abroad should have the right to see their families and some refugees in the resettlement pipeline are in imminent danger. The government countered that the pause is only temporary and is needed to improve vetting processes to protect against terrorist attacks. The new order bars citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from entering the country for 90 days, but Iraq is no longer on the list. Refugees are still barred for 120 days, but an indefinite ban on all refugees from Syria was deleted. The Department of Justice lawyers said the president has broad discretion to implement immigration policy and warned against the courts curbing those powers. ""If this court went down that road I think we could be in uncharted waters,"" said Jeffrey Wall, an attorney arguing for the Department of Justice. HAWAII CASE There will also be a hearing on Wednesday in a separate case brought by the state of Hawaii, which has argued that its universities and tourist economy would be harmed by the travel restrictions. Hawaii sued in conjunction with a plaintiff named Ismail Elshikh, an American citizen from Egypt who is an imam at the Muslim Association of Hawaii. Elshikh says his family will be harmed if his mother-in-law, who lives in Syria, is prevented from visiting because of the restrictions. Responding to this, the government said Elshikh had not been harmed because the ban allows for waivers, and his mother-in-law could apply for one. The new order removed from the earlier ban a clause that said it would give special protections for religious minorities, after Trump had said in an interview that Christians refugees should be given preferences for entry. While the text of the order does not mention Islam, the states and refugee support groups say the motivation behind the policy is Trump's promise during his election campaign of ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States."" He made that pledge in December, 2015 as he vowed to take tougher counterterrorism steps days after a mass shooting by Islamic State sympathizers in San Bernardino, California. The government said the courts should only look at the actual document and not at outside comments by Trump or his aides. In the Maryland hearing, government lawyer Wall denied the order discriminated against Muslims. The first order took effect immediately, causing chaos and protests at airports across the country and around the globe and miring Trump's administration in an early controversy. If the new ban goes ahead, advocacy groups said that lawyers will once again head to international airports to assist anyone who might be improperly detained or prevented from entering, said to Betsy Fisher, the policy director at the International Refugee Assistance Project. But because the order included a 10-day lag before taking effect, far fewer people are likely to be caught out while traveling. ""There are going to be attorneys on the ground and ready to respond,"" Fisher said in a telephone interview. ""But we're anticipating not seeing the same kind of chaos because there was an announcement in advance."" (Reporting by Ian Simpson in Greenbelt, Maryland, Mica Rosenberg in New York and Dan Levine in Honolulu; Additional reporting by Jonathan Allen in New York; Writing by Mica Rosenberg; Editing by Sue Horton and Frances Kerry) Efforts by former President Donald Trump to punish a perceived political foe were reversed by the Biden administration. ""Hours before he was scheduled to retire in 2018, Andrew G. McCabe, then the F.B.I.'s deputy director, was fired by the Justice Department, depriving him of his pension and prompting cheers from President Donald J. Trump, who had been hounding him over his role in the Russia investigation,"" The New York Times reports. ""On Thursday, the department reversed Mr. McCabe's firing, settling a lawsuit he filed asserting that he was dismissed for political reasons.""       On Thursday's edition of CNN's ""The Situation Room,"" anchor Wolf Blitzer and legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid discussed the planned criminal contempt referral of former Trump adviser Steve Bannon for refusing to comply with the House subpoena on the January 6 Capitol attack. ""It looks like, as they say, they're not messing around at all,"" said Blitzer.     CNN reporter Jamie Gangel said on Thursday that the House Select Committee investigating the January 6th Capitol riots appears to be moving aggressively and could soon ensnare members of former President Donald Trump's family. While talking about the committee's referral for criminal contempt of Trump ally Steve Bannon for failing to comply with its subpoena, Gangel explained how the committee is showing that it's not messing around.

1788122798,2017-03-09 00:00:00,5 ways to keep the government from spying on you,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-ways-to-keep-the-government-from-spying-on-you-2017-03-09,en,False,"privacy,politics and government,advertising and marketing",35170,Marketwatch,https://www.marketwatch.com/,"Ever feel like someone is watching you? You may not be paranoid. A new round of documents regarding government surveillance was unveiled by WikiLeaks on Tuesday, alleging that the Central Intelligence Agency hacks smartphones, computers and connected TVs to spy on American citizens and others around the world. (The CIA declined a request for comment.) To be clear, the techniques released in these documents are “very targeted,” said Sydney, Australia-based security researcher Troy Hunt. “Authorities would want to have a very good reason to use those techniques and the vast majority of people are outside the scope of what they’d be used for,” he said. Still, the revelations are not the first to suggest the government is surveilling citizens — in fact, they aren’t much different from the documents National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked in 2013, according to Mark Weinstein, a privacy advocate and chief executive officer of social network MeWe. He said each new round of revelations fuels the growing anxiety U.S. citizens have about being watched. “People are feeling an overwhelming sense of being creeped out by the aggregate of these stories,” he said. For average citizens starting to think about how to keep their communications out of reach of Big Brother, here are some of the ways to lock down devices and keep government entities, advertisers and corporations out of your daily lives. Use encrypted communication To avoid surveillance — by governments or others users — you should switch to more secure apps for messaging, like Signal, which is free for download on iTunes and Google Play. The app, which is recommended by Snowden himself to avoid surveillance, allows users to send encryption-protected information to others who also use the app and collects and stores very little data about users. WhatsApp, for example, is also encrypted but does store metadata — the information about who you are messaging and where, and is owned by Facebook 
        FB,
        +1.23%
       . (Facebook did not reply to request for comment.) Similarly, iMessage is encrypted by default, but Apple 
        AAPL,
        +2.02%
       still stores metadata on user conversations for up to 30 days and can hand the information over to law enforcement with a warrant. Messaging on iPhone is also only encrypted between two iPhone users, so texting Android users will revert messages to unencrypted SMS. Apple had a standoff with law enforcement over equipping devices with so-called “back doors” to enable them to access user information. The issue came to a boiling point when Apple refused to help the Federal Bureau of Investigation unlock the iPhone of the man who carried out a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. in 2016. No method is 100% secure, as the documents released Tuesday allege that the CIA has been able to access phones directly, bypassing encryption. This means they could install keyloggers or other surveillance tools directly onto user devices, intercepting communication at the source. “Signal, WhatsApp and iMessage are all encrypted end to end and the techniques for ’circumvention’ are akin to looking over someone’s shoulder as they type their messages into a secure platform like these,” Hunt said For nonmobile devices, users can implement PGP, a protocol that stands for “Pretty Good Privacy,” to encrypt and protect email. Cover up your webcams The documents released by WikiLeaks allege that the CIA built hacking tools that could remotely control devices including iPads, iPhones, Android devices and computers — hacking the camera and microphone to secretly record video and sound. A simple, cheap way to put a stop to this is to cover the camera with electrical tape or a Post-it Note. In fact, Snowden did just that in “Citizen 4,” the 2014 documentary made about him. Any opaque material works, but there are also a number of novelty stickers sold online to cover everything from computer cameras to iPad and iPhone devices. Buy stickers from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which fights for legislation that protects civil liberties against surveillance, and you can support internet freedom for the world while implementing your own. Update your devices Keeping your devices updated is a basic way to prevent hacking and other security breaches. Phones that are not updated are much more likely to be compromised, as a number of high-profile bugs have shown in recent years. In 2015 a flaw was discovered in 95% of Androids that allowed the phones to be hacked with a simple text, and a similar iPhone flaw was found just months before that. Apple can push out fixes to users remotely, but Google doesn't — making it all the more important to click that pesky “update your device” pop up whenever you see it. Don’t miss: 7 ways to keep your smart home from being hacked “You have to take care of basic cyber hygiene,” said Michael Kaiser, head of the public-private partnership to educate the public on digital privacy and security at the National Cyber Security Alliance. “Keep software up-to-date, and use strong passwords and two factor authentication.” Secure your smart TV (or don’t buy one) One of the hacks allegedly implemented by the CIA that WikiLeaks data revealed acts as a bug on Samsung TVs, allowing the agency to record citizens even after they had turned the TV off. Users can disable the features on Samsung that allow outsiders to snoop under ‘settings.’ Scroll to support, then ‘terms and policies’ and turn off voice-related services on the TV. However, Weinstein said the only sure way for users to prevent this is to unplug the TV completely when it is not being used — or avoid buying smart TVs at all. Users may run into issues with DVR and other “off-TV” capabilities, but without camera or audio capabilities, TVs will be less likely to monitor consumers. Buy a “dumb” TV and use a device like Apple TV that collects less information. A number of models come without video, microphones and other extras. Cover your tracks on social media Even without the government looking over our shoulders, social media makes it easy to give away a lot of privacy on our own, posting vacation photos and other personal details. Going completely dark on social media — deleting Facebook and Instagram accounts and moving to a cabin in the woods to avoid tracking — may be too extreme for the average consumer. It’s better to “start with what we can do,” said Weinstein. This includes steps as simple as switching from Google 
        GOOG,
        +2.55%
       to DuckDuckGo, a search engine that doesn’t track users. Users can also switch to a Tor browser, which uses encryption to allow people to surf the web without being tracked. While the WikiLeaks allegations center on government surveillance, Weinstein said, they are contributing to an awareness of how often we are watched in places that were once private, like the living room. “This is a lot bigger than ‘I have nothing to hide,’” Weinstein said. “This is about the fundamental right to enjoy your life without having someone over your shoulder watching. It’s a very interesting moment as people realize worldwide we have become the product, not the customer they serve.”"
