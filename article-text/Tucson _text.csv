) Jared Lee Loughner’s Internet musings depict a severely troubled young man who harbors a deep-seated distrust of government. Loughner, the suspected gunman in the assassination attempt on Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and mass shooting outside a Tucson, Ariz., supermarket, posted a series of incoherent YouTube manifestos that rambled about “conscious dreaming,” sleepwalking, grammar, terror and revolution. In the most disturbing rant published under his name, Loughner posted a video depicting a man dressed as the Grim Reaper setting fire to the American Flag. Playing in the background is “Bodies” by the metal band Drowning Pool with its chilling intro, “Let the bodies hit the floor.” His Myspace page, which was deleted yesterday, included a enigmatic sign-off: “Goodbye friends . . . Please don’t be mad at me.” Loughner attempted to enlist in the Army but was rejected, a law-enforcement source told The Post. “Jared Loughner is a United States Military recruit at MEPS [military entrance processing station] in Phoenix,” he wrote in another post accompanied by eerie music. “I didn’t write a belief on my Army application and the recruiter wrote on the application: None.” Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik said Loughner had a “criminal background” and had previously made death threats, but it was not clear against whom, except that the threats were not towards Giffords. The Arizona Daily Star said he was arrested in Oct. 2007 for possession of drug paraphernalia and was again arrested on an unknown charge a year later. In another paranoid rant, the suspect wrote: “Reading the second United States Constitution, I can’t trust the current government because of the ratifications; The government is implying mind control and brainwash on the people by controlling the grammar.” Among his favorite books listed on his Myspace profile, Loughner included “Mein Kampf,” “The Communist Manifesto” and “The Wizard of Oz.” Loughner, 22, a Tucson resident and student at Pima Community College, is an only child who still lives with his family, neighbors said. “When he was a young boy, he was very nice but kind of a loner,” said longtime neighbor Lynn Riach, who remembered often hearing him practicing the saxophone. “We’re a really tight-knit neighborhood. We know all our neighbors and the Loughner family kept to themselves,” Riach said. “The parents loved their son very much.” Other neighbors said they recall Loughner only rarely emerging from his house, usually to walk his dog. He always wore headphones, they said. He made a drastic change to his shaggy appearance last summer when he shaved his head, a neighbor said. “My favorite interest was reading, and I studied grammar,” he wrote on a Myspace profile that was deleted yesterday afternoon. Loughner dropped out of high school after his junior year in 2006 but later attended community college. A former classmate at Pima said he was “obviously very disturbed.” Lynda Sorenson, who took a math class with Loughner, told the Arizona Daily Star, that he would constantly disrupt the class “with nonsensical outbursts.” And Lydian Ali said the alleged gunman would laugh maniacally to himself in their poetry class. “It almost seemed like he was on his own planet, because his comments would have nothing to do with what we were talking about,” she told the paper. Excerpts from Jared Lee Loughner’s YouTube postings “The majority of citizens in the United State of America have never read the United States of America’s Constitution. You don’t have to accept the federalist laws. Nonetheless, read the United State of America’s Constitution to apprehend all of the current treasonous laws. You’re “ “The current government officials are in power for their currency, but I’m informing you for your new currency! If you’re treasurer of a new money system, then you’re responsible for the distributing of the new currency. “ “No! I won’t trust in God.” “In conclusion, reading the second United States Constitution, I can’t trust the current government because of the ramifications: The government is implying mind control and brainwash on the people by controlling grammar. No! I won’t pay debt a currency that’s not backed by gold and silver!” “My hope – is for you to be literate! If you’re literate in English grammar, then you comprehend English grammar. The majority of people, who reside in District 8, are illiterate – hilarious.” “I know who’s listening: Government officials, and the People. Nearly all the people, who don’t know this accurate information of a new currency, aren’t aware of mind control and brainwash methods.” “If I define terrorist then a terrorist is a person who employs terror or terrorism, especially as a political weapon. If you call me a terrorist then the argument to call me a terrorist is Ad hominem. You call me a terrorist. Thus, the argument to call me a terrorist is Ad hominem.” Additional reporting by Dennis Welch and Josh Margolin akarni@nypost.com Share Selection"

We want to bridge divides to reach everyone. Gabrielle Giffords still in critical condition. The motive of the suspect, Jared Lee Loughner, is still a mystery in the shooting of Giffords, a Democrat who supported the health-care bill. Loading... January 9, 2011 One man is in custody and authorities are looking for another the day after a mass shooting at a Tucson, Ariz., grocery store left six dead and 13 gravely injured, including the apparent target of the attack, US Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. With the local sheriff’s office and the FBI investigating, suspicions that the suspected gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, had an accomplice would complicate the thesis that the shooting was the work of a lone and mentally unbalanced young man lashing out at the government. The existence of a co-conspirator could point to a more calculated plot, and perhaps shed more light on the motive for the attack. ""We are not convinced that [the man in custody] acted alone. There is some reason to believe he came to this location with another individual, and that individual is involved,"" said Clarence Dupnik, Pima County sheriff, at a press conference Saturday. Congresswoman Giffords, who underwent surgery Saturday after a bullet struck her in the head during a political “meet and greet” event at a Tucson supermarket, remained in critical condition early Sunday. Killed in the attack were: • US district Judge John Roll, who stopped by the event to say hello to Giffords. He had been the chief judge for the District of Arizona since 2006 and a federal judge since 1991, appointed by Republican President George H.W. Bush. He had been the target of threats several years ago, after he ruled that a civil rights lawsuit filed by illegal immigrants could proceed against an Arizona rancher, according to a CNN report. • Gabriel Zimmerman, one of Giffords’s aides. Engaged to be married, Mr. Zimmerman, who like Gifford was Jewish, was the congresswoman’s director of community outreach and a Tucson native. • Dorwin Stoddard, a retired construction worker. Mr. Stoddard’s wife was also injured, but witnesses told CNN that he tried to shield her from gunshots. She is expected to recover. • Christina Greene, a 9-year-old who had recently been elected to serve on the student council at her school. She went to the event with a neighbor to meet Giffords. At time of writing, little was known about two others who died at the scene , Phyllis Scheck and Dorothy Morris, both in their seventies. The portrait emerging of the suspected gunman was of a troubled young man described variously by public officials as “deranged,” “mentally unstable,” and as having “a troubled past.” Mr. Loughner is believed to have dropped out of high school, and he was ousted from Pima Community College in September until he underwent a mental health evaluation and was cleared to return. In 2008, the US Army rejected him as a recruit, but did not reveal why. He’d been cited in Pima County in 2007 for possession of drug paraphernalia, according to a report in The Guardian. Authorities on Sunday released a photo of a man, estimated to be between 40 and 50, who they said was near Loughner at the scene prior to the shooting. The image is from a store surveillance camera, and the sheriff’s office asked the public for help identifying the unknown man. “We want to know if the person of interest is associated with” Loughner, Pima County deputy Jason Ogan told the Los Angeles Times. “We released the photo to see if anyone knows him.” The tragedy led House leaders on Sunday to order flags to be flown at half-staff to honor Mr. Zimmerman, and they canceled plans to hold a floor vote this week on repealing the controversial health-care reform law of 2010. Health-care reform was a hot-button issue in the midterm election, and several members of Congress, including Giffords, said they’d received unusually strident and angry phone calls and mail after the legislation passed in March. Her Tucson office was also vandalized at the time. Giffords voted in favor of the law. It’s not clear, though, whether the shooter targeted Giffords because of her vote on any specific issue, or even for her political views. Arizona has been through wrenching debates lately over several issues, among them state laws to crack down on illegal immigration, ending organ transplants as a Medicaid benefit, and how to curtail services amid a large budget deficit. The three-term congresswoman barely defeated a tea party-backed candidate in November, in which the health-care law was a major point of contention. Regardless, the shooting set off an intense debate on talk shows and in the blogosphere over the level of “vitriol” in public discourse – and whether those who engage in rhetorical flame-throwing bear any responsibility for inciting violence in others, especially those deemed to be mentally unstable. Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik suggested Saturday, in the aftermath of the shooting, that those exercising their rights to free speech would do well to consider the effects of their words. ""When you look at unbalanced people, how they respond to the vitriol that comes out of certain mouths about tearing down the government. The anger, the hatred, the bigotry that goes on in this country is getting to be outrageous,"" said Sheriff Dupnik. ""And unfortunately, Arizona I think has become sort of the capital. We have become the mecca for prejudice and bigotry."" Already a subscriber? Login Monitor journalism changes lives because we open that too-small box that most people think they live in.

JOS, Nigeria – Rioters set homes ablaze and angry youths armed with machetes set up roadblocks Sunday throughout a central Nigerian city plagued by violence between Christians and Muslims, witnesses said. Witnesses heard gunshots and saw smoke rising Sunday afternoon from a southern neighborhood in the city of Jos, where more than 500 people died last year. The latest rioting comes after 11 people died Saturday around Jos from religious violence and a political rally gone awry. Meanwhile, police in a city in northeast Nigeria are investigating a mass shooting at an illicit beer garden that left eight people dead and four others wounded. In Jos, families hid inside homes or wherever they could find shelter from the violence Sunday. Local lawyer Kwampkur Samuel Bondip said he was trapped inside a church with his family after Muslim youths blocked the road and began attacking passers-by. Danlami Mohammed, an official with a local Muslim organization, said the youths began rioting after finding arsonists had burned homes in their neighborhood overnight. Police officers and soldiers struggled to keep the violence under control. ""We have deployed our men to control the situation,"" said Plateau state police commissioner Abdurrahman Akano. Sunday's violence appeared to be a reaction to other attacks over the weekend. Christian youths attacked a car full of Muslims returning from a wedding in central Nigeria on Friday night, killing seven people inside the vehicle and sparking retaliatory violence that left one other person dead, an official said Saturday. Another three people were killed and several others were wounded when a meeting of a political party aligned with former military dictator Muhammadu Buhari collapsed into violence, witnesses said. Nigeria, an oil-rich country of 150 million people, is almost evenly split between Muslims in the north and the predominantly Christian south. Jos is in the nation's ""middle belt,"" where dozens of ethnic groups vie for control of fertile lands. The Jos violence, though fractured across religious lines, often has more to do with local politics, economics and rights to grazing lands. The government of Plateau state, where Jos is the capital, is controlled by Christian politicians who have blocked Muslims from being legally recognized as citizens. That has locked many out of prized government jobs in a region where the tourism industry and tin mining have collapsed in the last decades. On Christmas Eve, two bombs went off near a large market in Jos where people were doing last-minute Christmas shopping. A third hit a mainly Christian area of Jos, while the fourth was near a road that leads to the city's main mosque. Officials initially said at least 32 died from the blasts, while an official with the National Emergency Management Agency told journalists that he had counted 80 deaths from the explosions and the retaliatory violence that followed. An Internet message attributed to a radical Muslim sect known in northern Nigeria as Boko Haram claimed responsibility for the bomb attacks. However, the sect had never carried out an attack in that region before. Meanwhile, witnesses say gunmen stormed an illicit, outdoor bar Friday night in Gombe, a city in northeast Nigeria. The state is one of a dozen in Nigeria that implements Islamic Shariah law, which bans the consumption of alcohol. Most states, however, have hidden spots where locals can drink. The gunmen opened fire on those drinking there, initially killing seven people, authorities said. An eighth person died while receiving hospital care. Gombe state police spokesman Usman Kamba said the dead included customers and the woman running the bar. Police acknowledged confusion still surrounded the attack. ""Some say the attackers came wearing turbans, some say they covered faces, while others say came on high speed motorcycles, but the police (are) working on all options,"" Kamba said. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, though members of Boko Haram have made attacks there in the past. ___ Associated Press writers Saadatu Muhammad Awak and Shehu Saulawa in Gombe, Nigeria contributed to this report.

",http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2011/jan/09/suspect-attack-congresswoman-faces-5-charges/,en,False,,56,Arkansas Democrat-Gazette ,http://www2.arkansasonline.com/,"Federal prosecutors brought charges Sunday against the gunman accused of carrying out an assassination attempt on Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and killing six people at a political event in Arizona. Investigators said they carried out a search warrant at Jared Loughner’s home and seized an envelope from a safe with messages such as “I planned ahead,” “My assassination” and the name “Giffords” next to what appears to be the man’s signature. He allegedly purchased the Glock pistol used in the attack in November at Sportsman’s Warehouse in Tucson. Court documents also show that Loughner had contact with Giffords in the past. Other evidence included a letter addressed to him from Giffords’ congressional stationery in which she thanked him for attending a “Congress on your Corner” event at a mall in Tucson in 2007. Heather Williams, the first assistant federal public defender in Arizona, says the 22-year-old suspect doesn’t yet have a lawyer, but that her office is working to get a lawyer appointed for Loughner. Meanwhile, authorities released 911 calls in which a person witnessing the mass shooting outside a grocery store in Tucson describes a frantic scene and says, “I do believe Gabby Giffords was hit.” Loughner, 22, is accused of killing six people, including a federal judge, an aide to Giffords and a 9-year-old girl who was born on Sept. 11, 2001. Fourteen others were wounded, including the three-term Democrat lawmaker. Authorities don’t know his motive, but said he targeted Giffords at a public gathering around 10 a.m. Saturday outside a busy Tucson supermarket. Doctors treating the Democrat provided an optimistic update about her chances for survival, saying they are “very, very encouraged” by her ability to respond to simple commands along with their success in controlling her bleeding. He accused of firing at her district director and shot indiscriminately at staffers and others standing in line to talk to the congresswoman, said Mark Kimble, a communications staffer for Giffords. “He was not more than three or four feet from the congresswoman and the district director,” Kimble said, describing the scene as “just complete chaos, people screaming, crying.” Mourners crammed into the tiny sanctuary of Giffords’ synagogue in Tucson to pray that she quickly recovered. Outside the hospital, candles flickered at a makeshift memorial. Signs read “Peace + love are stronger,” “God bless America and “We love you, Gabrielle.” People also laid down bouquets of flowers, American flags and pictures of Giffords. An unidentified man who authorities earlier said might have acted as an accomplice was cleared Sunday of any involvement. Pima County sheriff’s deputy Jason Ogan told The Associated Press on Sunday that the man was a cab driver who drove the gunman to the grocery store outside of which the shooting occurred. One of the victims was Christina-Taylor Green, who was a member of the student council at her local school and went to the event because of her interest in government. She is the granddaughter of former Philadelphia Phillies manager Dallas Green. She was born on 9/11 and featured in a book called “Faces of Hope” that chronicled one baby from each state born on the day terrorists killed nearly 3,000 people. The fact that Christina’s life ended in tragedy was especially tragic to those who knew her. “Tragedy seems to have happened again,” said the author of the book, Christine Naman. “In the form of this awful event.” Authorities said the dead included U.S. District Judge John M. Roll; Greene; Giffords aide Gabe Zimmerman, 30; Dorothy Morris, 76; Dorwin Stoddard, 76; and Phyllis Scheck, 79. Judge Roll had just stopped by to see his friend Giffords after attending Mass. In one of several YouTube videos, which featured text against a dark background, Loughner described inventing a new U.S. currency and complained about the illiteracy rate among people living in Giffords’ congressional district in Arizona. “I know who’s listening: Government Officials, and the People,” Loughner wrote. “Nearly all the people, who don’t know this accurate information of a new currency, aren’t aware of mind control and brainwash methods. If I have my civil rights, then this message wouldn’t have happen (sic).” In Loughner’s middle-class neighborhood — about a five-minute drive from the scene — sheriff’s deputies had much of the street blocked off. The neighborhood sits just off a bustling Tucson street and is lined with desert landscaping and palm trees. Neighbors said Loughner lived with his parents and kept to himself. He was often seen walking his dog, almost always wearing a hooded sweat shirt and listening to his iPod. The assassination attempt left Americans questioning whether divisive politics had pushed the suspect over the edge. Giffords faced frequent backlash from the right over her support of the health care reform last year, and had her office vandalized the day the House approved the landmark measure. Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik lashed out at what he called an excessively “vitriolic” atmosphere in the months leading up to the rampage as he described the chaos of the day. The sheriff said the rampage ended only after two people tackled the gunman. A third person intervened and tried to pull a clip away from Loughner as he attempted to reload, the sheriff said. “He was definitely on a mission,” according to event volunteer Alex Villec, former Giffords intern.

At a news conference, Dr. G. Michael Lemole Jr., chief of neurosurgery, said Giffords has responded to simple commands. He told CNN Giffords' responses suggest she has retained the ability for higher levels of reasoning.
Lemole, who operated on Giffords, said the bullet passed through the left side of her brain ""back to front,"" causing less damage than it would have going through both hemispheres.
Giffords was in a medically induced coma.
""When you get shot in the head and a bullet goes through your brain, your chances of living are very small,"" said Dr. Peter Rhee, chief of trauma surgery.
Giffords, believed to be the shooter's target, was the only one of the wounded to remain in critical condition. Six people were killed. 
Jared Lee Loughner, a 22-year-old Tucson man, has been charged with the mass shooting.

Lemole, who operated on Giffords, said the bullet passed through the left side of her brain ""back to front,"" causing less damage than it would have going through both hemispheres. Giffords was in a medically induced coma. ""When you get shot in the head and a bullet goes through your brain, your chances of living are very small,"" said Dr. Peter Rhee, chief of trauma surgery. Giffords, believed to be the shooter's target, was the only one of the wounded to remain in critical condition. Six people were killed. Jared Lee Loughner, a 22-year-old Tucson man, has been charged with the mass shooting.

A federal agent's affidavit filed as part of the criminal complaint against Loughner said authorities also found a letter from Giffords thanking him for attending a 2007 event.

The network said Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik said Loughner, who had been suspended from a junior college in Tucson last fall after multiple encounters with campus police, is not cooperating with investigators. He is to appear in federal court in Phoenix Monday.
Investigators now believe Loughner had no accomplice in the mass shooting outside a Tucson supermarket where Giffords was meeting constituents. They said Loughner took a cab to the store and went inside with the driver to get change, but the driver did not know what he intended.
Giffords is believed to have been the major target, but 13 people were injured along with those who were killed.
Giffords remained in critical condition Sunday. At a news conference at University Medical Center in Tucson, a spokesman said doctors were ""cautiously optimistic"" about her recovery.  
Those killed have been identified as Roll, 63, chief judge for the U.S. District Court for Arizona; Zimmerman, 30; Christina Green, 9; Dorothy Morris, 76; Dorwin Stoddard, 76; and Phyllis Schneck, 79. 
The gunman still had bullets when subdued by two people in the crowd and ""probably would have shot other people had he not been tackled,"" Dupnik said.
The local sheriff lamented what he sees as the caustic effect the nasty tone of the rhetoric from some quarters has had on society.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)  TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — Federal prosecutors brought charges Sunday against the gunman accused of attempting to assassinate Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and killing six people at a political event in Arizona. Investigators said they carried out a search warrant at Jared Loughner’s home and seized an envelope from a safe with messages such as “I planned ahead,” “My assassination” and the name “Giffords” next to what appears to be the man’s signature. He allegedly purchased the Glock pistol used in the attack in November at Sportsman’s Warehouse in Tucson. Court documents also show that Loughner had contact with Giffords in the past. Other evidence included a letter addressed to him from Giffords’ congressional stationery in which she thanked him for attending a “Congress on your Corner” event at a mall in Tucson in 2007. Heather Williams, the first assistant federal public defender in Arizona, says the 22-year-old suspect doesn’t yet have a lawyer, but that her office is working to get one appointed. Williams’ office is asking for an outside attorney because one of those killed was U.S. District Judge John M. Roll. Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik said Sunday that Loughner acted alone. Meanwhile, authorities released 911 calls in which a person witnessing the mass shooting outside a grocery store in Tucson describes a frantic scene and says, “I do believe Gabby Giffords was hit.” Loughner fired at Giffords’ district director and shot indiscriminately at staffers and others standing in line to talk to the congresswoman, said Mark Kimble, a communications staffer for Giffords. “He was not more than three or four feet from the congresswoman and the district director,” Kimble said, describing the scene as “just complete chaos, people screaming, crying.” Loughner is accused of killing six people, including an aide to Giffords and a 9-year-old girl who was born on Sept. 11, 2001. Fourteen others were wounded. Authorities don’t know Loughner’s motive, but said he targeted Giffords at a public gathering around 10 a.m. Saturday. Doctors treating the lawmaker provided an optimistic update about her chances for survival, saying they are “very, very encouraged” by her ability to respond to simple commands along with their success in controlling her bleeding. Mourners crammed into the tiny sanctuary of Giffords’ synagogue in Tucson to pray that she quickly recovered. Outside the hospital, candles flickered at a makeshift memorial. Signs read “Peace + love are stronger,” “God bless America and “We love you, Gabrielle.” People also laid down bouquets of flowers, American flags and pictures of Giffords. One of the victims was Christina Taylor Green, who was a member of the student council at her local school and went to the event because of her interest in government. She is the granddaughter of former Philadelphia Phillies manager Dallas Green. She was born on 9/11 and featured in a book called “Faces of Hope” that chronicled one baby from each state born on the day terrorists killed nearly 3,000 people. The fact that Christina’s life ended in tragedy was especially tragic to those who knew her. “Tragedy seems to have happened again,” said the author of the book, Christine Naman. “In the form of this awful event.” Authorities said the dead included Roll; Green; Giffords aide Gabe Zimmerman, 30; Dorothy Morris, 76; Dorwin Stoddard, 76; and Phyllis Schneck, 79. Judge Roll had just stopped by to see his friend Giffords after attending Mass. An unidentified man who authorities earlier said might have acted as an accomplice was cleared Sunday of any involvement. Pima County sheriff’s deputy Jason Ogan told The Associated Press on Sunday that the man was a cab driver who drove the gunman to the grocery store outside of which the shooting occurred. In one of several YouTube videos, which featured text against a dark background, Loughner described inventing a new U.S. currency and complained about the illiteracy rate among people living in Giffords’ congressional district in Arizona. “I know who’s listening: Government Officials, and the People,” Loughner wrote. “Nearly all the people, who don’t know this accurate information of a new currency, aren’t aware of mind control and brainwash methods. If I have my civil rights, then this message wouldn’t have happen (sic).” In Loughner’s middle-class neighborhood — about a five-minute drive from the scene — sheriff’s deputies had much of the street blocked off. The neighborhood sits just off a bustling Tucson street and is lined with desert landscaping and palm trees. Neighbors said Loughner lived with his parents and kept to himself. He was often seen walking his dog, almost always wearing a hooded sweat shirt and listening to his iPod. The assassination attempt left Americans questioning whether divisive politics had pushed the suspect over the edge. Giffords faced frequent backlash from the right over her support of the health care reform last year, and had her office vandalized the day the House approved the landmark measure. Dupnik lashed out at what he called an excessively “vitriolic” atmosphere in the months leading up to the rampage as he described the chaos of the day. The sheriff said the rampage ended only after two people tackled the gunman. A third person intervened and tried to pull a clip away from Loughner as he attempted to reload, the sheriff said. “He was definitely on a mission,” according to event volunteer Alex Villec, former Giffords intern. —— Associated Press Writers Jacques Billeaud, Raquel Maria Dillon and Terry Tang contributed to this report.

Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) and many others, there is a lesson to be learned. We must realize that what unites us as Americans is more than what divides us; we often have more in common than we sometimes think. The outpouring of concern from every possible corner is evidence of that. We must keep that spirit in mind in the weeks and months ahead. Ms. Giffords is a model legislator who is willing to work with anyone. We need more public servants like her. Steven M. Clayton, Pittsburgh l The incredible tragedy in Arizona will undoubtedly be leveraged by both sides of many issues, ranging from Tea Party activism to gun control. One side will point to the other and say, ""You made this happen,"" and the other side will say ""But we didn't mean for this to happen."" These arguments are specious. The ""gun sight"" map of Sarah Palin was not made in an effort to lead to this shooting. It is mostly true that the ever more heated rhetoric of the conservative and liberal bases is not published in the effort to lead to violent action. But this is not enough. It is our responsibility as members of a productive society to actively prevent such acts. We must carefully think about our public actions and ask whether we are trying hard enough to prevent incitement. Did Ms. Palin's map really need gun sights? Is her opinion of the country's intelligence so low that she couldn't publish a list of names with issues well thought out and reasons for voting for other candidates? Why has the message frequently become that one candidate must be ""removed"" rather than another be voted in? Our arguments grow shorter and shorter. Inevitably, communicating in 140 characters or in five words on a sign at a rally or in a 10-second sound bite makes us lazy and careless. Sadly, many of those who communicate on far less constrained media, such as the Web, broadcast and print, also fail to consider the negative impact of their strident rhetoric. The desire for attention has replaced the need for responsibility. Mario Roederer, Bethesda l With the slayings of six Americans in Arizona, let alone the homicides in the Washington area in the first week of this new year, we have fresh evidence that access to firearms should be restricted nationwide. As long as we continue to permit minimally regulated gun purchases for all, our society will continue to pay an inordinately high price in lost lives. Ron Verdonk, Silver Spring "

Corey Fisher scored 21 points, Maalik Wayns had 13 of his 15 in the second half and No. 7 Villanova beat No. 24 Cincinnati 72-61 yesterday, handing the Bearcats their first loss of the season. Fisher had 20 points and made all nine of his free throws in a dynamic first half for the Wildcats (14-1, 3-0 Big East). “Fish had a big first half,” Villanova coach Jay Wright said. “But he got in foul trouble. Both Fish and Wayns did a great job for us.” Villanova upped its winning streak at The Pavilion, its cozy 6,500-seat on-campus arena, to 45 straight. The streak began on Jan. 17, 2007, and now includes 19 wins over Big East teams.

Loughner was handcuffed and wore a tan inmate uniform. His head was shaved and he bore a cut on his right temple. He responded ""yes"" when asked if he understood his rights. Doctors at Tucson's University Medical Center, meantime, were breathing a ""collective sigh of relief"" Monday about Giffords, who was critically injured during what authorities called the targeted attempt on her life by a gunman. Six people died in the attack. ""No change is good and we have no change,"" said Dr. Michael Lemole, referring to new CAT scans that showed no additional swelling of her brain. ""We can breathe a collective sigh of relief after the third day,"" which is Tuesday. Lemole, chief of neurosurgery at the Tucson hospital, said Giffords was following simple commands like raising her thumb, showing two fingers and wiggling her toes. He said that ""implies not only are the centers of the brain working but they're communicating with one another."" The hospital issued a statement Monday afternoon indicating Giffords remained in critical condition and that two patients who'd been hospitalized at the hospital's Trauma Center had been released. Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik said Loughner was not cooperating and told ABC News on Monday that the suspect had said ""not a word"" to investigators. Arizona Republic staffer Dennis Wagner reported Monday that FBI agents working the case ran into trouble gaining entry to the Loughner family home Monday. Relatives of the suspect had apparently used a 4-by-4 double-thick piece of plywood to block access to the front porch of the house in north Tucson, Wagner reported that he witnessed. Agents began banging on the blockade, shouting to be let in, and some agents who went to the rear of the house were able to get inside after talking to family members, Wagner reported. In court documentsFBI Special Agent Tony Taylor said investigators searched a safe in Loughner's Tucson home and recovered an envelope with Gifford's name written on it, along with the words: ""I planned ahead"" and ""my assassination."" The envelope contains what ""appears to be Loughner's signature,"" the court documents state. Also recovered from the safe was a letter addressed to ""Jared Loughney"" from Giffords thanking him for attending a Aug. 30, 2007, constituent event at another Tucson mall.

GABRIELLE GIFFORDS: Who is she?
SCENE:  Intern's actions may have saved Rep. Giffords' life
ON WATCH: Two House members plan to carry guns Loughner was charged with one count of attempted assassination of a member of Congress, two counts of killing an employee of the federal government and two counts of attempting to kill a federal employee. The court appearance on Monday was his first. President Obama will travel to Tucson on Wednesday to attend a memorial service for the victims of last weekend's shooting rampage. White House spokesman Nick Shapiro said late Monday that the president would speak at the service, and that first lady Michelle Obama would accompany her husband. The University of Arizona said the service would take place at 6 p.m. local time on the campus and would be free and open to the public. On Monday, the president, first lady and others around the country observed a moment of silence at 11 a.m. Monday ""to honor the innocent victims of the senseless tragedy."" Obama ordered flags flown at half-staff until Friday at sunset. Giffords, an Arizona Democrat, was shot in the head at point blank range during a ""Congress On Your Corner"" event at a busy Tucson supermarket. The dead include an aide to the congresswoman, a 9-year-old girl and a federal judge. ""She survived because she's a fighter. That's why,"" Giffords press secretary, C.J. Karamargin, holding back tears, said Sunday. ""Her will and her strength are reasons why."" Lemole said Giffords was fortunate the bullet did not cross the brain's two hemispheres, but rather went through only the left side. That region controls speech and right-sided movement. Lemole said part of Giffords' skull has been removed temporarily to aid the healing process. ""Brain swelling is the biggest threat right now,"" he said. GRAPHIC: Brain centers closest to bullet's path Rhee said Monday of the eight survivors in the hospital only Giffords is in critical condition; five are in serious condition; and two others are in good condition. ""Trauma care will now take over,"" he said, which mean addressing the patient ""as a whole"" taking care of emotional issues like post-traumatic stress syndrome and depression. Twenty people were shot in total, Dupnik said. Loughner was apprehended at the scene; a second man sought in connection with the case has been cleared, Sheriff's Deputy Jason Ogan said. The man was a cabdriver who drove the alleged gunman to the grocery store. Dupnik said the six killed included federal Judge John Roll, 63, who had stopped by to see his friend Giffords after attending mass; Giffords aide Gabe Zimmerman, 30; and 9-year-old Christina-Taylor Green, born on Sept. 11, 2001, and excited to meet the congresswoman after recently being elected to student council at Mesa Verde Elementary School. Also killed were Dorothy Morris, 76; Dorwan Stoddard, 76; and Phyllis Schneck, 79. The mother of the youngest casualty of Saturday's mass shooting said Sunday that both her children — 9-year-old Christina-Taylor Green as well as her 11-year-old son Dallas Green— were invited to the outdoor rally hosted by Giffords, but Dallas, may have been saved by the a conflicting karate practice. ""Had he gone, I'm afraid he would have died, too,"" said Roxanna Green, 45, whose daughter suffered a fatal gunshot wound to the chest. Born the day of the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, D.C., Christina-Taylor Green was ""anxious"" to attend the event and meet Giffords after being invited by neighbor Susan Hileman, Green said. Later that day, Green said she received a call from Hileman's husband saying her daughter and his wife had been taken to University Medical Center. ""I thought they had been in some kind of car accident, a fender-bender maybe,"" she said. ""After 10 or 15 minutes of waiting and not hearing anything, I knew it was not good. Then, the surgeon came out and said they tried but they could not save her."" Green, whose husband, John, is an executive with the Los Angeles Dodgers, said her neighbor remains hospitalized with multiple gunshot wounds. The victim's grandfather managed the Philadelphia Phillies, New York Yankees and New York Mets. ""I have so many memories of her,"" Green said of her daughter. ""She was a beautiful girl, inside and out. She cared about people and did so many charitable things. She was high energy. I remember her smile, her laugh."" At the U.S. Supreme Court, the nine justices joined in the national moment of silence. Arrayed as usual along their tall mahogany bench, justices slightly bowed their heads. Earlier in the morning, Roberts said the justices wanted to honor ""the innocent victims of the tragedy in Tucson."" ""That sensesless shooting on Saturday caused devastating injury to persons who all, in their own way, contribute to the strength of our nation,"" he said. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who was scheduled Monday to offer the state-of-the-state speech, instead used her time on the floor of the Arizona State Capitol in Phoenix to recognize Daniel Hernandez, the Giffords intern who aided the congresswoman at the shooting scene. Brewer also denounced the tragedy. ""Arizona is in pain,"" Brewer said. ""Yes, our grief is profound ... but we will not be brought down. We will never be brought down."" Brewer added, ""May God bless all the victims and their families and those suffering from Saturday's tragedy. May God bless those who serve us in the freedom and cause of justice."" ON POLITICS: Congress observes moment of silence
THE SCENE: Three helped subdue suspect Federal investigators have seized surveillance video that reveals a horrific scene of rapid devastation, U.S. Marshal David Gonzales said. He said Giffords was shot first and it took only several minutes for the gunman to empty a cartridge of 31 rounds before he was subdued while trying to reload his 9mm Glock gun. In a tape of the call released Sunday by the sheriff's office, a 911 caller witnessing the mass shooting describes a frantic scene and says, ""I do believe Gabby Giffords was hit. A guy had a semiautomatic pistol. He went in and just started firing and he ran."" Dupnik lauded Patricia Maisch, who was waiting in line with her husband to get a photo with Giffords when the shooting started. Dupnik said that after the gunman had fired the first clip of 31 bullets, Maisch ran up to the suspect and grabbed a full magazine as he was loading it into the gun. The shooter was able to reload, but the gun did not immediately fire due to a malfunctioning spring, Dupnik said. Roger Sulzgeber, who was also in line, and Joseph Zimudie, who was at a nearby Walgreens and heard the shooting, then subdued the gunman, Dupnik said. Mark Kimble, a communications staffer for Giffords, described the scene as ""just complete chaos, people screaming, crying."" The gunman fired at Giffords and her district director and started shooting indiscriminately at staffers and others standing in line to talk to the congresswoman, Kimble said. ""He was not more than three or four feet from the congresswoman and the district director,"" he said. Alex Villec, a 19-year-old volunteer, was organizing the line of constituents when the shooter approached and asked to speak to Giffords, Villec told the Arizona Daily Star. Villec said he told him to stand at the back of a line to wait for about 20 minutes. A few minutes later, the shooter left the line and walked toward Giffords. ""He was intent when he came back — a pretty stone-cold glance and glare,"" Villec told the newspaper. ""I didn't see his gun, but it was clear who he was going for ... His goal was the congresswoman."" Villec said the shooter walked past him and raised his hand. Villec said he heard gunshots before ducking behind a pillar and running across the supermarket parking lot to a bank for safety. ""It was bedlam,"" he said. ""People were getting down on the ground. They were screaming."" Dupnik blamed, in part, gun laws that allow ""everybody in this state to carry weapons whenever they want and that's almost where we are."" He also said that ""when the rhetoric about hatred ... about mistrust of government"" gets heated, it inflames ""the public 24 hours a day, seven days a week."" Giffords expressed similar concern before the shooting. Last March, shortly after the House passed health care legislation, Giffords' congressional office in Tucson was vandalized. Afterward, she referred to the animosity against her by conservatives, including former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin's decision to list Giffords' seat as one of the top ""targets"" in the November midterm elections. ""For example, we're on Sarah Palin's targeted list, but the thing is, that the way that she has it depicted has the crosshairs of a gun sight over our district. When people do that, they have to realize that there are consequences to that action,"" Giffords said in an interview with MSNBC. In the hours after the shooting, Palin issued a statement in which she expressed her ""sincere condolences"" to the family of Giffords and the other victims. In an email to a friend the day before she was wounded, Giffords discussed how to ""tone our rhetoric and partisanship down,"" according to the Associated Press on Monday. The message on Friday congratulated Republican Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson on his new position at Harvard University. She wrote him: ""After you get settled, I would love to talk about what we can do to promote centrism and moderation. I am one of only 12 Dems left in a GOP district (the only woman) and think that we need to figure out how to tone our rhetoric and partisanship down."" Federal law enforcement officials were poring over captured versions of a MySpace page that belonged to Loughner and over YouTube video published to the Internet weeks ago under an account ""Classitup10"" and linked to him. The MySpace page, which was removed within minutes of the gunman being identified by U.S. officials, included a mysterious ""Goodbye friends"" message published hours before the shooting and exhorted his friends to ""Please don't be mad at me."" In one of several YouTube videos, which featured text against a dark background, an author who identified himself as Loughner described inventing a new U.S. currency and complained about the illiteracy rate among people living in Giffords' congressional district. FULL COVERAGE: All stories on Gabrielle Giffords and the Tucson shooting
ON THE WEB: Local coverage from AZCentral.com ""I know who's listening: Government Officials, and the People,"" Loughner wrote. ""Nearly all the people, who don't know this accurate information of a new currency, aren't aware of mind control and brainwash methods. If I have my civil rights, then this message wouldn't have happen (sic)."" Roll was hailed as a wise and fair jurist by his colleagues. ""We in the judiciary have suffered the terrible loss of one of our own,"" Roberts said. JUDGE ROLL: Had received death threats in '09 Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said, ""I am just heartbroken. Gabby is more than just a colleague. She's a friend."" U.S. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said, ""An attack on one who serves is an attack on all who serve. Acts and threats of violence against public officials have no place in our society."" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Giffords ""a brilliant and courageous member of Congress."" Giffords was first elected in 2006, part of the freshman class that had ushered in a Democratic majority that made Pelosi the House speaker. Giffords represents the 8th District, which spreads to the U.S.-Mexico border. She won her third term in November by slightly more than 1 percentage point over Republican Jesse Kelly, who had Tea Party support. Giffords, who is married to astronaut Mark Kelly, had made immigration and border control among her signature issues during her three terms in Congress. A centrist Democrat, she approached the immigration debate in a nuanced fashion, mixing requests for more Border Patrol agents with calls to increase the number of work visas granted to foreigners.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., is a longtime gun owner and has often spoken out in support of broad Second Amendment rights. However, the tragic attack on Giffords that left six dead and 14 wounded is reigniting the debate over gun ownership in America. In 2008 and 2009, Giffords signed on to briefs to the Supreme Court urging justices to overturn gun control laws that severely restricted the access of those who sought to purchase and own firearms. In both cases, the court ruled to roll back the restrictions. At the time, Giffords noted the “long tradition” of gun ownership in the United States adding, “It is a tradition which every law-abiding citizen should be able to enjoy."" Many of Giffords’ Democratic colleagues are taking a different tone, including Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., who said Sunday, ""Guns kill. And those who glamorize gunplay or worship gun ownership do no service to humanity."" On Monday, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., announced that he is working with Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., on legislation that would ban the manufacture and sale of high-capacity ammunition clips like the one allegedly used by Tucson shooting suspect Jared Loughner. McCarthy, who lost her husband in a 1993 mass shooting, said the ban is something that was a part of the assault weapons law that expired in 2004. She said she’s been unable to get the prohibition re-enacted because “the House and the Senate are pro-gun houses.” Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the original author of the assault weapons ban, said Monday that she is also “looking at all the options” and hoping to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle on the issue. States have great latitude in passing their own gun laws, and Arizona is viewed as one of the most permissive. It’s a fact Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik, also a Democrat, lamented on Saturday, saying, “I have never been a proponent of letting everybody in this state carry weapons under any circumstances that they want, and that's almost where we are.” Loughner reportedly did pass a background check, as required in Arizona. There are now questions about his mental health, and whether a more thorough understanding of his possible condition might have affected his ability to purchase a weapon. At the same time, some lawmakers are pushing for action, others are urging caution. Appearing on “FOX News Sunday,” Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said the Tucson shooting is “probably about a very sick individual,” adding, “Weapons don’t kill people. It’s the individual that killed these people.” Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox Subscribed You've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!

Jared Loughner, 22, of Tucson is accused of the shooting spree that left six dead and a number wounded, including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz.
Advertisement In 2008, Loughner denied any involvement with the graffiti to a police officer, but in a second interview, told police the letters he had painted meant ""Christian,"" The Arizona Republic reported Monday. The newspaper said the officer wrote of the incident, ""I asked Loughner the meaning of his moniker. He stated that the 'c' meant Christian and the 'x' also meant Christian,"" adding in parentheses, ""As personally written by Loughner on my field interviewing notebook!"" The report said Loughner also admitted to other graffiti, always using a marker. Loughner was driving a 1969 Chevy Nova Oct. 13, 2008, the Republic said, when a witness saw him get out of the car and write a symbol on a street sign. The witness got his license-plate number, the report said. Records show the case was dismissed on Dec. 9, 2008, after Loughner completed a diversion program.

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: ANCHORAGE, Alaska — The Palin clan is off the air for now, at least on TLC. “Sarah Palin’s Alaska” concluded Sunday on the cable network with the final episode of the eight-part documentary series showing the former governor and her family having assorted adventures in their home state. The show appeared ripe for a second season after attracting an average of more than 3 million viewers per episode and debuting with an audience of nearly 5 million people in November — a record premiere for TLC. The end of the cable TV show is generating online buzz about the reason it won’t continue. Many say the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee must be eyeing another run for the White House. Some even mentioned that Discovery Communications-owned TLC could risk violating equal-time regulations if the show continued and Palin was running for office. However, TLC spokeswoman Laurie Goldberg said the plan from the start was for a special single season only. “It’s not a cancellation. It’s not a lack of renewal,” she said. Palin representatives declined to comment on the matter. The news that the show was not returning was first reported by Entertainment Weekly on Friday, a day before the weekend mass shooting in Arizona that left six people dead and injured 14 others, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Palin was drawn into the discussion because she used crosshairs on a gun sight to target Giffords’ district and 19 others last spring during midterm elections. Conservative talk show host Glenn Beck on Monday read what he said was an e-mail from Palin saying she hates violence and that “out children will not have peace if politicos just capitalize on this to succeed in portraying anyone as inciting terror and violence.” The cable television show has generated controversy of its own. Palin shot a caribou in one episode, prompting screenwriter Aaron Sorkin to call her a “witless bully.” In another episode, Palin and her family commented about Joe McGinniss, a temporary next-door neighbor who the Palins said intruded on their privacy to work on a book. Palin also was criticized for allowing her family to fish close to bears and for presenting the 49th state in a way only the wealthy could experience.

Can it change the culture?,http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2011/0111/Arizona-shooting-reverberates-in-Congress.-Can-it-change-the-culture,en,False,,3,Christian Science Monitor,http://csmonitor.com,"  Link copied. We want to bridge divides to reach everyone. In the halls of Congress, the Arizona shooting has prompted calls to tone down violent rhetoric. But it will take more than reformed lawmakers to change politics' tough-talking culture. Loading... January 11, 2011 Saturday’s mass shooting in Tucson, Ariz., reset the political clock on Capitol Hill Monday, as Congress swept aside the legislative agenda out of respect for those killed or injured, including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D) of Arizona and her aide, Gabriel Zimmerman. The motive for the mass shooting in Tucson is not clear, but that hasn’t stopped speculation about what is to blame or how tragedy can be averted in the future. The most frequent comment on Capitol Hill – short of ubiquitous calls to exercise prudence – is to tone down the toxic rhetoric, especially gun-infused metaphors. But critics acknowledge that it will take more than just members of Congress altering their tough-talking ways to change the overall culture. Political consultants, fundraisers, the news media are all also addicted to tough talk – and for the same reason, it sells. “This is a deep cultural style of political expression that has developed over 30 years, and it’s not going to be changed overnight,” says former House historian Raymond Smock, who led a staff discussion Monday on the issue at the Robert C. Byrd Center for Legislative Studies. “Politics has always been based on fear … keeping people mad, keeping people on the ragged edge,” he adds. “Every once in a while we get sensitized again, but it’s hard to change.” Rep. Robert Brady (D) of Pennsylvania wants to get the courts involved by expanding the existing ban on threats to top political leaders. His draft bill, which was prompted by Saturday's shootings, provides that all those things you can’t say about a president or vice president – such as statements or symbols expressing intent to kill or injure – you also should not be able to say about other federal officials, including members of Congress. That means no putting members' faces in a bull’s eye or cross hairs. After the Arizona shootings, Sarah Palin’s PAC website removed a map that put cross hairs on districts around the country where political opponents were targeted for defeat. Palin spokeswoman Rebecca Mansour called the targets on the site “surveying symbols.” The trouble is, Representative Brady notes, all that fear and hate-infused speech gets the public’s attention. Negative ads can push a candidate over the top – or sink them. “Unfortunately, it’s good politics in this day and age,” Brady said via a spokesman Monday. “It’s hard to end practices that work at the ballot box.” Journalists, too, are caught up in the “showdown,” “targeting,” “taking aim” rhetoric now deemed offensive. The National Journal cover story for Jan. 8 features the subhead: “John Boehner’s troops are spoiling for a fight, but the speaker wants to aim before he shoots.” The Rev. Rob Schenk, president of Faith and Action in the Nation’s Capital, says that fundraisers, too, share responsibility for a pernicious political culture. “The typical fundraising letter says that if you don’t do this, they will take over, as in your grandchildren will be taught by homosexuals in their classroom,” he says. “This kind of hyperbolic, alarmist, incendiary language is driven by the numbers,” he adds. “The fundraisers know if they can induce fear and anger, those are the two most effective motivators for people to go out of their way and cut a check.” “I must admit a certain guilt myself, because up until very recently I cooperated with this type of fundraising and now I’m beginning to see how damaging it was to people,” he says. Just three days into the investigation of the Tucson shooting, it’s not clear what motivated the suspected shooter, Jared Lee Loughner. His favorite books, as noted on his YouTube profile page, range from “Mein Kampf” and “The Communist Manifesto” to “To Kill a Mockingbird,” “Aesop’s Fables,” and “Peter Pan.” Internet comments attributed to him are disoriented and rambling. Prima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik repeated Monday his assertion that that the toxic climate of political speech may have been a factor in the shootings. “The vitriol affects the [unbalanced] personality that we are talking about,” he said. “You can say, ‘Oh no, it doesn’t,’ but my opinion is that it does.” Mark Pitcavage, a historian with the Anti-Defamation League, urges caution in jumping to conclusions in this case. “There has been an increase in violent rhetoric, but it’s not clear this incident was a manifestation of that,” he says. But he adds that toning down the rhetoric is a good thing and can reduce the incidence of future attacks. “If this gets people to catch their breath and make an attempt to get back to a more civil society, society can only benefit,” he says.

29757042,2011-01-11 18:00:00,Guns and responsibility -- Opinion Focus with Eugene Robinson,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2011/01/04/DI2011010403091.html?nav=rss_nation/special,en,False,,2,Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com," Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson will be online to discuss his recent columns and the latest news. _______________________ Eugene Robinson: Hi, everyone. Welcome to our weekly discussion -- a sad week, to be sure. Today's column, of course, was about the Tucson horror. I remember driving down to Blacksburg after the Virginia Tech shootings and asking the same question that I'm asking now: How on earth did this disturbed person get such deadly weaponry? Let's begin. _______________________ Gun control laws: Mr. Robinson, Jared Loughner was over 21, had no criminal record and had no mental health record. You talk about ""reasonable"" gun laws but the only new law that would have prevented him from legally buying a weapon would have been a total ban on handguns. Is that what you're advocating? Because I doubt even that would have kept him from getting his hands on a gun. It would only make it impossible for me, an Army retiree with three tours in Iraq and a security clearance, to own one. Eugene Robinson: The Supreme Court has made clear that a total ban on handguns would not pass muster, so that's not on the table. Two things should have happened: Congress should have renewed the ban on assault weapons, which would have made those 30-round clips illegal and unavailable; at least some lives would have been saved. More important, there should have been some way of flagging his disturbed mental state before he was allowed to buy that gun. The fact that he passed the federal background check tells me that the background check isn't much of a filter. _______________________ ""Well regulated militia"": I am a supporter of the 2nd Amendment as a way to keep the government in check. I do believe the Founding Fathers had that in mind when writing the Constitution.However, for the first time, I am finding myself drawn to the phrase ""well regulated militia"" and wondering what it could have meant. If every word in the Constitution is important, surely the terms ""well regulated"" have import. What is that ""regulation?"" And then what would a ""militia"" be? And how would they work together? What would that look like?Yet I don't hear us as a nation talking about that relative to guns. Should we be? Eugene Robinson: Let's be honest. The ""well-regulated militia"" phrase meant something in 1789, but now it's a total anachronism. I also think it's pretty irrelevant, since the Supreme Court has ruled that the Second Amendment confers an individual right to keep and bear firearms. That's not the way the Constitution was interpreted for nearly a century, but that's the way it is now. _______________________ Gun control is only one ingredient in the cocktail.: Just a comment: I live overseas in a nation with extremely high crime rates. At my house, we employ a number of security measures, e.g. perimeter wall, electric fencing, locked garage, grilled doors/windows, infrared sensors, sleeping safe haven, audible and silent alarms, and security response service. Any one of these can be (and have been) circumvented or breached by would-be criminals given enough time and effort. However, used together, they greatly decrease the likelihood that my family will fall prey to a home invasion because 1) most intruders will choose a softer target, and 2) law enforcement will likely respond before all layers can be breached. I am frustrated at the ""all-or-nothing"" extremist viewpoints (mostly) coming from opponents of gun control legislation. Laws to manage access to weapons is only one ingredient in the cocktail. Others might be greater enforcement of compliance with mental health reporting, public awareness/education campaigns (funded by gun manufacturers and the NRA), differentiation between guns for recreation vs. those for killing, etc. Eugene Robinson: Thanks for your smart perspective. You're right -- it's not all or nothing. We could start by enforcing existing laws that are not being followed, in some cases for ideological reasons. State are supposed to report the names of people judged mentally ill to the federal background-check list, but they don't comply. Following this law wouldn't have stopped the Tucson massacre, but it might stop the next. _______________________ Responsibility: As someone who has long objected to Sarah Palin's ""real Americans"" demagoguery, I understand the desire to blame her for the Tuscon tragedy. Obviously I agree that there's no direct link between people like Palin and the shooting. A point that I think is getting lost, however, is the much more general one about responsibility in rhetoric. One doesn't have to blame Palin or Sherran Angle to condemn the gunsights map and the ""Second Amendment solution"" as generally irresponsible. Would you agree? I think it's much more likely that such rhetoric leads to political extremism instead of incidents of violence. Eugene Robinson: I do. There has been no indication that the gunman in Tucson was tuned into Sarah Palin's or Sharron Angle's rhetoric -- and even if he was, not even an implacable Palin critic like me could charge that somehow she caused this atrocity. That said, there are some realities that need to be acknowledged. There was a time, in the '60s and '70s, when you heard angry, ""revolutionary,"" anti-government rhetoric coming largely from the left. Now you hear none of that from the left and a lot of it from the right, complete with military metaphors. The temperature of all this rhetoric heats up the political and social atmosphere in ways that I believe are dangerous. It's entirely appropriate to point that out. _______________________ Tucson, Az: I want all the gun zealots (as opposed to responsible firearms owners) to realize this point: For all their ranting about guns making us safer: and defending yourself, this massacre was NOT stopped by a citizen with a gun. Arizona was some of the most lenient guns laws in the country; citizens can open or conceal carry without a permit, and NO 2nd amendment hero pulled his 2nd amendment tool out from his holster to end this attack. This murderous rampage was ended when people grabbed a magazine out of the hands of an active shooter before he could reload another high capacity magazine. The myth of ""if only if more people had guns we'd be safer"" was destroyed, as it is with every mass shooting that has occurred in this country. Eugene Robinson: You couldn't be more right. What's more, our sister website Slate has a piece that tells the story of a bystander who did happen to be armed. He relates that carrying the gun made his more willing to rush toward the chaotic fray -- but that he arrived just after a man had taken the gun out of the hands of the shooter. This bystander thought for a moment that the hero was in fact the gunman. He didn't fire at him, fortunately, but that's the kind of thing that can happen when untrained people carry guns to the supermarket and make split-second decisions that mean the difference between life and death. Scary. _______________________ constitutional question: We already have limits on our second amendment rights. I am not allowed to purchase and carry an RPG, for example, nor am I permitted to mine my driveway, or make bombs in my basement. The only question is: Where is it reasonable and prudent to draw the line? I say: Go with original intent. Any American citizen should be permitted to own a black-powder muzzle-loader, no questions asked. Everyone else who wants a gun will have to be trained and licensed, with the license subject to biannual review. Eugene Robinson: Excellent idea. Anyone who wants to buy a musket, be my guest. The ""originalist"" justices, like Antonin Scalia, will surely agree. _______________________ How did this happen?: People have the right to bear arms in this country, and we just have to put up with the occasional mass shooting so that this right is protected for the majority. Do I agree with it? No, but I've come to accept it as inevitable. Eugene Robinson: _______________________ Gun Control: Hello, A young man on NPR yesterday who was a senior at Virginia Tech when that horrible tragedy happened said it best. In a free society with the population that we have, there will be a fringe element that is destructive and dangerous. Letter bomb, gun, chemical, auto. they will find a method. In D.C. when gun control was implemented didn't the murder rate soar? Paraphrasing Mencken- complex problems have simple solutions and they are wrong. Eugene Robinson: _______________________ Gun Control: Hi Eugene, The gun right fanatics always make the argument that gun laws are useless because ""the bad guys will find a way to get a gun no matter what."" That is absurd. With that logic, we should get rid of speed limits because bad people speed no matter what. We need to use better technology to screen gun purchasers and much stronger penalties for those illegally possessing/selling guns.If the political climate is not conducive to much stronger gun controls after VA Tech and Tuscon, do you think this country will EVER improve our gun laws? Eugene Robinson: _______________________ Historical irony in Arizona : Gene: I heard that Rep. Giffords district includes Tombstone AZ, site of the most famous gunfight in American history at the OK Corral. The immediate cause of that gunfight was the fact that one Ike Clanton had walked drunkenly through Tombstone threatening the life of Marshal Virgil Earp while waving a gun. As in many Western towns, contrary to what the movies have shown, carrying a gun was illegal. So Marshal Earp, hearing of Ike's bragging, sought him out and ""buffaloed"" him--smashing him in the skull with a revolver. When Ike was released from jail, he and some pals immediately armed themselves and were heard talking violence against Virgil Earp, his brothers and their friend John Henry ""Doc"" Holliday. It all ended in the famous gunfight--all precipitated by carrying guns illegally. If that's not irony, I don't know what is. Eugene Robinson: Thanks for the history lesson! _______________________ Guns and responsibility : How do we get adult kids into mental health treatment so they will even appear in a database for mental illness when they go to buy a gun?My daughter is an adult with a mental illness. She functions in society and goes to community college. She succeeds with much help from her family and friends. The sad fact is that in Virginia, the community college has no money to provide counseling for the mentally ill. If a student becomes a threat to themselves or anyone at school, they can see the disabilities counselor but only for academic counseling and some encouragement. If they truly need mental health assistance, they must go outside the college. Since Virginia Tech, mentally ill students appear on 'watch lists'--even those like my daughter who would never hurt anyone at school. If there are any incidents, they can be expelled. This, to me, is a huge problem. If the adult child doesn't want to seek help, they don't have to. Someone like the Arizona gunman drops out of college and ends up with too much time on his hands and no medical supervision. Then, he can buy guns and kill/hurt innocent people. Eugene Robinson: That's a heartbreaking story, and I'm sure your anguish is shared by many parents nationwide. The fact is that there is basically no system or infrastructure to adequately handle young adults with mental illness. Deinstitutionalization was a good and necessary process, but we replaced the old horrific mental institutions with... nothing. No real support, especially for those who are of the age of consent and who are not considered a danger to themselves or others -- which basically requires an overt, proximate threat. We need to rethink this problem, and fast. _______________________ The Bottom Line: Depending on which of two well-regarded surveys you go by, we have either the highest or the fourth highest (behind Brazil, Estonia and Mexico) per capita gun murder rates in the world (out of 180-some countries). I constantly hear gun enthusiasts claim that ""every place where gun control laws have been instituted, murder rates have gone up"". To them I ask, then how in blazes did things get so bad here in the gun Mecca of the world, and how are they so calm (one tenth the murder rate) in most European countries? What gives? Eugene Robinson: Very good question. They have strict gun control in Europe, and yet somehow the murder rate hasn't soared (as some gun advocates bizarrely claim it should). Turns out that there are more homicides committed with guns in countries where there are more guns. _______________________ Gun Zealots?: In response to comment Tucson. As I understand the events, two elderly men and one woman grounded the shooter after he was hit with a chair. The fourth man had a weapon and responded from a distant store upon hearing shots. What if the shooter had loaded the second magazine. Only one of the four had the greatest potential to save additional bystanders from being shot. Eugene Robinson: Right, but that's not what in fact happened. What happened was that the man with the gun arrived on the scene, and -- as he acknowledges -- had the impulse to shoot one of the heroes. The gun-toting citizen quelled that impulse, happily. But the killer was already subdued by the time he arrived. These to-the-rescue scenarios sound great, and it all works out fine in the movies, but things are a lot messier in real life. _______________________ Gun Control: Every time gun control is proposed, the gun lobby counters that criminals will just buy guns illegally. What can we do to stop the illegal flow of guns? Eugene Robinson: The Post has done an excellent series on the origin of guns used in crimes. These guns are being purchased legally at gun shops; then they change hands, perhaps a few times, before being used in crimes. So the chain of events that puts guns in criminals' hands begins with a legitimate sale -- protected, they tell me, by the Second Amendment. _______________________ Crafting an argument: I find your writing style very compelling. I was particularly moved by your column on repealing healthcare. I wish to use some of your articles in my FY Writing class. Is there a repository of your columns where I can find non-hot topic papers for my class? I teach at Clemson. Andrea Caumont: You can find all of Gene's columns here. _______________________ Eugene Robinson: Folks, my time is up for today. Thanks so much for participating, and see you again next week!"

Chaffetz Press Secretary Alisia Essig told Fox News that Chaffetz has carried his gun to different events back in his district and plans to do so more often in the future. A spokesman for Rep. Heath Shuler, D-N.C., said the congressman who challenged Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi for her spot atop the House Democratic Caucus also has a conceal and carry permit and expects to carry a gun more often. ""You never think something like this will happen, but then it does,"" Shuler told The Politico newspaper. ""After the elections, I let my guard down. Now I know I need to have (my gun) on me. We're going to need to do a much better job with security at these events."" Other lawmakers are considering ways to increase security details at home, though several have acknowledged that costs for frequent protection can be prohibitive. However, Rep. Jesse Jackson, Jr., D-Ill., announced Tuesday that he wants to restore the 5 percent in members' budgets that was cut by a House resolution last week as well as a 10 percent increase in member budgets for security measures. ""In some districts, that will mean hiring security personnel for public events. In other areas, that may mean installing surveillance cameras at district offices as a deterrent or improving the locks or the entry systems in district offices. Some will need more resources in order to move their offices to a safer area,"" Jackson said. Earlier this week, U.S. Capitol Police told lawmakers that members and staff should alert Capitol Police of suspicious circumstances, keep them informed of emergency and district contact information and appoint district staff to serve as a liaison to the Capitol Police. It also provided a guide for staying safe. On Monday, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., announced that he is working with Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., on legislation that would ban the manufacture and sale of high-capacity ammunition clips like the one allegedly used by Tucson shooting suspect Jared Loughner. McCarthy, who lost her husband in a 1993 mass shooting, said the ban is something that was a part of the assault weapons law that expired in 2004. She said she's been unable to get the prohibition re-enacted because “the House and the Senate are pro-gun houses."" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the original author of the assault weapons ban, also said she is ""looking at all the options"" for new gun legislation. States have great latitude in passing their own gun laws, and Arizona is viewed as one of the most permissive. Washington, D.C., however, has one of the strictest set of rules on guns and lawmakers who would protect themselves at home with a concealed weapon would likely find themselves unable to do so in the nation's capital despite Congressional rules that allow weapons to be taken into buildings by members and their authorized staff -- if the weapon is unloaded and securely wrapped. In 2007, a high-profile incident with a senior aide to Sen. Jim Webb, D-Va., set off debate on guns laws in Washington, D.C. An aide to Webb was arrested for accidentally carrying the senator's concealed handgun and ammunition clip into the Russell Senate Office Building, resulting in his arrest. Webb, a former Marine, said at the time that he packs a concealed weapon for his own safety, and during a Capitol Hill news conference discussed how he wants to protect himself, especially since members don't get presidential-style security details. Since the aide's arrest, the Supreme Court has invalidated the district's ban on all handguns, but the city still does not have a concealed carry law. Rep. Reid Ribble, R-Wis., a freshman who calls himself a firm supporter of the Second Amendment, said regardless of what individual members decide about their own safety, if fear controls lawmakers, it will debilitate the democratic process. ""If there are those who, for political purposes, want to use fear -- and we don't know what the motivations were for this young man yet, I think more will come out in the days as we go through the investigation -- but for those who want to use fear to restrict what we do and restrict movement, if they can cause us to do that, then in fact they've been successful in that endeavor,"" Ribble told Fox News.

Mike Huckabee lashed out at “left-wing politicians” and the media for their handling of Saturday’s mass shooting in Arizona, saying the rush to blame right-wingers for a shooting spree committed by a “whack job nut maggot” was “reprehensible.” Speaking on his radio show, “The Huckabee Report,” Monday and Tuesday, Huckabee, a top potential 2012 presidential contender, took up one of the right’s favorite themes in the wake of the shooting: that alleged would-be assassin Jared Loughner’s profile aligns more closely with liberals than conservatives... Huckabee noted that Loughner had been “described by classmates as a very liberal pothead” whose “favorite video shows a burning American flag. That doesn’t sound like any tea partiers I know.” It's obvious what's going on here: out of one side of their mouth, conservatives are deploring any discussion of violent right wing rhetoric as an unconscionable politicization of the tragedy, and out of the other side of their mouth they are politicizing the tragedy by blaming it on the left. It's clearly a deliberate strategy: Huckabee's comments mirror those of GOP Rep. Virginia Fox, who claimed Loughner is ""the liberal of liberals"" while simultaneously condemning criticism of the right's violent rhetoric. It's not at all consistent, but Republican talking points rarely are. They aren't trying to make sense. They're trying to win. They're acting not as if this were a national tragedy, but as if it were another partisan battle. And their number one priority is coming out on top."

We've received your submission. This Glock 19 loaded with a 33-round high-capacity magazine is exactly the same make and model used by accused mass murderer Jared Lee Loughner to kill six people and wound 14, including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Banned in six states, including New York and New Jersey, the extra-large clips continue to be sold freely throughout the rest of the country. “High-capacity magazines were involved in virtually every mass shooting in the US,” said Kristin Rand, legislative director of the gun-control advocacy group Violence Policy Center. “Ammunition is completely unregulated. There is no production-reporting requirements or background checks. It is impossible to determine how many [magazines] are out there.” The magazines were illegal under the Federal Assault Weapons Ban between 1994 and 2004, but when that law expired, they re-emerged — supplied by Glock and a bevy of “after-market” suppliers — on the open market, including in Loughner’s native Arizona. “They [manufacturers] are still eligible to sell them because of the sunset of the assault-weapon ban,” said Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms spokesman Joe Green. For instance, gunbroker.com — which one gun enthusiast described as the “e-Bay for gun collectors and gun merchants” — has multiple offerings for the Glock-issued 33-round magazine similar to Loughner’s. Another company, Spear Distributors Inc., of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., offers a new Glock 33-round magazine for $34.95 — and notes that it has 20 such items for sale. In a bizarre development, Glocks, including the model 19, have been flying off the shelves in Arizona since Saturday’s massacre. “We’re at double our volume over what we usually do,” Greg Wolff, who owns two Arizona gun shops, told Bloomberg News. “When something like this happens, people get worried that the government is going to ban stuff.” New York saw its own major increase in handgun sales Monday, just two days after the shooting — 33 percent compared to the same day last year. The national sales increase was about 5 percent, the news agency said. In New York, possession of the magazines carries a penalty of up to seven years in prison. There were 69 busts involving them last year, down from 78 s in 2009 and 83 in 2008. Meanwhile, carrying a gun within 1,000 feet of federal lawmakers would be illegal under a bill Rep. Peter King (R-LI) said he’d introduce. chuck.bennett@nypost.com Share Selection"

From the home they shared with their son, Randy and Amy Loughner released a statement calling it “a very difficult time” and spoke of their deep sorrow. “There are no words that can possibly express how we feel. We wish that there were, so that we could make you feel better,” the Loughners said. “We don’t understand why this happened. It may not make any difference but we wish that we could change the heinous events of Saturday. We care very deeply about the victims and their families. We are so very sorry for their loss.” The apparent target of the attack, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., 40, was able to breathe on her own Tuesday and move her arms at an intensive care unit, another hopeful sign of her progress, doctors said. The alleged gunman’s motives for shooting Giffords and 19 others remain unclear, though he had grown increasingly paranoid, friends said. One said that Loughner was influenced by films alleging that the collection of income tax is illegal and that the terrorist attacks of 2001 were staged by the government. A law enforcement official said Tuesday that a note was found in Loughner’s safe that said: “Die, Bitch.” Later on Tuesday, the Pima County Sheriff’s Department corrected its tally of the wounded. Nineteen people were shot, the department said, not 20 as had been reported. Six died, and 13 were wounded. Giffords’ congressional office released photos of Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, holding hands in her hospital room. The photos were taken Sunday, Giffords’ office said. The photos added a poignancy to Arizona’s latest turn in the national stage. Some critics, angered by the state’s aggressive anti-immigration stand and hard-right politics, have pointed to the mass shooting as evidence that Arizona is a place of intolerance and Tombstone justice. But there was also a rising sentiment and determination here that Arizona’s latest turn in the spotlight will be not another black eye, but a chance for a recalibration of the state’s image. The state has mustered an immediate and unified response, for instance, to reports that a controversial Kansas church is planning to picket the funerals of shooting victims. Tucson’s Democratic and Republican parties joined together to organize a blockade of counterprotesters, and Gov. Jan Brewer signed a bill restricting the Westboro Baptist Church’s activities — a bill that sailed through the normally rancorous state Legislature with ease. “I think it took a tragedy for the rest of the world to see how much compassion and unity there is in Tucson,” said Christin Gilmer, 26, who used to work for Giffords and knew two of the shooting victims. At Gilmer’s direction, supporters of the victims will line funeral processions wearing white wings to shield the families from the sight of the church pickets. Obama is scheduled to arrive in the city Wednesday for a public memorial. The president’s visit will come two days after Loughner appeared in federal court, charged with five federal crimes, including the attempted assassination of Giffords and the murder of John Roll, Arizona’s chief federal judge who was caught in the spray of bullets. Additional state charges are expected; Loughner could be executed. Amid the efforts to heal, there were also new fragments that emerged about Loughner’s life. He lived with his parents near Interstate 10, north of downtown Tucson. Loughner’s mother, Amy, appears to have been the family’s primary breadwinner. According to the human relations director of Pima County, Ariz., parks and recreation, Amy Loughner is a manager of a park in northeast Tucson on the site of a hot springs once used as a recuperation site. Jared Loughner had repeatedly exhibited unusual behavior. George Osler, 45, whose son Zachary was friends with Loughner, said it was clear that Loughner had distanced himself from reality and was abusing drugs. “He was a little odd,” Osler said. “You just have a suspicion — keep a close eye on this guy in case he’s up to something.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Rep. Peter King Rep. Peter King, the new chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, has ignited a storm of controversy for planning hearings next month on the growing threat of radical Islam (AP) (AP2009) Rep. Peter King said Tuesday he plans to introduce a new gun safety bill in Congress in the wake of the mass shooting in Arizona that killed six people and wounded 14 others, including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz. King said his bill would make it illegal to knowingly carry a gun within a thousand feet of ""certain high-profile"" government officials. ""It is imperative that we do all that we can to give law enforcement the tools they need to ensure the safety of New Yorkers and prevent an attack before it happens,"" King said during an appearance at a Manhattan event with Mayor Michael Bloomberg and other officials from New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania who discussed ways to prevent another shooting tragedy. Jared Loughner, 22, has been charged with trying to assassinate Giffords and is facing life in prison or the death penalty. The shooting rampage has altered the political landscape and prompted lawmakers to consider additional layers of security when meeting with constituents. A spokesman for King told FoxNews.com that the office is still working on the substance of the bill. King decided to introduce the bill ""to give the public a greater sense of security at public events with federal officials,"" the spokesman said. King is the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee and co-chairman of the Congressional Task Force on Illegal Guns. Bloomberg is co-chairman of Mayors Against Illegal Guns. ""Just as we saw after Virginia Tech, the Arizona tragedy has once again exposed fatal cracks in our background check system,"" Bloomberg said. ""The law says that drug abusers can't buy guns, but even though Jared Loughner was rejected by the military for drug uses and arrested on drug charges, he was able to pass a background check and buy a gun. It should be clear to everyone that the system is broken and it is time for our leaders in Washington to step up and fix it.""

Dr. Peter Rhee, Chief Trauma and Critical Care Emergency Surgery doctor at University Medical Center, describes in more detail the gunshot wound Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz.,received on Saturday, to reporters after a news briefing at UMC, Tuesday, Jan. 11, 2011, in Tucson, Ariz.  This Dec. 13, 2010 picture provided by the office of U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., shows Giffords, left, and Tucson Mayor Bob Walkup, right, during an event to raise money for The Salvation Army. On Tuesday, Jan. 11, 2011, Giffords was breathing on her own and moving both arms after being shot in the head on Saturday, doctors said.  The country is plagued by bad laws, but a good case can be made that the very worst laws are those that follow in the aftermath of a dramatic tragedy. The laws being proposed in the aftermath of the shooting of 20 people, six fatally, during an attempted assassination of Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, certainly validate this insight. Despite zero evidence that the shootings had any connection to Sarah Palin or the Tea Party, Rep. Robert Brady, D-Pa., is promising a bill to outlaw any speech or symbols that could be interpreted as threats to members of Congress, grousing that “You can’t put bulls’ eyes or crosshairs on a United States congressman.” Not to be outdone, Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., wants us to “rethink the parameters of free speech,” including installing “standards” to ensure “balanced media coverage.” Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., suggests the Federal Communications Commission “is not working anymore” and promises to look into ways to police (read: censor) the airwaves more effectively. She is especially upset at defeated Nevada Republican Sharron Angle’s reference to “Second Amendment remedies,” claiming there’s a direct connection between that statement and the shooting in Tucson, though there’s no evidence that shooting defendant Jared Lee Loughner knows who Sharron Angle is. Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, even wants Republicans to change the name of the effort to repeal Obamacare from “Repeal the Job-Killing Healthcare Law Act,” because, in light of Tucson, the word “killing” should not appear in the title of a piece of legislation. It should be obvious that these efforts to control speech run afoul of the First Amendment, which begins with the unambiguous words “Congress shall make no law.” But perhaps those words are offensive to distinguished members of Congress. So far, only Democratic Sens. Barbara Boxer of California and Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey have called for more new gun-control laws; Sen. Boxer wants a federal law on concealed-carry permits and supports Sen. Lautenberg’s call to ban the larger ammunition clip the shooter in Tucson used. But you can be fairly sure that more are coming. Actions of the unbalanced are routinely used to limit the rights of ordinary people. And William Galston of The New Republic has called for making involuntary commitment of those suspected of being mentally ill easier. What might make sense in the wake of Tucson would be increased security for members of Congress, though most proposals to date consist of increasing budgets and having the Capitol Police accompany members on visits to their districts. It would make more sense for members to notify local police of events in their districts. Most have not done so because – well, because until Saturday, town hall-style meetings haven’t seemed to pose threats beyond a little shouting. The shock of Tucson might ensure that constituent meetings are peaceful for a while – though copycat incidents can’t be ruled out – but a little protective prudence might be in order. That doesn’t require a new law. Get the latest news delivered daily! We invite you to use our commenting platform to engage in insightful conversations about issues in our community.

29804810,2011-01-12 15:26:39,Latest reaction to Arizona shootings,http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/blog/2011/jan/12/arizona-shootings-fallout-obama-tucson-speech,en,False,,1751,Guardian US,https://www.theguardian.com/us,"Turn autoplay off Turn autoplay on Please activate cookies in order to turn autoplay off 3.10pm GMT / 10.10am ET: Hello. It is another big day tracking the fallout from the Tucson mass shooting and near fatal wounding of congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. The country is still coming to terms with the aftermath of the massacre as it prepares for funerals and memorials. Yet the political ramifications are only just beginning. Here are some of the main highlights and developments we will be tracking: • Barack Obama lands in Tucson today to give what is being billed as one of the most important speeches of his presidency so far. Some experts are saying it is an ""Oklahoma City moment"" after Bill Clinton performed superbly as ""mourner in chief"" after the Oklahoma City bombing by Timothy McVeigh. ABC news speculates Obama's speech tonight will focus on the victims and avoid politics in a bid to bring the nation together. It also reveals Obama worked through much of last night writing it. • Sarah Palin is still a key part of the story. When is she not? She has released a video message directly taking on her critics who have blamed her – and other senior conservative figures – for inflaming emotions in American politics. Though, typically, she does not exactly use calm language in her message of peace and unity. She says those in the media blaming her are causing a ""blood libel"" on her reputation. Hmmm. I thought that phrase was generally used to explain the world's long history of brutal and awful antisemitism by those who falsely blame Jews for killing children for their blood – not for slamming a former governor of Alaska and current reality TV star for falsely hinting the American president might be a revolutionary Marxist. • America is also digesting the first and only statement so far to come from the family of alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner. It was issued last night to journalists essentially besieging the family in their Tucson home. It was brief and deeply apologetic. It is difficult to know what to make of it. It is hard to imagine what that family is going through. But at the same time the American public is demanding some form of explanation of Loughner's background. People want to understand his behaviour on some level. The family's plea for their privacy to be respected is unlikely to be obeyed. • As Arizona prepares for a slew of funerals and memorials, politicians in the state have proved that they actually can work together and pass a decent law when they really want to. In response to news that the disgustingly perverse Westboro Baptist Church was planning an anti-gay, anti-Catholic (anti-everything?) protest at the funeral of a nine-year-old victim of the tragedy, the Arizona legislature passed a law banning protests from near such events. Now, with that done, everyone should just ignore Westboro. They thrive on any sort of confrontation and counter-protest. At the same time, perhaps Arizona politicians can use their new spirit of co-operation to tackle thorny issues like immigration reform in a sensible and comradely atmosphere? Or, more likely, they can now go back to shouting at each other pointlessly. 3.27pm GMT / 10.27am ET: I think this can be filed under Not Very Helpful. But it has emerged that – as the nation sought answers to the Tucson tragedy and reflected upon how easy it was to buy guns – one Arizona politician decided to come to work armed. Or, as state senator Lori Klein so calmly put it: ""I pack."" That's heat she's packing, not a suitcase. To be exact, Klein decided that Monday was the perfect day to bring her .38 Special to work in her purse. ""It goes wherever I go ... I got sworn in with it. I didn't think it was an issue,"" Klein said, according to the Arizona Republic. It is hard to know where to begin with this particular staggering piece of idiocy. Of course, many will claim Klein – who is a Republican – was taking a sensible precaution at a dangerous time. But most will wonder when meaningful gun control can possibly begin when politicians take such decisions and start speaking like they are Hollywood action heroines. And, given that someone as clearly mentally unstable as Loughner was able to legally buy powerful guns, can we agree we do need to start somewhere? 3.41pm GMT / 10.41am ET: As has often been mentioned, the aftermath of shooting tragedies in the US seems to have developed a ritual all of its own. A great part of this is the ceremonies of mourning and tributes to those who have died or have been gravely wounded. The Tucson shooting stands out, obviously, for striking at the heart of one of the key pillars of American government. It is not stunned office workers mourning their colleagues or traumatised students wondering at the actions of another college shooter, but America's political class itself that feels under attack. So today the House of Representatives – of which Gabrielle Giffords was a member – is passing a resolution on the tragedy. The resolution honours all those slain on Saturday and acknowledges that Giffords was the target. Members of the house will speak for much of today in personal tributes and reflections on what the shooting means. Sometimes – in fact, nearly all the time – it is easy to be cynical at the posturings of most members of Congress. But here, watching the tributes on CNN, it is worth remembering that this time the politicians know Giffords and her staff as friends and work colleagues. 4.39pm GMT / 11.39am EST: The internet has invaded every aspect of modern life and we now leave online traces virtually wherever we go. Usually they have no significance. But in the aftermath of tragedies like that in Tucson suddenly they can provide – with hindsight – vital clues to the mindset of the alleged gunman. It used to be that mass shooters might leave a journal or a final note. Now we have a lifetime's online musings to speculate over, preserved on the internet. The Wall Street Journal has added to the trove of postings already found on YouTube and a UFO conspiracy website by digging up some of Loughner's contributions to a gaming website. They are fascinating stuff. They paint a picture of a young man dealing with mental problems. ""Does anyone have aggression 24/7?"" he asks the online community. And then ... If you went to prison right now ... What would you be thinking? Elsewhere in the cache of 131 postings Loughner also reveals that he struggled to find a job and felt bad after being rejected by women. More prosaically, he also talks about diets and weight-lifting. Other postings were typical of the rambling nonsensical style that Loughner exhibited on other websites and talk about grammar and conspiracy theories. There is no smoking gun here – he does not mention Giffords or indeed anything very political – but they do offer a chilling insight into Loughner's state of mind. 5.17pm GMT / 12.17pm ET: The defence of conservatives to the accusation that they have been inflaming debate in American politics runs to two basic arguments. The first one can be summed up: it's a lie put out by by the liberal media. The second one can be summed up: liberals do it too! A nice corrective to these arguments has been assembled by the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. They have come up with a timeline of the last few years that shows some of the more shocking incidents of rightwing violence and hysterical imagery. It shows that diehard conservatives do indulge in this and on a scale that those wacky liberals just cannot match. Some of it seems a little unfair. It is probably not right to pin the actions of a single crazed Neo-Nazi on the whole rightwing in general or even the extreme fringe of the right wing. But some of the comments from mainstream Republicans, radio talk show hosts and Tea Party figures are worth remembering. A few ""highlights"" (there are many, many more): 11 March 2009: NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre speaks at the 2009 Conservative Political Action Conference and announces that ""our founding fathers understood that the guys with the guns make the rules"". 31 July 2009: On WWJB-AM in Hernando County, Bob Haa tells a listener not to waste his ammunition on targets, to save it for the administration. Haa is later visited by an agent for the secret service. 25 August 2009: During a barbecue in Twin Falls, Idaho, an audience member asks Rex Rammell, a candidate in the 2010 Idaho Republican primary, a question about ""Obama tags"" during a discussion about state-issued tags for wolf hunting. Rammell responds: ""The Obama tags? We'd buy some of those."" 26 August 2009: At a rally in Texas, gubernatorial candidate and Tea Party favourite Debra Medina states: ""We understand that the tree of freedom is occasionally watered with the blood of tyrants and patriots."" 5.28pm GMT / 12.28pm ET: My colleague Stephen Bates has written a piece explaining more about the term ""blood libel"", which Sarah Palin used in her video message today (see 3.10pm GMT / 10.10am ET). Stephen writes: Sarah Palin's use of the phrase ""blood libel"" could scarcely be more incendiary, especially in a religious country like the US. The blood libel refers specifically to perhaps the most notorious verse in the Bible: Matthew 27:25, which has been used by some Christians to persecute Jews for nearly 2,000 years. That it should be used by an avowedly Christian politician about a Jewish one just takes crassness and insensitivity to a new level. One can only hope that Palin, or her advisers, did not appreciate the context, or the history. The verse in Matthew refers to the scene during Christ's trial before Pontius Pilate, before his execution, where the Roman governor, not being able to find fault with the accused man, publicly washed his hands of his fate, saying the crowd bore responsibility for his death. The Gospel says the crowd shouted back: ""His blood be on us and on our children,"" a phrase taken by Christians for centuries to indicate that the Jewish people as a whole and for perpetuity bore direct responsibility for the crucifixion and were therefore fair game for persecution and extermination. It has been used to justify pogroms, expulsions and discrimination and has fed Christian myths, such as those circulating in the middle ages, that Jews kidnapped and sacrificed Christian children to use their blood during Passover commemorations. 5.33pm GMT / 12.33pm ET: Following the antics of the Westboro Baptist Church reminds me of that old saying about not wrestling with a pig: you both end up covered in mud, but the pig likes it. However, these latest developments need a little discussion. First the good news: the church will no longer picket the funeral of nine-year-old victim Christina Taylor Green. Hurray! Now the bad news: they are doing that in return for media interviews that will grant them airtime in Toronto and Phoenix. Also the bad news part two: they are going to picket the funeral of slain judge John Roll instead. Oh, and also the site of the shooting itself. Staggering really. But Guardian commenter ""blearyboy"" below has also helpfully pointed out an interesting post analysing Westboro from the point of view of a money-making legal scam. It makes a good read. For what it's worth: I don't think the money-making scam side of things and the insane religious cult side of things necessarily cancel each other out. 5.51pm GMT / 12.51 ET: It is a funny old job being president. Not only do you have the tricky task of running the world's only superpower on a daily basis, but – because the president combines the jobs of prime minister and head of state – you also become the symbolic face of the nation. In times like these this involves the media giving you the temporary title of ""mourner in chief"". Most presidents wear this hat at some stage of their time in office. George W Bush had it after the 9/11 attacks. Bill Clinton put it on in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing. Ronald Reagan did a typically emotional job in the wake of the Challenger space-shuttle disaster. Now it is Barack Obama's turn with his Tucson speech. This CNN analysis does a good job of covering the basics of this role. But to me this seems a little overblown compared to the scale of previous tragedies. That is not to downplay what happened in Tucson. But the alleged actions of a madman do not really seem to match a spacecraft exploding on launch or a bomb that killed scores of people in the heartland or a terrorist attack that came to define our modern era. Still, it is going to be test of Obama's skills and political instincts to see how he handles this. Will we see ""campaign Obama"" who inspired the crowds with his emphatic gifts? Or ""governing Obama"" who has become increasingly isolated from the public mood of both left and right and become kind of a cold fish? 6.29pm GMT / 1.29pm ET: Sadhbh Walshe writes The Right Word on Comment is free, a series of articles tracking what conservative TV and radio hosts are saying. She has written an extensive piece explaining the reactions of Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck to the Arizona shootings. 6.36pm GMT / 1.36am ET: Sarah Palin's use of the word ""blood libel"" is now starting to genuinely dominate the news agenda. That simple two word phrase – so loaded with dreadful history and meaning – has elevated her statement from what should have been a sidebar or brief mention in the day's events to a global story. She is burning up Twitter and the BBC briefly put her as the lead story on its website, ahead of Barack Obama's coming Tucson speech. Which leaves a key question: did she mean it? Did Palin use the words ""blood libel"" knowing that she would inject herself front and centre into the story, overshadowing the president and filling a meme on the right that she is a victim of a vast leftwing media conspiracy? Or did she just unknowingly pick it up? On that latter point the words have been knocking around the conservative media in recent days. The Wall Street Journal ran a piece two days ago attacking those playing the blame game with the headline: ""The Arizona Tragedy and the Politics of Blood Libel"". The Washington Examiner on the same day hit out at New York Times's columnist Paul Krugman for ""the blood libel of blame"". Conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart also used the term blood libel before Palin did. So what happened? Did Palin – who is as wily as they come when it comes to media – consciously want to be part of this debate? Was she dog-whistling the conservative right with a loaded phrase? Or was she just googling around on conservative websites and came across a phrase used by others that she thought fit her situation? 6.56pm GMT / 1.56pm ET: Let's turn away for a moment from the political side of the Tucson tragedy and focus on something a bit more edifying. The truly remarkable thing about the story has been the amazing tale of Gabrielle Giffords' survival. She was shot in the head at point blank range and had a bullet go through the entire left side of her brain. That she is alive is a miracle and a tribute to her surgeons and the paramedics who rushed her to hospital. The latest news from her doctors at the University Medical Centre in Tucson continues to be good. Though she is still critical, Dr Peter Rhee said: ""We're at the very edge of the woods."" Of course, Giffords faces a long journey back to health and the extent of permanent damage is unknown. But she is alive, breathing and responding to commands. By Friday, Rhee said, she might even start to show signs of recovery as her brain swelling decreases. Here is the latest from the Arizona Republic. 7.17pm / 2.17pm ET: This is sad news. But it has just emerged that alleged gunman Jared Lee Loughner (left) was stopped by the authorities on Saturday morning, before the attack on Gabrielle Giffords, after he ran a red light. He was not stopped by the police but by an officer with Arizona Game and Fish. Loughner was described as ""very forthcoming"" and ""very polite, very subdued"" during the chat with the officer. He was issued with a warning, had his car inspected and told to move on. Maybe some will place blame here out of an understandable desire for ""what might have been"". But that would be a mistake and a use of hindsight that is very out of place. 7.52pm GMT / 2.52pm ET: Here comes Rush Limbaugh (left) to Sarah Palin's rescue. As Palin deals with the fallout from her comments about ""blood libel"" she perhaps needs someone to take the heat off. Someone, maybe, who could say something so outlandish and awful that it would distract from the storm of criticism heading Palin's way all around the world. Limbaugh has gamely stepped up to the plate. The conservative radio show demi-god, who has the popularity and power to make most Republican leaders kowtow to his whims, took to the airwaves with this analysis claiming Democrats support alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner: What Mr Loughner knows is that he has the full support of a major political party in this country. He's sitting there in jail. He knows what's going on, he knows that ... the Democrat party is attempting to find anybody but him to blame. He knows if he plays his cards right, he's just a victim. Thanks, El Rushbo. The problem here is that Limbaugh's comments are frequently so outrageous that this likely won't deflect any flak from Palin. The bigger problem, of course, is that Limbaugh is a genuine figure of power in American political life. Statements like these should make him a national laughing stock. But they do not. Millions of listeners tune in and love him every week. This line of attack from Limbaugh also might signal a ""no go"" to any conservatives who wanted to make dealing with America's mentally ill a part of this debate. He is clearly willing to agressively play up the line that any attempt to understand Loughner as mentally ill is simply putting the criminal on the same footing as the victims. 7.55pm GMT / 2.55pm ET: Here is a gallery of pictures of reaction to the shootings. 8.00pm GMT / 3.00pm ET: My colleague Peter Beaumont has written about Sarah Palin's blood libel comment and concludes it was a massive mis-step that shows she is unable to act the stateswoman and might blow a Tucson-sized hole in any presidential bid. Peter writes: More problematic still is a scenario where Palin knows what ""blood libel"" actually means, attaching herself as a victim on the same footing as those who suffered centuries of antisemitic persecution that culminated in the Holocaust. Is this what Palin is implying? Poor Sarah. That criticism of her crass political style is of the same order as the pogroms and expulsions perpetrated against the Jewish people? His conclusion: This video statement was a second chance to show how she could act as a statesman and engage with the debate about America's overheated political language at a time when families are still mourning their dead. She had an opportunity to demonstrate that she was not simply a polarising and partisan figure and to dismiss the suspicions that she is self-serving, narcissistic and self-obsessed. In that, Sarah Palin has manifestly failed. And she has failed not just as a politician, but as a human being, too. Read the whole thing here. It is worth it. 8.31pm GMT / 3.31pm ET: My colleague Ed Pilkington in New York has filed a story on the dramatic rise in handgun sales following the shooting. In the days since the tragedy, gun sales have increased dramatically. According to figures obtained from the FBI by Bloomberg, some 263 handguns were sold in Arizona the day after the killings, a rise of 60% on a year ago. Handgun sales were up 65% to 395 in Ohio and nationally increased by about 5% to 7,906. The spike in sales has been particularly pronounced for precisely the model of gun and ammunition deployed by the shooter, Jared Lee Loughner, on Saturday: the Austrian-made Glock 19. The handgun is used by many law enforcement agencies in the US, including the NYPD. 8.45pm GMT / 3.45pm ET: Contrary to rumours on Twitter and elsewhere, Sarah Palin has not taken down her controversial ""blood libel"" video message. It's still here, linked to from her Facebook page, which also contains a transcript. My colleague Chris McGreal has written about some of the criticisms of Palin's choice of language from Tucson here: The Anti-Defamation League, a group in New York that campaigns against antisemitism, said that while it ""was inappropriate at the outset to blame Sarah Palin and others for causing this tragedy"", it objected to her language. ""We wish that Palin had not invoked the phrase 'blood-libel' in reference to the actions of journalists and pundits in placing blame for the shooting in Tucson on others. while the term has become part of the English parlance to refer to someone being falsely accused, we wish that Palin had used another phrase, instead of one so fraught with pain in Jewish history,"" it said. Julie Roginsky, a Democratic party strategist, said that she does not blame Palin ""for the actions of one deranged gunman"". She added: ""The term 'blood libel,' however, is a term so loaded with bigotry and historic persecution that it should be consigned to the ash heap of history where the darkest days of antisemitism dwell. Whether she was aware of its historical context is irrelevant. She is a national figure with a huge following and so she should use her words carefully,"" she wrote in a Politico blog. 8.51pm GMT / 3.51pm ET: Time to swim furiously away from the Sarah Palin ""blood libel"" debate for a moment. It is a sad state of affairs when a debate about violent rhetoric rapidly descends into a lot of violent rhetoric. Instead check out this story from the Atlantic about the remarkable medical survival of Gabrielle Giffords. It is a bit grim (actually it is a lot grim) but it gives a nuts and bolts description of how Giffords was able to survive what should have been an instantly fatal wound. It is a mixture of luck, medical skill and unusual facts (a bullet in the head can sometimes be better than a blunt force knock due to being ""focused""). Who knew? 9.22pm GMT / 4.22pm ET: With the Loughner family keeping their silence apart from a simple statement and plea for privacy, details of the background of suspect Jared Lee Loughner are slow to seep out. However, a picture is beginning to emerge. It is fairly disturbing but one has to be careful with hindsight. He had trouble with friends and college, his family appeared very private and he behaved oddly at an animal shelter. Some neighbours thought the Loughners were very weird, some just mildly eccentric and some thought them normal. This Associated Press story has some good details, but perhaps the most fascinating new fact is that Loughner and his father had an angry dispute on the morning of the shooting. It ended with Loughner running off into the desert after Loughner Sr asked his son why he was taking a black bag out of the car boot. This probably happened after Loughner was stopped and searched that morning by a local Arizona Game and Fish officer for running a red light. People looking for some sort of trigger event might find it here in this father-son spat. Or, much more likely, they might find another narrowly missed opportunity to stop Loughner before he allegedly committed his crime. 9.45pm GMT / 4.45pm ET: After a day in which Barack Obama must have marvelled at Sarah Palin's ability to steal his thunder, it might be time to look ahead to tonight's Tucson memorial service to honour the victims of Saturday's shooting. People have been queuing up since the wee hours of the morning to get access to the McKale Memorial Center on the University of Arizona campus. At least 14,000 are expected to cram inside and tickets are on a first-come-first-served basis. Some 500 press requests were received by the college. The service is called ""Together We Thrive: Tucson and America"" and that is likely to set the tone for Obama's much anticipated speech, which is expected to come in at a brief 15 minutes. Other events for the service include a Native American blessing, some music and speeches by other political leaders such as Arizona's Republican governor Jan Brewer and attorney general Eric Holder. A schedule can be found here. 10.14pm GMT / 5.14pm ET: Not quite sure why these comments have not gained any traction, but US secretary of state Hillary Clinton (left) has called Jared Lee Loughner an ""extremist"" who acted out his ""political views"" in some ways. Clinton was talking to CNN and these comments seem to go a little above and beyond what most people in the centre and on the left are saying. That argument tends to be that Loughner allegedly carried out the shooting in Tucson because he was mentally ill but that he may have acted against a general background of unpleasent and violent rhetoric in public life. That seems almost common sense but Clinton's comments seem to take that a step further. The key quote: Based on what I know, this is a criminal defendant who was in some ways motivated by his own political views, who had a particular animus toward the congresswoman and I think when you cross the line from expressing opinions that are of conflicting differences in our political environment into taking action that's violent action, that's a hallmark of extremism, whether it comes from the right, the left, from al-Qaida, from anarchists, whoever it is. That is a form of extremism. 10.27pm GMT / 5.27pm ET: It has been a remarkable day of activity so far in tracking the coverage of the Tucson shooting of congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and others and it is not yet over. Here are the key developments: • The nation is waiting for the official memorial service in Tucson during which Barack Obama will give a short speech to the American public. The moment represents a chance for Obama to act as ""mourner-in-chief"" and call for unity. He is unlikely to make any overtly political statement and instead keep it personal and respectful. US secretary of state Hillary Clinton has called Jared Lee Loughner an ""extremist"" who acted out his ""political views"" in some ways (see 10.14pm GMT / 5.14pm ET). • Few things seem to happen in American political life that do not somehow involve Sarah Palin. The former Alaska governor caused a global outcry by claiming that media attacks on her for inflaming opinion against Giffords and other Americans amounted to a ""blood libel"". Palin made the claim in a video posted to Facebook and instantly shot to the top of the news programmes, eclipsing Obama and virtually every other development. • Giffords herself continues to do well in hospital. Or, more accurately, as well as can be expected for someone suffering from such a traumatic brain injury. Her doctors continue to be pleased with her progress though her long-term prognosis is still up in the air, in terms of how complete her recovery will be. But it seems there will be a recovery of some sort, which is nothing short of remarkable. • More details continued to emerge about the alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner. Most poignantly two apparent incidents on Saturday morning could perhaps have alerted people that something was wrong but sadly were missed. Firstly, Loughner was stopped and cautioned after running a red light. But then he was allowed to go on his way. Secondly, he had a row with his father and ran off after Loughner Sr challenged him about a mysterious bag he was removing from the family car's boot. I will be taking a break now but will return at around 1am GMT / 8pm ET for live coverage of the Tucson memorial service and Obama's speech. 00.53am GMT / 7.53pm ET: America awaits the beginning of the memorial service in Tucson, Arizona, for all the victims of Saturday's shootings. Of course, the focus is on President Barack Obama and the speech he is set to give. Comparisons are being made to other ""mourner-in-chief"" moments of previous presidents, such as Bill Clinton after the Oklahoma City bombing and Ronald Reagan after the Challenger space shuttle disaster. It is no easy task. But he should be able to rise to the occasion. Certainly, he won't be mentioning ""blood libels"", à la Sarah Palin (I hope). Obama has also visited the wounded Gabrielle Giffords in hospital. ""The president wanted to begin this solemn trip by stopping first at the hospital where Congresswoman Giffords and others continue to recuperate,"" a White House official told the New York Times. Meanwhile, my colleague Chris McGreal is on the ground and files these thoughts from the service in Tucson. Demand for the 14,000 seats in the sports arena where Obama is to speak is so large that the authorities were already directing people to a nearby stadium before the first of the mourners were seated. Many of those in the arena are students who waited in the winter sun for hours. The mourners, if that's what they can be called as many said they were principally there to see the president, gave a standing ovation and cheers for two of the surgeons who have been treating the wounded congresswoman. 1.09am GMT / 8.09pm ET: This seems worth noting: CNN makes a valuable contribution to the history of Jared Lee Loughner by getting a definitive response from the police on their prior contacts with the alleged shooter. Says Pima County Sheriff's bureau chief Richard Kastigar: The events that led up to what happened Saturday as they relate to law enforcement contact really do not add up in their totality to anything that would cause a police officer to say. 'This guy is going to go out there and shoot 20 people.' There's nothing there. It seems like a line that is aimed at putting a swift end to any conspiracy theories out there about just how much contact law enforcement had with Loughner. Given the state of debate in America at the moment, that is a good idea. Kastigar tells the channel that they absolutely did not have enough information or contact with Loughner to have any idea of what he was planning. ""I couldn't underscore that more,"" Kastigar said. Of course, there could be an element of spinning that line to deflect criticism of the police, but – unless someone comes up with hard facts about some new incident – it seems fair enough. Loughner drank, smoked pot and acted weird. Weirder than most, in fact. But it is impossible to say that it was obvious he would do what he allegedly did. 1.13am GMT / 8.13pm EST: President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama have entered. They are shaking hands to loud cheers. Which is a little bit like a campaign event. Not their fault. But a little odd for the beginning of a memorial. Obama is looking down, appearing sombre, with his hands clasped in front of him. Then the music stops and things get serious and quiet pretty quickly for the crowd. 1.15am GMT / 8.15pm ET: Carlos Gonzales, half-Native American and half-Mexican, resident of Tucson, gives a traditional blessing. It was a slightly bizarre ritual, but one done with a dose of humanity. ""Let us work towards harmony,"" he said, striking a tone that Obama will likely follow. Obama, though, probably will not carry as big a sacred feather. Gonzales went on to speak of families and the need to honour them. ""Let us use humour when appropriate for humour is healing and can help people,"" he said. I have to say: I agree. After this day of ""blood libel"" and ""blood libel"" reaction, we could all do with a bit of that. 1.26am GMT / 8.26pm ET: Not surprisingly, the early bits of the service are all about Tucson. Native American Carlos Gonzales gave a shoutout to local civic pride, and now University of Arizona Robert Shelton is using his platform to praise his town. ""It is, in the truest sense of the word, a community. We know each other and we care about each other,"" he said. Every city where a tragedy occurs that attracts the global media gets tarred with the horror of the event – it is reasonable to point out all the other things about a place. Things that define it far more than one random tragedy. Shelton's sentiment likely explains all the cheers from the local crowd. 1.42am GMT / 8.42pm ET: Daniel Hernandez, Gabrielle Giffords' student intern who is credited with helping save her life, gives an amazing and touching speech. He calls for unity and pays tribute to Giffords and the other victims. He rejects the use of the word ""hero"", and instead, praises those who lost their lives, as well as Giffords herself, her doctors and other public servants. It was a remarkably assured speech, with a nice balance of humility and respect. Huge cheers. Then Arizona's Republican Governor Jan Brewer takes the stage. She looks less calm and assured than Hernandez, to be honest, but she has never been a natural public speaker in the media spotlight. She strikes an entirely nonpartisan tone – surely setting the stage for the other political figures who will come after her. ""I know this, though, Arizona is united in a mission of recovery,"" she says, calling the shooting ""one mad man's act of darkness"". 1.46am GMT / 8.46pm ET: Janet Napolitano – a former Democratic Arizona governor and current head of the Department of Homeland Security – reached for comfort from the Bible during her brief speech. ""The violence that occurred Saturday does not represent this community, this state or this country,"" she said, before adding that words can fail people at such times. Then, she read a passage from the Old Testament. That is a sure way to keep things apolitical, not least because it is hard instantly to understand the meaning of the piece of scripture. US Attorney General Eric Holder was next up. He, too, read from the Bible (the New Testament, this time). It's good strategy and a reminder that this is a memorial. 1.53am GMT / 8.53pm ET: President Barack Obama is on the stage. He gets huge cheers but maintains a stony expression throughout. This is his ""mourner-in-chief"" moment. His first words are about the families of the victims. ""I have come here tonight as an American who like all Americans kneels to pray with you today and will stand by you tomorrow,"" he says: There is nothing I can say that fill the sudden hole torn in your heart. Then, he, too, like Holder and Napolitano, starts to read from scripture. 1.57am GMT / 8.57pm ET: Obama then praises Giffords for her openness in holding public meetings like that in which she was engaged at the time she was shot. He calls it a ""quintessentially American scene"" of open democracy and civic engagement. He pays tribute to slain Judge John Roll, which is proper. Giffords may be the focus and has suffered terribly, but she is alive. Roll, and five others, are dead. Obama moves on to talk of the other slain victims and tell brief stories of their lives. He is speaking well. Though one would expect that from a gifted orator. 2.01am GMT / 9.01pm ET: Obama completes his pen portraits of the dead victims. It was a nice part of the speech, laced with well-placed touches of humour (perhaps the president picked that up from Carlos Gonzales). That felt right. The nation is in mourning, but just as Tucson should not be defined by a tragedy, nor should these victims be defined by the random, awful nature of their death. They were much more than that. A little bit of celebration is good among the mourners. Then, Obama springs a surprise. He has visited Gabrielle Giffords in hospital and brings this good news. Gaby opened her eyes for the first time. She knows we are here, she knows we love her, she knows we are rooting for her. Huge cheers. Not surprisingly. Hard not to smile at that. Obama seems to be in his element. He may even have departed from the script and gone with the mood of the event here. 2.12am GMT / 9.12pm ET: Obama is actually smiling now, as he pays tribute to the heroes of the day. That feels unexpected but also appropriate. Why not celebrate brave deeds? He is clapping from the podium. So much for recent received wisdom about Obama's apparent inability to connect with ordinary people and ""feel their pain"", as Bill Clinton used to. Heroism is found not only on the fields of battle … heroism is here in the hearts of so many of our fellow citizens, all around us just waiting to be summoned. Finally, he is tackling the meat of the issue: what now for America? ""How can we be true to their memory?"" he asks. He talks about the ""national conversation"" that has surrounded the issue, from ""gun safety"" (note: he did not say ""regulation""!) to mental illness laws. ""It is important for us to pause for a moment and make sure we are talking with each other in way that heals, and not in a way that wounds,"" he says, taking on the thorny issue of political polarisation. No ""blood libels"" for Obama, then. And, like every other Democratic speaker tonight, he turns to the Bible and quotes from the Book of Job. What we cannot do is use this tragedy as one more occasion to turn on each other. That we cannot do. Let's use this occasion to expand our moral imaginations. And he asks for people to listen to each other. This is the key message: tone it down, America, he is saying. At the same time, he is practising what he is preaching. There will be no blame game from Obama. 2.20am GMT / 9.20pm ET: Obama is turning on the emotions now. ""What matters is not wealth or power or status or fame, but how well we have loved,"" he says. That sounds – to my cynical ears – a little too much like a line from a Hollywood movie. He then compounds it by talking of ""an American family 300 million strong"". But it's basically good stuff and impossible to argue with the sentiment. At the moment, it is is hard to see anyone disagreeing with this speech. The vast majority of pundits, I think, will greatly praise it. Emotional, non-political, but taking on the core issues without indulging in finger-pointing himself. Obama says a debate should happen about these events, but that it should be conducted better: ""Let's make sure it's worthy of those we have lost."" If anyone is comparing Obama and Palin over who has reacted more presidentially (though they really shouldn't be doing that), then Obama has shown Palin how it's really done. We may not be able to stop all evil in the world, but I know that how we treat one another, that is entirely up to us. 2.24am GMT / 9.24pm ET: He nears the end with a rousing call. For the first time, his voice rises, almost in anger, as he talks of nine-year-old victim Christina Taylor Green, and demands America lives up to her memory and the expectations of children like her. The crowd – according to the New York Times, more than 14,000-strong – goes wild; he pauses to absorb the cheers. That was quite a moment. He ends with the words: ""May God bless and keep those we have lost in eternal peace. May he watch over the survivors and may he bless the United States of America."" The remarks lasted 34 minutes, which was much longer than expected. 2.47am GMT / 9.47pm ET: So that was that. My feeling is that Obama did well. He was probably always going to be fine and the hurdles in front of him were not hard to jump. But his mixture of sombre speech, Bible-quoting, humorous anecdote and, finally, bipartisan hectoring was impressive. He even managed to stun everyone by revealing that Giffords has now opened her eyes during his visit to the hospital. That was an impressive, almost miraculous touch. On the cable news channels, the reaction seems to agree. David Gergen on CNN said: ""What the president had to say at the end of his speech was important … that resonated with the audience, and I am sure it will resonate with the rest of the country."" Over on Fox News, Brett Hume said: ""It was a very powerful speech."" Now, we wait to read the morning newspapers and get their more considered reaction. Until then, good night."

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: TUCSON, Ariz. — Summoning the soul of a nation, President Barack Obama on Wednesday implored Americans to honor those slain and injured in the Arizona shootings by becoming better people, telling a polarized citizenry that it is time to talk with each other “in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.” Following a hospital bedside visit with Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, the target of the assassination, he said: “She knows we’re here, and she knows we love her.” In an electrifying moment, the president revealed that Giffords, who on Saturday was shot point-blank in the head, had opened her eyes for the first time shortly after his hospital visit. First lady Michelle Obama held hands with Giffords’ husband, Mark Kelly, as the news brought soaring cheers from thousands gathered for a memorial service. Obama bluntly conceded that there is no way to know what triggered the shooting rampage that left six people dead, 13 others wounded and the nation shaken. He tried instead to leave indelible memories of the people who were gunned down, and to rally the country to use the moment as a reflection on the nation’s behavior and compassion. “I believe we can be better,” Obama said to a capacity crowd in the university’s basketball arena and to countless others watching around the country. “Those who died here, those who saved lives here — they help me believe,” the president said. “We may not be able to stop all evil in the world, but I know that how we treat one another is entirely up to us.” In crafting his comments, Obama clearly sought a turning point in the raw debate that has defined national politics. He faced the expectations to do more than console, but to encourage a new day of civility, all without getting overly political in a memorial service. Obama settled on a theme of challenging the country to have a debate that is worthy of those who died. He tapped into the raging debate about the role of incendiary rhetoric without dwelling on it. “Let’s remember that it is not because a simple lack of civility caused this tragedy. It did not,” the president said. After offering personal accounts of every person who died, he challenged anyone listening to think of how to honor their memories, and he was not shy about offering direction. He admonished against any instinct to point blame or to drift into political pettiness or to latch onto simple explanations that may have no merit. The president said it was OK, even essential, for the country to suddenly be debating gun control, mental health services and the motivations of the killer. But then he added: “At a time when our discourse has become so sharply polarized — at a time when we are far too eager to lay the blame for all that ails the world at the feet of those who think differently than we do — it’s important for us to pause for a moment and make sure that we are talking with each other in a way that heals, not a way that wounds,” the president said. The shooting happened as Giffords, a three-term Democrat who represents southern Arizona, was holding a community outreach event in a Tucson shopping center parking lot Saturday. A gunman shot her in the head and worked his way down the line of people waiting to talk with her, law enforcement officials said. The attack ended when bystanders tackled the man, Jared Lee Loughner, 22, who is in custody. Obama’s speech, by turns somber and hopeful, at times took on the tone of an exuberant pep rally as he heralded the men who wrestled the gunman to the ground, the woman who grabbed the shooter’s ammunition, the doctors and nurses who treated the injured, the intern who rushed to Giffords’ aid. The crowd erupted in multiple standing ovations as each was singled out for praise. The president ended up speaking for more than half an hour, doubling the expected length of his comments. Memories of the six people killed dominated much of Obama’s speech. The president, for example, recalled how federal Judge John Roll was on his way from attending Mass when he stopped to say hello to Giffords and was gunned down; Dorothy Morris, shielded by her husband, but killed nonetheless; and Phyllis Schneck, a Republican who took a shine to Giffords, a Democrat, and wanted to know her better. He spoke at length of 9-year-old Christina Taylor Green, the only girl on her Little League team, who often said she wanted to be the first woman to play in the major leagues. She had just been elected to the student council at her elementary school and had an emerging interest in public service. “I want us to live up to her expectations. I want our democracy to be as good as she imagined it,” Obama said. The little girl was born on Sept. 11, 2001, and had been featured in a book about 50 babies born that day. The inscriptions near her photo spoke of wishes for a happy child’s life, including splashing in puddles. Said Obama: “If there are rain puddles in heaven, Christina is jumping in them today.” Obama hit an emotional high point when he told of Giffords opening her eyes for the first time not long after his visit to her bedside. “Gabby opened her eyes, so I can tell you: She knows we are here, she knows we love her, and she knows that we are rooting for her through what is undoubtedly going to be a difficult journey,” Obama said. The lawmakers who were in Giffords’ hospital room when she opened her eyes were three of her close female friends in Congress: House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. “The doctors couldn’t believe it,” Wasserman Schultz later told CNN. “It was the most incredible experience that I have ever had.” Giffords is expected to survive, although her condition and the extent of her recovery remain in doubt. As finger-pointing emerged in Washington and beyond over whether harsh political rhetoric played a role in creating motivation for the attack, Obama sought to calm the rhetoric. “Bad things happen,” he said, “and we must guard against simple explanations in the aftermath.” He spoke of decency and goodness, declaring: “The forces that divide us are not as strong as those that unite us.” Obama’s appeal for civility played out against a deepening political debate. Earlier in the day, Republican Sarah Palin, criticized by some for marking Giffords’ district with the crosshairs of a gun sight during last fall’s campaign, had taken to Facebook to accuse pundits and journalists of using the attack to incite hatred and violence. Obama spoke to a crowd of more than 13,000 in the arena and thousands more listened on from an overflow area in the football stadium. About a mile away, at University Medical Center, Giffords lay fighting for her life. Other victims also remained there hospitalized. The memorial service was an important part of the mourning process for some of those who had lined up hours in advance to gain a seat. “If we don’t say goodbye and have a chance to say goodbye in an appropriate way, it will linger,” said Patty Sirls, 62. “So, for me, it’s a closure.” Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts As you comment, please be respectful of other commenters and other viewpoints.

Kornblut and Danna Hedgpeth / Washington Post TUCSON, Ariz. -- President Barack Obama comforted a community suffused with grief and summoned the nation to recommit to a more civil public discourse as he delivered a eulogy Wednesday evening urging Americans to talk with each other ""in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds."" Evoking memories of the six people killed here Saturday, Obama seized on the mass shooting at a congresswoman's supermarket meet-and-greet to tackle directly the subject of the nation's harsh political dialogue. He sharply decried the ""politics and point-scoring and pettiness that drifts away with the next news cycle."" ""Rather than pointing fingers or assigning blame, let us use this occasion to expand our moral imaginations, to listen to each other more carefully, to sharpen our instincts for empathy, and remind ourselves of all the ways our hopes and dreams are bound together,"" Obama told 14,000 people at the University of Arizona's McKale Memorial Center. Obama did not ascribe a political motive to the shooter, Jared Lee Loughner, or suggest that either party was to blame. Rather, in a 33-minute speech, he sought to move the nation past the tragedy. Obama paid a surprise visit to victims recovering at University Medical Center, including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, the Arizona Democrat, whom he visited for nine minutes in the intensive care unit. ""Gabby opened her eyes and I can tell you she knows we are here, she knows we love her, and she knows we are rooting for her,"" Obama said. In Washington, lawmakers still unnerved by the assassination attempt on one of their own offered a display of bipartisan unity. More than 120 Democrats and Republicans went to the well of the House to pay tribute in moving and sometimes tearful speeches. The House unanimously approved a resolution late Wednesday condemning the attack and praising citizen and emergency responders. Ohio members of Congress -- including Democrats Dennis Kucinich of Cleveland and Marcia Fudge of Warrensville Heights, as well as Dayton-area GOP Rep. Mike Turner -- took to the House floor to wish Giffords well and decry violence. ""Our hearts are broken, but our spirit is not,"" House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio said. ""This is a time for the House to lock arms, in prayer for those fallen and wounded, and in resolve to carry on the dialogue of democracy."" ""In the sweep of history, this attack was an attack on liberty,"" added Toledo Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur. ""It desecrates our worth as a people. We must all search our souls. How could such a heinous act transpire?"" Judge Larry Burns of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California was appointed to hear Loughner's case after federal judges in Arizona removed themselves. Meanwhile, in an eight-minute video posted online, Sarah Palin fiercely dismissed any notion that her firearms-infused political attacks contributed to Giffords' shooting. Palin also launched a controversy by accusing her critics of mounting a ""blood libel"" against her, a reference denounced as offensive by Jewish groups.

But that doesn't mean that everyone gets the help they need. ""The state laws are some of the best in the country,"" said Jack Potts, a forensic psychiatrist in Phoenix. ""The follow-up is not."" Under Arizona law, anyone can call the county or regional health authorities with concerns about a person's mental health, and authorities are required to send out mobile units to assess the person's condition, said Brian Stettin, policy director at the Treatment Advocacy Center in Arlington, Va., which advocates for involuntary commitment for mental illness. The person who files a request for commitment must list the names of two witnesses who can attest to the subject's behavior, although they don't have to sign the document themselves, Potts said. REPORTS: Loughner had 'dark personality' POLL: Conservatives not to blame for Ariz. shooting Typically, states allow involuntary commitment only if people pose a danger to themselves or others, or if they are profoundly disabled by their mental illness, to the point of being unable to take care of themselves, said Paul Ragan, associate professor of psychiatry at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville. But Arizona allows for involuntary commitment if someone is deteriorating from a mental illness and could benefit from treatment, Potts said. The law is intended to catch people before they do something dangerous. He said he knows of a high school principal, for example, who requested a mental health evaluation for an unstable student. The law also provides up to 90 days of inpatient hospital treatment, Potts said. A judge can order a patient to take his medication; patients who refuse can be sent back to the hospital. Yet Arizona often lacks the resources to treat people, he said. The state has one of the lowest ratios in the country for inpatient psychiatric beds for its population size. Across the USA, budget cuts have forced hospitals to close 4,000 inpatient psychiatric beds since 2009 — leaving them less able to take in the mentally ill, said Michael Fitzpatrick, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). Arizona has eliminated hundreds of positions for mental health case workers, who help coordinate patients' care, Fitzpatrick said. In a national score card rating the accessibility of mental health services, the alliance in 2009 gave Arizona a C, ""which is pretty close to a failing grade,"" said psychiatrist Anand Pandya of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles; 21 states scored a D, and none earned an A. To create the score card, the alliance had volunteers in each state try to schedule an appointment with a mental health professional. ""It's very hard to get an appointment with a psychiatrist in Arizona,"" Pandya said. ""Pretty much across the board, it takes a lot of time. There's no one clear number to call, and it's hard to figure out where to go from their website, even if you are completely mentally competent. The services in Arizona just aren't designed to be readily accessible."" PARENTS: Mental health lessons from the Tucson tragedy Arizona state officials, for example, were unable to tell NAMI how many patients they actually serve, according to the report. Arizona residents who spoke to NAMI for the report said they had many problems getting care, facing six- to eight-week waits to see a psychiatrist. Others complained of overworked case workers with nearly 100 clients. One unnamed patient quoted in the report told NAMI, ""When I first tried to get help after attempting suicide, I was told that I wasn't sick enough to qualify."""

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: TUCSON, Ariz. — President Barack Obama comforted a community suffused with grief and summoned the nation to recommit to a more civil public discourse as he delivered a eulogy Wednesday evening urging Americans to talk with each other “in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.” Evoking memories of the six killed Saturday in Tucson, Obama seized upon the mass shooting at a congresswoman’s supermarket meet-and-greet to tackle the subject of the nation’s harsh political dialogue. He decried the “politics and point-scoring and pettiness that drifts away with the next news cycle.” “Rather than pointing fingers or assigning blame, let us use this occasion to expand our moral imaginations, to listen to each other more carefully, to sharpen our instincts for empathy, and remind ourselves of all the ways our hopes and dreams are bound together,” Obama told 14,000 people at the University of Arizona’s McKale Memorial Center. Obama did not ascribe a political motive to the alleged shooter or suggest that either party was to blame. Rather, in a 33-minute speech, he sought to move the nation past the tragedy. Accompanied at the arena by first lady Michelle Obama, the president said he joins Tucson in its grief and that he came “as an American who, like all Americans, kneels to pray with you today and will stand by you tomorrow.” After touching down under blue skies and a bright desert sun, Obama paid a surprise visit to victims recovering at University Medical Center, including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., whom he joined for nine minutes in the intensive care unit. “Gabby opened her eyes, and I can tell you she knows we are here, she knows we love her and she knows we are rooting for her,” Obama said. Wednesday evening’s hourlong “Together We Thrive: Tucson and America” service was full of spiritual overtones. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano read from the Bible’s book of Isaiah, and Attorney General Eric Holder read from Corinthians. Audience members cheered and hollered throughout the service, at times making it appear more like a rally than a somber memorial. Organizers distributed navy T-shirts to attendees, many of whom snapped pictures of Obama and a litany of dignitaries, including Republican Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer. But the crowd did not lose sight of the purpose. As Giffords’ family entered with three hospital surgeons wearing white lab coats over their scrubs, the crowd stood in applause. Other heroes of the shooting, including Daniel Hernandez, the intern who tended to Giffords at the crime scene, were engulfed in cheers as they were shown on the arena’s video screen. Obama looked gravely serious throughout, pursing his lips even when the crowd screamed in delight. The rampage called for Obama to console weary citizens just as President George W. Bush did after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and President Bill Clinton after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. For Obama, it was not the first time he had addressed tragedy and divisiveness. A hallmark of his tenure has been his eagerness to cast himself as a healer. Obama shared personal details he had learned about the six dead: “Our hearts are broken by their sudden passing,” Obama said. “Our hearts are broken — and yet, our hearts also have reason for fullness.” The president said he was grateful for Hernandez, Patricia Maisch and others who ran through chaos at the scene of the massacre to save others. “These men and women remind us that heroism is found not only on the fields of battle,” Obama said. “They remind us that heroism does not require special training or physical strength. Heroism is here, all around us, in the hearts of so many of our fellow citizens, just waiting to be summoned — as it was on Saturday morning.” Obama’s advisers said his remarks were designed to help tamp down the current political conversation. He ruminated about young Christina’s growing interest in her government. As he focused on the child, his wife’s eyes brimmed with tears, and his remarks drew a sustained standing ovation as many in the crowd wept. “She saw all this through the eyes of a child, undimmed by the cynicism or vitriol that we adults all too often just take for granted,” Obama said. “I want us to live up to her expectations. I want our democracy to be as good as (Christina) imagined it. … All of us — we should do everything we can to make sure this country lives up to our children’s expectations. “If there are rain puddles in heaven, Christina is jumping in them today,” he said. “And here on Earth, we place our hands over our hearts, and we commit ourselves as Americans to forging a country that is forever worthy of her gentle, happy spirit.” With the State of the Union address less than two weeks away, Obama’s advisers said it is likely the president will raise the subject again in some manner in the days after the funerals have finished — perhaps in his speech to Congress.

(AP Photo/Chris Carlson)  TUCSON, Ariz. — The family of the youngest victim of the mass shooting in Arizona held hands and paused in a moment of silence Thursday under the large American flag recovered from Ground Zero after the 9/11 attacks, and later escorted the 9-year-old’s small brown casket into the church as little girls about her age cried. Several hundred other mourners, many in white T-shirts, lined a road near the church to show support. Christina Taylor Green was born on Sept. 11, 2001, and featured in a book called “Faces of Hope” that chronicled one baby from each state born on the day terrorists killed nearly 3,000 people. Christina’s funeral is the first for the six victims killed when police said a gunman opened fired on a crowd at an event for Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, critically injuring the congresswoman and wounding 13 others. The third-grader had an interest in politics and had recently been elected to her student council. She was the only girl on her Canyon del Oro Little League baseball team and played second base, and had told her father she wanted to become the first woman to play in the major leagues. The game was in her blood. Her dad is a scout for the Los Angeles Dodgers and her grandfather, former big league pitcher Dallas Green, managed the 1980 world champion Philadelphia Phillies. During President Barack Obama’s speech at a memorial Wednesday night, he spoke at length about Christina and reminded the audience that the third-grader’s neighbor had brought her to meet Giffords because of her budding interest in democracy. “She saw all this through the eyes of a child, undimmed by the cynicism or vitriol that we adults all too often just take for granted,” he said. “I want to live up to her expectations. I want our democracy to be as good as Christina imagined it. I want America to be as good as she imagined it.” The girl had told her parents she wanted to attend Penn State and have a career that involved helping those less fortunate. Before her funeral, cars were parked on both sides of the road, and traffic was backed up. Members of motorcycle groups from Arizona and California parked their bikes in a group. Several hundred people, many dressed in white T-shirts, stood silently along a road near the church. About 20 people were dressed as angels. They organized over the Internet and by word of mouth, saying they wanted to be there in case members of a Kansas church showed up to protest. The Westboro Baptist Church threatened to picket the funerals for Christina and other victims, but they backed off, in part because a nationally syndicated radio show agreed to host some of their members. The church is known for protesting at the funerals of slain servicemen and blaming their deaths on the country’s tolerance of homosexuality. As the city mourned the little girl, more details and documents surfaced about the suspect, Jared Loughner. For four years, he was an unremarkable college student, commuting to classes near his home where he studied yoga and algebra, business management and poetry. But last year, his classroom conduct began to change. In February, Loughner stunned a teacher by talking about blowing up babies, a bizarre outburst that marked the start of a rapid unraveling for the 22-year-old. After his first flare-up, campus police decided not to intervene. “I suggested they keep an eye on him,” an officer wrote. Loughner’s on-campus behavior grew increasingly erratic, menacing, even delusional. Fifty-one pages of police reports released Wednesday provided a chilling portrait of Loughner’s last school year, which ended in September when he was judged mentally unhinged and suspended by Pima Community College. New details were also still emerging about the busy morning Loughner had in the hours before the shooting. According to authorities, Loughner hustled to Walmart twice, was caught by police running a red light but was let go with a warning, and later grabbed a black bag from the trunk of a family car before fleeing into the desert on foot with his suspicious father giving chase. Eventually, he took a cab to the grocery store where he opened fire on Giffords and a line of people waiting to speak to her. Loughner was also carrying a knife but didn’t use it. Also Thursday, a man walking his dog found a black bag holding ammunition and authorities believed it was discarded by Loughner. Chief Rick Kastigar with the Pima County Sheriff’s Office told The Associated Press that an 18-year-old found the bag in a neighborhood near where Loughner lives. He went to get another man, who looked inside and saw ammunition. Just three months before the shooting, Loughner had been kicked out of school. In a Sept. 23 campus police report, days before his suspension, an officer called to quiet another one of Loughner’s outbursts described him as incomprehensible, his eyes jittery, his head awkwardly tilted. “He very slowly began telling me in a low and mumbled voice that under the Constitution, which had been written on the wall for all to see, he had the right to his ‘freedom of thought’ and whatever he thought in his head he could also put on paper. … His teacher ‘must be required to accept it’ as a passing grade,” the officer wrote. “It was clear he was unable to fully understand his actions.” During his first outburst, in a poetry class, he made comments about abortion, wars and killing people, then asked: “Why don’t we just strap bombs to babies?” Later, he became hostile with a Pilates instructor when he learned he was going to receive a B in the class. According to school officials, Loughner studied at the college from the summer of 2005 to September, when he was suspended after campus police discovered a YouTube video in which Loughner claimed the college was illegal under to the U.S. Constitution. In all, he had five run-ins with police on two campuses. Loughner was warned that the behavior had to stop. On Nov. 30, the same day he bought the Glock, Loughner posted a YouTube video, seething about campus police and the college. “If the police remove you from the educational facility for talking then removing you from the educational facility for talking is unconstitutional,” he said on the video. “The situation is fraud because the police are unconstitutional. … Every Pima Community College class is always a scam!” School officials told Loughner and his parents that to return to classes he would need to undergo a mental health exam to show he was not a danger. He never returned. Kelsey Hawkes said Thursday on CBS’ “The Early Show” that when she dated Loughner six years ago when they were both in high school, he showed no violent tendencies and he was a completely different person. “Very caring, very sweet, a gentle, kind, you know, a little bit quiet. But altogether a pretty great guy,” she said. Associated Press writers Amanda Lee Myers, Alicia Chang and Gillian Flaccus in Tucson, and Jacques Billeaud and Bob Christie in Phoenix contributed to this report.

I want America to be as good as she imagined it.” The girl had told her parents she wanted to attend Penn State and have a career that involved helping those less fortunate. Before her funeral, cars were parked on both sides of the road, and traffic was backed up. Members of motorcycle groups from Arizona and California parked their bikes in a group. Several hundred people, many dressed in white T-shirts, stood silently along a road near the church. About 20 people were dressed as angels. They organized over the Internet and by word of mouth, saying they wanted to be there in case members of a Kansas church showed up to protest. The Westboro Baptist Church threatened to picket the funerals for Christina and other victims, but they backed off, in part because a nationally syndicated radio show agreed to host some of their members. The church is known for protesting at the funerals of slain servicemen and blaming their deaths on the country’s tolerance of homosexuality. As the city mourned the little girl, more details and documents surfaced about the suspect, Jared Loughner. For four years, he was an unremarkable college student, commuting to classes near his home where he studied yoga and algebra, business management and poetry. But last year, his classroom conduct began to change. In February, Loughner stunned a teacher by talking about blowing up babies, a bizarre outburst that marked the start of a rapid unraveling for the 22-year-old. After his first flare-up, campus police decided not to intervene. “I suggested they keep an eye on him,” an officer wrote. Loughner’s on-campus behavior grew increasingly erratic, menacing, even delusional. Fifty-one pages of police reports released Wednesday provided a chilling portrait of Loughner’s last school year, which ended in September when he was judged mentally unhinged and suspended by Pima Community College. New details were also still emerging about the busy morning Loughner had in the hours before the shooting. According to authorities, Loughner hustled to Walmart twice, was caught by police running a red light but was let go with a warning, and later grabbed a black bag from the trunk of a family car before fleeing into the desert on foot with his suspicious father giving chase. Eventually, he took a cab to the grocery store where he opened fire on Giffords and a line of people waiting to speak to her. Loughner was also carrying a knife but didn’t use it. Also Thursday, a man walking his dog found a black bag holding ammunition and authorities believed it was discarded by Loughner. Chief Rick Kastigar with the Pima County Sheriff’s Office told The Associated Press that an 18-year-old found the bag in a neighborhood near where Loughner lives. He went to get another man, who looked inside and saw ammunition. Just three months before the shooting, Loughner had been kicked out of school. In a Sept. 23 campus police report, days before his suspension, an officer called to quiet another one of Loughner’s outbursts described him as incomprehensible, his eyes jittery, his head awkwardly tilted. “He very slowly began telling me in a low and mumbled voice that under the Constitution, which had been written on the wall for all to see, he had the right to his ‘freedom of thought’ and whatever he thought in his head he could also put on paper. … His teacher ‘must be required to accept it’ as a passing grade,” the officer wrote. “It was clear he was unable to fully understand his actions.” During his first outburst, in a poetry class, he made comments about abortion, wars and killing people, then asked: “Why don’t we just strap bombs to babies?” Later, he became hostile with a Pilates instructor when he learned he was going to receive a B in the class. According to school officials, Loughner studied at the college from the summer of 2005 to September, when he was suspended after campus police discovered a YouTube video in which Loughner claimed the college was illegal under to the U.S. Constitution. In all, he had five run-ins with police on two campuses. Loughner was warned that the behavior had to stop. On Nov. 30, the same day he bought the Glock, Loughner posted a YouTube video, seething about campus police and the college. “If the police remove you from the educational facility for talking then removing you from the educational facility for talking is unconstitutional,” he said on the video. “The situation is fraud because the police are unconstitutional. … Every Pima Community College class is always a scam!” School officials told Loughner and his parents that to return to classes he would need to undergo a mental health exam to show he was not a danger. He never returned. Kelsey Hawkes said Thursday on CBS’ “The Early Show” that when she dated Loughner six years ago when they were both in high school, he showed no violent tendencies and he was a completely different person. “Very caring, very sweet, a gentle, kind, you know, a little bit quiet. But altogether a pretty great guy,” she said. Associated Press writers Amanda Lee Myers, Alicia Chang and Gillian Flaccus in Tucson, and Jacques Billeaud and Bob Christie in Phoenix contributed to this report.

We've received your submission. TUCSON, Ariz.  — Christina Taylor Green, whose nine exuberant years began and ended with two of the most harrowing tragedies in recent American history, was laid to rest Thursday, her life cut short in a hail of bullets at a Tucson shopping center but her spirit remembered as fun-filled and loving. At a service that mixed “Ave Maria” with Billy Joel and ended with the plaintive wail of a bagpiper playing “Amazing Grace,” Bishop Gerald F. Kicanas told the 1,800 mourners inside the church that Christina “wanted to make a difference with her life, to make her mark. She has done so in such a powerful way that even she could not have imagined.” COPS FIND BAG WITH AMMO NEAR ‘SHOOTER’S’ HOME DOCTORS PURSUE AGGRESSIVE THERAPY WITH GIFFORDS SEN. GILLIBRAND DESCRIBES SEEING GIFFORDS OPEN EYES DEVOTED HUSBAND IS A ‘ROCK’ OF COMFORT AND COURAGE He also cited the many “times” of her life — “she had a time to laugh, a time to dance, which she so loved, a time to live and a time to build. She had a time to outshine the boys in baseball…a time to hug her little black stuffed dog, to love animals, to swim with her brother Dallas, which she so enjoyed, to model and be in fashion, to be elected to the Student Council, to be a leader and represent her class.” At the end of the service the Bishop also told the mourners, who included a number of Christina’s elementary school classmates and fellow Little League team members, that she had been an organ donor. The only other speaker was Christina’s father, John, who spoke directly to his daughter and said, “I think you’ve affected the whole country.” Outside the pink stone St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Catholic Church, a mammoth US flag that survived the Sept. 11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center – the day of Christina’s birth– fluttered between the ladders of two Tucson Fire Department trucks. As her family – her father, mother Roxanna and 11-year-old brother, Dallas – arrived for the service, they paused to look up at the flag under the crystal blue sky, gently rubbing each other’s shoulders. Then, all holding hands, they slowly walked beneath it and into the church, followed by other family members. Minutes later, the hearse carrying Christina’s child-size coffin, reportedly made of red oak especially for her by Trappist monks in Iowa, pulled up in front of the flag. Her parents and brother re-emerged to accompany her as a family for one of the last times as the coffin was wheeled inside. GAL PUT LOUGHNER ON PATH TO MADNESS HILLARY TAKES NIGHTMARE TO NEW EXTREME NEW YORKERS RUSH TO BUY GUNS VIDEO: ‘SHE OPENED HER EYES’ No television cameras were allowed inside the church for the nearly 90-minute funeral Mass. Afterwards, the family again walked with Christina to the hearse, this time with young Dallas placing his hand on his sister’s coffin. Christina, a brown-haired third grader, was the youngest victim of a shooting rampage Saturday outside a Tucson supermarket that gravely wounded Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) and killed six others. Jared Lee Loughner, a troubled 22-year-old loner, has been charged in the deaths. Among the mourners at Christina’s funeral was Mark Kelly, Giffords’ husband and a NASA astronaut, along with her sister, Melissa. Also present were Arizona’s two Republican senators, John McCain and Jon Kyl. After her death, from a gunshot wound to the chest, Christina was remembered as a spirited “Princess” – her father’s nickname for her – who had a kaleidoscope of interests including ballet, baseball (she was the only girl on an all boys team, the Pirates), swimming and politics. She went to the shopping center that day with a neighbor specifically to see Giffords because she had recently been elected to the Student Council at her elementary school and wanted to learn more. “She was very interested in politics since she was a little girl,” her mother told ABC. “I think that being born on 9/11 had a lot to do with that.” In fact, she appeared in a book “Faces of Hope” featuring a child from each state born on Sept. 11, 2001. Sports talent ran deep in her family. Christina was the granddaughter of Dallas Green, who managed the Philadelphia Phillies, New York Yankees and New York Mets. Her father is a supervising scout for the Los Angeles Dodgers. And aside from her not surprising prowess at baseball, Christina was also a gymnast and a swimmer. But, her mother said, “she was a girly girl as well as a tomboy.” The Arizona Republic reported she had a dollhouse, a boom box and an Audrey Hepburn poster in her bedroom. And this handwritten sign on her bedroom door: “Girls only. Back off boys. Girls rock.” Share Selection"

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. The following is a transcript of President Obama's address Jan. 12 at the University of Arizona during the memorial service for victims of the mass shooting in Tucson. Thank you. Please. Please, be seated. (APPLAUSE) To the families of those we've lost, to all who called them friends, to the students of this university, the public servants who are gathered here, the people of Tucson and the people of Arizona: I have come here tonight as an American who, like all Americans, kneels to pray with you today and will stand by you tomorrow. (APPLAUSE) There is nothing I can say that will fill the sudden hole torn in your hearts. But know this: The hopes of a nation are here tonight. We mourn with you for the fallen. We join you in your grief. And we add our faith to yours that Representative Gabrielle Giffords and the other living victims of this tragedy will pull through. (APPLAUSE) Scripture tells us, ""There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy place where the most high dwells. God is within her, she will not fall; God will help her at break of day."" On Saturday morning, Gabby, her staff, and many of her constituents gathered outside a supermarket to exercise their right to peaceful assembly and free speech. (APPLAUSE) They were fulfilling a central tenet of the democracy envisioned by our founders: representatives of the people answering questions to their constituents, so as to carry their concerns back to our nation's capital. Gabby called it ""Congress on Your Corner,"" just an updated version of government of and by and for the people. (APPLAUSE) And that quintessentially American scene, that was the scene that was shattered by a gunman's bullets. And the six people who lost their lives on Saturday, they, too, represented what is best in us, what is best in America. (APPLAUSE) Judge John Roll served our legal system for nearly 40 years. (APPLAUSE) A graduate of this university and a graduate of this law school... (APPLAUSE) ... Judge Roll was recommended for the federal bench by John McCain 20 years ago, appointed by President George H.W. Bush, and rose to become Arizona's chief federal judge. His colleagues described him as the hardest-working judge within the Ninth Circuit. He was on his way back from attending mass, as he did every day, when he decided to stop by and say hi to his representative. John is survived by his loving wife, Maureen, his three sons, and his five beautiful grandchildren. George and Dorothy Morris -- ""Dot"" to her friends -- were high school sweethearts who got married and had two daughters. They did everything together, traveling the open road in their R.V., enjoying what their friends called a 50-year honeymoon. Saturday morning, they went by the Safeway to hear what their congresswoman had to say. When gunfire rang out, George, a former Marine, instinctively tried to shield his wife. (APPLAUSE) Both were shot. Dot passed away. A New Jersey native, Phyllis Schneck retired to Tucson to beat the snow. But in the summer, she would return east, where her world revolved around her three children, her seven grandchildren, and two- year-old great-granddaughter. A gifted quilter, she'd often work under her favorite tree, or sometimes she'd sew aprons with the logos of the Jets and the Giants... (LAUGHTER) ... to give out at the church where she volunteered. A Republican, she took a liking to Gabby and wanted to get to know her better. (APPLAUSE) Dorwan and Mavy Stoddard grew up in Tucson together about 70 years ago. They moved apart and started their own respective families, but after both were widowed, they found their way back here, to, as one of Mavy's daughters put it, ""be boyfriend and girlfriend again."" (LAUGHTER) When they weren't out on the road in their motor home, you could find them just up the road, helping folks in need at the Mountain Avenue Church of Christ. A retired construction worker, Dorwan spent his spare time fixing up the church along with their dog, Tux. His final act of selflessness was to dive on top of his wife, sacrificing his life for hers. (APPLAUSE) Everything -- everything Gabe Zimmerman did, he did with passion, but... (APPLAUSE) ... but his true passion was helping people. As Gabby's outreach director, he made the cares of thousands of her constituents his own, seeing to it that seniors got the Medicare benefits that they had earned, that veterans got the medals and the care that they deserved, that government was working for ordinary folks. He died doing what he loved: talking with people and seeing how he could help. And Gabe is survived by his parents, Ross and Emily, his brother, Ben, and his fiancee, Kelly, who he planned to marry next year. (APPLAUSE) And then there is nine-year-old Christina-Taylor Green. Christina was an A student. She was a dancer. She was a gymnast. She was a swimmer. She decided that she wanted to be the first woman to play in the Major Leagues, and as the only girl on her Little League team, no one put it past her. (APPLAUSE) She showed an appreciation for life uncommon for a girl her age. She'd remind her mother, ""We are so blessed. We have the best life."" And she'd pay those blessings back by participating in a charity that helped children who were less fortunate. Our hearts are broken by their sudden passing. Our hearts are broken, and yet our hearts also have reason for fullness. Our hearts are full of hope and thanks for the 13 Americans who survived the shooting, including the congresswoman many of them went to see on Saturday. I have just come from the University Medical Center, just a mile from here, where our friend Gabby courageously fights to recover even as we speak. And I want to tell you -- her husband, Mark, is here, and he allows me to share this with you. Right after we went to visit, a few minutes after we left her room and some of her colleagues from Congress were in the room, Gabby opened her eyes for the first time. (APPLAUSE) Gabby opened her eyes for the first time. (APPLAUSE) Gabby opened her eyes. (APPLAUSE) Gabby opened her eyes, so I can tell you, she knows we are here, she knows we love her, and she knows that we are rooting for her through what is undoubtedly going to be a difficult journey. We are there for her. (APPLAUSE) Our hearts are full of thanks for that good news, and our hearts are full of gratitude for those who saved others. We are grateful to Daniel Hernandez... (APPLAUSE) ... a volunteer in Gabby's office. And, Daniel, I'm sorry, you may deny it, but we've decided you are a hero, because you ran through the chaos to minister to your boss and tended to her wounds and help keep her alive. (APPLAUSE) We are grateful to the men who tackled the gunman as he stopped to reload. (APPLAUSE) They're right over there. (APPLAUSE) We -- we are grateful for petite Patricia Maisch, who wrestled away the killer's ammunition and undoubtedly saved some lives. (APPLAUSE) And we are grateful for the doctors and nurses and first responders... (APPLAUSE) ... who worked wonders to heal those who'd been hurt. We are grateful to them. These men and women remind us that heroism is found not only on the fields of battle. They remind us that heroism does not require special training or physical strength. Heroism is here, in the hearts of so many of our fellow citizens, all around us, just waiting to be summoned, as it was on Saturday morning. Their actions, their selflessness poses a challenge to each of us. It raises the question of what, beyond prayers and expressions of concern, is required of us going forward. How can we honor the fallen? How can we be true to their memory? You see, when a tragedy like this strikes, it is part of our nature to demand explanations, to try to impose some order on the chaos and make sense out of that which seems senseless. Already, we've seen a national conversation commence, not only about the motivations behind these killings, but about everything from the merits of gun safety laws to the adequacy of our mental health system. And much -- much of this process... (APPLAUSE) ... of debating what might be done to prevent such tragedies in the future is an essential ingredient in our exercise of self- government. But at a time when our discourse has become so sharply polarized, at a time when we are far too eager to lay the blame for all that ails the world at the feet of those who happen to think differently than we do, it's important for us to pause for a moment and make sure that we're talking with each other in a way that -- that heals, not in a way that wounds. (APPLAUSE) Scripture tells us that there is evil in the world and that terrible things happen for reasons that defy human understanding. In the words of Job, ""When I looked for light, then came darkness."" Bad things happen, and we have to guard against simple explanations in the aftermath. For the truth is, none of us can know exactly what triggered this vicious attack. None of us can know with any certainty what might have stopped these shots from being fired or what thoughts lurked in the inner recesses of a violent man's mind. Yes, we had to examine all the facts behind this tragedy. We cannot and will not be passive in the face of such violence. We should be willing to challenge old assumptions in order to lessen the prospects of such violence in the future. (APPLAUSE) But what we cannot do is use this tragedy as one more occasion to turn on each other. (APPLAUSE) That we cannot do. That we cannot do. As we discuss these issues, let each of us do so with a good dose of humility. Rather than pointing fingers or assigning blame, let's use this occasion to expand our moral imaginations, to listen to each other more carefully, to sharpen our instincts for empathy, and remind ourselves of all the ways that our hopes and dreams are bound together. After all... (APPLAUSE) After all, that's what most of us do when we lose somebody in our family, especially if the loss is unexpected. We're shaken out of our routines. We're forced to look inward. We reflect on the past. Did we spend enough time with an aging -- an aging parent, we wonder? Did we express our gratitude for all the sacrifices that they made for us? Did we tell a spouse just how desperately we loved them, not just once in a while, but every single day? So sudden loss causes us to look backward, but it also forces us to look forward, to reflect on the present and the future, on the manner in which we live our lives and nurture our relationships with those who are still with us. (APPLAUSE) We may ask ourselves if we've shown enough kindness and generosity and compassion to the people in our lives. Perhaps we question whether we're doing right by our children, or our community, whether our priorities are in order. We recognize our own mortality. And we are reminded that, in the fleeting time we have on this Earth, what matters is not wealth, or status, or power, or fame, but rather how well we have loved and what small part we have played in making the lives of other people better. (APPLAUSE) And that process -- that process of reflection, of making sure we align our values with our actions, that, I believe, is what a tragedy like this requires. For those who were harmed, those who were killed, they are part of our family, an American family, 300 million strong. (APPLAUSE) We may not have known them personally, but surely we see ourselves in them. In George and Dot, in Dorwan and Mavy, we sense the abiding love we have for our own husbands, our own wives, our own life partners. Phyllis, she's our mom or our grandma, Gabe, our brother or son. (APPLAUSE) In Judge Roll, we recognize not only a man who prized his family and doing his job well, but also a man who embodied America's fidelity to the law. (APPLAUSE)And in Gabby -- in Gabby, we see a reflection of our public- spiritedness, that desire to participate in that sometimes frustrating, sometimes contentious, but always necessary and never- ending process to form a more perfect union. OBAMA: And in Christina, in Christina, we see all of our children, so curious, so trusting, so energetic, so full of magic, so deserving of our love, and so deserving of our good example. If this tragedy prompts reflection and debate, as it should, let's make sure it's worthy of those we have lost. (APPLAUSE) Let's make sure it's not on the usual plane of politics and point-scoring and pettiness that drifts away in the next news cycle. The loss of these wonderful people should make every one of us strive to be better, to be better in our private lives, to be better friends and neighbors and co-workers and parents. And if, as has been discussed in recent days, their death helps usher in more civility in our public discourse, let us remember it is not because a simple lack of civility caused this tragedy -- it did not -- but rather because only a more civil and honest public discourse can help us face up to the challenges of our nation in a way that would make them proud. (APPLAUSE) We should be civil because we want to live up to the example of public servants like John Roll and Gabby Giffords, who knew first and foremost that we are all Americans, and that we can question each other's ideas without questioning each other's love of country, and that our task, working together, is to constantly widen the circle of our concern so that we bequeath the American dream to future generations. (APPLAUSE) They believe -- they believe and I believe that we can be better. Those who died here, those who saved lives here, they help me believe. We may not be able to stop all evil in the world, but I know that how we treat one another, that's entirely up to us. (APPLAUSE) And I believe that, for all our imperfections, we are full of decency and goodness and that the forces that divide us are not as strong as those that unite us. (APPLAUSE) That's what I believe, in part because that's what a child like Christina-Taylor Green believed. (APPLAUSE) Imagine -- can you imagine for a moment, here was a young girl who was just becoming aware of our democracy, just beginning to understand the obligations of citizenship, just starting to glimpse the fact that someday she, too, might play a part in shaping her nation's future. She had been elected to her student council. She saw public service as something exciting and hopeful. She was off to meet her congresswoman, someone she was sure was good and important and might be a role model. She saw all this through the eyes of a child, undimmed by the cynicism or vitriol that we adults all too often just take for granted. I want us to live up to her expectations. (APPLAUSE) I want our democracy to be as good as Christina imagined it. I want America to be as good as she imagined it. All of us, we should do everything we can to make sure this country lives up to our children's expectations. (APPLAUSE) As has already been mentioned, Christina was given to us on September 11th, 2001, one of 50 babies born that day to be pictured in a book called ""Faces of Hope."" On either side of her photo in that book were simple wishes for a child's life: ""I hope you help those in need,"" read one. ""I hope you know all of the words to the National Anthem and sing it with your hand over your heart. I hope -- I hope you jump in rain puddles."" If there are rain puddles in Heaven, Christina is jumping in them today. (APPLAUSE) And here on this Earth, here on this Earth, we place our hands over our hearts and we commit ourselves as Americans to forging a country that is forever worthy of her gentle, happy spirit. May God bless and keep those we've lost in restful and eternal peace. May he love and watch over the survivors. And may he bless the United States of America.

29886986,2011-01-13 16:22:15,Restricting 2nd Amendment Isn't the Answer,http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2011/01/13/restricting_2nd_amendment_isnt_the_answer.html,en,False,,1040,RealClearPolitics,http://realclearpolitics.com/,"By Steve Chapman - January 13, 2011  It has been a dismal decade for gun control advocates. They lost the federal so-called assault weapons ban when it expired in 2004. The Supreme Court made history by proclaiming an individual right to own firearms for self-defense. A Democratic president came into office vowing not to take away anyone's guns. So it's no surprise that anti-gun forces would take the mass shooting in Tucson as a rare opportunity to reverse their fortunes. It's also no surprise that their proposals are models of futility. Gun control has faltered mainly because it hasn't worked. And nothing in the new recommendations offers hope of success. The first idea came from Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., who wants to ban all ammunition magazines holding more than 10 rounds -- which was the rule under the assault weapons law. Her rationale is that the rampage ended when the shooter exhausted a 30-round clip and tried to reload, at which point he was subdued. With a 10-round clip, he could have been stopped sooner. Maybe so. But Jared Loughner apparently put some planning into this attack, and had the laws been different, he might have planned around them. Suppose he couldn't go to the gun shop and buy a new 30-round clip. He could have bought a used one, which could be legally sold under the expired federal law. Or he could have bought extra weapons to avoid the need to reload -- like the shooter in the 2008 Northern Illinois University slaughter, who had a shotgun and three handguns. Passing a law to head off a freakishly rare occurrence is probably a waste of time. Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck says that of the hundreds of mass shootings that have occurred in this country, he knows of only one in which a gunman was stopped because he had to reload -- a 1993 episode on the Long Island Railroad. A measure offered by Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., offers even less promise. He wants to make it a crime to knowingly carry a firearm within 1,000 feet of a president, vice president, member of Congress or federal judge. That would punish law-abiding citizens who have no aggressive intentions -- say, someone who parks a block away from a campaign rally on his way to the target range. But it would have been only a paper barrier to Loughner, who ignored a host of laws on his way to shoot Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. The group Mayors Against Illegal Guns fantasizes that King's bill ""would give federal, state, and local law enforcement a better chance to intercept would-be shooters before they pull the trigger."" Not unless the gunmen announce themselves, it wouldn't. A more serious complaint is that Loughner was able to legally buy a weapon even though he was weird enough to induce fear at his community college. School authorities finally told him not to come back until he got a bill of health from a mental health professional. But none of this showed up in the background check when he went to buy a gun. Right now, federal law excludes a purchaser only if he ""has been adjudicated as a mental defective"" or involuntarily committed to a psychiatric facility. But some states bar sales to those who have been voluntarily committed, which makes sense. No one would argue against better use of available records. Stopping a troubled person whose behavior is not alarming enough to trigger action by his family or friends, though, borders on the impossible. We don't want to give every gun buyer the burden of proving mental stability -- any more than we would require each taxpayer to take a polygraph when filing a 1040. The only real hope for keeping a lunatic away from guns is diligence by those who know him. It's hard to imagine that stricter gun control laws would have any discernible value in averting tragedy. Homicides have actually declined since the demise of the assault weapons ban. Utah has the nation's most permissive gun laws, according to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, but it has one of the lowest murder rates in the country. California, with the strictest laws, has a homicide rate higher than the national average. There are plenty of lessons to be drawn from the ineffectuality of firearms regulations.

We want to bridge divides to reach everyone. Despite gun control efforts in Congress in the wake of the Arizona shooting, it's unlikely that America will see more gun control laws. In fact, the opposite may happen, at least in Arizona. Loading... January 13, 2011 Congress is preparing three new gun control laws in the wake of the shooting deaths Saturday of six people and wounding of 14 others, including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, in Tucson, Ariz. But some Americans are drawing a different conclusion from the attack: Only more guns in more hands can reduce gun violence. US lawmakers immediately began reviewing their personal security details in the wake of the shooting, even debating whether to install bulletproof glass to separate lawmakers from the publicly accessible Capitol gallery. At least two congressmen – Reps. Jason Chaffetz (R) of Utah and Heath Shuler (D) of North Carolina, both licensed gun carriers from staunchly pro-gun parts of their states – announced they'd be carrying weapons during upcoming public events in their districts. And even as Arizonans held an emotional national memorial meeting with President Obama on Wednesday night for the victims of the worst act of gun violence since the Fort Hood shootings in 2009, the Arizona Legislature didn't hesitate this week to introduce a bill that would allow college students to carry weapons on campus. ""Arizona's response [to the shooting] – the most likely legislative response – is going to be expanded gun rights,"" writes Slate's David Weigel, noting that gun rights remains a top priority for a fresh batch of tea party conservatives elected to the Republican-led legislature in November. In a country that, on the national level, hasn't passed a major gun-control law since the assault-weapons ban in 1993, gun rights have been steadily expanding by judicial decree as well as state and national law. In 2009, President Obama, who campaigned on a promise to reinstate the assault-weapons ban, signed laws allowing gun owners to carry their weapons in national parks and on Amtrak trains. Politicians are likely taking cues from the public. A Gallup poll in October found that 44 percent of Americans believe firearm sale regulations should be stricter, a record low response to that question. A USA Today poll taken after the Arizona shooting showed that only 1 in 5 respondents believe stricter gun control laws would have prevented the shooting. The Arizona Legislature's consideration this week of a proposed campus-carry gun law despite the Tucson tragedy illustrates how attitudes toward guns have changed since the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, which sparked a slew of state anti-gun measures, including in Kentucky and California. ""What we've seen is a maturing of the American public in its sophistication on the gun issue, and I think we're now seeing a growth toward a more realistic attitude, which is to think about these incidents on a case-by-case basis and whether this shows us anything that could be done better,"" says Dave Kopel, an adjunct constitutional law professor at Denver University. In the past 30 years, the number of states that automatically issue concealed-carry permits after a background check have gone from nine to 37, meaning that ""Americans have in most places practical social experience with guns, where if you go out in public, out of every 100 people you pass there's probably going to be a few who are lawfully carrying concealed weapons, and they're not maniacs,"" says Professor Kopel. ""That experience accumulates."" For their part, gun-control advocates hope the Arizona shooting will change the pro-gun rights momentum of the past decade, especially seeing as this time a mass shooting touched Congress personally. Rep. Carolyn McCarthy (D) of New York and Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D) of New Jersey, are preparing legislation that would ban the kind of high-capacity magazines allegedly used by the accused shooter, Jared Loughner, on Jan. 8. A bill aimed at preventing anyone from carrying a gun within 1,000 feet of a member of Congress, as well as other high-profile government officials, is forthcoming from Rep. Pete King (R) of New York. And on Wednesday, Rep. Gary Ackerman (D) of New York, offered up legislation to close a loophole that allows gun dealers whose licenses have been revoked to continue to sell firearms without background checks. Usually ""politicians turn a blind eye to this,"" Paul Helmke, president of the Brady Campaign and the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, tells The Huffington Post. ""They'll talk about anything except guns. My main hope with this shooting is that maybe now we'll finally start to talk about the intolerable level of gun violence in this country."" Largely because Democrats are not expecting President Obama to back any major gun-control package, Representative McCarthy, one of the strongest gun-control advocates in Congress, has said any bills to control specific guns like the Glock 19 semiautomatic used in the Arizona shootings are ""off the table."" And experts like Kopel say even the proposed new restrictions will have trouble passing Congress in the face of stated opposition from House Speaker John Boehner. With 85 guns in circulation for every 100 Americans, the sheer prevalence of guns leads to a high rate of gun-deaths – some 30,000 a year – in the US when compared with other Western countries. Yet in a country so heavily armed – and that reality protected in large part by the Second Amendment – gun-control measures, to many Americans, seem more a theoretical exercise when weighed against individual responsibility to protect oneself in the face of trouble, gun-rights experts say. ""Simply telling people to behave passively or to defend themselves in some other way is not very good advice,"" John Lott Jr., the author of ""More Guns, Less Crime,"" told the conservative National Review Online this week. ""Having a gun is by far the safest course of action for those left to confront a criminal alone."" In Arizona, which has some 39,000 words in its statutes related to gun control, the campus-carry legislation follows a major expansion of gun rights last year when the legislature made Arizona the sixth state to pass the ""Firearms Freedom Act,"" which exempts any firearm made and used inside the state's borders from federal regulations. If passed, the campus-carry law would give the state the lowest score in the US on a gun-control scorecard kept by the Brady Campaign. To many Arizonans, talking about how to get more guns into more hands even as the country grieves signals that the state is taking the wrong lessons from Saturday's tragic shooting. ""Arizonans, myself included, love to tout their vaunted independence and Western values,"" writes Katherine Benton-Cohen, a Georgetown University professor, on Politico. ""But when we perpetuate the idea that Arizona is some unchanging Wild West, we fall into the trap of a myth that only serves to embolden those who refuse to support common-sense restrictions on purchasing firearms."" In part, the failures of the gun-control movement nationally came out of a calculated decision by Democrats to court conservative and pro-Second Amendment Blue Dog Democrats in the South and West, a strategy which helped bring about Democratic victories in 2006 and 2008, laying the foundation for the passage of landmark legislation such as health-care reform. One of those Blue Dogs is Representative Giffords, a Second Amendment proponent who also owns a Glock. Already a subscriber?

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. In this file photo provided by the office of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, Giffords, left, is shown with her husband, NASA astronaut Mark Kelly. (AP/Office of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords) WASHINGTON -- NASA announced a backup shuttle commander Thursday in case they need to replace the astronaut-husband of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was wounded in a mass shooting last weekend. Officially, Capt. Mark Kelly, who is Giffords' husband of more than three years, is still the commander for the final scheduled flight of the space shuttle program, NASA said. The shuttle Endeavour is scheduled to launch on April 19 on a trip to the International Space Station. Kelly was named commander in 2009 and has been in training for 17 months. Being chosen to lead the last shuttle flight is a big honor, NASA spokesman Michael Curie said. Just in case Kelly can't fly as his wife recovers from a gunshot to the head, his spot will be taken by veteran shuttle commander Rick Sturckow (STUR'-koh) who is the agency's deputy chief astronaut. The Arizona congresswoman remains in critical condition in a Tucson hospital. Kelly said in a statement released by NASA that he recommended to the space agency that they ""take steps now to prepare to complete the mission in my absence if necessary."" ""I am very hopeful that I will be in a position to rejoin my (Endeavour) crew members to finish our training,"" Kelly said in the statement. As far as NASA is concerned, ""Mark is still the commander,"" chief astronaut Peggy Whitson said. ""He is facing many uncertainties now as he supports Gabrielle, and our goal is to allow him to keep his undistracted attention on his family while allowing preparations for the mission to progress."" Curie said NASA hasn't yet determined when exactly it needs to make a decision on whether Kelly, a three-time shuttle flier, will be able to command the mission. But he said naming a backup commander buys some time. Space shuttle crews usually spend well more than a year training for the intricate duties of a particular mission. Endeavour's 14-day mission would resupply the space station and install a $1.5 billion physics experiment. The shooting of Giffords put NASA in an uncomfortable position about what to do with the April flight, said American University professor Howard McCurdy, who has written several books about the space program. Removing Kelly from a prestigious job would look like punishing him because of the assassination attempt, but he will be busy helping his wife recover and could be distracted if he flies. He called Thursday's move ""a realistic, carefully thought out compromise.""

(AP) -- As the funeral for the youngest victim of the mass shooting in Arizona was set to begin Thursday, the largest flag recovered from Ground Zero after the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center was raised by two fire trucks with ladders extended, and several hundred people lined a road near the church to show support. Nine-year-old Christina Taylor Green was born on Sept. 11, 2001, and featured in a book called ""Faces of Hope"" that chronicled one baby from each state born on the day terrorists killed nearly 3,000 people. Christina's funeral is the first for the six victims killed when police said a gunman opened fired on a crowd at an event for Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, critically injuring the congresswoman and wounding 13 others. The third-grader had an interest in politics and had recently been elected to her student council. She was also the only girl on her Little League baseball team and wanted to become the first professional female ball player. During President Barack Obama's speech at a memorial Wednesday night, he spoke at length about Christina and reminded the audience that the third-grader's neighbor had brought her to meet Giffords because of her budding interest in democracy. ""She saw all this through the eyes of a child, undimmed by the cynicism or vitriol that we adults all too often just take for granted,"" he said. ""I want to live up to her expectations. I want our democracy to be as good as Christina imagined it. I want America to be as good as she imagined it."" Her funeral was set for 3 p.m. EST. Before it began, cars were parked on both sides of the road, and traffic was backed up. Members of motorcycle groups from Arizona and California parked their bikes in a group. Several hundred people, many dressed in white T-shirts, stood silently along a road near the church. About 20 people were dressed as angels. They organized over the Internet and by word of mouth, saying they wanted to be there in case members of a Kansas church showed up to protest. The Westboro Baptist Church threatened to picket the funerals for Christina and other victims, but they backed off, in part because a nationally syndicated radio show agreed to host some of their members.

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: TUCSON, Ariz. — She had an easy smile and eyes the color of mahogany. She was dainty one minute and a tomboy the next, trading a prim ballet outfit for a Canyon del Oro Little League uniform. She was the only girl on the Pirates, a second baseman and an occasional pitcher, and quite confident she’d be the first woman in the major leagues. She fancied things that, even in a cynical age, were hard to argue with — singing, animals, climbing mesquite trees, tending to the less fortunate. In the days since Christina Taylor Green became the youngest of those killed in Arizona’s mass shooting, much has been made of her life. But the hard truth is that she was born on one terrible day and died on another, with just nine years in between. Christina, born Sept. 11, 2001, shot and killed last weekend, was laid to rest Thursday, with little less than the promise of a better nation draped around her slender shoulders. In an address the night before the service, President Barack Obama had challenged Americans to live up to Christina’s vision — to be, as the president put it, “better friends and neighbors and co-workers and parents.” “She wanted to make a difference with her life, to make her mark. She has done so in such a powerful way that even she could not have imagined,” Tucson Bishop Gerald Kicanas said in his homily, given before a capacity crowd of 1,800 people. The bishop also noted that even in death, Christina helped others: She was an organ donor. About a quarter of the mourners were children, many of them from Christina’s school or baseball league. “Everybody’s going to be OK,” her father, John Green, told mourners. “She’d want that.” Addressing his daughter directly, he said: “I think you’ve affected the whole country. We’ll never forget you.” The private service was held at the adobe St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Catholic Church, in northwest Tucson near the foot of the Santa Catalina Mountains. The church was decorated with pink flowers and large photographs of a grinning Christina. Mourners spoke at an altar topped with a colorful “Ojo de Dios,” or God’s eye, a tradition of southwest Christianity that dates back to Spanish settlers and American Indians. Some believe the design is a window into the soul of God. Astronaut Mark Kelly, the husband of Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was severely wounded in the attack, was among the mourners attending the service. Hundreds more — families with children and elderly neighbors — lined the roadway leading to the church, many carrying single roses. The crowd grew silent as a black hearse carrying Christina’s small wooden casket approached. Amanda Stinnett, 32, wept and hugged a neighbor. Stinnett recalled Christina, a classmate of her children, standing in front of school collecting cans of food and clothes for families the school had “adopted” for the holidays. “Everyone loved her,” she said. The funeral came five days after a gunman opened fire at a Tucson shopping center, killing six, including Arizona’s chief federal judge, and wounding 13, including Giffords. Jared Loughner, 22, faces federal murder and attempted murder charges in the rampage. As she grew, Christina was preoccupied with her unusual birthday; when she was younger, her parents had to correct her when she told people she’d been born on a “holiday.” But the Greens came to view that day as one not only of tragedy but also of resurrection and aspiration. As a result, Christina became very patriotic and often wore red, white and blue. She was drawn to the idea of politics and public service, and had recently been elected to the student council at Mesa Verde Elementary School. She had gone with her neighbor, Susan Hileman, to meet their congresswoman. “It was women being proud of other women,” Susan Hileman’s husband, Bill, said this week. They were waiting to meet Giffords, hand in hand, when the first shots erupted. Hileman was hit three times but survived. Christina was shot once in the chest and died a short time later. Led by law enforcement officials in white gloves, pallbearers wheeled Christina’s casket into the church Thursday. Her parents, John and Roxanna Green, and her brother, 11-year-old Dallas, followed, holding hands and bowing their heads. A 30-foot-wide flag known as the National 9/11 Flag, which flew atop the south tower of the World Trade Center the day it fell, framed the entry to the church. Shredded and lifted from the wreckage, it was largely forgotten until 2008, when a foundation brought it to Kansas, where volunteers — many of whom had survived a series of tornadoes — used flags found in tornado rubble to patch it up. The flag will soon become part of the permanent memorial museum on the former site of the World Trade Center.

Gabrielle Giffords had opened her eyes for the first time since being shot at point-blank range. From Truman to Obama, see each president's ratings with USA TODAY's approval tracker. Former White House officials and experts in government and communications said Obama's healing words at Wednesday night's memorial service conveyed a message the country needed to hear. By not pointing fingers or seeking to score political points, they said, Obama positioned himself well as he readies his State of the Union Address for Jan. 25. That speech will lay out his goals for the year ahead, his first with a divided government. ""The president's speech last night was potentially seismic for him,"" said Richard Greene, a communications strategist who has written on history's most unforgettable speeches. ""Every time the president shows himself in this very warm, very human light, a light that everyone can relate to, he softens up the argument against his agenda."" Obama's entrance into the drama came as the harsh partisan rhetoric was escalating. Some liberals, such as Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, said vitriolic language from conservatives had helped to create a hateful atmosphere. Some conservatives, such as Sarah Palin, accused liberals of using the tragedy for political purposes. The president silenced both sides, at least temporarily. He called for empathy, not blame, to honor the six people who died and 13 others wounded, including critically injured Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. DOCTORS:  Giffords' moving of legs is major step in recovery
COPING:  Arizona shooting survivors may face emotional trauma ""Only a more civil and honest public discourse can help us face up to our challenges as a nation, in a way that would make them proud,"" Obama said. Could boost his standing Republicans as well as Democrats said the president's tone should help him in the weeks and months ahead. ""It reminded me of the old Obama, the Obama of 2008,"" said Peter Wehner, a former White House speechwriter. ""If his public standing goes up, his political standing goes up, and he becomes more formidable for Republicans to deal with."" But the Tucson tragedy and its political aftermath isn't as likely to generate policy prescriptions as have past incidents, such as the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks or the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. ""This is an isolated crime by a madman. It doesn't have the same policy legs that carry on to a substantive agenda,"" said Ari Fleischer, who was Bush's press secretary on 9/11. ""It doesn't change the fundamentals. In order for things to get done, President Obama needs to move to the center."" One area of policy that could come up for debate is federal aid to state and local governments for mental health treatment. Jared Loughner, who is accused of two counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder in the mass shooting, was never court-ordered to undergo treatment. A block grant to states has been frozen at $430 million since Bill Clinton's administration. Additional federal Medicaid funds available under the 2009 economic stimulus law will disappear June 30. INVESTIGATION:  Authorities examine bag suspect may have carried ""We certainly have people in the White House who are sympathetic,"" said Ron Honberg, of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. ""But it's just a very difficult time to ask for more money."" Some experts said that to advance his goals, Obama should make good on his pledge of civility and compromise. Making the aisle disappear ""What he has to make clear is that he's taking seriously his own lesson,"" said Wayne Fields, director of the John C. Danforth Center on Religion and Politics at Washington University in St. Louis. Then the two parties might come together ""by fits and starts,"" he said. White House officials said the State of the Union Address likely will include further calls for civility. But whether Obama cites the death of 9-year-old Christina-Taylor Green, Giffords' battle for survival or Loughner's mental health issues to push legislative proposals appeared less likely. FUNERAL:  Thousands turn out to remember Christina-Taylor Green
STUDY:  20% of Americans have done heroic deeds ""Will there be references to it? I imagine,"" White House senior adviser David Axelrod said. ""But much of what needed to be said was said last night. I certainly don't imagine it to be a major organizing theme."" Press secretary Robert Gibbs said Obama will look for more opportunities to address ""how we reach across the aisle, how we have that more civil debate and discourse."" One step, he said, might be for Democrats and Republicans to sit together for the State of the Union Address, as suggested by Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo. Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, said any intermingling is up to the members themselves. ""Maybe not having a physical aisle separate us would be a good thing as we talk about the state of our union,"" Gibbs said. Contributing: Mimi Hall"

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Capitol Hill police officer speaks to the media gathered outside the Capitol Hill office of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Az., Saturday, Jan. 8, 2011, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP) Members of Congress and other federal employees worried about their safety in the wake of the Arizona mass shooting can always request additional security detail from the U.S. Capitol Police or Marshals Service, but relying on local law enforcement may not be an option as cutbacks hit cash-strapped police forces. In the aftermath of the murderous rampage in Tucson Saturday that left six dead and 14 wounded, including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz, who was hosting a constituents meeting, House Sergeant at Arms Bill Livingood this week reissued a security guide for lawmakers concerned about their safety. ""It is essential that each district office establish communication with local law enforcement,"" Livingood said in a memo sent Thursday to House members and their staffs. The memo provided security guidance, including designating a law enforcement coordinator for each office. ""Members participate in a tremendous assortment of events each year, throughout the United States. Experience demonstrates though that not every event requires the presence of law enforcement,"" reads the memo obtained by Fox News. ""However, the decision whether or not to have a law enforcement presence at any event is one best made through close liaison with the Office of the Sergeant at Arms, the U.S. Capitol Police and your local law enforcement agencies."" Some lawmakers have already taken the advice to heart. Freshman Rep. Joe Walsh of Illinois reached out to the local sheriff to provide security at a town hall on Wednesday night in honor of Giffords. Other lawmakers are going further. Rep. Jesse Jackson, Jr., D-Ill., this week proposed additional congressional spending for security at district offices. Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., proposed barring people from bringing a weapon within 1,000 feet of a government official. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Tex., suggested allowing lawmakers to carry weapons inside the Capitol. Already, Reps. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and Heath Shuler, D-N.C., announced they're going to step up the frequency with which they carry concealed weapons to district events. For lawmakers who have started requesting assistance from local police, one agency is already working very closely with Congress and U.S. Capitol Police. John Firman, director of research for the International Association of Chiefs of Police, told FoxNews.com, that police chiefs will need coordination to determine how best to meet requests, whether that means pulling an officer out of another unit or division or handing out overtime. While he said there will be ""natural limitations"" to what can be offered, providing adequate security to U.S. lawmakers is a ""high priority."" ""The magic words here are going to be communication and planning,"" he said. ""Local police are going to be extremely receptive to this. It's going to come down to planning and communication so they don't get caught short with the knowledge that it's happening."" But for others, providing additional security is bound to be complicated by the budget crises facing many police agencies. A quarter of U.S. cities have reported cutting their public safety budgets in the past year, according to a report by the National League of Cities. Rep. Donald Payne, D-N.J., represents Newark, which just cut 13 percent of its police force, or about 163 officers, to help close an $83 million budget deficit. Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., represents Oakland, which last year slashed nearly 10 percent of its police force, or 80 officers, to help close a $31 million budget deficit. Dallas police and fire unions last year agreed to pay cuts and mandatory unpaid leave to help the city close a $130 million gap. That city's congressional representation is split among several lawmakers -- Ralph Hall, Eddie Bernice Johnson, Pete Sessions, Sam Johnson, Jeb Hensarling and Kenny Marchant -- who may pull from the same resources. Jim Pascal, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, the nation's largest police union, noted that more than 80 percent of police departments have 10 or fewer officers. One retired New York City Police Department officer who has provided security detail for a U.S. lawmaker said it's going to create a lot of strain on police departments because ""like so much else, you don't want anything to happen on your watch."" Nonetheless, Pascal said, despite the cutbacks and grim financial picture, police unions and former officers say local law enforcement will accommodate any security requests from lawmakers. ""It's important to state they're going to do what needs to be done, but it will cost an extraordinary strain and something will be left undone,"" Pascal said. ""Monitoring, in general, is just another thing that has been placed on the plate of local and state law officials. At the same time, robberies, car thefts, none of that is going away. So the cops have their hands full,"" added Bill Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations. Johnson said overtime costs will go up for employees, agencies and municipalities -- costs that he expects the federal government to pick up if they continue in the long term. ""The individual cops and sheriffs will do whatever they're asked to do to protect elected representatives of the people, but you can't get away from the fact that it will cost a lot of time and money to do a good job and it will have to be a federal responsibility to cover that,"" he said. Sheldon Greenberg, an associate dean of the Division of Public Safety Leadership at Johns Hopkins University, said there's a difference between police departments being ""shorthanded and not adequately analyzing resources you have to determine how they can be best used. ""A lot of agencies in my opinion are not shorthanded, but haven't allocated their people well,"" Greenberg said, explaining that patrol services are treated as a lower priority while resources are poured into specialty units and task forces. Greenberg said he doesn't believe there will be a flood of requests from lawmakers for additional security. ""In the short term, there may be a flurry of activity, but normalcy will prevail,"" he said. ""The worst thing that could happen would be to turn an average town hall meeting into a law enforcement endeavor. It's not what this country wants or will tolerate."" The House hasn't arrived at a conclusion yet on how it will provide more protection for members. The proposal from Jackson, who is also working to restore last week's 5 percent cut in member budgets, would add 10 percent to lawmakers' budgets for district offices, an increase that he says would translate into hiring more security personnel for public events in some districts, installing surveillance cameras or improving the locks or entry systems at district offices. One option he suggested is using additional resources to move some lawmakers' offices to safer areas. ""I do not feel that fear should grip us, but since 9/11 we've secured every federal facility with the exception of our district offices,"" Jackson said in a statement. ""After the events of last weekend, it is clear that our district staffs are vulnerable. Members should have the resources and the latitude to take the appropriate security measures in order to protect themselves and their staffs."" But freshman Rep. Michael Grimm, who is a former law enforcement officer, says no additional money is required. Instead, he wants to offer low-cost security awareness training for lawmakers and their staff. ""I firmly believe this training will be beneficial in various situations, from accidents and illnesses to acts of violence or terrorism they may encounter,"" he wrote.

We want to bridge divides to reach everyone. US Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, targeted in last week's Arizona shooting, continues to improve; a Tucson Safeway store reopens; and investigators work to build their case against Jared Loughner. Loading... January 15, 2011 A week has passed since America – and Tucson, Ariz., in particular – was horrified, revolted, and grieved by a mass shooting at a congresswoman’s routine event with constituents outside a Safeway supermarket. In that time President Obama has three times spoken to the nation, in a bid to comfort and unite. In that time three of the six people killed in the shooting have been laid to rest. In that time the Safeway has reopened, with store spokeswoman Cathy Kloos on Saturday noting employees’ desire to “reconnect with their customers” and affirming, “We’re doing OK.” The initial round of castigation – liberals and conservatives feuding over who’s more at fault for a climate of political “vitriol” and whether that played into the tragedy – has subsided. Lawmakers in Congress are considering whether Republicans and Democrats ought to intermingle in the audience at the upcoming State of the Union address, in a gesture of comity. Doctors say Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D), the apparent target of the attack, continues to improve after being shot in the head and is off a ventilator, raising hopes for her recovery, and 10 of the 13 wounded have been released from the hospital. Things will never be the same, especially for families who lost loved ones. But for many they are starting to be manageable, if still not explainable. RELATED: Five of Jared Loughner's strange ideas The challenge of explaining what happened – and why it happened – falls to law-enforcement authorities, who have spent the past week trying to build their case against suspect Jared Loughner. The 22-year-old Tucson resident, who had been kicked out of community college and rejected by the Army, faces four federal charges, including killing an employee of the federal government. Federal Judge John Roll died in last Saturday’s rampage. Authorities on Friday released a time line of Mr. Loughner’s activities in the 12 hours before the shooting. They say it shows an individual acting with deliberation and focus, posting a “Good-bye friends” bulletin and uploading a photo on his MySpace page, and driving to one Wal-Mart store and then another after he was not able to buy ammunition at the first. According to authorities, Loughner was up most of the night before the shooting. By their recounting of his actions, he dropped off photos for developing at a Walgreens at 12:24 a.m., and checked into a Motel 6 minutes later. By 2:30 a.m. he had retrieved the photos and returned to the motel. His MySpace activity came at 4:21 a.m. He checked out of his room before sunrise, and drove to one Wal-Mart and then a Super Wal-Mart two miles away, where he bought ammunition and a back-pack style diaper bag, in black. He was in his car at 7:30 a.m., stopped by an Arizona Fish and Game official after running a red light. Released, Loughner arrived at his parents’ home, where his father sees him remove a black bag from the car and tries to question him about it. Loughner runs away on foot, and his father drives after him in pursuit, but cannot find him. At 9:41 a.m., authorities say, a taxi picks up Loughner at a Circle K store and drives him to the Safeway near where Ms. Giffords is to hold her “Congress on Your Corner” event to meet constituents. Loughner and the taxi driver enter the Safeway to break a $20 bill, so Loughner can pay the fare. That and the subsequent shooting itself, they say, are captured on the store’s surveillance cameras. Also on Friday, Pima Community College, where Loughner had been a student, released to the Los Angeles Times a video that offers a more nuanced window on the suspect. He is alleged to have made the video and uploaded it in late September to Youtube. It was the final straw for the college, which had already dealt with complaints about him and responded to several incidents in which he was disruptive in class or at the campus library. Loughner was immediately suspended from school pending a mental health clearance. The video, shot on the campus, does not picture Loughner but is narrated by a voice that the Times says is his. Describing him as “rambling and agitated,” the Times notes that Loughner characterizes the college as a “genocide school,” says while walking past the bookstore that “they’re controlling the grammar,” and asserts that “all the teachers you have are being paid illegally and have illegal authority over the Constitution of the United States under the 1st Amendment.” Loughner’s attorney is expected to try to save him from execution by arguing that he is mentally ill.

We've received your submission. If someone admits to a federal official that he or she has used illegal drugs, that information should be sent to the FBI so that person can be disqualified from purchasing a gun, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said today. Noting that Jared Lee Loughner, the alleged shooter in the Tucson massacre, had admitted to military recruiters that he had used drugs on several occasions, Schumer, said he was proposing to the Justice Department and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that the military be required to notify federal officials about such admissions. He said such a process does not require new legislation. Loughner is charged with five federal counts in the killing of a federal judge and shooting of Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. The Jan. 8 mass shooting outside a Safeway grocery store resulted in six dead and 14 injured. A military official told Fox News last week that Loughner was rejected from enlisting in the Army in 2008 because he admitted he had used drugs. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because privacy laws prevent the military from disclosing such information about an individual’s application. Schumer said if military recruiters or other officials report admissions of drug use to a national database, those individuals could be denied a gun. “After Jared Loughner was interviewed by the military, he was rejected from the Army because of excessive drug use. Now, by law, by law that’s on the books, he should not have been allowed to buy a gun,” Schumer told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “But the law doesn’t require the military to notify the FBI about that, and in this case they didn’t. So I — this morning — I’m writing the administration and urging … that the military notify the FBI when someone is rejected from the military for excessive drug use and that be added to the FBI database,” Schumer said. The issue of limiting Second Amendment rights has exploded in the wake of the Arizona shooting as lawmakers and officials discuss whether increased curbs should be put on gun ownership. Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell said Sunday that a citizen hunting or protecting his home does not need a gun with 33 bullets per clip. “I think the nation’s spirits would be lifted if the Congress acted quickly with the president and reinstated the assault weapons ban which also had the ban on these large magazines, these clips that carried 30-plus bullets,” he said. Rendell, speaking on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” added that had Loughner earlier been classified as having mental illness, he would never have gotten a gun under provisions established in existing gun control laws.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. In this Jan. 15 photo, patrons walk past a makeshift memorial at the Safeway grocery store in Tucson where a gunman opened fire Jan. 8. (AP) The mass shooting in Tucson last weekend is fueling the gun control debate in neighboring California, with an advocacy organization renewing a push to prohibit firearms in restaurants and state lawmakers taking up a bill that would end the state's open-carry law. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence launched a drive last week challenging restaurants and cafes to exert their private property rights and ban guns in their establishments.The push formalized a campaign the group's California chapter has been loosely waging since last year. Karen Arntzen, Brady's California chapter coordinator, told FoxNews.com on Monday she thinks the Arizona shooting should help refocus Californians on gun control and bring more restaurants on board. ""Since the Tucson shooting, more of them are coming forward,"" Arntzen said. ""It's renewed the gun control debate. It's renewed the focus on mental illness, easy access to guns."" But open-carry advocates, who have been meeting at California restaurants exercising their open-carry rights over the past year, are not happy with the push and are vowing to counter the Brady Campaign. The California skirmish is one of many taking place across the country as gun control advocates and Second Amendment defenders clash anew in the wake of the Arizona shooting attack. After Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., was shot in the head last Saturday by a lone gunman, several members of Congress have floated new ideas for restricting access to guns. Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., is pushing a proposal to prohibit high-capacity magazines, a move criticized by the National Rifle Association. Most recently, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Sunday that he wants to require the military to notify federal officials whenever somebody tells a recruiter or other official that they have used illegal drugs -- this way, they could potentially be prohibited from buying a gun. Shooting suspect Jared Loughner, according to a source, was rejected from enlisting in the Army in 2008 because he admitted to using drugs. The attack will no doubt play into the same debate in state capitals. Along with the Brady Campaign's push, California Assemblyman Anthony Portantino has introduced a bill to end California's open carry law, which allows state residents to carry a firearm so long as it's unloaded and kept in a holster. Yih-Chau Chang, spokesman for gun-rights group Responsible Citizens of California, said the network of open-carry advocacy groups in the state will continue to make their case to restaurants. ""They've taken away the law-abiding citizens' ability to defend themselves,"" he said of the Brady Campaign and those restaurants that have agreed to ban weapons. He accused the Brady campaign of trying to ""capitalize"" on the Tucson tragedy and urged restaurants to ignore the hype. ""The Tucson shooting incident was, unfortunately, a tragedy that no amount of gun control is going to be able to stop,"" he said. The Brady Campaign push has already led to one confrontation, with more likely as the group sets out to protest the meetings of open-carry advocates in California. The latest incident occurred in Orange County over the weekend, when Brady Campaign activists arrived with protest signs as open-carry advocates carrying weapons met across the street at a Corner Bakery café. According to an account in the Orange County Register, the managers at the café eventually asked the open-carry crowd to leave because the presence of reporters, police and protesters was disrupting business. One open-carry activist, Robert Cowdell, told the newspaper that his group considered postponing the meeting because of the Arizona shooting, but went ahead with it anyway to make the case that ""guns level the playing field."" Arntzen said a similar protest is set for Jan. 20 at a local pizza parlor. She praised the state legislature for taking up the open-carry bill, but said the Brady Campaign would not wait for lawmakers to crack down on guns in restaurants. To those restaurants that want to participate, the Brady Campaign is offering pre-made signs declaring restaurants to be ""gun-free"" establishments. To those that resist, the campaign is putting their names on a public ""name & shame"" list of ""socially irresponsible businesses."" Among those restaurants is Starbucks Coffee Co., which could not be reached for comment. Chang praised Starbucks for its resistance to pressure from gun control advocates and suggested other restaurants that follow suit will be rewarded with more business from sympathetic customers. ""Second Amendment supporters vote not only at the ballot box, but also with their money,"" he said.

Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), who was shot through the head nearly two weeks ago, could be walking again in a matter of months after a course of intensive rehabilitation in Houston, doctors and her husband said Thursday. The congresswoman, whose injury in the Jan. 8 mass shooting in Tucson left questions about her cognitive and speech abilities, has made a ""fantastic"" recovery at the University of Arizona's medical center, said Michael Lemole, chief of neurology. He said that suggests she will respond well to the physical and other therapy she will receive at TIRR Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston, where she is scheduled to be transported Friday. Giffords was among 19 people shot, six of them fatally, at an event she was holding for constituents outside a Safeway. Jared Lee Loughner, 22, is facing murder and attempted-assassination charges in the incident. The doctors sought to manage expectations about her condition. Although Giffords has been able to scroll through pictures on an iPad and stand and bear her own weight, they said, the status of her vision and speech is unknown. Her husband, Mark E. Kelly, said that he believes she recognizes him and has tried to mouth some words. ""She'll smile at me. She'll do a couple things she'll only do around me, pat my face. . . . I can just look in her eyes and tell - she's well aware of who's around her, just very well aware of the situation,"" Kelly said. ""I think she's made a remarkable recovery."" On Thursday, Giffords was taken up to the hospital's helipad to take in some sunshine for the first time since the shooting. ""We let her see the Arizona skyline once before she leaves tomorrow,"" said emergency medicine chief Peter M. Rhee. The congresswoman will travel to Houston on Friday by ambulance, air ambulance and then medical helicopter. Doctors said the rehabilitation will probably take months, but they declined to describe a best-case scenario. Kelly, however, did. ""I've been telling the hospital staff she's going to walk through these halls . . . within a couple of months. I'm sure of that. So she'll be back,"" he said. Later, the doctors said it was possible. "

Answers to the open-ended questions reflect different results than another Gallup poll conducted soon after the Jan. 8 shooting spree, when the majority of people surveyed said they didn't think stricter gun laws would have prevented the tragedy, the Princeton, N.J., polling agency said. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., was critically wounded in the head and a federal judge was killed in the rampage attributed to 22-year-old college dropout Jared Loughner.
When asked what they think would work, survey participants most likely suggested stricter gun control laws, education about guns and violence, background checks for guns and allowing more Americans to carry guns for protection, Gallup said.
Participants also suggested that improvements in the mental health system, better security at public events, speaking out more about possible dangers, better parenting, and returning God or morality to people's lives could help prevent future shootings, Gallup said.

When assessing ""blame"" for the Tucson shootings, the majority of Americans assigned a ""great deal"" of blame to the mental health system for a perceived failure to identify people posing a danger to others, followed by easy access to guns. 
Results for poll are based on nationwide telephone interviews conducted with 1,032 adults Jan. 14-16. The margin of error is 4 percentage points.

We've received your submission. TUCSON, Ariz. — The man accused of carrying out a mass shooting in Tucson pleaded not guilty Monday to charges he tried to kill Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and two of her aides. The plea by Jared Lee Loughner marked his second court appearance since he allegedly shot the congresswoman and 18 others at Giffords’ meet-and-greet event on Jan. 8 outside a grocery store in Tucson. Six people died, and 13 others were wounded. Loughner, 22, faces federal charges of trying to assassinate Giffords and attempting to murder two of her aides. He will later face state charges dealing with other victims. U.S. District Judge Larry Burns of San Diego asked Loughner attorney Judy Clarke whether there was any question about her client’s abilities to understand the case against him. “We are not raising any issues at this time,” Clarke said. Investigators have said Loughner was mentally disturbed and acting increasingly erratic in the weeks leading up to the shooting. If he pleads not guilty by reason insanity and is successful, he could avoid the death penalty and be sent to a mental health facility instead of prison. At least eight U.S. Marshals were present at the hearing in the Phoenix courthouse, where Loughner entered Monday afternoon smiling and wearing an orange prison suit and glasses. Prosecutor Wallace Kleindienst estimated that he would know within the next 30 days whether additional federal charges would be filed against Loughner. Kleindienst said prosecutors provided defense lawyers with records taken from Loughner’s computer and documents of about 250 interviews made in the case. Giffords and two of her aides were among the 13 shooting victims who survived the attack. The six who died in the attack include U.S. District Judge John Roll and a 9-year-old girl. Share Selection"

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Shown here is Rep. Steve Cohen. (FNC) Rep. Steve Cohen on Thursday stood by his remarks in which he compared Republican attacks on the health care overhaul to Nazi propaganda advanced by Joseph Goebbels. The Tennessee Democrat, who is Jewish, said he regrets that anyone was offended and that his comments were used to ""distract from the debate about health care."" But in a detailed written statement, the congressman elaborated on and defended his analogy. ""Taken out of context, I can understand the confusion and concern,"" he said. ""While I regret that anything I said has created an opportunity to distract from the debate about health care for 32 million Americans, I want to be clear that I never called Republicans Nazis. Instead, the reference I made was to the greatest propaganda master of all time."" Cohen had accused Republicans of spreading false propaganda about the health care law and tried to compare their tactics to those used by the Nazis in the lead-up to the Holocaust. ""They don't like the truth so they summarily dismiss it,"" Cohen said. ""They say it's a government takeover of health care, a big lie just like (Nazi propagandist Joseph) Goebbels."" He made the remarks to a mostly empty chamber on Tuesday night as he argued against the GOP's bill to repeal the health care law -- a bill that passed the House Wednesday. Jewish groups swiftly criticized Cohen for making the comparison. The National Jewish Democratic Council issued a statement saying ""invoking the Holocaust to make a political point is never acceptable."" The NJDC called Cohen a ""leading progressive figure"" and said the ""vast preponderance of abusive Holocaust rhetoric"" comes from the political right, but urged both sides to condemn such rhetoric no matter who uses it. ""We implore Cohen and all our leaders to choose their words carefully as we move forward,"" the group said. Though few were in attendance for his original speech, Cohen said in his statement that he ""received no comments or responses from my colleagues on the floor at the time."" He went on to say that he would ""never do anything to diminish the horror of the Nazi Holocaust as I revere and respect the history of my people."" ""I regret that anyone in the Jewish Community, my Republican colleagues or anyone else was offended by the portrayal of my comments. My comments were not directed toward any group or people but at the false message and, specifically, the method by which is has been delivered,"" he said. Cohen's comments nevertheless defied calls by President Obama and others to tone down the political rhetoric after the Jan. 8 mass shooting that left six dead and 13 wounded, including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz. Giffords, who was shot in the head, is now in serious condition and is expected to be transferred to a rehab center on Friday. Cohen made several Nazi references on the floor, though did he not devote all his remarks to the comparison. ""You say it enough, you repeat the lie, you repeat the lie, you repeat the lie, and eventually, people believe it. Like blood libel. That's the same kind of thing,"" Cohen said. Blood libel is a historically and false anti-Semitic charge that Jews killed Christian children to use their blood in religious rituals. Sarah Palin drew controversy for citing the term last week to defend herself against accusations on the left that her use of violent imagery helped incite the mass shootings. ""The Germans said enough about the Jews and people believed it, and you have the Holocaust,"" Cohen added in his remarks. ""You tell a lie over and over again."" The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) condemned Cohen's remarks. ""No matter how strong one's objections to any policy or to the tactics of political opponents, invoking the Holocaust and the Nazi effort to exterminate the Jewish people is offensive and has no place in a civil political discourse,"" ADL National Director Abraham H. Foxman said in a statement. ""Using the Holocaust as an analogy to express frustration or comparing false information to the anti-Semitic blood libel or to Goebbels' genocidal propaganda is inappropriate and serves only to trivialize the dangers of anti-Semitism and the unique tragedy in human history that saw the murder of 6 million Jews and millions of others,"" he said. ""We respect Representative Cohen's right to engage in vigorous debate about health care policy,"" he added. ""We hope he will reconsider his offensive statement and we urge all members of Congress to reject such odious comparisons.""

By Shaun Tandon, AFP/Getty Images Jared Loughner, the accused gunman in the Tucson mass shooting, attended Pima Community College, which is pictured here. By Shaun Tandon, AFP/Getty Images Jared Loughner, the accused gunman in the Tucson mass shooting, attended Pima Community College, which is pictured here. Faculty members are seeking advice on dealing with disruptive outbursts and intimidating behavior, says Brian Van Brunt, president of the American College Counseling Association. Jared Loughner, 22, is accused of shooting Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 18 other people, six fatally, Jan. 8. He was attending Pima Community College in November when he was banned from campus for outbursts that scared students and teachers. At Western Kentucky University, where Van Brunt is director of counseling, staffers ""are looking at what would we do if we had a similar case,"" he says. His university has three or four students a year who exhibit a worrisome combination of self-isolation and simmering aggression, he says, and they're required to accept treatment on campus as a condition of staying in school. Several schools are expanding mental health services by making part-time counselors full-time or adding private counselors, including Henry Ford Community College in Dearborn, Mich., says Brett Sokolow of the National Behavioral Intervention Team Association. Many colleges added behavioral intervention teams after the Virginia Tech shooting in 2007, when student Seung Hui Cho killed 33 people, including himself. Usually, a team of counselors, teachers and campus police meets regularly to track complaints about disturbing behavior from instructors, dormitory workers and others. The team assesses the threat and coordinates action. Membership in the association jumped 14% to 578 schools since the Arizona shooting. Bookings for training rose from 16 schools in all of December to 17 in the first 10 days after the shooting, says Scott Lewis of the National Center for Higher Education Risk Management, a law firm that advises colleges on intervention teams. Name: Jared Loughner William Serrata, vice president for student services at South Texas College in McAllen, Texas, says he asked Lewis to add an evaluation of Pima's handling of Loughner to a previously planned lecture next month. Gaston College in Dallas, N.C., hired Lewis before the shooting to discuss behavioral intervention teams. Now a team is more likely to become a reality, says Wanda Wyont, director of retention. ""We're all going to take more caution and maybe develop procedures that would help us identify behavior that could be a problem,"" Wyont says. At Truckee Meadows Community College in Reno, counselors are making a video to remind staff to refer students who hint of suicide or violence to counseling, or call police if danger looms, says Estela Gutierrez, director of counseling. At Northern Virginia Community College, about 10 students and faculty members contacted Pat Lunt, special assistant for student mental health and behavior, about problem student behavior in the 10 days after Jan. 8. She fielded 130 calls in all of 2010. A report about threatening Facebook postings probably would have gone unreported before, she says. A student was taken for a hospital evaluation and banned from Jackson Community College in Jackson, Mich., Jan. 14 after ranting at a student advocate, says Cindy Allen, director of community relations. The student was allowed back last week, she says, after a dean ""made sure he understood that ... you shouldn't make statements that can be misconstrued as threatening."" A day before the Tucson shooting, the community college had held a training session that reviewed violent incidents at other schools. Some faculty members complained that it was too disturbing, Allen says. ""After Arizona, people said, 'OK, now we see it's important, what other training can we get?'""

For some observers, things as seemingly insignificant as a birth date—in this case, the birth date of a nine-year-old girl—feel heavy with significance, if only we knew how to interpret them. I, for one, was moved, though I did not know exactly why, when President Obama, in his Tucson memorial speech, solemnly reminded us, that ""Christina was given to us on September 11, 2001."" What followed was an invocation of hope, but I couldn't help wondering why the president had chosen the prophetically resonant phrase, a child is given to us. Did he believe that this particular girl was given to us (by God?) as a compensation for all those who were lost on that miserable day? Was he somehow intimating that the date of her birth had destined her to a particular saving future? All the machinery for providential interpretation was in place, but to no avail. The most that President Obama could do was to observe—and it was widely remarked in the media—that for a nine-year-old child, Christina was unusually civic-minded and had recently been elected to her student council. Although he did not draw any connection between her birth date and her destiny, her mother did explicitly though in a more quotidian manner when she told news organizations that ""she was very interested in politics since she was a little girl. I think that being born on 9/11 had a lot to do with that."" In the date of Christina's birth and the bitterly cruel circumstances of her end, a child's private life and the events of the larger world collided two times over. This uncanny, haunting symmetry, marked as it is with fateful overtones straight out of Greek tragedy, also feels pregnant with meaning, though what exactly still remains to be revealed. I have to say that I was puzzled when I read that New York City Fire Department representatives brought the flag that survived the World Trade Center attacks to Arizona for the express purpose of flying it at the church of Christina's funeral. They did this, according to ABC World News, as ""a tribute to a young girl who was born on the day the Twin Towers fell and died in another tragedy outside of an Arizona supermarket."" But what is the link between the two tragedies? Do the men who sent the flag from New York and those who raised it at the Christina's funeral believe that the murderous political violence on her birth date was somehow propelling Christina to her fate, a fate that was fulfilled with what, at times, is treated like murderous political violence—the target was Congresswoman Giffords and the assassin will be prosecuted under federal statutes. This, of course, is highly unlikely, for as we know, the shooting is more often treated as the work of a madman, which breaks, if these two events are to be associated with something like Greek tragedy, the necessary cosmic link between them and, in consequence, turns the flag into a totem of sheer coincidence. And then I found myself thinking about a softer version of fate that was half-suggested by Christina's mother: Because Christina was born on September 11, she was interested in politics and this somehow explains or, in more prosaic but still cosmic-tinged terms, put into motion the course of events that placed her at Congresswoman Giffords's informal Saturday morning meeting. This, I thought, is the kind of speculation in which many of us indulge when we have been in an accident; we re-play the haphazard events of the day, noting if only we had done this or that differently, we would not have ended up where we were at the time of the accident and thus would have escaped what retrospectively takes on the appearance of fate, but what is really nothing more than randomness, bad luck, sheer coincidence. Yet, as I write these words, I feel increasingly discomfited, as if my own quasi-fatalist speculations are a kind of superstitious, mental equivalent of the firemen sending the World Trade Center flag to Tucson. If, in these attempts to find or bestow meaning on the shooting of a nine-year-old girl, it is difficult to get anywhere with what is left to us of providential or tragic schemes of explanation, when it comes to the Tucson shooting itself, it has been equally difficult to get very far even with rational schemes of causation, like the one offered by Pima County Sheriff Dupnik, who has been a lawman for 52 years: that the increasingly ""toxic"" political environment—""the anger, the hatred, the bigotry that goes on in this country is getting to be outrageous""—contributed to the shooting of a congresswoman who supported the national health bill and a chief federal judge who made an unpopular decision regarding illegal immigrants. Both had received death threats; Judge Roll had been placed under 24-hour protection of the U.S. Marshals Service and the glass front door of Representative Giffords's office had been shattered, perhaps by a bullet. What is more, Representative Giffords was on Sarah Palin's notorious, democratic ""hit-list"" map and Giffords had spoken out against it, warning that incendiary words and images have consequences. Given that this is the world in which we actually live, the most plausible explanation for the mayhem would have been that a right-wing extremist group—""Patriot"" groups, for instance, increased 244 percent in 2009—or a true believer acting on his own carried out this assassination and tried to kill as many innocent bystanders as possible, suicide-bomber style (without the suicide). Everything was in place for this scenario. That is why Paul Krugman, in his immediate response to the horrible news, announced that he was ""expecting something like this atrocity to happen"" and why so many perfectly rational people felt the same way. This understanding of how such atrocities happen, however, has proven empty. The consensus today is that the Tucson shooting was the senseless act of a lunatic and those of us who confidently read the signs in Krugman's way are now in the position of the mad narrator in Nabokov's Pale Fire, who, in his painstaking, fantastical interpretation of a 999-line poem of a murdered neighbor/imagined double, keeps finding meaning where, in truth, there isn't any. The horrific mass shooting, I am supposed to tell myself, was nothing more than the act of a lunatic, signifying nothing, utterly absurd. And this is how Representative Giffords's forum with its homey name, ""Congress on Your Corner,"" that terror-filled Saturday morning is starting to feel, now that providence, fate, and finally, cause-and-effect relationships have lost their powers of elucidation. All we are left with is the standard, all-service, therapeutic explanation of mental illness... Nevertheless, even if the shootings were the act of a ""sick"" man, why, I ask myself, should we treat it as self-contained, completely cut off from the world we inhabit together? After all, it has long been recognized that pathologies do not spring full-blown out of a social vacuum, that they are best understood as heightened versions of what is considered normal. Loughner's reported obsession with the meaninglessness of words, with dreams, with government mind-control, like his gun fetishism, belong, albeit in exaggerated form, as much to our shared, common world as Palin's map of targeted congressional districts. Which made me think of the vicious pornographic imagination that is broadcast everywhere in our mass media and the ready-made, standardized forms of sexual humilation and brutality that those Army men and women at Abu Ghraib aped in their notorious S&M photographs and videos. Drawing precisely this kind of connection between what appears in our common world and how people think and act has long been the domain of conservatives (and more recently of radical feminists against pornography). Their sudden skepticism about its existence in the Tucson shootings puzzled me, as did its sudden discovery by liberals, who are typically, even habitually, dubious about such links. Why this reversal in political alignments? And it did not stop there. Reading those passages in Palin's ""blood libel"" statement where she courageously announces that she will not be silenced, that, no matter what, she will exercise her constitutional right of free speech, I felt, at least for a fleeting, no doubt delusional, moment, as if I were reading a speech by the radical anarchist Emma Goldman or the radical sex reformer Margaret Sanger. And I felt equally disoriented when I read liberals, who typically cleave to the notion that the speech we hate is as entitled to protection as any other, demanding—indeed, threatening to pass legislation to ensure—that their opponents tone down their vicious, inflammatory rhetoric. Nothing, on any level, was lining up properly. I had had enough of thinking about things about which thinking doesn't help and decided to go out. But, as I made my way through the treacherous patches of slippery ice on the sidewalk, the uncanniness of Christina's birth date again entered my thoughts. As an historian, I have long been interested in what I think of as retrospective knowledge, that what one notices about a person's life depends on how things turn out later. And then it dawned on me: If, as an adult, Christina had gone into politics and, say, achieved something significant in relation to Al Qaeda, then her birth date would have meant something in the way that President Clinton could say that he came from a town called Hope. But had she instead become the first woman to play major-league baseball, apparently a childhood dream of hers (she comes from a family of baseball players, she was the only girl on the little league team), it would not. And that was that ... at least until I recalled that I had read that Christina was an ""organ donor"" (that awful phrase) and that her father has said that he would like to meet and embrace the girl who received his daughter's gift of life. Although his wish is understandable, I hope that it will not be granted, that adults will keep this child mercifully in the dark concerning the identity of her donor so that this child who gains this second chance at life will not be forced to shoulder the unbearable burden of becoming part of Christina's unhappy story simply because she had the good luck of being at the right place at the right time.

30696772,2011-01-29 23:20:00,Thousands flock to O.C. gun show,http://www.ocregister.com/news/gun-286218-president-guns.html,en,False,,25,Orange County Register,http://www.ocregister.com/,"Trending:  The parking lot at the gun show was heavy on Chevy Silverado trucks and Ford F-150s, as well as political bumper stickers.  Gun show organizers don't take people's words for it that guns are unloaded.  A pistol with its clip removed sits on the screening desk just outside the gun show entrance.  One man outdid his fellow gun owners by bringing a cannon to the show.  Gun show staffer Tony Gregg handles a weapon after ensuring it's not loaded.  Attendees were allowed to bring guns inside, but had to have them screened to assure they weren't loaded.  A line stretched from the middle of the fairgrounds and nearly as far as the eye could see when the gun show's gates opened Saturday morning.  Jim Rose of Long Beach said law-abiding gun owners shouldn't face new restrictions because of the Tucson shootings. ""It wasn't everybody in America that pulled the trigger,"" he said.  Jeffrey Belanger of Long Beach said laws on concealed weapons are unfair. ""Someone else pulls a gun on me, and I follow the law, what am I going to do? I can't fight them with my fists.""  Roger Hewson of Fountain Valley said California's gun laws have become onerous. ""They're making it so difficult. I think it's going to get worse and worse from here,"" he said.  Ken Downs of Costa Mesa worried the Tucson shootings would lead to new, widespread gun restrictions. ""Every time something bad happens, they try to impose rules that affect a majority, when it's a minority that causes the problems,"" he said.  Darrin Simmons of Fountain Valley complained that lawmakers cast too wide a net in restricting guns. ""One person drinks and drives and kills someone, you don't go after ... all the other drivers,"" he said.  Frank Kerr of Costa Mesa makes his Second Amendment feelings clear.  A gun show attendee shows off a T-shirt that uses applies President Barack Obama's campaign message to the terrorist-fighting Jack Bauer character from the ""24"" television series.  An attendee holds up a $1,000 Colt 45 pistol.  COSTA MESA – Frank Kerr, standing in a quarter-mile-long line Saturday to enter the Crossroads of the West Gun Show, sighed when asked for his thoughts on the recent mass shooting in Arizona. “I know,” he said, “they’re going to come after my guns when stuff like that happens.” Amid thousands of firearm aficionados who showed up for the two-day event at the O.C. Fair and Event Center, few seemed to disagree. “I’ve never seen it this busy before,” said attendee Jim Rose, who learned to hunt on his family farm in Missouri. “What we’re seeing here is a lot of people are nervous.” (CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS FROM THE SHOW, INCLUDING COMMENTS FROM ATTENDEES.) Turnout has always been strong during the show’s two decades in Orange County, especially after news-making acts of violence or the election of a Democratic president, said Bob Templeton, Crossroads president. That trend appeared to hold Saturday despite victories for gun owners at the federal level, including President Barack Obama’s signing of a law allowing loaded firearms in national parks. Besides the Tucson killings, which reportedly have the White House considering entering the gun-control debate, worries centered on state legislation that, had it not been struck down this month, would have further restricted ammunition sales. “Politics and the dialog and the debate about gun control always play heavily on the size of the crowd,” Templeton said. Tracy Olcott, vice president of Crossroads, said 15,000 people could pass through the gates, breaking the attendance record. “We’ve got a great crowd here,” she said. Among them was Fountain Valley resident Roger Hewson, sporting a T-shirt depicting a well-armed Benjamin Franklin. “They’re making it so difficult,” he said of California gun laws, which mandate a background check and 10-day waiting period. “I think it’s going to get worse and worse from here.” Jeffrey Belanger of Long Beach concurred: “I just think it’ll get to the point here in California where we can’t carry guns.” For all the pessimism, the overwhelmingly male gathering also had light moments. Tony Gregg, who ensured that no loaded guns came inside, laughed when seeing a man waiting to have heavy artillery screened. “Just the cannon? You’re good,” Gregg told him. “I can’t do anything with that.” By 10 a.m., cash registers were clinging with sales of bullets and Bud Light. Customers perused weapons of all sizes, from pocket pistols to an M-60 machine gun, reputedly one of three legal for sale in the state. Merchandise ran the gamut from pepper spray and “emergency response knives” to Egyptian cotton sheets, porcelain tea pots, rabbit skins and DVDs with such titles as “Blunt Force Trauma First Aid” and “Rock ‘N’ Roll: Sexy Girls and Sexy Guns!” “Palin-Limbaugh 2012” shirts were easy to find, as were “Liberal Hunting Permit” bumper stickers. Most guests said they weren’t in need of anything in particular, but came anyway, just in case something caught their eye. Better safe than sorry. “The turnout has never been like this,” said Ken Downs of Costa Mesa. “Never.” Contact the writer: 714-796-7952 or joverley@ocregister.com Get the latest news delivered daily!

We've received your submission. New York trader Vincent McCrudden has been threatening officials and co-workers for more than a decade — and that’s why he should be released on bail. At least that’s what McCrudden’s lawyer, Bruce Barket, may argue at a bail hearing scheduled for today. In a motion filed yesterday, Barket said his client’s long history of aggressive and intimidating behavior has yet to result in physical harm. “In the dozen or more years he has been writing and speaking to the industry in this manner, [McCrudden] has never taken a single step to harm anyone,” Barket wrote in papers filed in Brooklyn federal court. McCrudden was arrested last month and held without bail after he allegedly threatened the lives of dozens of financial regulators, including Securities and Exchange Commission chief Mary Schapiro. The 49-year-old former hedge fund manager, who fled the attacks on the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, was also sanctioned several years ago for threatening co-workers. The prosecution is expected to ask Judge Denis Hurley to deny McCrudden bail at the hearing, said a source close to the case. McCrudden is being held at a Queens detention center. His arrest followed a mass shooting in Tucson, Ariz., that injured Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and resulted in the deaths of six people, including a federal judge. Barket also is expected to argue that the courts commonly grant bail to people who have threatened government officials, including $50,000 bail for a Long Island man who threatened to use a high-powered rifle on Gov. Andrew Cuomo when he was attorney general. In a Sept. 30 e-mail, McCrudden allegedly threatened to hire professional hitmen to torture and kill a high-ranking official at the National Futures Association. In his motion, Barket said he doubts that his client wrote the violent e-mail, adding that McCrudden’s past letters have been peppered with expletives. “It lacks the vulgarity that is littered in all of his other writings,” Barket wrote. “[McCrudden] doesn’t string together more than half a sentence before he uses the ‘F’ word, the ‘MF’ word, the ‘C’ word, something.” kwhitehouse@nypost.com Share Selection"

We've received your submission. TUCSON, Ariz. — Arizona will prosecute Jared Loughner, the 22-year-old charged in the mass shooting at a Tucson-area supermarket, when his federal case is over, according to law enforcement officials. In a statement expected to be released Friday by Arizona US Attorney Dennis Burke, whose office is handling the federal case, and Barbara LaWall, attorney for Pima County, said their offices have agreed that Loughner will first be prosecuted by the US attorney’s office. When the federal charges “have been fully prosecuted through the Federal court system, Arizona state charges will be prosecuted by the Pima County Attorney’s Office,” according to a copy of the statement. Loughner is charged in connection with a mass-shooting on Jan. 8 that killed six and injured 13, including Rep.Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.). In federal court, Loughner has been charged with attempted assassination of Giffords, who was shot in the head at close range. He is also charged with the attempted murders of two federal employees, Giffords’ aides. More charges are likely to be filed by federal prosecutors to address the killing of federal Judge John Roll and a Giffords aide. Those charges could carry the death penalty. Many other victims not employed by the federal government were also wounded and killed, including nine-year-old Christina Taylor Green, who died from her wounds.

Nothing too much to worry about; another situation under control. By James Palka, AP Bystanders embrace at the scene where Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and others were shot outside a Safeway grocery store in Tucson on Jan. 8. By James Palka, AP Bystanders embrace at the scene where Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and others were shot outside a Safeway grocery store in Tucson on Jan. 8. That was Saturday so far for Rodeffer, a battalion chief for the Northwest Fire/Rescue District in Tucson: everything under control. He had clocked in at 7 that morning, reveling in the small weekend luxury of wearing a T-shirt to work. He would work a 24-hour shift, then catch four days off. Rodeffer celebrated his 46th birthday on Friday with a punishing kettlebell workout and dinner at Red Lobster with his parents and Maggie, his wife of 18 years. Saturday, Jan. 8, was slow so far. A patient with chest pains; a minor bike accident, the cyclist skinned up and bruised. Rodeffer dispatched himself to both calls and handled them. Under control. At 10:14, a call came across the radio: first-alarm medical. Severe emergency. An address about 7 miles to the south and east. Ina and Oracle roads. Rodeffer jumped in his truck and headed there. As Rodeffer sped through the sparse Saturday-morning traffic, radio chatter turned frantic. More units dispatched. Injuries. Multiple injuries. He called Lane Spalla, another battalion chief. ""Lane, this is sounding like a deal,"" Rodeffer said. ""What are you thinking?"" Spalla was already there — a shopping center with a Safeway. Rodeffer pulled up, but everyone was being held back. Police were still securing the scene. Finally, medical responders were cleared. Rodeffer parked his truck on the west edge of the lot and walked quickly toward the store. A banner sharpened into focus: Gabrielle Giffords, in red letters, United States Congress in blue. The banner didn't register in Rodeffer's mind. Instead, he saw only the scene in front of it. In his years as a Marine, in a decade of emergency service, he had never seen this. Bystanders were swarming the firetrucks, tugging desperately at firefighters, reaching for medical equipment. ""People are dying here!"" someone cried. ""We need your help!"" Two miles away, the alarms sounded at Northwest Fire/Rescue District Station 30. The dispatcher's voice was measured, but the words conveyed the urgency: engine. Rescue. Battalion. Firefighter and paramedic Tony Compagno reached for his fire gear and then heard the words: 10 people shot. ""At the fire?"" Compagno asked his captain. ""There's no fire,"" the captain said. The radio buzzed. The units flew. Compagno and his crew were among the first to arrive. They waited for police to let them through and found chaos. Bodies. So much blood. Compagno was assigned triage: assess and count the victims and figure out who needed help first. No time to write it down. He had to keep it in his head. I gotta get in there, he thought, gotta make the count. He saw a man lying face down in a pool of blood and fixed on the image. His mind froze for an instant. So much blood. Come on! he told himself. Come on! He heard yelling, and one voice broke through. ""Congresswoman Giffords has been shot! Over here!"" Compagno ran to her. She was alive. He stood in the cramped walkway in front of the store and scanned the ground. He did the numbers. Four dead for sure. Seven people needed immediate attention. A little girl on the ground. He heard another voice, from someone else in the crew. ""How many helicopters?"" ""Launch all of them,"" Compagno said. Then another voice. Engine 33 was on the scene. ""Who? Who's next?"" Who's next? he thought. ""Her,"" Compagno said, pointing to the little girl, bloodied, unconscious. ""Her."" He knew her injuries were significant. Terrible. But the dad in him. .. he didn't want her to be dead. The second crew was up. Compagno pointed them toward the woman in the red coat. Colt Jackson bent down and took her hand. ""Hi, I'm Paramedic Jackson,"" he said. ""Can you hear me?"" She squeezed his hand. He went through the basics, the ABCs: check her airway, breathing and circulation. He put her on oxygen. He turned to a young man at the patient's side, dark hair, glasses. The man hadn't budged, even with all the blood. Hold her like this, Jackson told him. It will protect her back. ""This is Congresswoman Giffords,"" the young man said. ""I'm staying."" Daniel Hernandez had been an intern for her office for exactly five days when he arrived for the meet-and-greet at the Safeway that morning. When the shooting started, other staffers went down, hit. One of them, Ron Barber, turned to Hernandez. ""Make sure you stay with Gabby,"" Barber said. ""Make sure you help Gabby."" Hernandez had pressed his bare hand against her head to stop the bleeding until medics arrived. Now, he walked alongside the stretcher, holding her hand. The ambulance doors opened. He climbed inside. As the ambulances rolled out, headed south toward University Medical Center, Compagno continued directing the help at the scene. More paramedics flooded in as helicopters droned. But that wasn't what Compagno noticed. All around the victims were bystanders, family, friends — just regular people, comforting them, giving them CPR. One man used his belt as a tourniquet. They're not alone, he thought. None of them is alone. James Palka left his house a few minutes before 10:30. He had packed two cameras he used for event photography, the lenses set up for the meet-and-greet. He left the house where he ran his freelance business and turned on to Ina Road, heading east. He was really just going out of personal interest, to photograph U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords at her ""Congress on Your Corner"" event. About a mile away from the Safeway, a speeding paramedic truck passed. Then another. A firetruck. He wondered if there had been an accident. As he neared the shopping center, traffic slowed and sirens wailed again. His stomach seized as the thought hit him. What if someone had tried to kill the congresswoman? He reached Oracle Road and saw firetrucks and emergency vehicles and one. .. two. .. three. .. four ambulances. Palka eased through the intersection. Most of the entrances had been blocked by wooden sawhorses and police tape, but he spotted a side driveway still open. He pulled in and parked. He got out of his car and somehow remembered to bring his camera. He stood for a moment. A scruffy-looking man stood near him behind the police line. ""What happened?"" Palka asked. ""Someone shot the congresswoman,"" the man said. Palka felt weak. Why her? he asked himself. She's one of the good ones. For several minutes, Palka watched as a bystander, as a person. He took pictures of parties, fundraisers. His work as a photographer hadn't prepared him for this. Then he remembered his camera. No one else was taking pictures, he realized, not even with a cellphone camera. He was carrying his 70-300mm telephoto and could see the scene from the police line. He raised the camera and started taking pictures: Emergency workers treating the wounded, lifting people onto gurneys. Medical helicopters landing in the parking lot. Police officers talking to witnesses. Bloodied men and women comforting one another. He heard voices rise, then saw paramedics pushing a gurney toward an ambulance. A young man stayed alongside, his hand on hers. The patient was clearly hurt badly, her head bloodied. It was her. It was Giffords. Palka snapped a series of photos as she was put in the ambulance. It was 10:41 a.m. A half-hour had passed since the first shots were fired. Anna Ballis crouched on the sidewalk in front of the Safeway, applying pressure to the upper leg of Giffords' district director. Ron Barber had been a total stranger only moments before. She propped his head on a jacket to make him more comfortable. Ballis had stopped at the grocery store to buy beef broth for a roast she intended to put in a slow cooker. She saw Giffords' event and thought about stopping, but the line looked too long. Then a man with a white beard stepped out and encouraged her to come by after she'd finished. Giffords would still be here, he said. Moments later, the shooting started. Ballis reacted instinctively, ducking behind a pillar, then under a table. When the shooting stopped, she regained her bearings. Then she saw the man with the white beard, bleeding badly. She ran to his side and put pressure on his wound. Barber seemed more concerned about everyone else than himself, and Ballis had to reassure him that Giffords and the others were being cared for. He squeezed her hand. ""Thank you,"" he said. Steve Rayle sat on the gunman until sheriff's deputies arrived. Then his medical training took over. A hospice doctor who had worked in emergency rooms, Rayle surveyed the scene. He moved from victim to victim, offering advice, encouragement, comfort. He administered CPR to one man. But he couldn't provide what the victims needed most. Blood. They were losing too much blood. Someone brought clean rags and aprons from Safeway's butcher shop. Rayle and others grabbed them, pressing down on the bleeding wounds. Bill Badger could feel the stinging in his head, where a bullet had grazed him. Faith Salzgeber had found something from inside Walgreens to sop up the blood. As paramedics treated his injury, Badger still held his mobile phone in his left hand. With his left thumb, he dialed home. His wife, Sallie, answered. ""I've been hit,"" he said, his own words difficult to believe. ""But I'm OK."" Across the parking lot, in a Pima County sheriff's vehicle, a young man sat in handcuffs. He wore a dark hooded sweatshirt. His face was bleeding and swollen. Jared Loughner said almost nothing. Roger Salzgeber began to tremble as the rush of adrenaline subsided and the chill morning air wrapped around him. He shook as he watched the emergency workers, watched his wife helping. As paramedics ushered the uninjured away from the shooting scene, Roger and Faith began to settle in with the uneasy reality of what had happened. The rage he had felt as he pinned the gunman began to give way to the truth. Everyone around me, he thought, is either injured or dead. The first ambulances were allowed on the scene at 10:19. More arrived over the next half-hour. Rodeffer, the battalion chief, pushed crews to move quickly. ""Let's get 'em in ambulances and get 'em on the road,"" he said. Thirteen people went to hospitals. One man drove himself. Five people died at the scene. Several others were in grave condition. As the ambulances sped away and helicopters flew some of the wounded to UMC, the news began to break upon a stunned city and then a horrified nation. Another mass shooting. Except this time, the shooting was at a congresswoman's event. Some of the earliest reports surfaced on National Public Radio. The Internet blasted bulletins. Twitter feeds caught fire. A brief mention on CNN grew into non-stop coverage. The facts were scarce at first. Even as victims were rushed to hospitals, news crews could barely sketch out what had happened. How many shot? How many killed? Then, soon, came the unthinkable. A dispatch presented with a question mark at first. A report said it was true. Soon, other reports cited the first report. The news caught up to anxious friends and relatives seeking word from hospitals. It caught up to worried onlookers. It caught up to a private jet streaking from Houston toward Tucson, carrying a Navy pilot-turned-astronaut, racing to be with his congresswoman wife. The word flashed across the Internet, then the airwaves. Gabrielle Giffords was dead. Chapter 4 coming Tuesday.  Posted  | Updated Advertisement"
31122744,2011-02-07 17:53:06,Hearing for Youngstown suspects postponed a day as investigation of shooting continues,http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2011/02/hearing_for_youngstown_suspect.html,en,True,,1641,cleveland.com,http://www.cleveland.com/,"YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (AP) -- A prosecutor says two suspects in a deadly shooting at an Ohio fraternity house could face additional charges. Youngstown City Prosecutor Jay Macejko  says a court appearance scheduled for the two men Monday morning was delayed until Tuesday. He says police requested the delay because of possible new developments that could lead to more charges. Macejko has declined to say what the new charges could be. A college student was shot to death and 11 people were wounded in the shooting early Sunday. Nineteen-year-old Braylon L. Rogers and 22-year-old Columbus E. Jones Jr. were arrested Sunday on charges of aggravated murder and shooting into a house and 11 counts of felonious assault. Police accuse the men of spraying bullets into partygoers at the Omega Psi Phi frat house near the Youngstown State University campus. At a press conference Sunday afternoon, Youngstown 1st Ward 
Councilwoman Annie Gillam said it's hard to make sense of the tragedy, 
which occurred in her ward of the city.  ""It's a sad day. We need to find a way to make our young people value
 life -- their own and other people's lives and how to deal with 
conflict,"" she said. .' ""People just started pushing each other,"" said YSU freshman DeShaun McDonald.  As the fight escalated, McDonald and a friend decided it was time to 
leave. Before they could exit, the shooter was pushed out of the house, 
only to immediately charge back in. That's when the gunshots began. ""As soon as we begin to move, all I hear, it's just like pow, pow, 
pow, pow, pow. Like, at least 12 or more times,"" McDonald said. * ""I want to express my deepest sympathies to the family of the student who died ..."" ""I have offered to them the use of any and all state resources they 
might require,"" Kasich said. ""I will continue to monitor the situation 
and provide any support necessary to help those impacted by this tragic 
event."" A detective  also said police still are trying to confirm if the shooting was 
related to a fight that took place several hours earlier at the Love 
Lounge bar on West Federal Street. Jaleesa Moore just wanted to celebrate her 20th birthday by going out 
with friends. Now doctors tell her she won't be able to hold her 9-month
old daughter for two months. Moore was one of 12 people shot at the party about 3:30 a.m. Sunday at a house near the YSU campus. Victim Jamail Johnson's Facebook page lists him as a 2005 Liberty 
graduate, Youngstown State University senior and part-time manager at a 
Footlocker store. The 25-year-old was shot in the head and legs when 
gunfire erupted during a party at 3 a.m. at 55 Indiana St. ""There has been an ongoing decline in violent crime in Youngstown, 
Ohio.  But when you have an incident like this, there's no excuse. 
There's nothing you can do to put a pretty picture on it and 
unfortunately it does overshadow the progress we have made,"" Mayor Jay Williams says. Radio personality Lucky Penny says he knew the victim, 25-year-old Jamail Johnson, from seeing him in passing at different events. ""He
 was a good guy. He didn't live that lifestyle; real great guy coming 
from a very good family. Had a lot of future aspirations he wanted to 
do, and it's been cut short,"" he said. * s Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.

Not so, reports Mediaite, but it’s obvious why some people thought so; the interjection of Fuller allegedly saying “You’re dead” was hard to hear during Humphries’ miked-up contribution. Tommy Christopher boosted the audio and bold the preceding text to mark it, and even then it took two passes for me to hear it: TRENT HUMPHRIES: It’s not just gun laws that are standing in the way of this happening. There are all kinds of laws that Congress needs to look at and — and I think there is a time for this debate. But for what we saw and felt right now, I’m not sure that applause and things going on are appropriate right now until we’ve had actually, maybe had the funerals finished for the people that have –that were (sic) suffered and died. My neighbor is one of those people. And — and I loved that man. And — and I want to see — I want to see some introspection maybe from the people before the national debate happens. You know, and those — and — and it’s very well to have those things. But something’s going to have to happen with — with everybody. And — and I just — I mean, it’s — it’s something that where as a country, we talk about political discourse and what’s appropriate and what’s not. I think that — that applies to everybody including the media who’s — who’s — you know, and not in this — this — this has been a very, very cathartic thing for everybody. Immediately after the shooting to see people jump to political angles. I just don’t want to see that right now and I’m a very political person. So I — I would ask that maybe we — we have that discussion and it’s a larger discussion and that — and that we have that just a little bit later. NBC reports that Fuller has been held for involuntary psychiatric screening, as well as on charges of threats, intimidation, and disorderly conduct: A Tucson mass shooting victim was taken into custody Saturday after yelling “you’re dead” at a Tea Party spokesman during the taping of an ABC-TV town hall event hosted by Christianne Amanpour. The Pima County Sheriff’s Office said J. Eric Fuller, 63, was involuntarily committed to an undisclosed medical facility, NBC News reported. The Associated Press said he was undergoing a psychiatric evaluation. He faces charges of threats and intimidation and disorderly conduct, according to Tucson TV station KGUN. … Fuller was in the front row and apparently became upset when Humphries suggested that any conversations about gun control should be delayed until all the dead were buried, KGUN reported. Fuller took a picture of Humphries and shouted, “You’re dead.” Some reports, NBC notes, had Fuller making other remarks, as well as bystanders saying that they became increasingly concerned over his behavior. This is an ironic turn after a week in which conservatives were accused of causing the shooting through supposedly “extreme rhetoric,” but people should resist the temptation to turn Fuller into some sort of poster boy of the Left in response.  He was one of the victims of the January 8th attack, and that would be enough to make anyone angry enough to act a little irrationally in the immediate aftermath.  Hopefully the psychiatric screening will prompt Fuller to seek counseling, or his family to insist on it.  If this week taught us anything, it’s the danger of knee-jerk demonization for political pointscoring.  We have been praying for all of the victims, and we’ll continue to do so for healing to those wounded, including Fuller. Update: Just to clarify, Tommy boosted that part of the audio so that people could hear it more clearly in this clip; he heard it himself clearly when it first happened. I misunderstood what he wrote in his article. Copyright ©2021 HotAir.com/Salem Media. All Rights Reserved."

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. FILE: In this Dec. 22, 2010, photo, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., talks with reporters on Capitol Hill. (AP) WASHINGTON -- If someone admits to a federal official that he's used illegal drugs, that information should be sent to the FBI so that person can be disqualified from purchasing a gun, Sen. Chuck Schumer said Sunday. Noting that the alleged shooter in the Tucson massacre had admitted to military recruiters that he had used drugs on several occasions, Schumer said he is proposing to the Justice Department and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that the military be required to notify federal officials about such admissions. The New York Democrat said such a process does not require new legislation. Jared Lee Loughner is charged with five federal counts in the killing of a federal judge and shooting of Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. The mass shooting January 8 outside a Safeway grocery store resulted in six dead and 13 injured. A military official told Fox News last week that Loughner was rejected from enlisting in the Army in 2008 because he admitted he had used drugs. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because privacy laws prevent the military from disclosing such information about an individual's application. Schumer said if military recruiters or other officials report admissions of drug use to a national database, those individuals could be denied a gun. ""After Jared Loughner was interviewed by the military, he was rejected from the Army because of excessive drug use. Now, by law, by law that's on the books, he should not have been allowed to buy a gun,"" Schumer told NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""But the law doesn't require the military to notify the FBI about that, and in this case they didn't. So I --this morning -- I'm writing the administration and urging that that be done, that the military notify the FBI when someone is rejected from the military for excessive drug use and that be added to the FBI database,"" Schumer said. The issue of limiting Second Amendment rights has exploded in the wake of the Arizona shooting as lawmakers and officials discuss whether increased curbs should be put on gun ownership. Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell said Sunday that a citizen protecting his home or hunting doesn't need a gun with 33 bullets per clip. ""I think the nation's spirits would be lifted if the Congress acted quickly with the president and reinstated the assault weapons ban which also had the ban on these large magazines, these clips that carried 30-plus bullets,"" he said. Rendell, speaking on CBS' ""Meet the Press,"" added that had Loughner earlier been classified as having mental illness, he would never have gotten a gun under provisions established in existing gun control laws. ""Had this man been classified, had he been committed civilly at any time prior to his purchasing the gun from Wal-Mart, he would have in fact been denied access to that firearm,"" Rendell told ""Face the Nation."" Schumer said he is hopeful legislation would move to reinstate the assault weapons ban. But the senator noted that while the mental illness provision had been added to gun laws several years ago -- after a shooting in Long Island in which the gunman had been declared by a court as mentally ill -- Loughner was not on anyone's books because he apparently never received treatment. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who appeared with Rendell, said that some would argue that if more people had been carrying guns, the alleged shooter may not have gotten off as many rounds as he did. But, he added, Loughner apparently suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, which went untreated. ""The most important thing that would have prevented this is if this Loughner had been identified as what he clearly was,"" he said. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., who appeared with Schumer, agreed that the law was not written with a case like Loughner in mind. ""There's a hole in what we need to do. And I'm willing to work with Senator Schumer and anybody else that wants to make sure people who are mentally ill cannot get and use a gun,"" he said.

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: TUCSON, Ariz. — At the Frontier Gun Shop in Tucson, Jim Sharrah figures he can outfit you with a quality handgun or whatever else you need in 20 minutes. As long as you’re a resident of Arizona and at least 21 without an adjudicated history of violence or mental issues, that’s about how long the entire process takes, including the background check. You can walk out with the weapon loaded and tucked inside a coat. “I grew up here,” the affable 68-year-old John Wayne fan said. “Back then, you could get out of school and just go out hunting and shooting.” But since the mass shooting Jan. 8, a new debate has erupted over whether laws such as Arizona’s, which allowed 22-year-old Jared Loughner to buy the 9mm Glock allegedly used in the attack, are too lax. But missing is an understanding of the culture of this southern Arizona community of 1 million people. People here own guns: lots of people — including Giffords, who owned the same model weapon she was shot with. At least two people who helped tend to the wounded and subdue the gunman were carrying concealed handguns. “I’m one of those guys you’re going to have to pry it out of my cold dead fingers,” said Mike Harris, a 64-year-old broker who performed CPR on two victims while he was carrying a concealed pistol. Guns long have been part of the fabric of Tucson society. Even the local ABC affiliate is known as KGUN-TV. But Tucson also is known as a more moderate enclave in the state. In the wake of the Jan. 8 attack, some Tucsonans say there needs to be a new look at how Arizona handles gun laws. “You can carry a gun in a restaurant and bars,” said Cheryl Clark, a 40-year-old financial adviser attending a service for victims of the tragedy. “They’re talking about allowing guns in schools, in the universities, allowing professors and students to carry guns.” For what some would consider a more nuanced view, go no farther than Sharrah’s Frontier Gun Shop, one of 224 licensed gun sellers in Pima County. Sharrah opposes gun control but is serious about safety and advises people to take courses before they buy weapons. He carries a weapon, but he went through state training that used to be required for that. State law now says that anyone who can legally own a gun can carry it concealed without a permit or training, a change Sharrah calls stupid. Mike Harris has similar views. The former Marine drill instructor said he carries a pistol, a habit he picked up after being robbed repeatedly when he owned several steakhouses and carried cash from the day’s receipts. He considers himself a knowledgeable gun owner. Harris arrived at the Safeway lot just moments after the shooting had stopped and the gunman had been detained. “Afterward, my wife said, ‘What would you have done if you’d gotten there earlier?’ ” he said. “I would have killed him.” Harris also noted the suspect could have gotten a gun virtually anywhere he’d wanted to. Anyone who answers an ad placed by an individual offering a gun for sale can make the purchase with no scrutiny at all. Unlike at a gun shop, there’s no background check; not even a check of identification is required. “None at all,” said Thomas Mangan, a spokesman for the Phoenix office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. “If you’re the owner and you sell it, you’re not required to do anything. The same would apply to 100 guns. “It’s like you’re selling a baseball card.” Because of that, there’s no way to estimate reliably how many people in Pima County own guns. Gun rights advocates will tell you that’s the way it should be, that government has no right to impose restrictions on gun ownership. “I think some of the (negative) views that exist of Arizona come from states on the East Coast and West Coast that have created gun laws that are contrary to the Constitution,” said Tommy Rompel, 29, the owner of Black Weapons Armory, a few miles from Sharrah’s shop. “Most of our gun customers believe in being able to protect your home yourself.” Rompel’s shop sells high-end weapons, mostly custom-designed versions of the AR-15 semiautomatic rifle that can be fitted with various components for different appearances. “Like Lego blocks for adults,” he said, standing in his shop with a pistol holstered to his side. He also sells suppressors, or silencers. He said many of his customers want them because they don’t care to wear ear protection when target shooting and because “they’re fun.” Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts As you comment, please be respectful of other commenters and other viewpoints.

Gabrielle Giffords — a tragedy that resulted in the killing of six people and the wounding of 13, including Giffords — a Latina friend sent me an e-mail with an awful confession: “Aren’t you relieved,” she asked, “that it was a white guy and not a Latino? Can you imagine how the (expletive) would have hit the fan if it had been a Latino? OMG.” You might consider this sort of comment crass. But I can assure you that millions of Latinos around the country were thinking the exact same thing. We live at a time when all Latinos — including those who came to the United States legally and whose roots go back five or more generations in the Southwest, or those whose ancestors came from Puerto Rico, Cuba, the Dominican Republic or elsewhere — are presumed to have arrived yesterday and to have come unlawfully. We live at a time when Latino immigrants — whether legal or illegal — are made into scapegoats for everything from street crime to traffic jams to failing schools. Why not a murder spree? The only problem is that the accused gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is neither Latino nor an illegal immigrant. This is homegrown terror. Try telling that to some conservatives, in Arizona and around the country, who jumped to the conclusion that the shooter was an illegal immigrant. That’s what happened in Phoenix within hours of the shooting, according to DeeDee Garcia Blase. She is the president and founder of Somos Republicans, a national organization of Hispanics. The group has taken on as its mission to keep the GOP from saying and doing dumb and destructive things that might further alienate Hispanics. As you can imagine, trying to save the Republican Party from its darker impulses is a full-time job. Blase was attending a meeting of the Maricopa County GOP when she heard the news that Giffords had been shot. “While in shock and in disbelief,” Blase wrote in an op-ed that appeared in The Santa Fe New Mexican. “I heard snickers in the distance and muffled voices asserting that the shooting was probably ‘done by an illegal.’ ” A few days later, a conservative radio host in San Diego shared the same sentiment with listeners. “When I heard the story, I thought it was an illegal alien,” he said, “because there are, like, 100,000 of them in that state.” Actually, no one knows the exact number of illegal immigrants in Arizona, or any other state. Before Gov. Jan Brewer signed the state’s tough immigration law last year, rough estimates were as high as 400,000. Now, demographers claim, many of them have left Arizona for less-hostile places. Later that same day, syndicated radio host Rush Limbaugh put in his two cents. “The American people “… hear of a mass shooting in Arizona, what’s the first thing they think of?” Limbaugh asked. “One of two things: Illegal aliens went wild, or a Muslim terrorist attack. “… Because those are reality.” Actually, it’s not reality. It’s prejudice. There is a difference. Assuming something is so doesn’t make it so. FBI statistics show that from 2005 and 2008, with illegal immigrants streaming into Arizona, violent crimes reported in the state dropped. The nonpartisan Immigration Policy Institute has said that the debate about immigrants and crime overlooks two major points: “Crime rates have already been falling in Arizona for years despite the presence of unauthorized immigrants, and a century’s worth of research has demonstrated that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes or be behind bars than the native-born.” To recap, before we knew who had been arrested for this horrible crime, some Latinos worried that, if the shooter turned out to be one of them, there would an awful backlash against the entire community. When they learned that the suspect wasn’t Latino, they breathed a sigh of relief. But the reprieve was short-lived because, to others, the villain in this story might as well have been Latino and an illegal immigrant to boot. You can’t miss the irony. For the past several days, Republicans have been complaining to anyone who will listen that it was terribly unfair for liberals to go off half-cocked and jump to the conclusion that it was right-wing talk radio and anti-government rhetoric that inspired this tragedy.

Henigan: Our Leaders Must Renounce the Ideology of Political Violence,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dennis-a-henigan/political-leaders-must-re_b_806416.html,en,False,,27502,HuffPost,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/#,"Author, ""Guns Don't Kill People, People Kill People"" and Other Myths About Guns and Gun Control As the nation recoils from the horror of the mass shooting in Arizona, I am struck by a strong sense of terrible inevitability. The cauldron of political violence had been allowed to boil for too long. As it did in 1995 with Timothy McVeigh, at some point violent action was destined to follow the violent talk and the brandishing of guns. It started two summers ago during the red hot public debate over health care, when angry protesters with guns started showing up at presidential events and town hall meetings. A dozen people openly carried guns outside the Phoenix convention center where the president was giving a speech, including one with an AR-15 assault rifle strapped to his back. A New Hampshire man stood outside another presidential appearance on health care reform with a pistol strapped to his thigh. And like a bizarre premonition of yesterday's shooting, in August of 2009 an armed protester actually dropped his handgun at an earlier ""Congress on the Corner"" event with Rep. Giffords, then as now outside a Safeway. And then there was Sharron Angle, who in the midterm elections called for  for ""Second Amendment remedies"" to be used ""when our government becomes tyrannical."" Indeed, openly displayed pistols became commonplace at Tea Party events. Threats of violence were made against supporters of the president, and the windows of Democratic offices were shattered across the nation, including the district offices of Rep. Giffords (apparently by gunshot), all in apparent response to an appeal from a right wing website. A political extremist was intercepted on his way to attack San Francisco's Tides Foundation. During her reelection campaign, Rep. Giffords' Republican opponent exemplified the toxic mix of guns and politics when he held campaign events where he invited his supporters to rally against her by joining him in shooting machine guns. In the wake of the Tucson bloodshed, there has been much commentary already about the incendiary rhetoric and violent imagery that has invaded our political discourse. Those who have so poisoned our politics deserve our derision. But it is not only an issue of rhetoric and imagery. The fact is that the rhetoric springs from an ideology of political violence -- a set of convictions about the relation between citizens and their government -- that has found a home among radical ""gun rights"" zealots. When Sharron Angle spoke of ""Second Amendment remedies,"" they were echoing a core belief of the ""gun rights"" movement, including the leaders of the National Rifle Association, that guns are legitimate tools of political dissent. The NRA often talks of the Second Amendment as the ""First Freedom,"" because it is the potential of an armed populace to take up arms against their political leaders that deters tyranny. In the aftermath of Tucson, it is chilling to recall the words of an NRA official, who told the New York Times some years ago, that ""the Second Amendment... is literally a loaded gun in the hands of the people held to the heads of government."" Or, as NRA Executive Director Wayne LaPierre, told a cheering crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2009, ""Freedom is nothing but dust in the wind till it's guarded by the blue steel and dry powder of a free and armed people... Our founding fathers understood that the guys with the guns make the rules."" Much is yet to be known about the beliefs and motivations of the Tucson killer. But we know for certain what he has done. He targeted a U.S. Congresswoman, who now lies critically wounded, and his attack killed six innocent people, including a federal judge and a nine-year-old child, as well as wounding 13 others. At some level, he felt justified to take up arms against a government official. He sought to ""make his own rules"" with a semi-automatic pistol. The result was mass slaughter. In our republic, the rules are made, not through violence, but through the vigorous discussion of issues between the people and their elected representatives. Ironically, that is what was occurring outside that Tucson Safeway when the gunman struck. He was attacking not just Rep. Giffords and her constituents. He was attacking our cherished tradition of peaceful dissent and democratic decision-making. In hindsight, it seems especially appropriate that, during the recent reading of the Constitution on the House Floor, Rep. Giffords read the First Amendment. The time has come for political leaders of both parties, whether liberal or conservative, to renounce the ideology of political violence. Ideas have consequences. The idea that ""the guys with the guns make the rules"" has inevitable consequences that can no longer be tolerated.

258438036,2011-01-11 14:11:59,Dr. Harold Koplewicz: Treating Mental Illness Before It Kills,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-harold-koplewicz/the-lesson-from-tucson-tr_b_807028.html,en,False,,27502,HuffPost,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/#,"Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist; President, Child Mind Institute In the mass shooting in Arizona Saturday there were heroes who prevented even more bloodshed. We need heroes to intervene before lives are lost. The three people who wrestled Jared Loughner to the ground and disarmed him outside a supermarket in Tucson are being hailed as heroes, and rightly so. They prevented further loss of life at the hands of the 22-year-old, who had, in little more than an instant, killed six people and wounded more than a dozen others, including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. These two men and a 61-year-old woman saw a chance to intercede, and they made the most of it. But there are others in this story who could have, and I believe would have, been heroes if they had the knowledge and tools they needed to stop Jared Loughner's descent into mental illness before it cost the lives of his victims, not to speak of his own life. It's heartbreaking to read the accounts of college students and professors who noticed Loughner's bizarre and frightening behavior, shared their fears with others, but didn't see a way to get Loughner effective help when his downward slide could have been stopped. On the first day of class one student wrote to a friend that another student in the class was so disruptive he scared her. ""Hopefully he will be out of class very soon, and not come back with an automatic weapon."" A week later she wrote, ""We have a seriously disturbed student in the class. They are trying to figure out how to get rid of him before he does something bad, but on the other hand, until he does something bad, you can't do anything about him. Needless to say, I sit by the door."" It's terrible to imagine a student actually sitting by the door of her classroom because she was so afraid of another obviously mentally ill student--and outrageous that it took more than a single day to resolve the situation. In fact, it took three or four weeks before her concerned professor, and others who had Loughner in their classes, were able to have him removed. But they weren't able to get him help. Pima Community College required that Loughner undergo an evaluation if he wanted to reenroll; he refused. What his professors didn't do is acknowledge that he was a risk to both himself and others, and call the police. College administrators, or neighbors, or friends, for that matter, wouldn't look the other way if a young man they knew was bleeding, or going into a diabetic coma. They would immediately dial 911. And the kind of psychotic breakdown Loughner was demonstrating is no less severe, no less demanding of immediate treatment. And it gives no shortage of warning, either. Schizophrenia, if that's what this is--or any of the other psychiatric disorders that can lead to psychosis--doesn't develop overnight. There are warning signs, and those signs didn't prompt the intervention they should have. Why? Because people have little understanding and a lot of fear when it comes to psychiatric disorders. If you're on a subway car and someone faints, or has a seizure, half the people on the car will come to his aid, or call 911, or pull the emergency cord. But if someone is acting delusional or disturbing on a subway car, people will look away, move to the other end of the car, or change to the next car as soon as they can. And mentally ill people, especially those with paranoid delusions, are also at risk of slipping into the alternative universe of the Internet, where all kinds of extreme rants seem to offer evidence for their fantasies. For Loughner this included a radical right-winger who argues that the government uses grammar to control people, and only an alternate ""truth language"" can offer escape. It wouldn't be that surprising if he also gave literal credence to the violent rhetoric that permeates politics these days--especially in Arizona. How many times does this have to happen--think Virginia Tech--before we recognize how pervasive mental illness is in the college-aged population, and cut through legal and emotional barriers to getting treatment as soon as symptoms develop? The first signs of 75 percent of all psychiatric disorders appear by the age of 24. We need a plan for giving mental health care parity with other medical care in terms of access, in terms of quality, and in terms of moral responsibility. Part of what needs to be addressed is stigma--the general fear and unease surrounding psychiatric illness, particularly disorders like schizophrenia. Take, for instance, Steve Kornacki's conclusion on Salon, after evaluating Loughner's political musings: ""My hunch is that Lougnher is just basically crazy, and that his political thinking isn't particularly coherent or organized."" While I can't disagree that his political thinking appears incoherent, what this sentiment misses is that there is no such thing as ""basically crazy."" If Loughner is indeed afflicted with schizophrenia that does not mean that this tragedy had to happen. While the vast majority of people who suffer with schizophrenia are not violent, the disorder can lead to the sort of disastrous violence we saw on Saturday if left untreated. We don't know exactly why this happened, but the truth is that early intervention improves the outlook for anyone with a psychiatric disorder. So what can we do? Reduce stigma through improved education, so both those with a mental illness and the people around them will not hesitate to seek or facilitate treatment. Improve access to the best evidence-based interventions. Praise those who would be heroes by helping someone get the psychiatric care he needs before it becomes a tragedy. Harold S.

The next day, the mass shooting in Tucson happened. That shooter, Jared Lee Loughner, was of questionable mental health and was still able to pass a background check. Despite being too dangerous for college and having been rejected by the army following a failed drug test, Loughner was not considered too dangerous to own a gun in this country. We have spent the past few days tortured by our knowledge of what the Tucson shooting victims and their families are going through. Here is the blog we had written about our own experiences with the failure of our country's gun laws to effectively keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. It could have been - and should have been - impossible for Seung-Hui Cho, the Virginia Tech shooter, to buy his two guns the way he did. He wasn't forced to the ""black market"", but rather, he walked into a gun store and sat down at his computer, cleared two background checks, and easily became armed and dangerous. We learned this truth within days of the tragedy, and by the end of that year, we, dozens of other grieving families, and the Brady Campaign, succeeded in convincing Congress to pass a law to improve some of the weaknesses in the background check system that allowed the events of April 16, 2007 to proceed. Three years ago this month, President George W. Bush signed the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) Improvement Act into law. Now more than one million mental health records belonging to dangerous people who should not be allowed to possess guns are in the background check system. This is a major milestone. It's the kind of progress that needs to happen if we're serious about protecting Americans from gun violence. Cho was a very disturbed young man who had a long history of mental health problems. His final suicidal outburst, which ended the lives of 32 people and injured 17 others, including Colin, shone a harsh spotlight on the serious deficiencies in Virginia's mental health care system and in those of nearly every state and territory of the U.S. Like other states, the Virginia mental health system had been chronically under-funded despite ever-increasing demands and many worthy efforts to improve and enhance it. After the Tech massacre, the Virginia General Assembly took note of the recommendations of the governor's review panel, which had been set up to examine the root causes of the tragedy and put in place new laws and new funding to improve the mental health system. However, circumstances have conspired to limit the effectiveness of those changes. The recession led to back-to-back cuts in state funds for mental health (15 percent in 2009 and again in 2010). This year there could be more cuts, up to 6 percent. The result is that four years after Virginia Tech - the worst school shooting in American history -- Virginia is spending significantly less money on mental health care than it was before the tragedy. On the other hand, Virginia has always been one of the best states for sending disqualifying mental health judgment data to the NICS system and things got even better after Virginia Tech. But the rate at which most other states report mental health disqualification data to the NICS system is still woefully inadequate. When Congress passed the NICS Improvement Act, it hoped to give states a financial incentive to enhance their systems of reporting. Too many states, such as Indiana, had not submitted a single mental health record to NICS. Last fall, nearly $20 million was released for the effort. While there are more than a million records now in the NICS Index, we haven't finished the job. Based on responses from 42 of 56 U.S. states and territories, the National Center for State Courts and SEARCH, the National Consortium for Justice Information and Statistics, estimate that more than 2 million disqualifying mental illness records should be in the NICS Index. Since its passage, the Brady background check system has stopped dangerous people more than 1.9 million times from purchasing guns. But if the majority of people who have been judged to be ineligible to buy guns due to serious mental health problems can still pass background checks because of missing data, that represents a huge hole in the safety net. Can we as a nation accept that a simple clerical procedure stands between increased public safety and us? Mental illness is a disease that needs to be treated. Until it becomes commonplace to make appropriate treatment widely available for people with serious mental health problems, and until we understand that gun ownership requires a level of knowledge, skill and self-control that is beyond the capability of certain individuals, we, very sadly, should not be surprised if more incidents like Virginia Tech keep happening. We Americans seem to celebrate freedom more than responsibility. But the two go hand-in-hand, not just for people who would do us harm, but for every American whose birthright is the ability to raise a voice in political affairs. We may not want to be our brother's keeper, but how many of us want to make it easy for him to be an executioner?

Gabrielle Giffords are devastated and guilt-ridden, a neighbor said, mourning their own tragedy as Tucson residents prepared Tuesday for a community memorial service and a visit from the president. (SCROLL DOWN FOR LIVE UPDATES) Jared Loughner's mother has been in bed, crying nonstop since the shooting rampage on Saturday, neighbor Wayne Smith, 70, told KPHO-TV. Amy and Randy Loughner want to know where they went wrong with their 22-year-old son. The younger Loughner is charged with trying to kill the Democratic lawmaker and killing a federal judge. ""I told them they didn't fail. They taught him everything about right and wrong,"" Smith said. ""We all know you can teach someone everything and have no control how it works out."" Loughner's parents have not appeared publicly or spoken since the incident, but the family released a statement on Tuesday afternoon: ""There are no words that can express how we feel... we don't understand why this happened. We wish we could...change it. We wish that there were, so we could make you feel better. We don't understand why this happened. It may not make any difference, but we wish that we could change the heinous events of Saturday. We care very deeply about the victims and their families. We are so very sorry for their loss."" At University Medical Center, Giffords remained in critical condition, but doctors said she is able to draw breaths on her own. Dr. Michael Lemole, Giffords' neurosurgeon, said, however, that doctors left the breathing tube in Giffords to protect her airway. When asked about swelling in her brain on the third day, which is when it often reaches its peak after an injury, Lemole said a CT scan early Tuesday showed no increase in swelling. But he cautioned that it can sometimes take longer for brain swelling to reach its peak. Click here for more information, or scroll down for the latest updates.

Debra Hughes, a writer who has made Tucson her home, frames the current public debate within the history of Arizona's deeply divided community. The Tucson Shootings: Words and Deeds AN ESSAY by Debra Hughes The night of the mass shooting in Tucson, a downtown art gallery hosted an already scheduled reception for an exhibition, Flesh · Bone · Spirit. The images on display from François Robert's photography series Stop the Violence were of human bones arranged in the shapes of a handgun, grenade, knife, Kalashnikov, fighter jet, and other symbols of violence, all starkly set on black backgrounds. Those images confronted viewers with their own heavy feelings. That morning six people had been killed and thirteen wounded in the shooting rampage at Gabrielle Giffords's political rally at a local Safeway. Jared Lee Loughner had tried to assassinate the Arizona congresswoman, using a Glock 19 semiautomatic pistol and firing thirty-one rounds into the crowd in about fifteen seconds. The shooting took place at a small shopping center in my neighborhood. I wasn't there that morning, though my family and I easily could have been. Our bank is there, along with the stores where we mail our packages, buy pastries, toothpaste, and paper towels, and where we regularly run errands. That morning people had gathered to hear what their state representative had to say. She called the event ""Congress at Your Corner."" In the afternoon, at a press conference addressing the violence, Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik, a seventy-five-year-old with the sagging cheeks and drooping eyes of a bulldog, spoke his mind. ""People tend to pooh-pooh this business about all the vitriol that we hear inflaming the American public by people who make a living off of doing that."" He was alluding to talk-show hosts and politicians who use inflammatory rhetoric, and he added that the effect of their words should not be discounted. ""That may be free speech, but it's not without consequences."" Almost immediately a heated public debate began over whether or not political rhetoric had spurred Jared Lee Loughner to kill. Tucson forensic psychologist Dr. Gary Perrin, a professional familiar with violent crime, was asked if a mentally disturbed person might distort strong messages into a belief that violent acts are noble. Perrin replied, ""In these recent days, and I mean the past few years, rhetoric has increased. Words are powerful, and certainly words can make a [mentally unstable] person act in a certain way."" But he emphasized that violent acts are ""situational, and many things contribute. Words can be one of the factors."" As forensic specialists pieced together the factors that provoked Loughner, the debate about political vitriol flourished. Within a week of the shooting a Google search produced 55 million results about the event, including myriad bloggers arguing over free speech. Steven Colbert, on his Comedy Central TV show, aired a segment entitled ""The Word: Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Angriness,"" in which he deadpanned, ""If incendiary rhetoric isn't connected to the Arizona tragedy, it logically follows that it must be good."" The night before Gabrielle Giffords was shot, she sent an email offering congratulations to Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson, a Republican, after he was named director of Harvard University's Institute of Politics. In it she wrote, ""After you get settled, I would love to talk about what we can do to promote centrism and moderation. I am one of twelve Democrats in a GOP district (the only woman) and we need to figure out how to tone our rhetoric and partisanship down."" Here, in Arizona's Eighth Congressional District, set among picturesque desert scenes of saguaro, mesquite, and towering mountain ranges, factional tensions run high. The district shares a long stretch of borderland with Mexico, and immigration issues get as hot as the summer temperatures. This past year Arizona passed the country's toughest statute on immigration reform. Town Hall meetings have the reputation of turning into cauldrons of polarized debate about other issues as well, such as government spending, health care, and guns. During the past year, Giffords struggled through a brutal reelection campaign in which her opponent appeared in a Web advertisement, holding an assault weapon. Last year Arizona became only the third state that doesn't require a permit to carry a concealed weapon, and people with concealed-weapons permits can take their guns into restaurants and bars if the proprietor allows it. The Tucson shooting and its aftermath are being followed around the world, especially in places where violence is a problem. Venezuelan magazine editor Sergio Dahbar wrote, ""The Giffords shooting is being followed very closely in Latin America because we also have this illness. We have the illness of intolerance."" A well-known maxim from Victor Hugo commenting on unrest in France in the 1830s runs, ""The guilty one is not he who commits the sin, but the one who causes the darkness."" At the University of Arizona's basketball stadium, in the memorial tribute to those who died or were wounded in the shooting, President Obama asked for a return to civility. ""What we can't do is use this tragedy as one more occasion to turn on one another. As we discuss these issues, let each of us do so with a good dose of humility."" Habits are hard to break. Only days after the shooting, Arizona passed laws prohibiting picketing within three hundred feet of any home, cemetery, funeral home, or house of worship before, during, or after a ceremony or burial. As the shooting victims were being laid to rest, a group called Angel Action donned white wings and stood with hundreds of others dressed in white, to shield mourners from potential protests by fanatics, such as the Westboro Baptist Church congregants, who have been disrupting services for US soldiers slain in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Westboro group is emblematic of the flashpoints of opinion and controversy across the land. In the weeks and months ahead, only determined national leadership and conscientious, principled activity and restraint on the part of major media, and on the part of each citizen, can restore humanity and civility to American discourse.

Louie Gohmert says his office is drafting a measure to allow members of Congress to carry guns in the District of Columbia, including in the Capitol and on the House floor. Gohmert says he and his colleagues need to be able to protect themselves, in light of the mass shooting in Arizona. “It’d be a good thing for members of Congress who want to carry a weapon in the District,” he said. “I know friends that walk home from the Capitol. There’s no security for us,” he said, adding that the measure would deter people from attacking members. “There is some protection in having protection.” He said there were times during the health care debate last year that he felt afraid, including when a stranger approached him on the street and started screaming at him. Though Gohmert doesn’t have a concealed weapon permit in Texas, he’s long been a strong advocate for Second Amendment rights. Gohmert said his staff is preparing a draft of the bill now, which he'll circulate among members for input before formally introducing. © 2021 POLITICO LLC"

522178191,2011-01-11 21:50:12,Adam Kissel: UC Berkeley Chancellor Blames Arizona Shooting on 'Hateful Speech',http://www.huffingtonpost.com/adam-kissel/uc-berkeley-chancellor-bl_b_807616.html,en,False,,27502,HuffPost,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/#,"VP at FIRE, thefire.org Yesterday morning, UC Berkeley Chancellor Robert J. Birgeneau e-mailed the campus community with regard to the horrendous mass shooting in Arizona that killed a federal judge, a 9-year-old girl, and several others while gravely injuring Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, the apparent target of the attack. Like many others in the news media and on blogs and Twitter, Birgeneau chose to put the blame for the shooting on the ""climate"" of speech in Arizona, while lamenting what he sees as similar problems at his own institution. The key sentence: ""A climate in which demonization of others goes unchallenged and hateful speech is tolerated can lead to such a tragedy."" The e-mail is produced in whole below: From: Robert J. Birgeneau, Chancellor <CALmessages@berkeley.edu> Date: Mon, Jan 10, 2011 at 10:30 AM Subject: Chancellor Birgeneau comments on Arizona shootings To: ""Staff, All Academic Titles, Other Members of the Campus Community, Deans, Directors, Department Chairs, Students,"" <CALmessages@berkeley.edu> Dear members of our campus community: This weekend's shooting of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and the deaths and injuries of many others in the horrific event in Tucson, Arizona[,] have shocked our nation. We here at UC Berkeley offer our sincere condolences to everyone who has been personally affected by this tragedy. Such a brutal and violent attack on an individual who has devoted herself to public service is deeply regrettable. It calls upon us as an academic community to stop and ponder the climate in which such an act can be contemplated, even by a mind that is profoundly disturbed. A climate in which demonization of others goes unchallenged and hateful speech is tolerated can lead to such a tragedy. I believe that it is not a coincidence that this calamity has occurred in a state which has legislated discrimination against undocumented persons. This same mean-spirited xenophobia played a major role in the defeat of the Dream Act by our legislators in Washington, leaving many exceptionally talented and deserving young people, including our own undocumented students, painfully in limbo with regard to their futures in this country. On our own campus, and throughout all the campuses of the University of California, we must continue to work toward a climate of equity and inclusion for all. We must be vigilant to condemn hate speech and acts of vandalism on our campuses by those wanting to promote enmity. We must work to support dialogue about our differences and eschew expressions of demonization of others, including virulent attacks on Israel, anti-Muslim graffiti, racism towards African-Americans, Chicano/Latinos and other underrepresented minority groups, and homophobic acts. Continuing to support our principles of community will ensure a better and safer campus. We must do this now so that our students, as future leaders of this great country, will continue to set the standard for a better and safer nation. Robert J. Birgeneau Chancellor, UC Berkeley Chancellor Birgeneau's e-mail is very ill-considered for a variety of reasons. First of all, there is so far no evidence that a ""climate of demonization,"" ""mean-spririted xenophobia,"" or ""hateful speech"" had anything to do with alleged killer Jared Loughner's apparent decision to try to assassinate Giffords and kill or injure many others. The supposition that political expression created a climate that led Loughner to his choice is an idea that seems to have sprung from whole cloth out of the minds of people who likely were upset beforehand about ""rhetoric"" and ""hateful"" speech, including, apparently, Chancellor Birgeneau. Nevertheless, it has quickly become the driving force in the national discussion about the shooting. In the United States, ""hateful speech"" is tolerated consistently in public forums nationwide--including public universities--because the First Amendment demands that the government tolerate virtually all speech. By itself, ""hateful speech"" cannot be punished by UC Berkeley, a public institution bound by the First Amendment. In fact, the Supreme Court has stated that free speech ""may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people to anger."" Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 4 (1949). One of the primary reasons for this tolerance is that there is not and cannot be widespread agreement on what speech is ""hateful"" and therefore undeserving of Constitutional protection. An excellent example of this disagreement is found in Birgeneau's own e-mail: I believe that it is not a coincidence that this calamity has occurred in a state which has legislated discrimination against undocumented persons. This same mean-spirited xenophobia played a major role in the defeat of the Dream Act by our legislators in Washington, leaving many exceptionally talented and deserving young people, including our own undocumented students, painfully in limbo with regard to their futures in this country. The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE, where I work), of course, has no position whatsoever on the proposed federal DREAM Act or any state legislation regarding immigration in Arizona--FIRE is nonpartisan. But we do know that reasonable people in a democratic society take a variety of reasoned positions for and against legislation for a wide variety of reasons, not just ""mean-spirited xenophobia."" Finally, Birgeneau's e-mail, if taken to its logical conclusion, seems to imply that minority groups and undocumented students at UC Berkeley might become violent if people in the campus community do not support the DREAM Act and if other examples of ""hateful speech"" go unchallenged on campus. While he avoids an outright call for censorship of certain opinions--such as opposition to the DREAM Act--he makes it clear that he would not be surprised if the voicing of these opinions led to another incident like that in Arizona. Birgenau thus implies that such expression is therefore both morally wrong and likely to endanger people's lives through its very utterance. It is within the Chancellor's rights to officially encourage people at Berkeley to act and speak in accordance with the university's officially sponsored moral principles. Yet, does the Chancellor really think students on his campus are so fragile, psychologically weak, and prone to violence that the campus is less ""safe"" when they see mean graffiti, experience racism, or hear ""virulent"" language against Israel? Even if someone on campus is truly so unstable and unsafe--a possibility in any institution as large as UC Berkeley--taking the steps necessary to ensure that such a person is never ""set off"" by speech he or she finds offensive would result in a campus that one would not even recognize as a part of America. Adopting the logical if unstated conclusion of the Chancellor's argument here (as some lawmakers and commentators appear to be ready to do) would result in the imposition of a variation on the ""heckler's veto,"" where the most violent person in the community gets to decide who may speak and what they may say, on threat of violence. As UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh wrote yesterday for The Volokh Conspiracy, there is no First Amendment exception that would leave speech unprotected when ""the concern is simply that a few kooks or extremists might be moved to commit a crime at some indefinite time as a result of seeing the speech."" If we are to have a free society, the boundaries of acceptable speech must not be determined by what might spark the murderous rage of the craziest and/or most violent person.

499498326,2011-01-12 07:00:00,Sarah Palin's 'blood libel' comment overshadows a calibrated message,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/12/AR2011011202145.html,en,False,,2,Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com," Sarah Palin's statement Wednesday in response to the Tucson shootings, in which she has found herself at the center of a debate over civility in political discourse, was crafted as both a defense of her own actions and a strike against her critics - but reaction to the statement was dominated by a fresh controversy over her use of the phrase ""blood libel."" With the exception of those words, the former Alaska governor's statement was remarkable for its careful calibration - replete with references to ""the greatness of our country"" and other rhetoric likely to resonate with her base. It was also notable that Palin, known for her often-controversial impromptu tweets, waited four days after the shootings and then released a professionally produced, polished seven-minute video in which she read from a script. Palin spoke of the ""enduring strength of our Republic,"" described the Constitution as a ""sacred charter of liberty"" and referred to the ""genius"" of the founding fathers. ""America must be stronger than the evil we saw displayed last week,"" she said. ""We are better than the mindless finger-pointing we endured in the wake of the tragedy."" In Palin's version of events, her controversial actions represented common cause with Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), who a few days before being critically wounded in the mass shooting had read the First Amendment on the House floor. ""Acts of monstrous criminality stand on their own,"" Palin said in the statement. ""They begin and end with the criminals who commit them, not collectively with all the citizens of a state, not with those who listen to talk radio, not with maps of swing districts used by both sides of the aisle, not with law-abiding citizens who respectfully exercise their First Amendment rights at campaign rallies, not with those who proudly voted in the last election."" She went on to say: ""Within hours of a tragedy unfolding, journalists and pundits should not manufacture a blood libel that serves only to incite the very hatred and violence they purport to condemn. That is reprehensible."" It is not at all clear that Palin intended to use the term ""blood libel"" in its full historical context. The phrase refers to a centuries-old anti-Semitic slander - the false charge that Jews use the blood of Christian children for rituals - that has been used as an excuse for persecution. The phrase was first used in connection with response to the Arizona shootings in an opinion piece in Monday's Wall Street Journal and has been picked up by others on the right. While Palin did not explain her decision to use such historically fraught imagery, it would be recognized by religious voters, including the social conservatives who constitute such an important part of her following. Palin has come under criticism because a map on her Web site during the midterm elections showed districts of congressional Democrats she had targeted for defeat marked with cross hairs. Giffords, whose district was one of those 20, had publicly complained that this was an invitation to violence. There is no evidence at this point that the suspected gunman, Jared Loughner, was influenced by Palin or any other political figure. Tim Crawford, the treasurer for Palin's political action committee, said Palin is ""her own best spokesperson and she wanted to talk about this."" ""The reason we did the video was we wanted the statement in total out there. We wanted the video to be seen in its entirety,"" he said."

30763009,2011-01-31 14:00:00,Tracks of their tears: Real men do cry in public,http://www.ocregister.com/articles/crying-286186-says-tears.html,en,True,"politics and government,united states politics and government,elections,television,football,super bowl",25,Orange County Register,http://www.ocregister.com/,"Trending:  On election night in November, Rep. John Boehner fights back tears while recalling his modest upbringing as the son of a tavern owner and one of 12 children. Boehner stood to become the Speaker of the House of Representatives as the Republicans gained their majority. Boehner has said those who know him well know he cries, but on election night the rest of the nation was getting its first taste of the salt on his cheeks.  When it comes to crying in public, athletes seem to have enjoyed more freedom to express themselves than other tough guys. Here Iker Casillas, captain of Spain's national soccer team, celebrates victory over the Netherlands at the 2010 FIFA World Cup finals match in South Africa. ""The motivation is 'we gotta win.' We're not talking about amateur athletics here, where it's give it your best shot,"" says sports psychologist Darrell Burnett of Laguna Niguel. ""Jobs might be on the line. There's got to be a lot of stress no matter how much training you put yourself through.""  Dick Vermeil, shown here hugging his wife after his last game as coach of the Kansas City Chiefs in 2006, cried on camera during his NFL days.""He was notorious for crying in public,"" says sports psychologist Darrell Burnett of Laguna Niguel. ""At that time it was kind of seen as, well, he's a nice old guy. It wasn't seen as much. Now it's kind of an emotional moment when it happens.""  It's OK to cry when you win, as golfer Tiger Woods does here in 2005 during presentation of the green jacket that goes to the winner of The Masters at Augusta National Golf Club.  It's OK to cry when you are saying goodbye to your sport and to your fans, as tennis star Andre Agassi does here after his last tournament, the U.S. Open in 2006. The crowd showered Agassi with an eight-minute ovation.  It's also OK to cry when your jersey is being retired, as former baseball player Frank Thomas does when the Chicago White Sox retire his number 35 at a ceremony last year.  It doesn't go over so well when you cry in defeat, as tennis phenom Roger Federer of Switzerland does here after losing the 2009 Australian Open to Rafael Nadal of Spain. But then again, Federer also cries when he wins, as he did a year later at the same venue when he defeated Britain's Andy Murray in the 2010 Australian Open final. Murray shed his own tears, saying to British fans as he wiped his eyes, ""Sorry I couldn't do it for you tonight. I can cry like Roger, it's just a shame I can't play like him.""  Who can forget college star Adam Morrison's face-on-the-floor crying after his favored Gonzaga team was beaten in the last seconds by UCLA in the regional semifinals of the 2006 NCAA Tournament? Labeled a cry baby, Morrison filmed a 30-second NBA Live spot in 2007 that addressed his crying on national TV. ""So what? Failure hurts,"" he says in the edgy, black-and-white commercial that shows him shooting baskets by himself on an outdoor court. ""In that moment, winning was everything. ... I'll cry again. I hope I never lose that intensity.""  Tears streamed down the face of Pittsburgh Steelers receiver Hines Ward after his team won Super Bowl XLIII in 2009. The Steelers and Ward will be trying for another victory Sunday against the Green Bay Packers. If they win, will it be as emotional for Ward?  Actor Jamie Foxx, shown at the Academy Awards in 2005, tearfully accepts his Oscar for Best Actor in the movie ""Ray."" During the long, dry spell when it was taboo for American men to cry in public -- roughly the latter half of the 19th century and most of the 20th -- actors still shed tears on screen. Clark Gable's crying scene in ""Gone With the Wind"" in 1939 is one famous example, even if Gable, considered a man's man, was reluctant to do it. He thought crying was not masculine and the scene would hurt his career. In more recent times, male entertainers have felt free to cry off screen as well, especially at award shows.  The emotion that comes with being named best actor was even too much for rugged American film icon John Wayne. The Duke, best known for his tough-as-leather roles in Westerns and  war movies, appears to wipe at a tear as Barbra Streisand, who presented him with his Oscar, looks on at the 1970 Academy Awards. He was nominated twice for best actor in a career that spanned six decades. He finally won for his portrayal of Rooster Cogburn in ""True Grit,"" a role that has also earned Jeff Bridges an Oscar nomination this year for his performance in the remake.  At another widely viewed news conference that evolved around a popular figure caught in a bad situation, Los Angeles Lakers superstar Kobe Bryant cries in July of 2003 while insisting he is innocent of charges that he sexually assaulted a 19-year-old Colorado woman. He also said he was ""disgusted at myself for making the mistake of adultery."" His wife Vanessa sits by his side, holding his hand. The charges were dismissed a year later, and an undisclosed settlement was reached with the alleged victim in a civil lawsuit.  Public confessions of wrongdoing have produced tears from men in prominent positions. In a 2009 photo, South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford wipes tears from his eyes at a news conference during which he admitted to an extramarital affair. His wife was pointedly absent from his side. Jenny Sanford later divorced him.  Never one to hold back tears, FOX News and radio talk-show personality Glenn Beck gets ready to cry during a moment with faith leaders at the ""Restoring Faith"" rally held in August in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. To some, his readiness toward tears defines how deeply he holds his convictions, while critics have called his crying ""fake"" and ""creepy.""  John Boehner wipes away tears as he waits to receive the gavel from outgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Jan. 5. By then, Boehner's tears had become the subject of much public discussion thanks to previous displays of emotion on election night and during a ""60 Minutes"" interview. Tom Lutz, author of the book ""Crying: The Natural and Cultural History of Tears,"" says part of the intense discussion over Boehner's tears has to do with his seeming tendency to cry when talking about his own rags-to-riches story and with the demonstrative way he cries. ""There's something about the wiggling lips and the kind of concentration on his face where he seems to be trying hard not to cry,"" Lutz says.  It wasn't all that long ago when tears could derail political ambitions. Sen. Edmund Muskie's infamous moment in the New Hampshire snow killed his bid to become the 1972 Democratic nominee for president. Muskie had called a press conference outside the building of the conservative Union Leader newspaper to defend his wife over what he said were attacks against her character in the conservative publication. Muskie wiped at his eye during his emotional comments, leading to reports that he had cried. Muskie always maintained that it was snow, not tears.  President Bill Clinton was photographed multiple times in teary moments during his administration. ""Clinton is the guy who brought weeping back into style in politics,"" says Tom Lutz, author of ""Crying: The Natural and Cultural History of Tears."" Here he wipes away a tear at the 1997 memorial service for the late Commerce Secretary Ron Brown. Clinton's emotions at this moment weren't questioned. But he was skewered for what happened as he left the service: He appeared to switch in an instant from a lighthearted mood when he noticed a camera on him, bowing his head and wiping at his eyes. Conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh had a field day, calling it ""the best illustration of the fake and phony characteristics of this man.""  President George W. Bush could not hold back tears when presenting a posthumous Medal of Honor in 2008 to the parents of Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael Monsoor, a Navy SEAL from Garden Grove. How the public reacts to prominent men who cry in public depends on the context, says Tom Lutz, author of the 1999 book ""Crying: The Natural and Cultural History of Tears"" and chairman of creative writing at UC Riverside. ""Men are allowed to feel things for other people strongly enough in public, but not allowed to feel things strongly enough about themselves to cry in public.""  President Barack Obama, criticized by some for not showing enough emotion when engaging with the public, teared up when he spoke Jan. 12 at the ""Together We Thrive: Tucson and America"" gathering in Arizona to honor the victims of the mass shooting that had occurred four days earlier.  Obama wipes away tears that are more personal as he speaks about his grandmother during a 2008 campaign rally in North Carolina. Madelyn Dunham, who had a long battle with cancer, died just hours before her grandson was elected president. Obama told the crowd: ""Some of you heard that my grandmother who helped raise me passed away early this morning. I'm not going to talk about it too long because it's hard for me to talk about.""  Cameras found The Rev. Jesse Jackson weeping in the massive crowd gathered at Chicago's Grant Park on the night Barack Obama was elected president. Jackson had hoped to become the nation's first African American president when he sought the Democratic nomination in 1984. Questions were raised about his election-night tears: Was he crying because he was moved by the historical significance of Obama's election, or was Jackson wishing he was the one headed to the White House? During the campaign, Jackson was taped making crude remarks about Obama. But by way of explaining his tears, he said in part during an interview with National Public Radio, ""Well, on the one hand, I saw President Barack Obama standing there looking so majestic ... And if I had one wish: If Medgar (Evers), or if Dr. King could have just been there for a second in time, would have made my heart rejoice. And so it was kind of duo-fold -- his ascension into leadership and the price that was paid to get him there.""  While men in public office can cry, depending on the circumstances, women who hold or aspire to positions of power are treated differently. Consider the flap when then-Sen. Hillary Clinton choked back tears the day before the New Hampshire presidential primary in 2008. Some said it humanized her, others said she was being manipulative. ""Men seem to have a slight advantage -- the 'he had a darn good reason effect',"" says Penn State researcher Stephanie Shields, who co-authored a study on how men and women perceive tears.  Hillary Clinton's brush with tears during the 2008 presidential campaign didn't cause her anywhere near the grief that Rep. Pat Schroeder of Colorado faced after she tearfully announced that she was backing out of a bid for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination. Schroeder was criticized for being too emotional. Twenty years made a big difference in how Clinton's tears were perceived. ""From certain political quarters where she was vilified for being 'mannish' it humanized her. She was not attacked the way Pat Schroeder was when she cried,"" says Tom Lutz, author of ""Crying: The Natural and Cultural History of Tears.""  CBS news anchor Walter Cronkite, considered in his day the ""Most Trusted Man in America,"" fought hard to compose himself on the air after he announced the official confirmation of President John F. Kennedy's death in 1963. Decades later, the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, marked what researchers Stephanie Shields and Leah Warner call a ""sea change"" in our acceptance of journalists and other men weeping on TV in the face of tragedy. ""It kind of legitimized crying in public as coming from the heart,"" says Shields, a professor of psychology and women's studies at Penn State who co-authored with Warner a study on the perception of crying in men and women.  Jeff Bridges won his first best actor Oscar last year, playing a rough-and-tumble country singer in ""Crazy Heart."" In an interview filmed backstage after his acceptance speech, Bridges cried while speaking of what the award would mean to his father, actor Lloyd Bridges. Are more tears in store if he wins again this year?  What are the odds that some big hunk of a man will be reduced to tears in front of millions of TV viewers when his team wins the Super Bowl? Or when his team loses? It seems like a sure bet with so many men – in sports, in politics, in entertainment – crying openly these days. Speaker of the House John Boehner‘s tears have washed over the nation in waves: on election night; a few weeks later on “60 Minutes” with interviewer Lesley Stahl; when he accepted the gavel from Nancy Pelosi as the leader of Congress. He also cried a few days after the mass shooting in Tucson, during remarks on the floor of the House condemning the attack and praising the victims. Boehner has been praised and pummeled for showing his emotions so profusely. Stahl said she thought “people are going to like him” in reaction to what she described as his “full-bore crying.” But Jon Stewart spoofed him on “The Daily Show.” Somewhere in the middle, Sean Hannity sympathized while wishing he’d stop. So is it OK for men in the public eye to openly cry? Perhaps more OK than for women in power? Tom Lutz, author of the 1999 book “Crying: The Natural and Cultural History of Tears,” gets asked these questions whenever someone famous cries in public. “Oh God, it’s amazing,” he says of Boehner. Lutz wrote a Dec. 15 Los Angeles Times op-ed piece about what the House speaker’s tears might tell us about the contradictions inherent in crying. But Boehner is not the biggest crier in the history of American men who dare to weep. Take Abraham Lincoln, for example. Lutz says it wasn’t unusual for men in other eras to cry in public. In the 18th century, it was not only acceptable, but expected: “If you didn’t cry at the theater or didn’t cry at the opera, it meant that you were some kind of lower class boor.” In the 19th century, crying marked the skill of orators such as Lincoln and presidential opponent Stephen A. Douglas, says Lutz, who is the chairman of creative writing at UC Riverside. “Lincoln cried at the right moments in his speeches. So did Douglas.” The increasing demand of the industrial revolution for efficiency in the workplace left no room for expressing emotion, pretty much drying up men’s tears in the latter half of the 19th century and through most of the 20th, Lutz says. Sen. Edmund S. Muskie lost his bid to be the Democratic presidential nominee in 1972 because he appeared to cry at a news conference in New Hampshire while defending his wife against what he considered attacks on her character. To no avail, he maintained that it was melting snow, not tears, he wiped from his cheeks during the outdoors gathering. Then, with a trickle, the man-tears began to flow again. It became downright presidential to become teary-eyed, from Ronald Reagan to Bill Clinton to George W. Bush to Barack Obama, at moments of solemnity and tragedy. In sports, men are seen crying for less grave, and more personal, reasons. Emotional displays after victory or defeat are understandable, given the pressure to win and the investment that athletes make to that end, says Darrell Burnett, a clinical and sports psychologist in Laguna Niguel who is also on the Little League International Board of Directors. “I think if a guy cries it’s because he can’t control it. It was just too much for him,” Burnett says. Athletes who have famously cried over the heartbreak of defeat include tennis players Roger Federer after losing the 2009 Australian Open and Andy Murray when he was defeated by Federer a year later in Australia; basketball player Adam Morrison, late of the Los Angeles Lakers, when UCLA defeated Gonzaga in the last seconds of a 2006 NCAA Tournament game; and quarterback Tim Tebow when his Florida Gators lost the SEC championship in 2009. Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler reportedly teared up in the locker room following his team’s loss last week in the NFC Championship game after hearing he was being called a quitter. Too much bawling after a loss can look like bad sportsmanship, Burnett points out: “The tear that comes from victory appears much more humbling than the tear that comes from losing.” More recently, the floodgates have opened for men in other walks of life. Stephanie Shields and Leah Warner, authors of a much-cited study on the perception of crying in men and women, say 9/11 marked a real shift, when journalists, politicians, public servants and Joe Citizen wept in front of cameras. “Those tears were so clearly genuine and so clearly about something profound and important, it kind of legitimized crying in public as coming from the heart,” says Shields, a professor of psychology and women’s studies at Penn State. Shields and Warner, a researcher at Ramapo College of New Jersey, determined in their study that how crying is perceived depends on three things: what the crying is about, who is crying, and how they are crying. People react more positively if the tears are “not for a mistake you made but for something really big, like a tragedy,” Shields says. And there’s more sympathy for tearing up than openly weeping, she adds. Unless, it’s a woman crying. Consider the flap over Hillary Rodham Clinton choking up on the 2008 presidential campaign trail in New Hampshire. Heartfelt or manipulative? Was she being human or hormonal? “When (a man) cries, it must have been something important to get him to that point,” Warner says the thinking goes. “But when women cry, oh, it’s Tuesday again.” Women, Lutz says, are still bucking the notion that “somehow they are not up to X, Y and Z – sending troops into battle, doing the traditional kind of male activities. They have to fight to not do too much traditionally feminine behavior.” So if Sarah Palin were to cry on camera, that would be another big one for Lutz. “I will get a lot of calls the day she weeps.” See our slide show for more on men who cry in public.

(Pima County Sheriff's Office) If the gunman in Saturday’s mass shooting had sought mental health treatment years ago, doctors could have been able to work out his problems before he allegedly unleashed terror on the crowd outside a Safeway in southern Arizona, a top state health official told FoxNews.com on Monday. But that early intervention likely never happened. Though colleagues and acquaintances expressed concern, particularly over the past year, about Jared Lee Loughner’s mental state, no evidence has yet emerged showing he sought treatment. Pima Community College effectively kicked Loughner off campus last September after a series of disruptions and told him that if he ever wanted to return he’d need a “mental health clearance” from a professional saying he did not present a danger. Loughner never returned with the document. Dr. Laura Nelson, deputy director for behavioral health at the Arizona Department of Health Services, told FoxNews.com the state has no record of Loughner, 22, seeking mental health treatment in the public system. “I truly believe that it could have (helped),” Nelson said. Loughner also reportedly did not seek help in the Pima County system. Now that six people are dead and 14 wounded in the wake of Saturday’s shooting, experts and officials and acquaintances say Loughner clearly had mental health issues that should have been addressed. Personal accounts and public records suggest that Loughner’s behavioral problems didn’t start to surface until his late teenage years. He was in concert band and jazz band before dropping out of high school in 2006. He liked rock music. And home life may not have been so bad -- while little is known about his father other than his proclivity for bickering with neighbors, Loughner’s mother was a loyal employee with the local parks department who had been on staff since 1987. Then something about Jared Loughner changed. Nelson, while careful not to offer a diagnosis of Loughner, described in general terms a mental illness profile that would sound familiar to anyone following Loughner’s case. The doctor said that schizophrenia, as well as bipolar disorder, often stay dormant until the college years. “Many times, more serious mental illnesses will become much more evident in the late teenage years, early adulthood,” she said. For schizophrenia patients, she said, they may be predisposed to the illness but not ’t show it until the symptoms are set off by a “trigger.” That could be a traumatic event or substance abuse, including the use of marijuana – a drug Loughner apparently used quite a bit. The symptoms, Nelson said, are hallucinations, paranoia, “losing touch with reality” and becoming “socially withdrawn.” Nelson said mental illness alone typically does not make people violent. But she said substance abuse can contribute and that people who have “anti-social behavioral tendencies could be prone to violence.” Though Loughner had friends in high school, neighbors who had fleeting contact with him over the last few years said he kept to himself. He would walk his dog around the neighborhood but not respond to others. A portrait of Loughner’s home life is still emerging. Anthony Woods, a teenager who lives next door, said Loughner’s father would argue a lot with neighbors over trivial matters. But his mother, Amy, was apparently a nature lover. She started out with Pima County’s Parks and Recreation Department as a maintenance worker nearly 25 years ago and later became a horticulturist. Most recently she was employed as a park manager for the Agua Caliente Park, supervising staff and tending to the 101-acre park described online as an “oasis in the desert.” “She’s been with us a long time,” Pima County Human Resources Director Gwyn Hatcher told FoxNews.com. Dr. Keith Ablow, a psychiatrist and member of the Fox News Medical A-Team, said Jared Loughner appeared “psychiatrically ill” and should have been admitted to a psychiatric unit. Now that six people are dead, including a federal judge and a 9-year-old girl, and Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., is suffering from a traumatic gunshot wound to the head, few in Tucson have any sympathy for Loughner. In a small coffee shop up the street from Loughner’s house on Monday, customers chatted passionately about the need for justice in the case. One expressed concern that the insanity defense would be used. Nelson said a lesson can still be drawn from all of this. She said teachers, family members, health professionals, members of the clergy and others must be cognizant of the signs of mental illness and encourage anyone showing those signs to seek help. “People really can get better,” she said.

(AP) The suspect in Saturday's deadly rampage purchased a firearm legally after passing an FBI background check, the company's vice president of hunting operations told FoxNews.com on Sunday. Jared Lee Loughner, a 22-year-old man with a troubled past who law enforcement say may have been influenced by American Renaissance, a pro-white publication, bought the gun from Sportsman's Warehouse's Tucson store in November. Loughner, accused of killing six people, shooting Arizona Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and wounding 13 others, did not present a concealed weapons permit so he was required to pass an FBI background check. He did so""immediately and without incident,"" said Matt French, speaking from the Sportsman's Warehouse's Utah headquarters. ""To my knowledge, the firearm purchase was without incident,"" French said. French could not confirm whether the gun purchased in November was the same gun allegedly used in Saturday's mass shooting, for which Loughner so far has been charged with five counts  of murder and attempted murder. However, he said it was the only recent firearm purchase made by the suspect at their stores. ""Sportsman's Warehouse is cooperating fully with the authorities in investigating this horrible tragedy,"" he said. ""Our sincere condolences go to those affected by this unspeakable incident."" New details are emerging about Loughner as a law enforcement memo based on information provided by the Department of Homeland Security and obtained by Fox News suggests he may have ties to the American Renaissance group, though it's unclear if he was directly affiliated with the publication or group. The Southern Poverty Law Center describes the group as ""white nationalist"" whose leader, Jared Taylor, is ""a kind of modern-day version of the refined but racist colonialist of old."" The memo states that there is ""no direct connection"" between Loughner and the group, ""but strong suspicion is being directed at AmRen / American Renaissance. Suspect is possibly linked to this group. (through videos posted on his MySpace and YouTube account.). The group's ideology is anti-government, anti-immigration, anti-ZOG (Zionist Occupational Government), anti-Semitic."" The memo also includes information about the suspect's mother, who works for the Pima County Board of Supervisors and notes that Loughner has multiple arrests but no criminal record. But Taylor, a 1973 graduate in philosophy from Yale University, told Fox News on Sunday that he had never heard of Loughner until Saturday and has checked the group's records going back 20 years and has not found any subscriptions for Loughner to American Renaissance publications. He added he has no indication that Loughner ever attended any of the group's events, which have been held on the East Coast where the organization is based. Taylor also denied references to the group as being ""anti-ZOG."" ""That is complete nonsense,"" he said. ""I have absolutely no idea what DHS is talking about. We have never used the term 'ZOG.' We have never thought in those terms. If this is the level of research we are getting from DHS, then heaven help us,"" he said. Loughner lives with his parents in a Tucson neighborhood that one neighbor described as part of an area that is notorious for ""stash houses"" for Mexican gangs to bring drugs into the U.S. and store them. The neighbor, who asked only to be identified as Jon, said he volunteered at a phone bank for Giffords' 2008 congressional campaign. He said none of the neighbors seem to know any member of the Loughner household, which on Sunday was cordoned off. Two run-down jalopies outside the house along with a front walkway littered with empty paint buckets and a garden hose blocked the walkway and door while the entire front yard is covered in a tangled cactus tree. Nothing like this has ever happened in this neighborhood. ""We've had a number of good DEA busts,"" Jon said. ""It's a shock, it really is. ... It's sad, it's been a sad day."" Another neighbor directly across from the home also did not want to give his name, but said a mother, son and father live at the house. ""They weren't real friendly,"" said the neighbor who described himself as 60 and retired. They mostly didn't talk to anyone and mainly stayed inside. ""Loners,"" he called them. Another neighbor, Anthony Woods, who was three years behind Loughner in school, said the father in the household was argumentative. Woods said the dad would complain about everything from neighbors' trash cans on the street to standing too close to his property by the fence. Woods said law enforcement interviewed the mother and father at the Loughner house Saturday night. ""They confiscated a lot of things"" from the house, he said. Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik said Saturday that Loughner had ""a troubled past."" ""I'm not a psychiatrist so I have no reason to believe the person was insane. Was he unstable? I would agree with that,"" he said. Loughner was kicked out of Pima Community College following a series of run-ins with school officials and police at the colleges where he frequently caused disruptions in classrooms and elsewhere on campus, according to The Arizona Republic. The tensions with school officials led to Loughner's production of a YouTube video in which he declared the college illegal, the newspaper reports. The college said Loughner could only return if he received mental-health clearance, according to The Arizona Republic. Loughner is suspected of posting a series of YouTube videos that show a focus on literacy and currency -- as well as his distrust in the government. ""Hello, my name is Jared Lee Loughner,"" one of the videos says, in words appearing on the screen. ""This video is my introduction to you! My favorite activity is conscience dreaming; the greatest inspiration for my political business information. Some of you don't dream -- sadly."" The video, posted Dec. 15, later turns more political. ""The majority of citizens in the United States of America have never read the United States of America's Constitution. You don't have to accept the federalist laws,"" the video's titles say. ""In conclusion, reading the second United States Constitution, I can't trust the current government because of the ratifications: the government is implying mind control and brainwash on the people by controlling grammar. No! I won't pay debt with a currency that's not backed by gold and silver! No! I won't trust in god!"" Loughner's last writing on his MySpace page was just hours before the shooting. ""Goodbye friends,"" he wrote. ""Please don't be mad at me."" Loughner was rejected from enlistment in the U.S. Army because he failed the Army urinalysis, a military official told Fox News. Records obtained from the Pima County, Ariz., criminal database also show Loughner was arrested in 2007 for possessing drug paraphernalia, a misdemeanor charge. The records suggest that Loughner paid a $20 fee and completed a court-ordered program for drug offenders. Three months later he was cited for running a stop sign, according to court documents. Another record shows a 2008 arrest for what’s described as a ""local charge"" in Marana, Ariz., 20 miles northwest of Tucson. The non-criminal charge was dismissed. FBI Director Robert Mueller said that the gun used in Saturday's massacre was a Glock semi-automatic 9-mm. gun with extended magazine.

Gabrielle Giffords and killing six people at a political event in Arizona. Investigators said they carried out a search warrant at Jared Loughner's home and seized an envelope from a safe with messages such as ""I planned ahead,"" ''My assassination"" and the name ""Giffords"" next to what appears to be the man's signature. He allegedly purchased the Glock pistol used in the attack in November at Sportsman's Warehouse in Tucson. Court documents also show that Loughner had contact with Giffords in the past. Other evidence included a letter addressed to him from Giffords' congressional stationery in which she thanked him for attending a ""Congress on your Corner"" event at a mall in Tucson in 2007. Heather Williams, the first assistant federal public defender in Arizona, says the 22-year-old suspect doesn't yet have a lawyer, but that her office is working to get a lawyer appointed for Loughner. Meanwhile, authorities released 911 calls in which a person witnessing the mass shooting outside a grocery store in Tucson describes a frantic scene and says, ""I do believe Gabby Giffords was hit."" Loughner, 22, is accused of killing six people, including a federal judge, an aide to Giffords and a 9-year-old girl who was born on Sept. 11, 2001. Fourteen others were wounded, including the three-term Democrat lawmaker. Authorities don't know his motive, but said he targeted Giffords at a public gathering around 10 a.m. Saturday outside a busy Tucson supermarket. Doctors treating the Democrat provided an optimistic update about her chances for survival, saying they are ""very, very encouraged"" by her ability to respond to simple commands along with their success in controlling her bleeding.

""He was not more than three or four feet from the congresswoman and the district director,"" Kimble said, describing the scene as ""just complete chaos, people screaming, crying."" Mourners crammed into the tiny sanctuary of Giffords' synagogue in Tucson to pray that she quickly recover. Outside the hospital, candles flickered at a makeshift memorial. Signs read ""Peace + love are stronger,"" ''God bless America and ""We love you, Gabrielle."" People also laid down bouquets of flowers, American flags and pictures of Giffords. An unidentified man who authorities earlier said might have acted as an accomplice was cleared today of any involvement. Pima County sheriff's deputy Jason Ogan told The Associated Press today that the man was a cab driver who drove the gunman to the grocery store outside of which the shooting occurred. One of the victims was Christina-Taylor Green, who was a member of the student council at her local school and went to the event because of her interest in government. She is the granddaughter of former Philadelphia Phillies manager Dallas Green. She was born on 9/11 and featured in a book called ""Faces of Hope"" that chronicled one baby from each state born on the day terrorists killed nearly 3,000 people. The fact that Christina's life ended in tragedy was especially tragic to those who knew her. ""Tragedy seems to have happened again,"" said the author of the book, Christine Naman. ""In the form of this awful event."" Authorities said the dead included U.S. District Judge John M. Roll; Greene; Giffords aide Gabe Zimmerman, 30; Dorothy Morris, 76; Dorwin Stoddard, 76; and Phyllis Scheck, 79. Judge Roll had just stopped by to see his friend Giffords after attending Mass. In one of several YouTube videos, which featured text against a dark background, Loughner described inventing a new U.S. currency and complained about the illiteracy rate among people living in Giffords' congressional district in Arizona. ""I know who's listening: Government Officials, and the People,"" Loughner wrote. ""Nearly all the people, who don't know this accurate information of a new currency, aren't aware of mind control and brainwash methods. If I have my civil rights, then this message wouldn't have happen (sic)."" In Loughner's middle-class neighborhood — about a five-minute drive from the scene — sheriff's deputies had much of the street blocked off. The neighborhood sits just off a bustling Tucson street and is lined with desert landscaping and palm trees. Neighbors said Loughner lived with his parents and kept to himself. He was often seen walking his dog, almost always wearing a hooded sweatshirt and listening to his iPod. The assassination attempt left Americans questioning whether divisive politics had pushed the suspect over the edge. Giffords faced frequent backlash from the right over her support of the health care reform last year, and had her office vandalized the day the House approved the landmark measure. Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik lashed out at what he called an excessively ""vitriolic"" atmosphere in the months leading up to the rampage as he described the chaos of the day. The sheriff said the rampage ended only after two people tackled the gunman. A third person intervened and tried to pull a clip away from Loughner as he attempted to reload, the sheriff said. ""He was definitely on a mission,"" according to event volunteer Alex Villec, former Giffords intern.

We want to bridge divides to reach everyone. A Westboro Baptist Church spokeswoman is expected to get air time on two radio talk shows in exchange for the called-off protests. Critics say the church will get more exposure that way, but one of the talk-show hosts says the deal was worth it. Loading... January 14, 2011 United in grief over the Arizona mass shooting, Tucsonans and their sympathizers accomplished what others could not: run the controversial Westboro Baptist Church out of town. Members of the church have protested outside military funerals across the United States as they attempt to spread their message that America is being punished for its growing tolerance of gay rights. But in Tucson, protesters did not show up at the first two funerals for shooting victims – held for 9-year-old Christina Green and US District Judge John Roll. Instead, the Topeka, Kan., church will take to the airwaves. In exchange for canceling its planned pickets at the funerals of the six shooting victims, the church announced, it will get air time on two radio shows. The move has sparked some criticism from pundits who say the church – which consists mostly of the Rev. Fred Phelps and his family members – will reach a far wider audience through radio than it would have at the funeral sites. “People are saying they don’t deserve the air time, and they probably don’t. But these families do not deserve what the protesters wanted to do to them, either,” Tucson resident Patti Standard says. On Saturday, church spokeswoman Shirley Phelps-Roper is expected to get 30 minutes of air time on a Phoenix talk show hosted by Steve Sanchez. And on Monday, the nationally syndicated Mike Gallagher show will give an hour to Ms. Phelps-Roper. “One hour of radio time on my radio show is quite insignificant compared to [what] the grieving families and the mourning families have to go through,” says Mr. Gallagher, a conservative political commentator. Phelps-Roper won’t simply have an open mic, he notes. She will be debating Dinesh D’Souza, president of The King’s College in New York City and author of “What’s So Great About Christianity.” The emergency law that Arizona lawmakers passed earlier in the week in reaction to the planned pickets was unlikely to stop the protests, Gallagher says. The legislation makes protests illegal within 300 feet of any home, house of worship, cemetery, or funeral home just before, during, or after a ceremony or burial. “I know these people: They don’t even want to get 300 feet away. And besides, even if they violate the law, it’s a misdemeanor,” Gallagher says. “It’s a slap on the wrist.” The best deterrent is “to keep them from ever going,” says Gallagher, adding that those who don’t want to hear the radio segments have the option to turn their radio off. The Westboro Baptist Church’s antigay protests have angered many Americans and have raised difficult free-speech questions. The US Supreme Court is weighing a case that involves the group’s actions. From what some Tucson residents know about the church, they’ve decided not to tune in to the radio shows. “I don’t think anybody in Tucson will have the show on,” says C.J. Doyle, a resident who went to Christina's funeral along with 20-year-old daughter Emily. “But I think it’s going to end up good because you’re not going to have a whole bunch of people exposed to that particular group.” Phoenix resident Marshall Stone, who traveled to Tucson to pay his respects, was glad the protesters left the mourning families alone. “I have a daughter, and I can’t imagine the parents having to bury their daughter, and then on top of that to be bothered by somebody like the Westboro people,” he says. Six people were killed in Saturday’s mass shooting, and 14 others were injured, including US Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D). Already a subscriber?

Dupnik, who is overseeing the investigation of Saturday's mass shooting that critically wounded Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D),  became an overnight sensation with his remarks that the ""vitriol"" in today's political discourse contributed to the incident and that Arizona has become ""a mecca for prejudice and bigotry."" Dupnik's name was a top search term on Twitter Saturday night, with many of the tweets thanking him for his candor, and overnight, a Facebook page titled ""Clarence Dupnik is my Hero"" sprung up. In a news conference Saturday evening, Dupnik condemned the ""atmosphere of hatred and bigotry"" that he said has gripped the nation and suggested that the 22-year-old suspect being held in the shooting was mentally ill and therefore more susceptible to overheated messages in the media. ""There's reason to believe that this individual may have a mental issue. And I think people who are unbalanced are especially susceptible to vitriol,"" he said during his televised remarks. ""People tend to pooh-pooh this business about all the vitriol we hear inflaming the American public by people who make a living off of doing that. That may be free speech, but it's not without consequences."" His remarks especially resonated with liberals, who even before the name of the suspect was released suggested that the shooter may have had been incited by the tea party. There is no indication that the suspect, Jared Lee Lougner, identified with the tea party or was politically conservative.  During the campaign, liberal pundits and politicians asserted that the sometimes militant language some conservative politicians used could incite violence. MSNBC talk show host Keith Olbermann, who acknowledged and apologized for his role in the acrimonious political climate, praised Dupnik's ""extraordinary"" comments at the close of his show on Saturday. Dupnik's remarks drew criticism from conservatives. ""We have no idea at this point the motivation of this murderer's act. Yet Dupnik took his moment in the spotlight to drive a political wedge into the event,"" local conservative radio host Jon Justice said in an e-mail to the Tucson Weekly. ""They were reckless and dangerous statements made by someone who should have known better. He should have been using his time to help bring the community together."" Dupnik, 74, a Democrat who has served as Pima County sheriff since 1980, is known for his colorful and often bluntly partisan commentary. Last year, he refused to enforce Arizona's aggressive new law targeting illegal immigrants, calling it ""stupid"" and ""racist."" He coined the phrase ""political fornickaboobery,"" to describe the motives he felt were behind the crackdown. He has called the tea party ""bigots,"" and on Saturday, he had similar words about Arizona's reputation. ""The anger the hatred the bigotry that goes on in this country is getting to be outrageous, and unfortunately I think Arizona has become sort of the capital,"" he said. ""We have become the Mecca for prejudice and bigotry."" Yet Dupnik has also argued that the state should not be obligated to educate illegal immigrant children, and a group of fellow Democratic officials in 2009 asked him to apologize after he said 40 percent of students at a particular school district were illegally in the country. He refused. His remarks on Saturday further ingratiated him with liberals who have often taken issue with another Arizona sheriff - Maricopa County's Joe Arpaio, a Republican and frequent speaker at tea party events who has clashed with federal authorities over his aggressive tactics in dealing with illegal immigrants. Pima is a border county of nearly 1 million that includes Tucson, a Democratic-leaning city, and overlaps with the 8th congressional district, which Giffords represents. According to the Pima County sheriff's office web site, Dupnik is a 50-year veteran in law enforcement, having first served in the Tucson Police Department in 1958. By

			| Report abuse Is this sheriff really this dumb? This shooter could be a liberal for all he knows. Is Dupnik a liberal trying to stop free speech? The truth about this story is this shooter is nuts. He met the Congresswoman in 2007 and asked her a crazy question and got a crazy answer back. He got mad and finally blew up after three years. He probably doesnt even listen to talk radio or anything. Posted by: brianc6234 | January 11, 2011  2:21 PM

			| Report abuse Let's see.  Sheriff Dupnik states that the suspect isn't cooperating and not talking to LEO's about the incident, yet Dupnik holds a press conference insinuating that it's politically motivated. Sheriff Dupnik states that ""Limbaugh"" is making statements without evidence that are factually incorrect and it incites people (to violence), yet Dupnik makes statements tying the shooting to Republicans, tea party participants and conservative voters without evidence and considerable evidence to the contrary. Sheriff Dupnik makes these comments fairly quickly after the incident when it would be fairly clear with the police record the suspect has that his ties to the victim are within the democratic and liberal political motive and inspection of his residence would clearly show (and wouldn't there be a visit to that residence the same day?) that there were other ""factors"" clearly involved. Is this the Sheriff YOU would want in your county?  A guy who makes off hand comments involving a case publicly, giving the defense more reasons to instill doubt, leaking inaccurate information, inciting violence by rhetoric without any factual evidence, hampering federal investigation by making numerous public speeches naming false motives and possible profile groups of suspects. The only facts here are that Sheriff Dupnik failed to provide adequate protection for elected officials at a public event and failed to seriously evaluate and prevent a known threat to the Congresswoman from gaining access to her. He needs to be replaced or fired. Posted by: Flachbau | January 11, 2011 12:08 PM

			| Report abuse Wow what biased reporting from the Washington Post. The only people I have seen blame this on conservatives are lefties(like Dupnik). Wherever those sites praising Dupnik came from they are no doubt made by leftists. Just go look at some of the hateful comments and blogs from over the weekend all over the internet coming from liberals, from the Huffington Post to some of the comments on here. Keith Olbermann and the liberal talking heads today are already pinning this on conservatives. This is the kind of rhetroric that has this nation divided. Not to mention Obama and the last President who has worked overtime to divide the nation with their extremist policies. No one knows what political affiliation this shooter was and people should reserve judgement until after the facts are in. Even then, NO ONE FORCED HIM TO PULL THE TRIGGER!!!!

			| Report abuse Gotta love Sheriff Dupnik for pointing out how these influences poison our society. But while considering these influences, we must include this countries'general acceptance and promotion of violence as a means to an end. A stunning hypocrisy occurs to me while listening to Obama and other public figures condemn this horrific event. These very same ""leaders"" and the American public in general are quite ok with our military flailing away around the world in unnescessry wars causing the deaths of tens of thousands of innocents.  And then we wonder why some of our citizens think that violence is an acceptable solution to perceived threats. Posted by: stevedumford | January 10, 2011  4:52 PM

			| Report abuse What sort of journalism is this?  It certainly isn't reporting--the sheriff did not mention the Tea Party.  And if it is opinion, it certainly isn't balanced.  I can't believe that this young woman actually has an advanced degree in journalism.  What is happening to the WAPO?  Why does the WAPO find it necessary to smear this sheriff?  There has been little reference to the Tea Party in any of the coverage I followed.  The discussion has centered around inflammatory rhetoric and Sarah Palin's hit list.  Her journalism is typical of the sort of writing that I see in the comments section and her article isn't worthy of association with a paper with the status and reputation of the WAPO.  Talk about dumbing down. Posted by: msu73 | January 10, 2011  9:11 AM

			| Report abuse While I have enjoyed reading the posts which seem to relish mudslinging at other commenters, I would like to mention that Sheriff Dupnik did not name anyone in his comments but rather seemed to plead with all parties to tone down the nasty, vitriolic speech.  Why do you think he was referring to the tea party or the far right?...he didn't say anything about the tparty. Posted by: marlenepitts | January 10, 2011  3:22 AM 
			| Report abuse I'm tired of being called a racist and a bigot because I oppose the radical and destructive policies of Barrack Obama, and the Professional Left. Sheriff Dupnik of Pinal County used the 15-minutes of fame accorded him by a national tragedy, to continue the liberal smear campaign which has been in full force, ever since those of us who voted for Barrack Obama, fully understood the fraudulent campaign he used to get elected: ""The anger the hatred the bigotry that goes on in this country is getting to be outrageous, and unfortunately I think Arizona has become sort of the capital,"" he said. ""We have become the Mecca for prejudice and bigotry."" I agree that the hatred and bigotry that goes on in this country is outrageous. The problem is, the vast majority of it is coming from the Democratic party and the Left. One need look no further than on-line forums like this one, where liberals routinely characterize those who oppose them as ""ignorant"", ""stupid"", ""extremist"", ""racists"", and of course the umbrella term: ""bigots"". When it comes to arguing the issues on the merits, they have very little to say, since the costs of propping up their unsustainable ideology of entitlement and state-sponsored altruism has pushed this country to the brink of economic disaster. FYI, Sheriff Dupnik, here's the Wikipedia definition of ""bigotry"": ""A bigot is a person obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices, especially one exhibiting intolerance, and animosity toward those of differing beliefs."" If you want to put a stop to it, you may start with your next big press-conference: by doing your job, sticking to the facts, and sparing us your sanctimonious rants directed at those of us who voted for change, and got exponentially more of the same corrupt, business as usual in Washington.

| AP
NEW ORLEANS -- Former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin says her ""Don't retreat -- reload"" slogan is a call for political activism, not violence. Addressing fellow conservatives at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference, Palin accused the media of twisting her words and tarnishing the reputation of the tea party movement. She told Republicans on Friday, ""Don't retreat -- reload, and that's not a call for violence."" Palin noted that critics have questioned why she'd use such language while some Democratic lawmakers face threats of violence over their support of health care overhaul legislation. Palin added, ""No one is calling for such a thing."" Posted by: nansev | January  9, 2011  9:41 PM

---------------------
WTH does George Bush have to do with this thread? Another liberal who can't resist finding another method to bash George Bush. I'm not a George Bush fan. I voted for Al Gore against George Bush. I also voted for Obama in 2008 crossing over against McCain who is from my own state because of Palin. None of which means crap about this idgit Clarence Dupnick. We have a POTUS who refuses to secure our border and plays politics with our lives. We have a representative who votes against her district on every vote for two years. We have a local sheriff who publicly states he won't uphold laws. We have a Tucson police chief saying the same thing. Notice the trend and wonder why people here are frustrated? We have violent crime escalating daily. Murders records hit record highs last year. In fact we passed the record back in November. Every murder in December set a new record. Dupnick couldn't find a drug bust if it drove up to DPS HQ and slapped him. All the time while counties, BP, and ICE around us are breaking records for drug seizures. Yeah for Clarence Dupnick the local Barney Fife of AZ. Ease up on that vitriol you might cost the old coot his nap time. Posted by: Desertdiva1 | January  9, 2011  8:41 PM

If the shooter yesterday only had the standard magazine he would have posed a mush smaller threat. Fortunately he was blocked by a women in the crowd from using the larger magazine and when he inserted another magazine it malfunctioned. His College and the Military recruiters knew he had problems but again we do not have the systems in place to block/report his behavioral problems to law enforcement and society in general.

His comments around SB1070 inflamed the residents. When you have a sheriff publicly posting that he and his men would not enforce the law then maybe someone in law enforcement can explain to you what oath of office means. If you want to see an example of a great sheriff look no further than Pinal County sheriff Paul Babeu. Now there is a man who is both a good politician AND a good law enforcement official. We will be glad to trade Dupnick to anyone who will take him. Posted by: Desertdiva1 | January  9, 2011  5:28 PM

We will not have free speech abridged, we will not tolerate this hate machine to attack us over one of theirs.

The fault needs to be placed where it belongs and not just thrown against the wall to see if it sticks for cheap political points. Obama just got spanked in November - he is going to play this up all its worth.  He needs to challenged on this at every step. Obama and the leftists need to answer for their vicious hate speech.

VirginiaConservative for example, just chill out and think about making a reasonable point rather than just mounting your next attack. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Nothing I said was an attack - unless you consider the truth an attack. The point is this:  A lunatic with leftist leanings just murdered some very good and innocent people. Before the blood had even stopped flowing, the left started dancing in it, screeching at full volume at how this was a tea party attack. Once it became clear this puke was no tea partyer, then the narrative switched to how he was manipulated by right wing media. This is a very sick and twisted situation and the people making the false and indefensible accusations are the sickest among us. Want to talk about inflammatory hate speech?  Great, lets start with our current president, his cabinet, the leftists in the senate (remember Durbin, Murtha and Kerry accusing our troops of being murderers and keepers of Gulags?  Congressional lunatics like Grayson. Lets them move on to disgustingly vicious sites like kos and huffpo. You include all this - then you can talk about the right with a little moral standing. Until then, you are just another goof, baying at the moon. Posted by: VirginiaConservative | January  9, 2011  4:25 PM

Also, a woman who met him in the past described him as more left liberal. Now, for critical thinking part.  For, two years Democrats ran roughshod over Republicans in the Congress Houses and there were no shooting.  At a time the Republicans are in the  majority there is suddenly a devastating shooting. The question of who will take responsibility for it could be medications, the liberals or the conservatives because there has been acrimony on both sides.

The Sheriff is doing what you, the media, should have done a long time ago: call out the Tea Baggers as a dangerous racist, zenophobic, antisemitic hate movement.  He's at Ground Zero so he knows that the media narrative that the baggers are just tax protesters is totally bogus. Laughably, the media continues to push the talking point that this attempted assassination was committed by an apolitical ""lone nut.""  Not so.  Turns out Jared probably had ties to a prominent white supremacist; he probably had at least one accomplice; and there is no evidence he was ""a nut."" And why is the media shying away from confronting Palin aggressively about her listing Giffords (at No. 4) on her famous gun-crosshairs hit list.  Giffords was one of only two sitting Members of Congress on the hit list. Sad and tragic.  Katherine Graham's Washington Post would have been all over this.

			| Report abuse I find listening to Dupnik's ""feelings"" at his press conferences about the state of rhetoric in the country hypocritical as he is the very same law official, sworn to uphold the law, who said that he would refuse to enforce Arizona's new immigration law because he didn't like it and the legislators in Arizona appeared to be racists. So perhaps callings others over the top for their speech is funny coming from a man who has been over the top in his own speech and openly saying he will not enforce the laws he has sworn to uphold. I would suggest he and other democrats should think back to how many times they have called the citizens of Arizona racists and bigots because they want to secure their borders. How many ever before in history have seen such an all out assault in the court system of the US govt. against its own citizens in favor of illegals entering the country? So perhaps Mr. Dupnik should think how his own previous rhetoric may also be worthy of review before he complains about others. It is fine to ask for all rhetoric to cool down but don't forget your own as well. Both political sides here could be assigned blame by the other but then is it the point to excuse the shooter for his actions as long as political gain can be made?  This whole blame game is sick in itself and should be stopped. Posted by: justmyvoice | January  9, 2011  3:26 PM

			| Report abuse Hazmat77 @ 2:05, might I point out the obvious to you so that you will stop trying to justify the actions of people who fill the airwaves with vitriol on a 24 x 7 basis? 1. Major Nidal is a mentally unbalanced person whose decision to commit a terrorist act was influenced by an individual who works tirelessly to turn one group of Americans (Muslim Americans) against their fellow citizens and against the government. The provacateur's name is Anwar al Awlaki, it wasn't Nancy Pelosi. You know this, I know this, and anyone who has spent 5 minutes reading about Nidal's attack knows this. 2. Most Americans reject and repudiate Awlaki's use of lies, exaggeration and vitriol to turn Muslim Americans against their fellow citizens. We do not question the idea that his actions are dangerous. One cannot believe that Awlaki's hateful words can incite violence without recognizing that that the vitriol spewed by right wing politicians and commentators who also seek to turn Americans against Americans can also incite violence. 3. No one has suggested that all mass murders are motivate by political vitriol. The fact that the mass murderers in Columbine chose to kill their fellow students tells the casual observer that their crime was probably not politically motivated. On the other hand, the fact that Loughner chose a politician as his primary target tells the casual observer that his crime may have been motivated by hatred for political figures in general or by his hatred for a specific target. 4. After Columbine, we as a society asked how two teenagers could become so alienated that they would kill their fellow students. Many of us, as parents, took the time to talk to our children and to watch them more closely to ensure that they would not be the next perpetrators or victims of such a terrible crime.  It is perfectly reasonable to do the same now and it is perfectly reasonable that we are asking ourselves what role hateful political speech played in this tragedy.

But much of it emanates from the left...just review the personal denigration of Bush43 made by Nancy Pelosi and other so-called leaders of the Democrat Party since Election 2000. And none of the vitriol bears any relationship to the Intentional MURDER of 13 members of the US Military on October 5, 2009 at Ft. Hood - the most populous US military installation in the world, by Major Nidal Malik Hasan, 39 year old US Army Doctor -psychiatrist, clearly an Islamic crazed individusal. Need I remind you adherents of political correctness of the Columbine High School shooting where 2 students killed 13 people plus themselves ... without any regard to political vitriol. They were simply not ordinary kids. They were kids with serious psychological problems according to Peter Langman author of: ""Why Kids Kill: Inside the Minds of School Shooters"".

He also forgot to mention violent TV, videos, music, movies, internet, and many other sources that someone like the accused killer was much more likely to be influenced by than...... Sarah Palin? Seriously? Perhaps amidst all the time he spent online, reading the Communist Manifesto, and listening to his iPod (according to neighbors), he found time to internalize our country's political debate. Yeah. That's it. I am angered but not surprised by the Left's immediate willingness to use this horrible event for political gain. Skiritae Posted by: Skiritae | January  9, 2011  2:04 PM

This comment in this article is the only time I've read/heard that Olbermann apologized for his inflammatory comments on his TV program.  I wonder why.  In addition to such bad actors as Limbaugh, Beck, Hannity etc., I would also include MSNBC stars such as Olbermann, Ed Schultz, and Chris Matthews.  I've never watched Larry O'Donnell but I've seen him on Morning Joe and he's just as bad as the others.  In fact, he's been referred to as Crazy Larry because of his uncontrolled outbursts.  (I'm still ambivalent about Rachel Madow.)  The Left is just as culpable as the Right.  And I'm especially not forgiving highly partisan politicians either.

			| Report abuse Dupnik? It's easy to attribute such incidents to the level of vitriol in the public discourse. But much of it emanates from the left...just review the personal denigration of Bush43 made by Nancy Pelosi and other so-called leaders of the Democrat Party since Election 2000. And none of the vitriol bears any relationship to the Intentional MURDER of 13 members of the US Military on October 5, 2009 at Ft. Hood - the most populous US military installation in the world, by Major Nidal Malik Hasan, 39 year old US Army Doctor -psychiatrist, clearly an Islamic crazed individusal. Need I remind you adherents of political correctness of the Columbine High School shooting where 2 students killed 13 people plus themselves ... without any regard to political vitriol. They were simply not ordinary kids. They were kids with serious psychological problems according to Peter Langman author of: ""Why Kids Kill: Inside the Minds of School Shooters"". The Sheriff should stick to invesigqating and reporting the facts - he is not the person to be ascribe externam causation, especially so soon after the incident. Let the facts DEVELOP.

			| Report abuse Dupnik was clearly rattled, but he was also on to something we all recognize in today's society: our modes of communication, however helpful on one hand, have developed faster than our human capacity to understand and respect them, ergo to use them properly. We are a people unmoored from the basics of human civility, and we forget the power of our words. As a Christian, I am particularly concerned with those who claim to be Christians and then forget how often we are cautioned in the Bible to be mindful before we speak. I am also concerned with the rush to call the gunman a lone wolf who ""acted alone."" Perhaps he did, but to divorce any member of today's society from the nerve center of the rest of it is to make a grave mistake. Again, Christians should particularly be held to the fire here. We are told by Christ that ""what you do to the least of these, you do to me."" In other words, even if he is a lone mentally ill man, we are influencing him in how we talk, act, incite. When we speak we should be mindful of ""the least of these"", including how our words affect the children of our population, who we have all but abandoned to the vagaries of an amoral market who wants a piece of their soul from the first day of life in a Barney diaper. Where is our dignity? I am certainly not encouraging repression of our communication modalities. But I am calling for personal responsibility at a much higher level of personal and social evolution than we have yet mastered. Little ears are listening. Little eyes are watching. And the vulnerable are in the mix. I would like to believe that as a society we are capable of finding our social maturity after over 200 years a nation, with our amazing freedoms, and with it our enormous responsibilities. Is it possible in a land this large, and so complex, with such freedoms that we barely understand? Will Americans rise to the challenge? Or is the double edged sword of our freedoms more than we can handle, and one that in the end will pierce our hearts, killing us all? Posted by: lindsaycurren | January  9, 2011  1:50 PM

			| Report abuse The sheriff should stick to police enforcement of the laws of Pima County instead of pyscho-babbling what was going on in the mind of a mass killer. If the killer was so focused on right wing political hatred, why did the perp kill six others including a Repub nominated US judge, and eleven year old girl and four others and wound thirteen more.  His hatred was in fact quite boundless.   Following the Obama crowd of wasting no crisis, NPR immediately ginned up the Congresswoman's wound to a killing, and CNN used the NPR report to call up a bunch of Obama supporters to blame anyone who dissented with Obama over the past two years for killing a Congresswoman.  Too bad for NPR, thank God the Congresswoman was wounded.  NPR, the Sheriff and those who want to spew their hatred of dissent with tortured logic are creating a country without rule of law or its enforcement.  Rather, blame their neighbors.  The electorate has spoken once, but recall has to be in the wind with the events of the first few hours of the mass murder in Arizona.  Certainly, after Juan Williams, Wikipedia tape misreporting, and hysterical reporting of the Congresswoman's death, NPR should be cut loose from the public treasury.

Once people get used to hearing it, its not a far leap for someone who is mentally vulnerable to act on it, thinking that it is, in fact, normal or expected behavior. So no, its not Palin's fault.

We're not going to live in that kind of country, and any politician who thinks we are is going to get voted out of office. So you better shape up and watch your mouths.

Push the button of the person on the edge of sanity they go off. This wacko's self described political terrorism on youtube was actually carried out.

Also, vitriol comes from both sides of the aisles. There are also many, many people in crisis in the US but nobody's helping them.
There's also no perspective. Alas, shootings of public figures occurs, ""vitriol"" or not.

The vitriol, the provacation and rhetoric coming from the right served as a catalyst to the disrespect, incivility and anger.  Yet, none of the republican legislators (or fox fans, beckheads, limbaugh dittoheads) asked for a calming of the rhetoric - instead, they took their place in the clown parade and defended the right to free speech.  I'm all for free speech, except when it incites violence.  It's been a deliberate campaign to keep the anger frothing - and folks are suprised at the end result?  All to score political points.  It's absolutely pathetic. Bravo Sheriff!! Posted by: notfooledbydistractions1 | January  9, 2011 12:53 PM

In another country,this would much severe consequences.
 Where is our responsibility?
 There appears to be more chaos in the News than perhaps, at the shooting sight. Comments made here, will not help to bring calm across our country. We all express our aversion to crime,where ever committed, that image is wiped out in our day to day living.Our expressions that come out of dissent are as extreme as our expressions of Happiness. It is not the gun only that is killing, it is our attitudes. In an instant we turn from good to bad, our minds are just balancing on the thin side of the coin or wedge.The same expressions are seen on the TV that we watch every day.Our society is so advanced, we have forgotten the acts of civility, each day is like a Video that is fast-forwarded-this is no way that we should act like this and at the same time preach.God help this countryit, is not war, it is just act of chaos in our mind.

That may be free speech, but it's not without consequences.""
*************************************
Is what Dupnik said by blaming talk radio for this shooting not vitriol just because he said it with somewhat of a calm voice? Is this not essentially trying to incite violence against certain talk radio and television personalities? This was a briefing on a violent tragedy and he used it to make a political point, very inappropriate for the occassion. After the sheriff's ""vitriol"" at his press conference you can rest assured that the threats against people like Beck and Limbaugh increased dramatically.

They will try to paint a picture of why someone would commit such a heinuous act.  The problem is it's a tired story line.  The question we should be asking ourselves is why these sort of shootings seem more prevalent today than say 100 years ago. Posted by: h20andoil | January  9, 2011 12:40 PM

Same as with Fox News and their venomous spew that riles up the mentally challenged who feel threatened when Fox News tells them to feel threatened.  The right wing belief that imposing a few operating rules on Health Insurance Companies is a ""government takeover of health care"" indicates how credulous right wingers are.  They hate.  Oh do they hate.  Facts and logic are ignored in favor of  baseless beliefs.  Now we come to the schizophrenic who takes (his 2nd Amendment right intact) a gun to a street corner political event.  He shot the politician through the head.  Was he a leftist or a right wing authoritarian?  It doesn't matter.  He listens to Fox News and Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity and Bill (Tide Comes In, Tide Goes Out) O'Reilly, believes what they tell him:  that America is being taken over by Liberal elites, and acts.

			| Report abuse Letâs not try to link the ânation's heated political discourseâ with criminal activity and that there might even be the possibility ânation's heated political discourseâ has âtaken a dangerous turn.â  âHeated political discourseâ is a First Amendment Right.  If there was such a link then why was it not made with Timothy McVeigh (Oklahoma City bomber) and the Fort Hood Massacre (by a U.S. Army Officer who proved to be a Muslim Terrorist) and the 9/11 Muslim Terrorists that attacked the Twin Towers (NYC) and the Pentagon.  The First Amendment is about âFreedom Speechâ and not about freedom to kill people.  There is a big difference between the two.  Freedom of Speech is legal, but murder is against the law! Think of all the Tea Party Rallies (held at the height of the Health Care Reform Debate) and all the Town Hall Meeting that took place around the same time where people (millions of them) voiced their opposition (âheated political discourseâ) toward health care reform.  That was âFreedom of Speechâ at its best.  Yet, there was a single shot fired at any Tea Party Rallies or any Town Hall Meetings.  People on both sides of the issue called one another names (Freedom of Speech), but no shots were fired (criminal activity).  No shots were fired when the President of the United States of America referred to the GOP as âenemies.â  Letâs not now try to tie criminal activity with âheated political discourse.â  There is no need to limit or ban Freedom of Speech because some violate the Laws of the Land.  Deal with the law breakers and leave the law abiding people alone. Maybe it is time to take the domestic terrorist threat in this country seriously.  When the âJared Loughnerâs (Arizona shooting yesterday)â and âMaj. Nidal Hasanâs (Fort Hood 2009)â are caught red handed at the scene, then maybe our laws should be changed to reflect the changing times.  Those caught and apprehended at the scene should have a trial and if convicted they should be executed without the right of appeal, because it is not their guilt that is in question and such people (by the mere fact of their committing those horrific crimes) do not deserve the right of appeal.  Congress can change the law.  Those not caught at the scene of then their guilt or innocence is a different story.  Domestic terrorists are âenemies of the Stateâ and they should be treated as such and treated no differently than a saboteur in time of war! Posted by: charlie651 | January  9, 2011 12:34 PM

We have a sheriff who has been busy telling everyone who will listen (eastern media especially) that he isn't going to enforce the immigration laws (it's racist, you know, to set limits on citizenship), has called the people in the state who disagree with him racist, is sheriff in a yuppie-based environment where slamming the motivations of those with whom you disagree is the norm, and somehow - somehow - he is now shocked that political rhetoric has gotten intense.  The newspapers who have been giving this guy a free ride for awhile (Post included) should pay attention to his comment ""I know we have free speech and all"" (or words to that effect) that he follows by indicating that free speech is clearly the problem.  I am not a Palin fan - and ads with targets on them are childish at best - but the danger from Saturday is how this moron sheriff will use the suffering to help muzzle people with whom he disagrees. Violence always has unintended consequences - and inevitably it serves as an excuse by one group to control another.  Maybe - just maybe - if this self-important oaf had actually listened to the people of the state and found some way to deal with mobs of illegals instead of patting himself on the back with how enlightened he was we'd have gotten the noise level in Arizona down a notch.

Bill Weld left the Reagan Administration full of complaints about the president who appointed him, whereupon he was welcomed home to Massachusetts, elected Governor, and made a darling of the left. Look at the facts: while Dupnik slept, private citizens stopped the killer, saved the Representative's life, and had the killer pinned down ready for Dupnik's armed bureaucrats when they arrived five minutes later.

Just like Major Hassan.  Another crazy person seeking to become relevant by shooting people.  We spent countless hours blaming Islam for Major Hassanâs actions. One thing remains clear: The Tucson shooter did not target a celebrity or a famous sports figure.  He did not target a religious leader or a member of the media.  He targeted an elected representative of our government.  To ignore this fact is a recipe for disaster.  The people that want to dismiss the fact that a politician was targeted are refusing to deal with reality.  They are, once again, ignoring facts because it may not agree with their opinion.

Furthermore, I agree with the GOP on many issues. I really, really miss Ronald Reagan right now. Know why? Because Reagan never told anyone that those who disagreed with him were bad people. However, Palin, Beck, Coulter*, Limbaugh, and the whole slimy cabal of them have been making money out of rants that pit Americans against each other. The Republican Party has changed dramatically in the last 20 years or so. It changed so much, that I doubt Reagan would recognize it. He was a tolerant man and he encouraged tolerance of differing viewpoints. Not the current group of clowns serving. I think Palin needs to publicly apologize for her crosshairs posting and I think that Rush, Beck, and these other losers should hold a conference on tolerance. Sadly, both of these ideas fall into the ""Yeah, right"" category. There's too much money to be made off hatred. Ronald Reagan is turning over in his grave.

Liberals viciously attack those they disagree with, but when they find themselves on the receiving end complain about lack of civility. What hypocrisy. After the way liberals have demonized people like Bush and Palin, they should be the last to demand civility for themselves. Posted by: Juan__ | January  9, 2011 12:18 PM

			| Report abuse Dupnik decried political vitriol that incites violence - he did not ascribe this vitriol to any specific political party. Why, then, are Republicans reacting so defensively to his comments? This, of course, is a rhetorical question; we all know the answer only too well. Posted by: AJBF | January  9, 2011 12:13 PM

Calling for ""direct action"" and then pretending you were talking about votes instead of intimidation or violence is both dishonest and cowardly. Worse, not speaking out against provocateurs like Palin BEFORE the violence they've cutely encouraged comes to pass makes all who applauded the speeches partially to blame. The left marginalized its violent crazies--the anarchists, the communists, the Weathermen, The time for the right to do the same, unless it finds the implied threats to Democrats too tantalizing to denounce.

1054873120,2011-01-14 14:53:39,Rep. Giffords Responds to Commands But Not Out of the Woods Yet,https://abcnews.go.com/US/rep-gabrielle-giffords-remains-critical-conditions-shooting/story?id=12574682,en,False,"medicine and health,murders and attempted murders",39000,ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/,"Charges filed against accused gunman Jared Loughner. Eyewitness Accounts of Arizona Shooting Jan. 9, 2011 — -- Rep. Gabrielle Giffords is responding to simple commands and is in critical condition after suffering a gunshot wound to the head yesterday, according to her doctors. ""She is able to communicate through simple commands,"" said Dr. Michael Lemole, a surgeon at the University Medical Center in Tucson, Ariz., who treated Giffords. ""And we're very encouraged by that."" ""But she's still in critical condition and brain swelling can occur at any point, but I'm cautiously optimistic,"" he added. ""We don't know what her deficits will be in the future."" Giffords, 40, was shot in the back of her head, the bullet crossing the left side of her brain and exiting just above her left eye, said Dr. Peter Rhee, the director of Trauma and Critical Care at the University Medical Center. She is breathing with the help of a ventilator. Fourteen other people were wounded and six killed during the assassination attempt on Giffords at a political event outside a Tucson grocery store Saturday morning. The alleged gunman, 22-year-old Jared Loughner, is in the custody of the Pima County Sheriff's Office. A second man whom authorities had been searching for as a person of interest in the case turned himself today in and has been released. Pima County Sheriff's Office Bureau Chief Richard Kastigar said the individual was a cab driver who had driven Loughner to the grocery store. He was caught on camera when he entered the grocery store after there was an issue with Loughner paying for the ride. Some of the terror of that moment was evident in the 911 calls that were released today. ""Oh my god,"" exclaims a 911 operator who got the first report of the carnage. A man who identified himself as Manuel Hernandez told the operator, ""There was a shooting at Safeway…Where Gabrielle Giffords was…and I do believe Gabrielle Giffords was hit."" ""She's hit. And I do believe she's breathing,"" he said. ""She is breathing. She still has a pulse."" ""He went in and just started firing and then he ran,"" said Hernandez, prompting the operator's exclamation. A woman named Sally Badger frantically called seeking information about her husband. ""My husband just called me and told me he was shot. He was going to the Gabrielle Gifford event and I don't know where he is,"" Badger told 911. ""He called me and then the phone went dead."" Her husband Bill Badger, a retired Army colonel, was grazed on the back of his head. He is cited by some as one of the heros who tackled Loughner to stop the slaughter.  A criminal complaint filed in federal court this afternoon charges Loughner with one count of attempted assassination of a member of Congress, two counts of killing an employee of the United States and two counts of intent to kill employees of the United States. During a search of Loughner's home, authorities found an envelope with handwriting that read ""I planned ahead,"" and ""My assassination"" and the name ""Giffords,"" as well as Loughner's signature. Loughner is scheduled to appear in court on Monday. Rhee described Giffords' injury as a ""devastating wound."" ""Right now she's in a very good situation, and hopefully it will stay that way,"" he said. Giffords is unable to open her eyes and cannot speak because of the ventilator, according to Rhee, but she is able to respond when asked to squeeze her hand or hold up her fingers. ""We take those simple commands for granted but they demonstrate high functioning in the brain,"" said Rhee. Rep. Giffords was there for a ""Congress on Your Corner"" event, one of several events she had planned in her Arizona Congressional district to meet with her constituents. The dead have been identified as the 63-year-old Roll, 30-year-old Gabriel Zimmerman (Giffords' director of community outreach), 76-year-old Dorthy Morris, 76-year-old Dorwin Stoddard, 79-year-old Phyllis Scheck, and 9-year-old Christina Green, according to the Pima County Sheriff's Department. Loughner legally purchased a Glock 19- 9mm gun at Sportsman's Warehouse in Tucson on Nov. 30, law enforcement officials said. It's unclear if he bought the extended clips used with the gun during the mass shooting.  An extended clip holds 30 rounds, officials said. Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik described the alleged shooter as ""mentally unstable."" Dupnik lauded three individuals -- at least one of whom was shot herself -- for tackling Loughner to the ground before he was able to load another magazine into his gun. Authorities released a photo of the other  person of interest -- a white male between 40 and 50 years old with dark hair -- and said he was last seen at the event and may have a connection to Loughner. The congresswoman was the clear focus of the gunman's assault, Dupnik said. ""He ran through the crowd and when he got to [Giffords] he just started shooting,"" the sheriff said. ""The anger, the hatred, the bigotry that goes on in this country is getting to be outrageous. And unfortunately Arizona I think is the capital. We are the Mecca for prejudice... for prejudice and bigotry,"" Dupnik said. ""When I looked up, he was shooting at Congresswoman Giffords,"" Steven Rayle, an eyewitness, said. ""He didn't stop shooting, he just continued shooting rapidly. It was close quarters so people had nowhere to get away from."" ""He didn't seem agitated, he seemed determined and just let loose with a barrage of bullets,"" Rayle said of the gunman. Rayle told ABC News that ""another man went running off"" after the shooting, but wasn't sure if the other man was involved. Rayle said the gunman approached Giffords and shot her before turning his gun on other people randomly. ""The whole thing unfolded in about 12 or 15 seconds. As he came around it I laid down on the ground and acted as if I was shot.""  After Giffords was shot in the head, staffers rushed to her aid, Rayle said. ""She was conscious, one of her staffers had a coat held to her face,"" Rayle said. After ducking under a concrete pillar, pretending to be wounded, Rayle helped tackle the gunman. He grabbed the suspect's feet. ""He didn't really say anything except like, 'you're hurting my arm.'  He was defensive, tense and struggling,"" Rayle said. Giffords, a representative for Arizona's 8th District who just won reelection to a third term, has been the target of conservative political opponents in recent months. Last March, Giffords' office was vandalized just after she voted in favor of the health care reform law. The intruders destroyed a glass door and a window at her Tucson Congressional offices. At the time, Giffords' press secretary C.J. Karamargin said the office had received many phone calls with ""nasty and rude and hateful comments"" from opponents of the health care bill. Recently Giffords, who supports gun rights, has received angry letters from anonymous sources, ranting about the supposed national gun registry and border control. One letter received on Dec. 15 addressed to ""giffords, obama, mccain and sen. Jon kyl"" got personal on the topic of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian A. Terry, who was killed in a late night shootout at the U.S.-Mexican border. ""Brian a Terry's blood is on your hands! How many more legal residents of the USA have to die before the border is CLOSED??? Obama I call you out! CLOSE THE DAMN BORDER NOW! Quit pandering to illegals!,"" the letter read. Giffords has a reputation as a political rebel.  Though though she supported her party's effort to pass a landmark health reform law, she voted with the Democratic Party only about 40 percent of the time, according to Congressional Quarterly,. She was also one of a handful of Democrats who did not vote for Nancy Pelosi for speaker of the house, during the recent Democratic leadership elections after Democrats lost their majority in the House last November.

Dupnik, who is overseeing the  investigation of Saturday’s mass shooting that critically wounded Rep.  Gabrielle Giffords (D),  became an overnight sensation with his remarks  that the “vitriol” in today’s political discourse contributed to the  incident and that Arizona has become “a mecca for prejudice and  bigotry.” Dupnik’s name was a top search term on Twitter Saturday night, with many of the tweets thanking him for his candor, and overnight, a Facebook page titled “Clarence Dupnik is my Hero” sprung up.  In a news conference Saturday evening, Dupnik condemned the  “atmosphere of hatred and bigotry” that he said has gripped the nation  and suggested that the 22-year-old suspect being held in the shooting  was mentally ill and therefore more susceptible to overheated messages  in the media. “There’s reason to believe that this individual may have a mental  issue. And I think people who are unbalanced are especially susceptible  to vitriol,” he said during his televised remarks. “People tend to  pooh-pooh this business about all the vitriol we hear inflaming the  American public by people who make a living off of doing that. That may  be free speech, but it’s not without consequences.” His remarks especially resonated with liberals, who even before the  name of the suspect was released suggested that the shooter may have had  been incited by the tea party. There is no indication that the suspect,  Jared Lee Lougner, identified with the tea party or was politically  conservative.  During the campaign, liberal pundits and politicians  asserted that the sometimes militant language some conservative  politicians used could incite violence.

Evoking memories of the six killed here Saturday, Obama seized upon the mass shooting at a congresswoman's supermarket meet-and-greet to tackle directly the subject of the nation's harsh political dialogue. He sharply decried the ""politics and point-scoring and pettiness that drifts away with the next news cycle."" ""Rather than pointing fingers or assigning blame, let us use this occasion to expand our moral imaginations, to listen to each other more carefully, to sharpen our instincts for empathy, and remind ourselves of all the ways our hopes and dreams are bound together,"" Obama told 14,000 people at the University of Arizona's McKale Memorial Center. Obama did not ascribe a political motive to the alleged shooter, or suggest that either party was to blame. Rather, in a 33-minute speech, he sought to move the nation past the tragedy. Accompanied at the arena by first lady Michelle Obama, the president said he joins Tucson in its grief, that he came here ""as an American who, like all Americans, kneels to pray with you today and will stand by you tomorrow."" After touching down under blue skies and a bright desert sun, Obama paid a surprise visit to victims recovering at University Medical Center, including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), who was shot in the head and remains in the intensive care unit. A short time after the president left her room, Giffords, surrounded by her husband and three close friends from Congress - House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) - opened her eyes and reached for her husband, showing a level of responsiveness that thrilled her loved ones. ""Gabby opened her eyes,"" said Obama, who was told about the incident by Giffords's husband during the short ride from the hospital to the arena. ""And I can tell you she knows we are here, she knows we love her, and she knows we are rooting for her"" In Washington, lawmakers still unnerved by the assassination attempt on one of their own offered a display of bipartisan unity. More than 120 Democrats and Republicans went to the well of the House to pay tribute in moving and sometimes tearful speeches. The House unanimously approved a resolution late Wednesday condemning the attack and praising the rescue work of citizen and emergency responders. Meanwhile, federal and local investigators sought to determine how suspect Jared Lee Loughner came upon the money to buy the weapon and ammunition he allegedly used in Saturday's rampage, parts of which were captured on the supermarket's security camera. Judge Larry A. Burns of the Southern District of California was appointed to hear Loughner's case after federal judges in Arizona recused themselves because of their personal relationships with one of the victims, Judge John M. Roll. The hopes of the nation were on Tucson, a shaken desert city that all week has mourned the fallen in hushed churches and at makeshift vigils. The first in a string of funerals - this one for 9-year-old Christina Taylor Green - begin Thursday."

We want to bridge divides to reach everyone. Calls for unity in response to the Arizona shooting are seen as an opportunity for the civility movement to tackle partisan rancor. Loading... January 13, 2011 Exchanges on the House floor were growing heated and vicious. Cooperation between parties had ground to a halt – and had already led to a shutdown of government. Worried about the future of Congress itself, 86 members sent a letter to the speaker requesting an urgent, bipartisan retreat to focus on one thing: building civility. Laura Chasin, founder of the Public Conver­sa­tions Project, helped facilitate discussions at that 1997 congressional retreat in Hershey, Pa., and describes a “very moving” scene. Members were asked how the acrimony in public life affected them. “And the stories that came out,” she says, “oh, my.” One congressman from the Southwest, “with tears streaming down his face,” Ms. Chasin recalls, said he’d gotten into politics to help people, but found himself in town-hall meetings “just gritting his teeth. The abuse had become so horrible.” Now, 15 years later, it seems the tone in Wash­ington – and around the country – is, if possible, even more divisive and ugly. Last summer, with a stagnant economy and emotions over the health-care reform bill raging, some members wound up canceling town-hall meetings altogether because they were deteriorating into shouting matches. And while hostile rhetoric may not have been a factor in the alleged assassination attempt in Tucson of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D) of Arizona, it was an issue that she herself had made a priority. Her widely reported e-mail sent to Kentucky’s Republican secretary of state, Trey Grayson, the day before she was wounded in a mass shooting is a clear indictment of the problem. Congratulating him on being named president of Harvard’s Institute of Politics, she added: “After you get settled, I would love to talk about what we can do to promote centrism and moderation. I am one of only 12 Dems left in a GOP district (the only woman) and think that we need to figure out how to tone our rhetoric and partisanship down.” In the immediate aftermath of Ms. Giffords’s shooting, these divisions have again been on display, as some partisans on the right and left have pointed fingers and accused one another of unfairly assigning blame. “That is precisely what is wrong with our dialogue,” Stephen Car­ter, a law professor at Yale University and author of “The Vio­lence of Peace,” observed in an e-mail interview. “Everything that happens, from the trivial to the tragic, is viewed across the spectrum as simply another opportunity to bash the opposition.” Yet many have also responded to the shooting with calls for unity. Indeed, in his Jan. 12 speech at the memorial for the victims of the Tucson shooting, President Obama urged Americans to talk “with each other in a way that heals,” declaring that “what we cannot do is use this tragedy as one more occasion to turn on each other.” And to a growing number of activists and experts in the business of civility, it appears partisan rancor is reaching a tipping point. They say that changing the tone of political rhetoric can’t be just a vague aspiration, but is an absolute imperative – and must take the form of a concrete, organized effort. More to the point, many believe it’s doable. “This is possible,” insists Nancy Jacobson, a longtime Democratic fundraiser and cofounder of the new bipartisan group No Labels, which defines its mission in part as supporting politicians who put labels aside and work across the aisle. No Labels aims to represent what it sees as the underserved “majority” of Americans, whose views lie in the center of the political spectrum, rather than at the extremes. Instead of policy and issues, the focus is on “attitude and approach”: finding ways to support and reward – rather than punish – politicians who reach across the aisle. The group’s “code of conduct” for politicians is centered on civility and respect. “What we are about is changing behavior,” says Ms. Jacobson. “And putting pressure on politicians to do just that.” No Labels has already drawn criticism and even derision from some (New York Times columnist Frank Rich mocked the group’s “faith in kumbaya as an antidote to what ails a polarized Washington”). But there’s evidence that its efforts have an audience. A 2010 survey by the Center for Political Participation at Allegheny College in Meadville, Pa., found a “growing concern about the implications of an uncivil body politic.” Citizens paying “close attention” to politics were four times more likely to say the tone in politics had gotten worse in recent years. And 95 percent said civility in politics was important for a healthy democracy. “To me, it’s so clear that it’s in the interests of the American people to have the parties actually dialoguing,” says Mark Gerzon, founder of the Mediators Foundation. Mr. Gerzon, who facilitated bipartisan congressional retreats from 1995 to 2007, points to a growing network of groups fostering Democratic-Republican dialogue at federal, state, and community levels. Efforts like this can have a profound effect, he says: By the end of a 1997 House retreat, “people said, ‘I don’t remember who’s a Democrat and who’s a Republican.’ ” Key to the retreat’s success, says Gerzon, were the ground rules: “No personal attacks”; “When others speak, listen”; “Be open to other points of view”; and “Treat the sessions as confidential.” It did change the way members did business, if temporarily. A study by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia found noticeable improvement in civility on the floor of the House immediately after the retreat. Members were more likely to express desire for compromise as name-calling, aspersion, and hyperbole dropped. An obstacle to a more civil tone, says Gerzon, is Congress’s setup, particularly in the House, where power lies with party leaders, who dictate strategy and punish those who fall out of line. “If [members] don’t want to play the A versus B game ... then they’re a traitor to the party. It’s a very uncreative way of creating legislation.” And extreme rhetoric is an effective – often irresistible – way to grab the spotlight. “One way to get attention is to be more vitriolic,” says Deborah Tannen, author of “The Argument Culture.” Politicians looking for visibility, and media worried about losing viewers, readers, or listeners, have incentives to amp up the volume. Ultimately, experts agree, when it comes to lasting change, both sides need a motivating force. “There has to be an answer to the ‘why’ – ‘why change?’” says Chasin. She gives the example of a series of successful dialogues she facilitated between a group of pro-choice and pro-life activists after the 1994 fatal shootings at two abortion clinics in the Boston area. Both sides, she says, were seriously afraid of further violence. “They had an answer to the ‘why’ – and they did it.” And while it may be hard to quantify what those discussions achieved in practical terms – “successful prevention is very hard to prove,” Chasin admits – the two sides found new levels of respect for one another. They shared information, and at one point went to the FBI together. The original plan for four meetings turned into a five-year dialogue. It’s too early to tell if the Giffords shooting acts as a similar catalyst, but in the short term, higher levels of restraint are apparent. A planned showdown over repealing parts of Mr. Obama’s health-care bill was postponed, and some are calling for new ways to come together. “I think an event of this kind has a profound impact on politicians,” says former Indiana Congressman Lee Hamilton, now the director of the Center on Congress at Indiana University. “At least for a period ... they will exercise second thoughts about very strong, vitriolic rhetoric.” Mr. Hamilton hopes the shootings won’t discourage members from meeting the public: “It’s terribly important to a representative to have that close touch.... A threat to that give-and-take is a threat to the very core of the democratic process.” The process may be contentious, but it’s no excuse for toxic rhetoric, adds Hamilton, who – as a leader of the Iraq Study Group and of the 9/11 commission, forged consensus on tough issues. “I think we have to get back to a much more civil discussion in the country – and to recognize that this is a great big complicated country,” he says. “We shouldn’t fall out of our chairs because someone disagrees with us, but the manner in which you disagree makes an awful lot of difference in society.” Already a subscriber?

          / CBS News TUCSON, Ariz. -- A lawsuit supposedly filed by the gunman in the 2011 Tucson mass shooting against his best-known victim and the federal government could be a hoax, reports CBS Tucson affiliate KOLD-TV, the source of the original story. The court filing, which appeared to have been made by Jared Lee Loughner and without a lawyer, alleges emotional and psychological distress and features bizarre accusations, including that the shooting was a setup and his original lawyer was a global spy who forced him to plead guilty. Loughner pleaded guilty and is serving seven consecutive life sentences, plus 140 years, for the Jan. 8, 2011 shooting that killed six people and wounded 13, including former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. The purported suit names Giffords and the federal Bureau of Prisons and seeks $25 million for emotional and psychological distress. It was filed in federal court in Arizona on March 18. But just a few days earlier, a similar suit was filed. That one was started on March 15, supposedly by Jason Brian Dalton, the Uber driver accused of killing six people in a shooting rampage in Kalamazoo, Michigan. That purported suit had Dalton suing Uber Technologies, Inc. for $10 million in punitive damages. It later turned out to be a hoax. According to a note on the Loughner filing, the supposed lawsuit could be thrown out because it does not follow proper form, KOLD says.

As a poster on Free Republic remarked, ""Look shortly for the leftist media to push the 'Gay, Hispanic-American Intern saving the Liberal Congresswoman's life from the Tea Party' angle."" Well, Freepers, here it is! It's not quite that simple, of course. However we try to understand the causes of the tragedy in Arizona and the political rhetoric of violence, it seems clear that there's considerably more to the disturbing story of shooting suspect Jared Lee Loughner than can be explained by pointing to a few wry Sarah Palin quips. And if simply being gay and Latino were grounds for heroism, Ricky Martin's face would be on the $10 bill. Daniel Hernandez is, by any measure, an extraordinary young man. He had been interning in Gabrielle Giffords' office only five days when an event at a local Safeway thrust him into the international spotlight for his quick thinking, bravery and competence in the wake of unimaginable violence. On the ""Today"" show Monday, Matt Lauer explained how Hernandez drew upon his high school training as a certified nursing assistant to check on the pulses of other shooting victims before noticing the severity of Giffords' wounds and, as he puts it, prioritizing her. He put her upright and held her in his lap as he applied pressure to staunch the blood. ""I could tell she had a severe gunshot,"" he said. ""I just tried to do my best until emergency medical services could arrive. My focus was on making sure I was doing everything I could to take care of her."" Even when the ambulance arrived, he stayed with her, because ""I saw my job then as not taking care of her medical needs but taking care of her emotional needs. I tried to comfort her and make sure she knew she wasn't alone. I let her know I was going to try to contact her parents and her husband."" In the two days since the shooting, Hernandez has emerged in interviews as a graceful presence with a no doubt promising future, with considerably much more going for him than his status as a minority. So why should the sexual orientation of this eminently competent, compassionate person keep coming up in this tale? Why is his ethnicity, and the fact that he grew up speaking Spanish and attending dual language schools, of any consequence?  Hernandez never asked to be the face of a movement. He doesn't represent any one group any more than Jared Lee Loughner is your typical white guy. And that's exactly why it matters. It matters because guys like Arizona Sen. John McCain, who described the repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell"" as ""a very sad day,"" still think that orientation has an effect on whether or not a person can ably serve in the military. It matters because the notion that two people of the same sex can love each other and build a life together is still considered in many parts of the country, including Arizona, a threat to what is laughably referred to as ""traditional marriage"" -- as if heterosexuals have really mopped up the floor with this whole commitment thing. It matters because last week, when Arizona banned a Tucson district's Mexican-American studies program,  state's Attorney General Tom Horne referred to it as ""propagandizing and brainwashing."" It matters because just last year Arizona enacted a law that would not merely allow but require immigration officials to determine the immigration status of anyone ""where reasonable suspicion exists"" that the person might be in the country illegally. And ""reasonable suspicion,"" as many civil libertarians pointed out, might just boil down to having a darker shade of skin or speaking Spanish. That's just Hernandez's home of Arizona. And though Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik scathingly referred to his state as ""a mecca for racism and bigotry,"" violence, racism and bigotry aren't confined to any one ZIP code -- they exist all over this great land of ours.  They exist just as surely as Hernandez shows that kindness and bravery are alive and well in Arizona. It's still far too easy for a small-minded yahoo to champion discrimination based on orientation and race, and it's just as easy for another small-minded yahoo somewhere else to believe the red states are indeed ""meccas of racism and bigotry."" If any good can come out of something as unfathomably horrible as Saturday's mass shooting, let it be that it shakes up a few preconceptions. That it shows the world that a hero can be gay or straight, can speak English or Spanish or both, and that stupid laws can exist in places full of good people. And anyone who has any doubt of what kind of person deserves to serve next to him in battle, or stand before their community and declare their love, or go to school, or walk down the street without being asked for paperwork needs to hear that and remember that, again and again until it sinks in. Yes, the ""gay Hispanic American"" saved a life on Saturday, and yes, it does matter. Mary Elizabeth Williams is a senior writer for Salon and author of ""A Series of Catastrophes & Miracles.""

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: WASHINGTON — The terrorist threat to the United States may be at its most “heightened state” since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and al-Qaida and its affiliates are placing increased emphasis on recruiting Americans and other Westerners to carry out attacks, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said at a congressional hearing Wednesday. Napolitano spoke before the House Committee on Homeland Security, whose chairman, Peter King, R-N.Y., is planning hearings on the threat posed by domestic radicalization and a growing incidence of U.S. citizens or legal residents involved in terrorist plots. “This shift, as far as I’m concerned, is a game changer that presents a serious challenge to law enforcement and the intelligence community,” King said. While Napolitano addressed the growing threat of homegrown terrorism, Michael Leiter, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, said al-Qaida’s leadership, based in Pakistan, is “at one of its weakest points in the past decade.” He said, however, that the pressure on al-Qaida has allowed its affiliates, such as the group’s allied organization in Yemen, “to innovate on their own.” “I actually consider al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula … (to be) probably the most significant risk to the U.S. homeland,” said Leiter, using the formal name for the Yemeni affiliate. “They’ve been quite successful at being innovators.” Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula has been tied to attempts to blow up a commercial aircraft over Detroit and two cargo planes traveling to the United States. One of the group’s leading ideologues, the U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, has been linked to Nidal Hasan, the Army major facing trial in the mass shooting at Fort Hood. The Yemeni group also has aggressively courted Westerners, an effort that has included the launch of an English-language magazine titled, Inspire. “It is spiffy,” Leiter said. “It’s got great graphics and in some sense we think probably speaks to individuals who are likely to be radicalized.” Articles in the magazine have called on supporters to launch their own attacks in Western cities. King asked Leiter whether he was concerned that threatening messages or signals were being sent through Inspire. “I think I’d take that more in a classified setting,” Leiter said, “but as a general matter, I think Inspire is attempting not to build a secret network between AQAP folks in the United States or other English-speaking countries. It is more looking to what the title suggests: inspire them to act on their own.” King’s focus on the radicalization of American Muslims has drawn criticism that his forthcoming hearings could indict an entire community. “There are a variety of domestic extremist groups more prevalent in the United States than Islamic extremists, including neo-Nazis, environmental extremists, anti-tax groups, and others,” Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., the ranking minority member on the committee, wrote last week in a letter to King in which he called for the scope of the hearings to be expanded. King rejected that idea, saying in a written reply that threats from “Islamic jihad were uniquely diabolical.” “The committee cannot ignore the fact that al-Qaida is actively attempting to recruit individuals living within the Muslim American community to commit acts of terror,” he said.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Reps. Mike Pence of Indiana and Greg Walden of Oregon unveiled this week the Broadcaster Freedom Act, which would ban the FCC from forcing broadcasters to give free airtime to opposing sides on controversial issues. (Reuters/AP) Seeking to hammer the final nail in the coffin of the Fairness Doctrine, two Republican lawmakers who are former broadcasters have reintroduced a bill that would prevent the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from regulating political speech on the airwaves. Amid calls for the reinstatement of the Fairness Doctrine after the assassination attempt on Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz, last month, Reps. Mike Pence of Indiana and Greg Walden of Oregon unveiled this week the Broadcaster Freedom Act, which would ban the FCC from forcing broadcasters to give free airtime to opposing sides on controversial issues. ""The American people cherish freedom, especially freedom of speech and of the press,"" said Pence, a former radio talk show host who introduced the same bill in the last session of Congress when Democrats still controlled the House. ""Bringing back the Fairness Doctrine would amount to government control over political views expressed on the public airways,"" he said in a statement. ""We must pass the Broadcaster Freedom Act and bury the Fairness Doctrine once and for all."" Walden, who owned and operated radio stations with his wife for nearly 22 years, said: ""The Fairness Doctrine represents an assault on the fundamental freedoms included in the First Amendment. Called the Fairness Doctrine or a code name like localism, this kind of outdated government regulation of political speech has no place in the modern broadcasting landscape."" Enacted under President Truman in 1949, the Fairness Doctrine sought to ensure that discussion over the airwaves of controversial issues did not exclude any particular point of view by threatening to strip broadcasters who didn't comply of their licenses. At the time, only 2,881 radio stations existed compared with roughly 14,000 today. A Supreme Court ruling in 1969 upheld the constitutionality of the regulation largely on the grounds that there were so few channels at the time. The FCC abolished the doctrine in 1987, casting its requirement that broadcasters devote equal time to all points of view an unconstitutional abridgement of free speech. Rush Limbaugh debuted on the nation's airwaves the following year and conservatives have dominated talk radio ever since. After the mass shooting in Arizona last month that claimed the lives of six people and wounded 13 others, including Giffords, Rep. James Clyburn, the No. 3 Democrat in the House, called for the reinstatement of the Fairness Doctrine. ""Free speech is as free speech does,"" Clyburn told the local newspaper. ""You cannot yell 'fire' in a crowded theater and call it free speech. And some of what I hear, and [what] is being called free speech, is worse than that."" But President Obama and FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn – the congressman's daughter – have said they oppose the regulation and it is highly unlikely to be reinstated with Republicans in control of the House.

Mr. Hunter's homage to semiautomatic firearms with high-capacity magazines borders on the fiction for which he is well known. His claim that the Virginia Tech and Fort Hood shooters did not use ""extended magazines"" is based on semantics and is disingenuous. The magazines may have not actually ""extended"" beyond the body of the handgun, but their capacity (at 15, 20 and 30 rounds, respectively) exceeded the 10-round limit that was in place before the federal assault weapons ban was allowed to expire. Mr. Hunter's argument that high-capacity magazines are rarely used in crime is also wrong. Starting with the horrific mass shooting at a California elementary school in 1989 that featured a semiautomatic AK-47 with a 75-round magazine, high-capacity magazines have been a staple of mass shooters and common muggers alike. A ban on high-capacity magazines might not have stopped the Jan. 8 shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.). But we know that for those injured by rounds 11 to 32, it could have made a big difference. Josh Horwitz, Washington The writer is the executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.    "

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Black and Associates Auctioneers Inc.'s Tate Heinzerling spots a bid for a 45 Eley Colt Single Action Army revolver, during the Western Americana High Noon's auction on Jan. 29, 2011 in Mesa, Ariz. The Arizona Legislature is considering a bill to designate a historic Colt revolver the official state firearm, angering gun-control activists who denounced the measure as insulting and a waste of time when the state is facing serious economic problems. (AP/The Arizona Republic) PHOENIX -- The Arizona Legislature is considering a bill to designate a historic Colt revolver the official state firearm, angering gun-control activists who denounced the measure as insulting and a waste of time when the state is facing serious economic problems. The measure comes less than two months after the deadly shooting in Tucson that killed six and wounded Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, a former Arizona legislator. The mass shooting has prompted gun-control supporters to push for tougher weapons laws, although that is unlikely to happen in an Arizona Legislature that has become a national leader in passing pro-gun laws in recent years. Sen. Ron Gould, sponsor of the bill, said he sees nothing wrong with honoring a firearm for its contribution to the state's western heritage. ""We spent about 120 seconds of committee time on that bill,"" Gould said. ""So it's not like it takes an overwhelming amount of time. Generally, everybody asking why we are doing this takes longer than actually doing it."" With the state centennial celebrations under way, Colt lobbyist Todd Rathner says the bill is fitting to honor the state's founders. Rathner said the Colt Single-action Army revolver played a major role in protecting the mines and settlements during the late 19th century. ""Arizona was founded by rugged individuals who took care of themselves and did so largely with a Colt Single Action Army Revolver on their hip,"" said Rathner, who is pushing the firearm bill which would make Arizona one of the first two states to recognize an official gun. Anti-gun activists like Hildy Saizow, president of Arizonans for Gun Safety thinks it's a bad idea altogether. ""First of all, that our legislature would be spending time on this when the public wants state legislatures to focus on things like the state budget makes no sense,"" Saizow said. ""What we need to be focused on is how do we prevent gun violence, that's the public issue."" Utah lawmakers have passed a similar bill to designate the Browning M1911 — a semiautomatic pistol — as the state's official gun. The bill awaits the governor's signature. The Senate Appropriations Committee voted 9-4 early Wednesday to advance the measure. The bill enjoys widespread support — almost half of the Legislature is co-sponsoring the measure.

We just need to enforce the laws on the books.""   How many times have you heard this argument from the gun lobby and its wholly-owned subsidiaries in Congress? And how many times have their actions on gun law enforcement exposed the hypocrisy of their words? It has happened yet again on the issue of gun trafficking to Mexico. It is now beyond dispute that more than 60,000 guns -- primarily military-style semiautomatic assault rifles -- have moved from American gun shops in the border states into the hands of the murderous Mexican drug cartels, and more are moving every day. Yet on Friday, the House of Representatives, heeding only the National Rifle Association's command, voted to block the Obama administration from implementing a sensible proposal that would enhance enforcement of our laws to curb gun trafficking to the Mexican cartels.   Cartel-related Mexican violence, fueled by the flood of American guns, has taken a staggering 34,000 lives in recent years. The victims are not Mexican alone. Last week a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent was killed, and another was wounded, in an apparent drug gang attack in the northern Mexican state of San Luis Potosi. Last month a Texas missionary was shot to death in northern Mexico. In March of last year, a U.S. employee of the American consulate in Ciudad Juarez and her husband were killed when drug gang members fired on their car as they left a children's party. Cartel-related violence has occurred on American soil as well, in the form of kidnappings and abductions from Las Vegas to Texas to Atlanta. Under the proposal advanced by the Justice Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, licensed gun dealers in the border states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California would be required to report to ATF multiple sales of semiautomatic rifles that can take detachable ammunition magazines, like the high-capacity magazine used in the Tucson mass shooting. This new requirement would give law enforcement officials real time notification of large-volume sales of such favored cartel assault rifles as the AK-47 and the AR-15, sales that typically are ""red flag"" indicators of gun-trafficking. Such notification would give federal enforcers a valuable tool to move quickly to disrupt trafficking channels -- and arrest the traffickers -- before the guns reach the streets of Mexican cities and towns. Take the case of Sean Steward, an indicted trafficker who, over two days in early December, 2009, bought 50 assault rifles at two stores and then, on Christmas Eve, bought another 40 at a store in Glendale, Arizona. Another accused trafficker, Uriel Patino, made multiple purchases of assault rifles on 20 separate occasions, including buying 40 on one day, 26 on another, and 16 on another. Federal law enforcers are prosecuting these traffickers, but long after the guns have made it into the hands of violent drug lords, exacting their grievous toll. ATF simply wants to find out about suspicious sales to traffickers as soon as they happen, to prevent the guns from reaching their deadly destination.   On Friday, the House, dominated by the Tea Party and their supplicants, heard all it needed to know from Rep. Dan Boren (D-Okla.), the sponsor of the amendment to block the ATF reporting rule: ""I remind my colleagues this amendment carries the full support of the National Rifle Association."" The NRA said ""jump"" and the House responded, ""How high?"" Why is the NRA so opposed to the proposed rule? The gun lobby's leaders offer two transparently bogus reasons. First, the NRA says the proposal ""only burdens law-abiding gun owners and retailers."" ""If someone is breaking the law, go after them full-bore,"" says Chris Cox, lobbyist for the NRA. ""If they aren't, leave them alone."" The problem is that the government needs information to determine who is violating the law and who is not, and then to prosecute the violators. The ATF proposal would give the government more timely information to permit federal agents to go after the traffickers ""full-bore"" before the guns do their damage. It may be that some law-abiding citizens also will have their multiple purchases reported, but how is this different than requiring all citizens to report their income to IRS, in order that the law can be enforced against those who are tax evaders?   As to the claimed ""burden"" on dealers, these are the same dealers who the gun industry is fond of portraying as ""partners"" with ATF in fighting gun crime. Yet when ATF says it needs the dealers to fill out an additional form to fight trafficking to drug gangs, the industry whines about the ""onerous"" burden and becomes a ""partner"" only with the NRA.  Second, the NRA trots out its ultimate bogeyman, claiming the ATF plan amounts to a ""registry"" of gun owners. If the ATF proposal is gun registration, then we have had a system of registration for handguns for the last 40 years. Since the Gun Control Act of 1968, federal law has required gun dealers to report to ATF multiple sales of handguns because such sales are strong indicators of gun trafficking. The proposed ATF rule would apply this same reporting requirement to some semi-automatic rifles, but only those sold by dealers in four states and only for a period of one year. No other purchase of a rifle need be reported to ATF (though records of all gun sales by licensed dealers are maintained by the dealers). The charge of ""registration"" is nothing but a typical NRA scare tactic.  Since 2006, 14 U.S. Custom and Border Patrol Agents have been killed, most recently Brian Terry, fatally wounded in December of last year with an AK-47. There is little doubt that more courageous federal officers will be struck down, with assault rifles trafficked from American gun shops. Perhaps the NRA bosses, and the House members they control, can explain to the families of the slain federal agents, and to those of the Mexican citizens who have lost their lives to drug cartel gunfire, the wisdom of depriving ATF of an important tool against gun trafficking. But please spare us the phony talk about the need to ""enforce the laws on the books.""

allow passage of a measure restricting gun owners to a 10-round
magazine, down from the current limit of 15, two sources with knowledge of the
deal said today. In exchange, the legislature will shepherd through a gun-owner
championed bill that would define what are known in the gun world as
""reasonable deviations"" to the law governing transport of a firearm. Currently a gun owner may only transport an unloaded, stored
weapon straight to the destination, be it on a hunting trip or to a gun range. Under
the law, a gun owner may detour from the route only for deviations that are
""reasonable."" But next week lawmakers will introduce a bill that would define
those deviations as small detours to allow for emergencies, picking up another
range goer or hunter or for short side trip like gas station stops and bathroom
breaks. Sources say the gun control advocates initially pushed back
against the bill but eventually agreed to the compromise after the early
measure was scaled back. As part of the fanfare surrounding the announcement of the
ammunition magazine limit, families of the young victims of the 2012 Newtown,
Ct. school shootings will be on hand to attend a press conference with
legislative leaders. The families, part of the advocacy group Sandy Hook Promise,
named after the elementary school where the shooting happened, have long pushed
for the magazine limit, saying it's a measure that does not restrict anyone
from gun ownership, but could still save lives. The magazine limit was initially passed last year in the
Assembly, but was held up in the Senate where Sweeney (D-Gloucester) refused to
put the measure for a vote.  At the time,
Sweeney called the current 15-round limit ""reasonable."" But two sources say Sweeney is now prepared to pass the 10-round
limit.  Assemblyman Lou Greenwald (D-Camden), who sponsored the measure in the
lower chamber last year, said the Assembly is fully on board with the proposal as well. ""We've been part of this discussion and we've always said there has to be a limit on magazine size,"" Greenwald said.  ""There is a position now that everyone is comfortable with that will allow the passage of both bills."" Fewer rounds in a magazine means more reload time, gun control
advocates say, and more time for people involved in a mass shooting to stop the
shooter or run away.  The drop, they say,
means only an inconvenience for gun owners, while it could save lives. ""The Governor should take to
heart the tragic experience of the Sandy Hook families as
well as their heartfelt commitment to safety from gun violence for all
Americans and sign the ten round maximum capacity bill when it reaches his
desk. It's about public safety,"" said Bryan Miller, executive
director of Heeding God's Call, a faith-based organization focused on
preventing gun violence.
""Opponents of this remarkably moderate and reasonable
public safety measure make clear their extremism, for no one needs more than
ten rounds for hunting, sport shooting or self defense."" Second Amendment advocates counter that the limit will only
apply to lawful gun owners and not to criminals who purchase their weapons
illegally. ""For the most part this is the same
feel-good, do-nothing legislation that the New Jersey legislature is so fond of
sponsoring,"" said New Jersey Second Amendment Society President Frank
Fiamingo in an interview earlier this month. ""As usual, the legislation
targets the law-abiding gun owner who has purchased a gun legally and does not
address the gangs and the career criminals who are committing the crimes."" It remains to be seen if the Gov. Chris Christie will sign
both bills.  Advocates say they have
received no indication from the governor if he supports the measures. A spokesman for the governor said Christie does not comment
on pending legislation. Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.

His speech consisted of a string of opportunistic arguments for even weaker gun laws, ignoring completely the tragic reality of what actually happened on January 8th outside that Safeway store. ""If Tucson taught us anything, it taught us this: Government failed. And when they tell you that a ban on assault weapons can make you safer, don't buy it,"" LaPierre raged. ""These clowns want to ban magazines? Are you kidding me? ""Their laws don't work, their lies aren't true. By its laws and lies and lack of enforcement, government policies are getting us killed,"" LaPierre told the audience that gave him a standing ovation. I'm not surprised that LaPierre misstated the facts and that he and his disciples missed the true lessons of yet another mass shooting. They've got their act of blindness to commonsense down to a science. It helps them with their agenda: any gun, for anybody, any place, and any time. But Americans who are seeking answers and who are willing to learn from tragedies can see clearly from Tucson that it's time to do something now to keep weapons out of the hands of the dangerously mentally-ill, drug abusers, and other dangerous and irresponsible people who shouldn't have such easy access to guns, or the high capacity ammunition magazines that allow them to fire over 30 rounds in just 15 seconds. The Tucson shooting did not occur in a state or city with restrictive gun laws, Mr. LaPierre, or in one of your so-called ""gun-free"" zones. The killer was not deterred by Arizona's policy of allowing any gun owner to carry loaded guns in public without a permit, and was not stopped by the nearby citizens with guns at the shopping center -- he was stopped when his ammo magazine emptied, something that would have happened 20 bullets earlier if the 1994 ban on those killing tools had not been allowed to expire in 2004. Last Sunday was the 100th anniversary of the birth of former president -- and conservative icon -- Ronald Reagan. Nowhere has that celebration been more evident than at CPAC, whose members desperately seek to clothe themselves in the mantle of Reagan's legacy. Speaker after speaker evoked the memory and wisdom of the nation's 40th president in honor of his 100th birthday. Considering those sentiments, it is odd that LaPierre would go to CPAC to spout insults, such as ""clowns"" and ""liars"" to denounce government policies endorsed by very man CPAC and conservatives across the country have spent the week honoring. President Reagan was a life member of the NRA who often expressed his belief in an individual's right to bear arms. But he demonstrated in his words and by his actions that he had a common sense understanding that there should be reasonable restrictions on the availability of guns. For example, in contrast to the NRA's current push for more guns in more hands in more places, Reagan administration policy kept dangerous weapons out of national parks. Regarding calls for sensible gun laws in the wake of Tucson, LaPierre told CPAC attendees that ""political elites"" were trying to fool Americans into believing that ""if we just pass another law or two we can stop a madman bent on a streak of violence."" It appears obvious that, unlike LaPierre, Ronald Reagan learned a much different lesson from a mass shooting involving an elected official. Expressing a view diametrically opposite LaPierre's, Reagan, whom no CPAC member would associate with the political elite, sent a letter in 1991 to Time Magazine titled ""Why I'm For the Brady Bill."" Ten years after being wounded along with three others, including his Press Secretary James Brady, in an assassination attempt by a mentally-dangerous individual, Reagan wrote: ""This nightmare might never have happened if legislation that is before Congress now -- the Brady Bill -- had been law back in 1981."" Following Tucson, many people in our country hope to stop the recurring nightmare of mass shootings by limiting access to high-capacity ammunition magazines. Thanks to a high-capacity magazine, the deranged Tucson shooter managed to kill six people and wounded 13 others, including Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, in a matter of seconds. Even so, LaPierre suggested to CPAC that banning assault weapons was some kind of joke. Reagan, despite being known for his sense of humor, didn't find the concept funny at all. In May 1994, the former president asked Congress to pass a ban on assault weapons. ""We urge you to listen to the American public and to the law enforcement community and support a ban on the further manufacture of these weapons,"" read a letter from Reagan along with former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. ""While we recognize that assault-weapon legislation will not stop all assault-weapon crime, statistics prove that we can dry up the supply of these guns, making them less accessible to criminals."" Ronald Reagan applied common sense, reason and respect for the sentiments of the American people on the issues of guns and gun violence. LaPierre, who even ignores the opinions of the majority of NRA members who favor reasonable restrictions on guns, doesn't come close to applying Reagan's wisdom. Even if LaPierre can't grasp the true lessons of Tucson, perhaps in the midst of the celebration of Ronald Reagan he can learn something about the steps true leaders are willing to take to curb gun violence in our country.

258441627,2011-02-17 17:36:33,Dennis A. Henigan: The NRA's Post-Tucson Contortions,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dennis-a-henigan/the-nras-post-tucson-cont_b_824580.html,en,False,"law and legislation,gun control,firearms,murders and attempted murders",27502,HuffPost,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/#,"Author, ""Guns Don't Kill People, People Kill People"" and Other Myths About Guns and Gun Control In the National Rifle Association's carefully constructed parallel universe, the governing narrative is that ""good people with guns"" prevent harm from ""bad people with guns,"" unless misguided gun control laws disarm the ""good people"". It is revealing to watch the NRA twist itself into contortions trying to fit the Tucson mass shooting into this narrative when everything about the shooting contradicts it. NRA leader Wayne LaPierre put his parallel universe on full display last week in his address to the annual Conservative Political Action Committee meeting. According to LaPierre, the killing of six and the wounding of thirteen in Tucson on January 8 proves that ""government failed"" and gun laws don't make us safer. Why? Because, he asserted, the shooting occurred in a government-mandated ""gun-free school zone,"" where presumably the shooter did not have to fear that a law-abiding citizen might confront him with a gun. LaPierre was referring to the federal law barring possession of a gun within 1,000 feet of a school, a law that the NRA adamantly opposed. He said the sidewalk in front of the Safeway in Tucson where the shooter struck was within 1,000 feet of a school located across the street. Even if this were true (and there appears to be a charter school nearby), LaPierre was wrong that gun carrying on that Safeway sidewalk in Tucson was illegal. The NRA appears to be unaware that the federal gun-free school zones law does not apply ""on private property not part of school grounds,"" like Safeway's sidewalk and parking lot. It also does not apply to individuals lawfully licensed to carry guns, of which there are many in Arizona, due to the State's ridiculously permissive laws.   In other words, the Tucson shooter had every reason to expect that Arizonans carrying concealed weapons might be present at the site of his attack. Yet he attacked anyway. In fact, even if the Safeway sidewalk were a ""gun-free zone,"" LaPierre's argument fixing blame on the gun-free school zones law assumes that Loughner chose to attack Rep. Giffords and her constituents at that location because he knew it was ""gun-free"". Is it really plausible to believe that Jared Loughner knew about the federal law, knew about a nearby school, believed that the Safeway was within a ""gun-free zone,"" and therefore assumed that he would not be challenged by a law-abiding Arizonan with a gun?   LaPierre is forced to embrace such an absurdity to direct attention away from the plain (but highly inconvenient) truth about Tucson: the shooting happened in a state that makes it easy to carry concealed weapons, in a place where the shooter had every reason to expect to be confronted by law-abiding citizens with guns. Yet Loughner was neither deterred by that prospect, nor prevented by other armed citizens from exacting his horrific toll. In his CPAC speech, LaPierre boldly declared, to loud cheers, that ""the best way to stop a bad guy with a gun, is a good guy with a gun."" LaPierre failed to mention that there actually was a ""good guy with a gun"" in front of that Safeway. His name was Joseph Zamudio. His gun had nothing do with stopping Loughner from continuing his carnage. Zamudio has said that he got to the shooter only after someone else had grabbed the gun from Loughner's hands. Zamudio added that he was prepared to ""shoot the person with the gun,"" and initially thought the hero who had the gun was, in fact, the shooter. Thankfully, Zamudio showed sufficient caution that he did not shoot an innocent person. But it is clear that his gun did no one any good that day and came dangerously close to adding to the carnage.   LaPierre also neglected to mention to the adoring CPAC crowd that under the nearly non-existent gun laws of Arizona -- the NRA's version of nirvana -- Jared Loughner himself was ""a good guy with a gun,"" at least until the instant he pulled the trigger. Loughner had passed a background check and was a legal concealed weapon carrier as he approached his targets. Thanks to the NRA, Arizona's laws are so weak that even if the Tucson police had known of the dangerous behavior that led to his dismissal from the local community college, they would have been powerless to take his gun away until he actually fired.   LaPierre ridiculed the idea that ""another law or two"" could save lives. ""If we could legislate evil out of people's hearts,"" he said, ""we would have done it long ago."" Decades ago, opponents of civil rights legislation made a similar argument, asserting that ""you can't legislate away hatred."" The argument was always a red herring; civil rights laws were not passed to eliminate hatred, but rather to protect people from the discriminatory effects of hatred. Similarly, gun laws are not passed to eliminate evil, but rather to protect innocent people from the death and injury caused when those with evil intentions have easy access to lethal weaponry. It was not a gun law that contributed to death and injury in Tucson, but rather the expiration of one. For ten years, we had in place a federal law limiting the capacity of ammunition magazines for semi-autos to 10 rounds, but that law inexcusably was allowed to expire in 2004 as part of the federal assault weapon ban. The Tucson shooter used a Glock pistol with a 33-round magazine, and he was able to fire over 30 rounds in about 16 seconds. Only when he paused to reload was he subdued by several unarmed citizens. There is no serious doubt that had Loughner been forced to reload after only 10 rounds, he would have been subdued sooner, with lives saved and serious injuries avoided. Wayne LaPierre has no response, except to label as ""clowns"" those who would dare make military-capacity magazines no longer available to the civilian market. LaPierre and the rest of the gun lobby bosses will persist in bending reality in service to their parallel universe. The real world was in front of that Safeway in Tucson, where free access to guns did not save lives, but took them.

649015738,2011-03-03 12:04:15,Keep Guns Off Campus,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dennis-a-henigan/keep-guns-off-campus_b_830842.html?utm_hp_ref=guns-on-campus,en,False,"education and schools,politics and government,law and legislation,colleges and universities,gun control,firearms,murders and attempted murders",27502,HuffPost,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/#,"Author, ""Guns Don't Kill People, People Kill People"" and Other Myths About Guns and Gun Control In the wake of the Tucson shooting, Arizona's legislature is considering various bills addressing guns and violence. The legislation with the best chance of passage has nothing to do with strengthening the state's laws to prevent dangerous individuals from easily acquiring the firepower that enabled Jared Loughner to shoot 19 people in about 16 seconds, killing six of them. Incredibly, the bill with the most momentum would force Arizona colleges and universities to allow the concealed carry of guns on campus.   The Arizona bill is one of many similar bills being pushed in states across the nation, as the gun lobby seeks to overcome the collective judgment of college administrators, faculty and students that allowing guns on campus is a recipe for disaster. Up until now, sanity has prevailed, as such bills have failed 43 times in 23 states in recent years. But the forces of ""guns everywhere"" are back, and pitched battles are underway, not only in Arizona, but in Texas and elsewhere. It all started with the Virginia Tech mass shooting of almost four years ago, which prompted ""gun rights"" proponents to argue that the shooting could have been stopped if one of the students in the targeted classrooms had been carrying a gun and could have returned fire. It is revealing that none of the students and teachers who actually were under fire that day have become proponents of concealed carry on campus. Indeed, Colin Goddard, who was shot four times in his French class, has become a crusader for stronger gun laws, as poignantly depicted in the documentary Living for 32, now being shown on college campuses coast-to-coast. (The movie was shown at the University of Arizona and Arizona State this week.) The argument supporting guns on campus is based on a bizarre assessment of relative risks. Its proponents seek to create the remote possibility that a legal gun carrier will be in the right place at the right time when a killer attacks, and will act effectively to stop the attacker, when the attack itself, particularly a mass attack, is itself a remote possibility. In order to create the unlikely chance of this ""good guy shoots attacker"" scenario becoming reality, the proponents of campus concealed carry seek to ensure a proliferation of guns in classrooms, dorm rooms, dining halls, sports stadiums -- anywhere where a violent attack may occur.   This necessarily means introducing a broad new array of obvious risks into everyday life on college campuses. Those risks seem anything but remote: that an argument between a professor and a disgruntled student will erupt in gunfire; that an intoxicated student will accidentally discharge his gun while showing it off at a Friday afternoon keg party; that a student's momentary despair over a romantic break-up will turn lethal as he finds a gun and turns it on himself. The pro-gun crowd assails ""gun-free zones"" that allegedly invite the violent to attack the unarmed, but the reality is that currently gun-free college campuses are far safer than the gun-saturated communities that surround them. Justice Department figures show that college students aged 18 to 24 experience violence at a 20% lower rate than non-students in the same age group. In addition, 93% of the violence against students occurs off campus.   Given that in most states gun owners must be 21 to carry concealed weapons, the ""guns on campus"" activists question why law-abiding adults licensed to carry in other locations should be barred from doing so on college campuses. Several obvious responses come to mind. First, the experience of states in making it easier to carry concealed weapons hardly recommends extending concealed carry to college campuses. The evidence is mounting that very dangerous people are being given concealed carry licenses, that they are committing egregious violence with guns, and that liberalized concealed carry is associated with more violent crime, not less. Why should we subject our largely peaceful college campuses to a policy that has led to greater danger outside those campuses? After all, Jared Loughner was a legal concealed carrier under Arizona law until he shot 19 people. Second, college campuses are particularly hazardous environments for widespread gun possession and carrying. They are populated largely by individuals aged 18 to 24, a highly volatile time of life and the age group with the highest incidence of such behaviors as binge drinking and drug use. Moreover, those young people live in dormitories, group houses and other high-density situations in which it is difficult to ensure that a gun always will be in the possession of the person licensed to carry it. The pressures of college life itself add to the risk, particularly the risk of suicide. Chancellor Francisco Cigarroa of the University of Texas, in an eloquent letter to Governor Rick Perry opposing concealed carry on campus, cited the concerns of ""campus health professionals, who know and deal with the reality of the emotional and psychological pressures of academic life, separation from family, relationships -- all pressures that contribute to the harsh reality that suicide is the second leading cause of death among college students.""   Finally, don't believe for a minute that the ""gun rights"" crowd is content to limit campus concealed carry to 21-year-old seniors and grad students. At the same time the gun lobby is pressing the Texas legislature to force Texas universities to allow concealed carry, the NRA is pursuing a lawsuit to strike down, as a violation of the Second Amendment, the Texas law setting 21 as the minimum age to carry concealed. If the NRA gets its way, it will be freshmen and all other students who will be eligible to carry loaded guns on campus. Students are standing with their professors and administrators in resisting laws forcing campuses to accept guns. The student government at the University of Texas has come out foursquare against such laws. Just this week, 57% of the Texas A&M student body voted against guns on campus. These are young people who have grown up around guns, yet understand they have no place on a college campus.   Ultimately, this is not just a campus safety issue. It also is an issue involving the core values served by institutions of higher education. It is difficult to imagine anything more destructive to an environment of academic freedom -- in which controversial issues can be passionately debated free of fear and intimidation -- than students or professors ""strapped"" as they participate in those debates.   Students, faculty and administrators get it. Do our lawmakers?

283885061,2011-03-06 18:12:26,Drive for Gun Control Blocked in Senate,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/us/politics/senate-obama-gun-control.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0,en,False,"politics and government,law and legislation,united states politics and government,gun control,firearms",1,New York Times,http://nytimes.com,"Advertisement Supported by By Jonathan Weisman WASHINGTON — A wrenching national search for solutions to the violence that left 20 children dead in Newtown, Conn., all but ended Wednesday after the Senate defeated several measures to expand gun control. In rapid succession, a bipartisan compromise to expand background checks for gun buyers, a ban on assault weapons and a ban on high-capacity gun magazines all failed to get the 60 votes needed under an agreement between both parties. Senators also turned back Republican proposals to expand permission to carry concealed weapons and to focus law enforcement efforts on prosecuting gun crimes. Sitting in the Senate gallery with other survivors of recent mass shootings and their family members, Lori Haas, whose daughter was shot at Virginia Tech, and Patricia Maisch, a survivor of the mass shooting in Arizona, shouted together, “Shame on you.” President Obama, speaking at the White House after the votes, echoed the cry, calling Wednesday “a pretty shameful day for Washington.” Opponents of gun control from both parties said that they made their decisions based on logic, and that passions had no place in the making of momentous policy. “Criminals do not submit to background checks now,” said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa. “They will not submit to expanded background checks.” It was a striking defeat for one of Mr. Obama’s highest priorities, on an issue that has consumed much of the country since Adam Lanza opened fire with an assault weapon in the halls of Sandy Hook Elementary School in December. Faced with a decision either to remove substantial new gun restrictions from the bill or to allow it to fall to a filibuster next week, Senate leaders plan to put it on hold after a scattering of votes Thursday. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader and a longtime gun rights advocate who had thrown himself behind the gun control measures, is expected to pull the bill from the Senate floor and move on to an Internet sales tax measure, then an overhaul of immigration policy, which has better prospects. More than 50 senators — including a few Republicans, but lacking a handful of Democrats from more conservative states — had signaled their support for the gun bill, not enough to reach the 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster. Democratic leadership aides said the effort could be revived if a public groundswell demanded it. “The world is watching the United States Senate, and we will be held accountable,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who helped lead the gun control effort. But with the families of Sandy Hook students in the Senate gallery and a flurry of gun rights phone calls flooding Senate offices, it was hard to imagine how much more emotion could be brought to bear. Aides to senators supporting the bill said that only outside circumstances, like another mass shooting, might cause those who voted “no” to reconsider their positions. “It’s almost like you can see the finish line, but you just can’t get there,” said Andrew Goddard, whose son, Colin, was hurt but survived the shooting at Virginia Tech. “It’s more annoying to be able to see it and not get to it.”  8 Photos View Slide Show › Mr. Obama — who avoided the gun issue in his first term and focused on proposals he thought had a better chance of passing, only to seize on expansive measures after the Newtown shootings — made last-ditch appeals to senators, including Dean Heller, Republican of Nevada, and Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire. Both rejected his entreaties. Standing in the Rose Garden next to former Representative Gabrielle Giffords and other victims of gun violence, Mr. Obama flashed anger as he said that the gun rights lobby had “willfully lied” about the legislation, and that Republicans and Democrats had “caved to the pressure.” “But,” he added, “this effort is not over.” For now, the gun rights lobby has proved more persuasive. The National Rifle Association mobilized members to blanket the Senate with phone calls, e-mails and letters. The group also spent $500,000 on Wednesday alone, on an advertising campaign criticizing “Obama’s gun ban” and using Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a deep-pocketed gun control advocate, as a foil. “Tell your senator to listen to America’s police instead of listening to Obama and Bloomberg,” the ad said. The action on Wednesday was initially supposed to be only the first series of votes in a debate to take days if not weeks. But as the measures’ chances faded this week, Senate leaders decided to rush the process, reaching a bipartisan agreement to hold nine votes in succession, each with a 60-vote threshold for passage. Using the 60-vote hurdle so early in the process allowed Democrats to prevent the passage of an amendment mandating that any state with a concealed-weapons law, no matter how rigorous, would have to recognize the concealed-weapons permit of residents from any other state. The amendment received 57 votes in favor, including those of 12 Democrats, and 43 votes against. Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, a lifelong backer of the N.R.A. who also pushed for new restrictions in recent weeks, made one last plea for his amendment, which would extend background checks to Internet and gun show sales. While acknowledging that “the politics are risky,” he said it was “a defining time in politics, where you know the facts are on your side.” The bipartisan measure, which had appeared to have a strong chance of passage, received 55 votes before Mr. Reid changed his vote to “no” to preserve the parliamentary right to bring the measure up again. Four Republicans voted “yes”: Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, a co-author of the legislation; John McCain of Arizona; Mark Steven Kirk of Illinois; and Susan Collins of Maine. An equal number of Democrats voted “no”: Mark Begich of Alaska, Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Max Baucus of Montana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. All are from states that Mr. Obama lost by wide margins last fall, and all but Ms. Heitkamp face difficult re-election campaigns in 2014. Debate over the measures consumed the Senate on Wednesday, with speeches from both sides meant to stir emotions. “I choose to vote my conscience,” Mr. Reid said, announcing his decision to vote for the bans on assault weapons and magazines that carry more than 10 rounds of ammunition, “because, if tragedy strikes again — if innocents are gunned down in a classroom or a theater or a restaurant — I could not live with myself as a father, as a husband, as a grandfather or as a friend knowing that I didn’t do everything in my power to prevent it.” The assault weapons vote was 40 in favor and 60 against. The magazine ban fell with 46 in favor and 54 against. Even a bipartisan amendment to impose stiff penalties on gun traffickers, which was supported by the N.R.A. and expected to be adopted by voice vote, instead was defeated, receiving 58 votes, as the partisan lines hardened. The successive defeats left senators on both sides of the issue dazed and disappointed. Mr. Begich said the Senate could have united behind measures with broad support, like strengthening the existing background check system with more data about would-be gun buyers who have been deemed mentally ill, rather than expanding the checks to sales not now covered. Mr. Begich also cited bolstering school safety, criminalizing gun trafficking and improving mental health programs. “That’s a lot,” he said. “Is it perfect? No. But it’s a lot.” Those modest steps, however, were sacrificed because other Democrats did not want to see further-reaching provisions fail at the expense of a package that the gun rights lobby wanted, aides said.

He's on a drug he calls ""Charlie Sheen."" But what powerful hallucinogen inhaled by the left induces the mental fantasy that makes them believe: Spending nearly a trillion dollars in ""stimulus"" money ""created or saved"" 3.5 million jobs? A ""tax cut"" means giving checks to the nearly 40 percent of the workforce that pays no federal income taxes? Racism drives the tea party/conservative/right-wing criticism of a left-wing black president -- who received more of the white vote than John Kerry, in every age demographic, and who at one time enjoyed an approval rating of almost 70 percent? Government can ""invest"" in ""green jobs of the future"" better than can the private sector, can pick winners and losers better than the marketplace, and can do this while not rewarding those with political influence or punishing those without it? The rich pay no taxes -- even though the top 1 percent of income-earners pay nearly 40 percent of all federal income taxes? Tax cuts only benefit the rich -- even though they disproportionately pay the income taxes (see above)? Federal and state budget problems can be solved by simply raising taxes on ""the rich"" and making them pay ""their fair share""? Governors' attempts to rein in public-sector compensation -- because it vastly exceeds the private-sector counterparts -- constitute an ""assault"" on ""all unions""? Expensive, anti-competitive, job-killing ""global warming"" regulations imposed on U.S. businesses can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions -- even though the No. 1 and No. 4 ""polluters,"" China and India, respectively, say, ""Go to hell, we're growing our economies""? ObamaCare adds 30 million uninsured to the insured; allows people to keep their doctor or health insurance; forces health insurance companies to ""insure"" applicants with pre-existing illnesses -- all while saving money, lowering costs and retaining the same quality? President Barack Obama presented a ""fiscally responsible"" 2012 budget -- even though it adds to the debt, continues high annual deficits and changes nothing about the three autopilot entitlement programs, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid? ""Greed"" and lack of Wall Street regulation caused the housing meltdown -- even though the Community Reinvestment Act, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and the Federal Housing Administration distorted behavior; pressured lenders to give loans to the ""underrepresented""; incentivized people who should have been renting to buy homes; and put taxpayers on the hook for the losses? ""ObamaCare"" is a racist and offensive word -- but not ""RomneyCare"" or HillaryCare? The Muslim Brotherhood is ""primarily secular""? Health care is a ""right"" -- but keeping a handgun in your own home should be a crime? Public education can be fixed by spending more money -- without allowing greater parental choice and more competition against government schools? If millions of illegal aliens would likely vote Republican, liberals would still support putting them on a pathway to citizenship? If convicted felons would likely vote Republican, liberals would still push to restore their full ""voting rights""? Right-wing ""vitriolic rhetoric"" caused the mass shooting in Tucson -- but left-wing rhetoric like MSNBC's Chris Matthews' description of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich as ""a car bomber"" does no damage? The Bush tax cuts for the rich ""caused the deficit"" -- even though Obama says maintaining the current rates for the top 2 percent of income-earners ""costs"" $700 billion over 10 years, or for each year, less than 5 percent of the current annual deficit? The war in Iraq caused the deficit -- even though the combined annual costs of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars represent about 10 percent of the current annual deficit? President George W. Bush and his policies made America hated in the Middle East -- even though polls show the Egyptians have a lower opinion of America under Obama than they did under Bush? Obama can convince Iran from continuing its nuclear weapons programs -- by criticizing Israel for building ""settlements,"" and by breaking missile defense promises made to the Czech Republic and Poland to get Russia's help in pressuring Iran? Bush ""admitted committing torture"" by approving waterboarding and is, therefore, a confessed ""war criminal""? Questioning Obama's place of birth or religion is insanity -- but not believing that ""Bush lied, people died""; Bush had prior knowledge of 9-11; Bush allowed America to be attacked on 9-11 to provide a pretext for war in Iraq; 9-11 was a government-involved inside job; and that WTC Building 7 imploded from planted explosives? Bush governed as an evil, civil liberty-crushing warmonger -- even though Obama continues the same war on terror programs and policies, including the use of the ""state secrets"" courtroom defense to prevent national-security-sensitive documents from being turned over to the defense; rendition; the terrorist surveillance program; the Patriot Act, including the despised library provision; drone attacks in Pakistan; and the continued use of Guantanamo Bay prison? Obama fulfilled his campaign promise to reduce the influence of lobbyists -- while members of his administration hold meetings off White House premises to avoid the requirement of having to keep a record of the meetings? So here's the question. As between Charlie Sheen and the nonsense-believing left-wingers, who should be drug tested? Copyright 2011, Creators Syndicate Inc.  Author Archive  More Tweets »"

Gabrielle Giffords, an Arizona Democrat, is able to follow conversations and instructions, occasionally speak in full sentences, express emotion and walk with assistance, her physicians reported Friday. In a news briefing that was almost entirely upbeat, the doctors at TIRR Memorial Hermann hospital here said they were surprised by the rate of Giffords' progress and noted that she was not discouraged or depressed. ""I am very happy to report she is making leaps and bounds in terms of neurological recovery,"" said Dong Kim, one of the neurologists on her team. ""She has made a tremendous amount of progress."" He stopped short of assuring that Giffords would be able to watch the April 19 launch of the space shuttle, which her husband, Mark Kelly, will command. ""We think there's a good possibility that she will be there,"" he said. But the rehab team needs to be sure such an excursion would be both ""safe and appropriate."" A breathing tube inserted in a tracheostomy, or opening in the front of her neck, was removed last week, which Giffords celebrated with a pumped fist, said Imoigele Aisiku, a critical care physician at the hospital. Giffords was wounded in the left side of her head Jan. 8 in a mass shooting that killed six people and wounded 12 others besides her. The left side of the brain controls language -- both speaking and comprehension -- in nearly all people. Kim said Giffords ""is clearly saying words she wants. She is starting to string words together. She can repeat anything we say to her."" That last capacity is especially important, he said, because it implies that the ""whole primary language area"" is intact. However, he did not provide examples of the kind or complexity of verbal tasks she is performing. Giffords has no memory of the shooting and would not be expected to remember it, the doctors said. She's been told about it and knows it is the cause of her injury. Her memory otherwise appears to be normal, both for remote events (such as experiences of childhood) and recent ones (such as day-old conversations). ""We don't think she is going to have any memory problems outside of that one event,"" Kim said. He added that they don't expect her to have vision problems, either. Giffords is undergoing three to five hours of therapy a day at the Institute for Rehabilitation and Research, a 119-bed rehab center in the huge, multi-hospital Hermann health-care system in Houston. Gerard Francisco, a rehabilitation physician and TIRR's medical director, said the staff has ""been kept busy reimagining and rethinking the rehab program"" because of the congresswoman's progress. That consists of adding new forms of therapy and making the ones she's already doing more difficult and complex. But he did not provide examples. Francisco and Kim said Giffords's personality -- she is known for enthusiasm and optimism -- is apparent. ""She hasn't shown depression,"" Kim said. ""She's been just very forward-looking, and even with the speech, she's not showing much frustration.""

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. AUSTIN, Texas – On her first day of class, 51-year-old Marie Kilian was talking with other students at Sam Houston State University about what to do if a gunman walked in and started shooting. Run. Tackle him. Throw textbooks. But all of those ideas seemed likely to get her killed. ""I am better able to protect myself in a Walmart than a college classroom,"" Kilian said Wednesday, testifying in support of legislation that would allow concealed handgun license holders to carry their weapons in college classrooms and buildings across Texas. As a license holder, Kilian said she would have another alternative: shoot back. Kilian was among dozens of students, faculty and administrators who testified before the bill was approved late Wednesday by the state House Homeland Security and Public Safety committee. Split along party lines, Republicans backed the measure on a 5-3 vote. It's the first step to becoming law. Supporters consider it a key gun-rights, self-defense measure to prevent violent campus crime such as the Virginia Tech shootings in 2007. Opponents, including some university and law enforcement officials, worry that students and faculty would live in fear of classmates and colleagues, not knowing who might pull a gun over a poor grade, broken romance or drunken argument. Texas has become a prime battleground for a national campaign to open campuses to firearms because of its gun culture and the size of its university system, which includes 38 public colleges and more than 500,000 students. Similar firearms measures have been proposed in about a dozen other states, but all have faced strong opposition, especially from college leaders. Texas would become the second state, following Utah, to pass such a broad-based law. Colorado gives colleges the option and several have allowed handguns. Former Texas A&M University student Adrienne O'Reilly said she was assaulted by a fellow student a couple of blocks off campus. At 5-foot-2, 115-pounds, ""a handgun is the only thing that gives me a fighting chance,"" said O'Reilly, who now has a concealed handgun license. ""One wrong word could set off a temper,"" countered Mickey Gressman, a student at Colin County Community College. ""A lot of people say it's for self-defense. Let's just fire campus police if they're not doing their jobs and everybody has to start arming themselves. ... More guns is going to cause a lot more trouble."" The Texas Senate passed a guns-on-campus bill in 2009, but it died without a vote in the House. This year, more than half of the Republican-controlled House's 150 members have signed on as co-authors of one of the bills, and the issue is supported by Republican Gov. Rick Perry. The chancellor of the University of Texas system recently wrote Perry and state lawmakers, saying school administrators do not want guns on campus, fearing a rise in college suicides and violent confrontations. Alice Tripp, lobbyist for the Texas State Rifle Association, which supports the bill, called college campuses ""predator magnets"" where violent crimes such as rape are underreported. Until the Virginia Tech killings, the worst college shooting in U.S. history occurred at the University of Texas at Austin, when sniper Charles Whitman went to the top of the administration tower in 1966 and killed 16 people and wounded dozens. Last September, a University of Texas student fired several shots from an assault rifle on a campus street before killing himself. Texas enacted its concealed handgun law in 1995, allowing people 21 or older to carry weapons if they pass a training course and a background check. The state had 461,724 license holders as of Dec. 31, according to the state Department of Public Safety. Rep. Joe Driver, R-Garland, author of House Bill 750, said the issue applies mostly to faculty, staff and parents because most students would be too young to qualify for a license. In 2010, only 7 percent of license holders in 2010 were between the ages of 21 and 25, Driver said. ""We're not talking about every student getting a gun,"" Driver said. ""I did not file this bill so (license holders) could be heroes in mass-shooting situations. I filed this bill to allow (them) to be able to protect themselves."" But some lawmakers on the committee noted that students are staying in school longer and getting older, raising the percentage of students who would qualify for licenses. A University of Texas at Austin student, Katherine Merriweather, said she was nearby when a student carried an assault rifle into a campus library and killed himself last year. The gunman was the only casualty. ""If another student had opened fire as a vigilante, I think the matter would have been worse with so many students in the library,"" she said. Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo testified against the bill, citing the potential for chaos if someone does begin shooting on campus. ""When you think about 21-year-olds, responsibility is the last thing they are thinking about,"" Acevedo said. ""Common sense says to me that guns on campus, like in bars, is not the right environment."" Driver's bill would keep a ban on guns in bars, churches, hospitals or athletic events on college campuses. It also would apply to private universities, but gives give them the option to ban concealed handguns after consulting with students, faculty, parents and law enforcement.

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: HOUSTON — A woman who fled to Nigeria last month after a fire at her Houston home day care center killed four children was returned to the U.S. on Monday and has waived extradition to Texas, authorities said. Jessica Tata, 22, landed at an Atlanta airport shortly after 5 a.m. on a flight from Lagos, according to the U.S. Marshals Service. Tata was booked into the Fulton County jail, where she will remain until authorities arrange to take her to Texas. U.S. marshals will head that effort. Agency spokesman Dave Oney said the transport process should be complete within a week. Tata waived extradition during a court appearance in Atlanta, sheriff’s spokeswoman Tracy Flanagan said. Tata was taken into custody Saturday in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. Authorities believe she fled to the West African nation two days after the Feb. 24 fire, which also injured three children. Investigators believe Tata went shopping and left all seven children alone before a stove-top burner that was left on ignited the blaze. ST. LOUIS — Hospital officials said Monday that doctors in St. Louis have given a terminally ill Canadian toddler a tracheotomy in hopes of extending his life by a few months. The 13-month-old’s parents brought him to Missouri last week after an Ontario court ruled doctors could remove his breathing tube because he is in a permanent vegetative state. Cardinal Glennon Children’s Medical Center said that Joseph Maraachli suffers from Leigh Syndrome, a progressive neurological disease. COLUMBIA, S.C. — A safety inspector admitted he never tested a children’s train ride that derailed over the weekend, killing a 6-year-old boy and injuring dozens of others, officials said Monday. Witnesses said the engine sped up just before it went off the tracks. Officials have not said what caused the crash Saturday at Cleveland Park in Spartanburg. The 60-year-old train, dubbed “Sparky,” was open a week early because of warm weather and supposedly was checked Wednesday by a state inspector. After the crash killed Benji Easler, the inspector came forward, saying he hadn’t been thorough. ABBEVILLE, Ala. — Nearly 70 years after Recy Taylor was raped by a gang of white men, leaders of the rural southeast Alabama community where it happened apologized Monday, acknowledging her attackers escaped prosecution because of racism and an investigation bungled by police. “It is apparent the system failed you in 1944,” Henry County judge and commission chairwoman JoAnn Smith told several of Taylor’s relatives at a news conference at the county courthouse. Taylor, 91, who is black, lives in Florida and did not attend. But her 74-year-old brother Robert Corbitt, who still lives in town, was front and center and said he would relay the apology to his sister. Taylor was 24 and married when she was gang-raped in Abbeville. She was walking home from church when she was abducted, raped and left on the side of the road. Two all-white, all-male grand juries declined to bring charges. BOSTON — A Texas construction worker horribly disfigured in a power line accident has undergone the nation’s first full-face transplant in hopes of smiling again and feeling kisses from his 3-year-old daughter. Dallas Wiens, 25, received a new nose, lips, skin, muscle and nerves from an unidentified donor. The surgery was paid for by the U.S. military, which hopes to learn how to better help soldiers with severe wounds. Wiens will not resemble “either what he used to be or the donor” but something in between, said plastic surgeon Dr. Bohdan Pomahac. Pomahac led a team of more than 30 doctors, nurses and other staff at Brigham and Women’s Hospital during the 15-hour operation last week. The Fort Worth man’s features were burned away and he was left blind after hitting a power line while painting a church in November 2008. The transplant won’t restore his sight, the surgeon said. WASHINGTON — Once again, the public is getting increasingly disgusted with Washington. It sees a failure to solve the most basic, pressing issues as Congress struggles to craft a federal budget. And incumbents are getting worried about the implications. “It’s hurting some of us,” said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who’s up for re-election next year. “They blame everybody.” A Pew Research Center poll shows about half of Americans think the debate over deficits has been “generally rude and disrespectful.” There’s even bipartisan agreement — 48 percent of Republicans and Democrats have that view as well as 57 percent of independents. President Barack Obama signed legislation Friday to provide funding to keep the government open until April 8, the sixth temporary extension. Pew surveyed 1,525 adults from March 8-14. The poll suggests the losers so far have been Republicans, who rode a wave of voter irritation to win control of the House last fall. PHOENIX — Astronaut Scott Kelly saw his sister-in-law, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, on Friday at a Houston hospital for the first time since she was wounded 2 1/2 months ago in a mass shooting in Tucson, her spokesman said Monday. Kelly was in the middle of a five-month space station mission when Giffords was shot in the head Jan. 8 while meeting with constituents. Six people were killed and 13 others were wounded, including Giffords, who is married to Kelly’s identical twin, Mark Kelly. After rushing to Houston a day after landing in a Russian space capsule, Scott Kelly visited her Friday. There were more smiles than tears, said Giffords spokesman C.J. Karamargin. JERUSALEM — Sarah Palin stayed out of sight Monday during her first trip to Israel, dodging paparazzi who hoped to get a glimpse of the former Alaska governor. A visit to Israel is almost a rite of passage for potential Republican candidates. Israel is a key ally and a top concern for Jewish voters. Palin’s two-day visit follows stops by former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, all potential candidates for president in 2012. — Associated Press, McClatchy Newspapers SORANGE, Pakistan — Rescuers used shovels and bare hands Monday to try to dig out miners buried after a gas explosion in a coal mine in southwestern Pakistan. Caskets were lined up to await the bodies from a blast that may have killed up to 52 miners. More than 200 people stood outside the mine waiting to hear news or to help. Since the accident Sunday, 27 bodies have been recovered. “We have yet to search the remaining two wings, but there is zero percent chance we can get anybody alive,” government mine inspector Iftikhar Ahmed said. Ahmed said the mine, owned by state-run Pakistan Mineral Development, was declared dangerous two weeks ago because of the presence of methane gas, but the warning was ignored by the contractor working the mine.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. RICHMOND, Va. – Virginia Tech will have to pay the maximum $55,000 fine for violating federal law by waiting too long to notify students during the 2007 shooting rampage, the U.S. Department of Education announced Tuesday. Department officials said in a letter to the school that the sanction should have been greater for the school's slow response to the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The $55,000 fine was the most the department could levy for Tech's two violations of the federal Clery Act, which requires timely reporting of crimes on campus. ""While Virginia Tech's violations warrant a fine far in excess of what is currently permissible under the statute, the Department's fine authority is limited,"" wrote Mary Gust, director of a department panel that dictated what punishment the school would receive for the violation. The university could have lost some of its $98 million in federal student aid. The department has never stripped a school of federal funding for such a violation. A university spokesman said Virginia Tech would appeal the decision. ""We believe that Virginia Tech administrators acted appropriately in their response to the tragic events of April 16, 2007, based on the best information then available to them at the time,"" spokesman Larry Hincker said in a statement. The department issued its final report in December, finding that Virginia Tech failed to issue a timely warning to the Blacksburg campus after student Seung-Hui Cho shot and killed two students in a dormitory early on the morning of April 16, 2007. The university sent out an e-mail to the campus more than two hours later, about the time Cho was chaining shut the doors to a classroom building where he killed 30 more students and faculty, then himself. The report also determined that the school failed to follow its own procedures for providing such notification. The report said Tech's failure to issue timely warnings ""deprived its students and employees of vital, time-sensitive information and denied them the opportunity to take adequate steps to provide for their own safety.""

RICHMOND, Va. — Virginia Tech will have to pay the maximum $55,000 fine for violating federal law by waiting too long to notify students during the 2007 shooting rampage but will not lose any federal student aid, the U.S. Department of Education announced Tuesday. Department officials wrote in a letter to the school that the sanction should have been greater for the school's slow response to the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, when student Seung-Hui Cho shot and killed 32 students and faculty, then himself. The $55,000 fine was the most the department could levy for Tech's two violations of the federal Clery Act, which requires timely reporting of crimes on campus. ""While Virginia Tech's violations warrant a fine far in excess of what is currently permissible under the statute, the Department's fine authority is limited,"" wrote Mary Gust, director of a department panel that dictated what punishment the school would receive for the violation. The university avoided the potentially devastating punishment of losing some or all of its $98 million in federal student aid. While that's possible for a Clery Act violation, the department has never taken that step and a department official said Tuesday it was never considered for Tech. University officials have always maintained their innocence and said they would appeal the fine, even though it's a relatively small sum for a school of more than 30,000 full-time students and an annual budget of $1.1 billion. The amount would cover tuition and fees for one Virginia undergraduate student for four years, or two years for an out-of-state undergrad. ""We believe that Virginia Tech administrators acted appropriately in their response to the tragic events of April 16, 2007, based on the best information then available to them at the time,"" spokesman Larry Hincker said in a statement. The Clery Act requires colleges and universities that receive federal student financial aid to report crimes and security policies and provide warning of campus threats. It is named after Jeanne Ann Clery, a 19-year-old university freshman who was raped and murdered in her dormitory in 1986. Her parents later learned that dozens of violent crimes had been committed on the campus in the three years before her death. The Education department issued its final report in December, finding that Virginia Tech failed to issue a timely warning to the Blacksburg campus after Cho shot and killed two students in a dormitory early that morning in 2007. The university sent out an e-mail to the campus more than two hours later, about the time Cho was chaining shut the doors to a classroom building where he killed 30 more students and faculty, then himself. That e-mail was too vague, the department said, because it referred only to a ""shooting incident"" but did not mention anyone had died. By the time a second, more explicit warning was sent, Cho was near the end of his shooting spree. ""Had an appropriate timely warning been sent earlier to the campus community, more individuals could have acted on the information and made decisions about their own safety,"" the department said in its letter. A state commission that investigated the shootings also found that the university erred by failing to notify the campus sooner. The state reached an $11 million settlement with many of the victims' families. Two families have sued and are seeking $10 million in damages from university officials. That case is set for trial this fall. Virginia Tech argues that, relying on campus police, it first thought the shootings were domestic and that a suspect had been identified so there was no threat to campus. The university argued that the Department of Education didn't define ""timely"" until 2009, when it added regulations because of the Tech shootings. Hincker, the university spokesman, outlined six other serious incidents at other college campuses before and after the Tech shootings in which notifications were not given for hours, or in some instances the next day, and the schools were not punished. ""The only reason we want to appeal this is that it gives us the process to explain how a notice given on one campus can be OK if it's this long, and a notice given on another campus is not OK if it's this short a time period,"" he said. ""As best we can tell, it's whatever DOE decides after the fact."" The education department rebuffed that argument, saying officials should have treated it as a threat because the shooter was on the loose. Through its appeal, Hincker said the university hopes to find out how the department came to its conclusion. School officials were never interviewed, he said, and the department refused to share materials or respond to Freedom of Information requests sent by the school. If the school loses the appeal, it could fight the fine in court. The money goes back to the Department of Education. Several victims' family members maligned Tech for saying it would appeal. ""This is in black and white,"" said Suzanne Grimes, whose son Kevin Sterne was injured in the shootings. ""They're going to spend more money appealing it than just paying the fine, because they do not want to admit they did anything wrong."" Lori Haas, whose daughter Emily was shot but survived, said she was not surprised by the maximum fine. ""I feel like it's par for the course, if you will, for what they are allowed to do,"" she said. ""I think it is a woefully, woefully, woefully sad amount of money for the staggering loss of life."" Andrew Goddard, whose son Colin also was injured, said even a smaller fine would have accomplished a purpose. ""The bottom line is just having a monetary amount points out what they did was wrong,"" he said. ""There's really no way you can replace 32 people, or even seek to equate that with money. I'm not too worried about the amount. Even if they charged them a dollar, it would have done the same thing."" Only about 40 schools have come under review for Clery violations in the 20 years that the law has been in place. The largest fine to be levied was $350,000 against Eastern Michigan University for failing to report the rape and murder of a student in a dormitory in 2006. S. Daniel Carter, director of public policy for Security On Campus, a nonprofit organization that monitors the Clery Act, said it's ""a shame"" the department had only really began fining schools for noncompliance in 2005. ""If the Department of Education had sent a stronger message about having to follow the law and that something faster would be expected sooner, the shootings at Virginia Tech may have never happened,"" Carter said.

An interactive attraction featuring gangster memorabilia and commentary from film mobsters James Caan, Mickey Rourke and Frank Vincent opens Wednesday on the Las Vegas Strip. And Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman, a former mob defense lawyer, plans to launch his Las Vegas Museum of Organized Crime and Law Enforcement later this year. For Las Vegas, the attractions represent an unprecedented embrace of its infamous founders. ""What differentiates us from any other city is our history,"" Goodman said. ""This is the story of America."" The desert oasis made famous by scantily-clad showgirls, ubiquitous slot machines and 24-hour happy hours has long celebrated its reputation as a haven of vice, but its relationship with the mob has taken a few hits in recent years. The city that once proudly boasted of its ties to organized crime —Goodman played himself in the 1995 mob movie ""Casino""— has instead promoted its family-friendly restaurants and Broadway shows for the past decade. No more. The Tropicana casino and hotel, a one-time hangout for organized crime now more known for its bargain-counter room rates, celebrated its new ""Mob Experience"" attraction Tuesday night with a red carpet party attended by ""Baywatch"" siren Pamela Anderson and comedian Rita Rudner, as well as a handful of mob heirs, including the son of Tony ""The Ant"" Spilotro, the inspiration for the bloodthirsty Joe Pesci character in ""Casino."" The sprawling casino attraction features the diary of mobster Meyer Lansky, Spilotro's gun and family photos and home movies from other infamous criminals. Visitors are greeted by life-size holograms of chatty gangsters and a chance to get ""made."" The publicly-funded mob museum, meanwhile, is slated to open in December at a downtown Las Vegas courthouse where a detailed mob hearing that helped expose organized crime to ordinary Americans was held in 1950. The $42 million museum started as an effort to save one of Las Vegas' few historic buildings. It's amassed a wide collection of gangster artifacts, including the wall from Chicago's St. Valentine's Day massacre, the only gun recovered at the mass shooting and the barber chair where hit man Albert Anastasia's life came to an end in a 1957 New York murder. ""This isn't some lampoon,"" Goodman said. ""It's not a gimmick. This is going to be a real museum."" The museum will highlight money laundering schemes, mob violence and the role organized crime played in Las Vegas and other cities. Both Las Vegas attractions expect to lure hundreds of thousands of visitors each year driven, at least in part, by the nation's unquenched fascination with the silver screen mob bosses of ""Goodfellas"" and ""The Godfather."" ""There is a certain excitement to think people who had done illegal things and got away with it were in charge here,"" said Alan Balboni, a Nevada historian. Neither attraction has sidestepped controversy. The Tropicana's Mob Experience was recently sued by the daughter of notorious gangster Sam Giancana over an alleged breach of contract involving the purchase of Giancana's furniture. Critics have also slammed the attraction for being too deferential to the family members of the gangsters. The exhibition glosses over the mob bosses' violent histories while praising them as handsome fathers. In one room, an actor asks visitors how a petty casino thief should be punished for his crime. ""Do we use a shovel on him?"" the actor asked an encouraging crowd during Tuesday's grand opening. At the same time, the mob museum has been hounded by criticism that Goodman, a longtime mob ally, is glamorizing organized crime. ""Why are any of these brutal killers being honored? This is nothing but gross sensationalism,"" said William Donati, an English professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and the author of ""Lucky Luciano: The Rise and Fall of a Mob Boss."" ""This is the image of Las Vegas that we want to portray?"" Donati said. ""What are they going to do next, have a show honoring the drug cartels of Mexico?"" To appease critics and burnish its academic credentials, the mob museum brought in historians, law enforcement officials and acclaimed museum leaders to help build its collection. Ellen Knowlton, a former FBI agent based in Las Vegas, said she initially worried the project would romanticize mob culture after Goodman asked her to head the not-for-profit museum. She focused on the consequences of crime and persuaded collectors and federal investigators to provide photographs, transcripts of wiretaps and other materials from various mob investigations. ""If you thought organized crime was a glamorous lifestyle when you walked into the museum, you won't feel that way when you walk out,"" she said. Like many of America's colorful cities, Las Vegas boasts a rich history of hustlers, gangsters and hoodlums. The city's backroom deals and money laundering schemes gained worldwide notoriety because of criminal legends such as Benjamin ""Bugsy"" Siegel, who ran the Flamingo hotel in the 1940s and named it after his mistress. The racketeer was implicated in at least 30 murders, according to the FBI. In later years, Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal ran the Chicago mob-owned Stardust, Fremont, Hacienda and Marina casinos. Unlike in other cities, where mob bosses fought for territory, Las Vegas was deemed an open playground for gangsters of all nationalities. ""This was the golden goose,"" said Michael Green, a historian at the Community College of Southern Nevada who is working with the mob museum. ""Las Vegas was a young enough city not to be bound by old elites and old rules."" Nevada's tightening regulations and increasingly corporate culture began to turn off mobsters in the 1970's, allowing Las Vegas to become the corporate-run tourist mecca it is today. There are still those who long for the past. Longtime casino workers frequently reminisce of the days when mob bosses delivered flowing tips and safe streets.

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: LAS VEGAS — Speakeasies, bootleggers, gun-wielding crime bosses and tough-guy accents pay homage to Las Vegas’ mob roots in a pair of new attractions showcasing Sin City’s criminal history. An interactive attraction featuring gangster memorabilia and commentary from film mobsters James Caan, Mickey Rourke and Frank Vincent opens Wednesday on the Las Vegas Strip. And Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman, a former mob defense lawyer, plans to launch his Las Vegas Museum of Organized Crime and Law Enforcement later this year. For Las Vegas, the attractions represent an unprecedented embrace of its infamous founders. “What differentiates us from any other city is our history,” Goodman said. “This is the story of America.” The desert oasis made famous by scantily-clad showgirls, ubiquitous slot machines and 24-hour happy hours has long celebrated its reputation as a haven of vice, but its relationship with the mob has taken a few hits in recent years. The city that once proudly boasted of its ties to organized crime —Goodman played himself in the 1995 mob movie “Casino”— has instead promoted its family-friendly restaurants and Broadway shows for the past decade. No more. The Tropicana casino and hotel, a one-time hangout for organized crime now more known for its bargain-counter room rates, celebrated its new “Mob Experience” attraction Tuesday night with a red carpet party attended by “Baywatch” siren Pamela Anderson and comedian Rita Rudner, as well as a handful of mob heirs, including the son of Tony “The Ant” Spilotro, the inspiration for the bloodthirsty Joe Pesci character in “Casino.” The sprawling casino attraction features the diary of mobster Meyer Lansky, Spilotro’s gun and family photos and home movies from other infamous criminals. Visitors are greeted by life-size holograms of chatty gangsters and a chance to get “made.” The publicly-funded mob museum, meanwhile, is slated to open in December at a downtown Las Vegas courthouse where a detailed mob hearing that helped expose organized crime to ordinary Americans was held in 1950. The $42 million museum started as an effort to save one of Las Vegas’ few historic buildings. It’s amassed a wide collection of gangster artifacts, including the wall from Chicago’s St. Valentine’s Day massacre, the only gun recovered at the mass shooting and the barber chair where hit man Albert Anastasia’s life came to an end in a 1957 New York murder. “This isn’t some lampoon,” Goodman said. “It’s not a gimmick.

Shirley DeLucia, who played dead under her desk at the American Civic Association in Binghamton, says the only point of those magazines is to inflict as much carnage as possible, like in the recent shooting in Tucson. DeLucia says she’s haunted by that day’s “horror” in flashbacks, nightmares and lasting physical effects. Pending legislation, with 106 House co-sponsors, would ban magazines holding more than 10 rounds. A similar ban expired in 2004.

It's not enough. And if we're going to change what we've been doing, we have to talk about what's good, what's bad, and what's ugly about America's approach and policies. After the shocking mass shooting in Tucson on January 8, we called on the Obama Administration to begin a conversation about the issue of gun violence in America. Finally, nine weeks later -- after 2,000 more gun murders, a spike in the shootings of police officers, and a flood of guns being illegally trafficked, not only to Mexico, but also to cities throughout this country - the Obama Administration has told us that it's paying attention to the frequent death and injury facilitated by the all too easy access to guns. Last Sunday, President Obama delivered a statement on gun violence prevention in an op-ed published in the Arizona Daily Star. He affirmed his belief in the Second Amendment while also recognizing that, because of gun violence, ""every single day, America is robbed of more futures...And as a society, we have a responsibility to do everything we can to put a stop to it."" ""I'm willing to bet that responsible, law-abiding gun owners agree that we should be able to keep an irresponsible, law-breaking few -- dangerous criminals and fugitives, for example -- from getting their hands on a gun in the first place,"" the President also declared. On Tuesday, I attended a meeting at the U.S. Justice Department with representatives from the White House, the Vice-President's office, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the FBI, and others from the Obama Administration, along with leaders from the gun violence prevention movement, to discuss how to reach the goals outlined in the President's statement. Officials from the Administration indicated that this was the first of what they hoped would be a series of discussions. They said they had not settled on, or excluded, any relevant proposals. I began the discussion by listing basic measures that the Brady Campaign, and others, felt could make a difference. The list included: a strong background check system, with good and complete records of dangerous and irresponsible people, applicable to all commercial gun sales; more tools for law enforcement to stop trafficking in illegal guns; increasing the number and type of military-style weapons, including ""assault clips,"" that should not be readily available to civilians, like machine-guns and fully automatic weapons. Administration officials then asked questions. My colleagues and I gave examples and arguments for legislative, administrative, and voluntary policies that could help reduce the bloodshed. The meeting lasted more than 90 minutes. Having this many Administration representatives spend this much time on this initial meeting signaled to me that the President is serious. He wants to do something meaningful about gun violence. After meeting with others, including law enforcement and ""gun rights"" groups, Obama's representatives will be presenting specific proposals. We hope those will include all the ""sound and effective steps"" that the President called for in his statement. Sadly, National Rifle Association Boss Wayne LaPierre has decided that he and the leadership of his organization aren't willing even to engage with the Obama Administration or the rest of the nation in a conversation about what can be done to reduce the tremendous loss of life that we Amercians suffer from gun violence. Solving challenges begins with a frank discussion - and that's what we need - not posturing that allows the situation to get worse. Regardless of party or ideology, Americans of all backgrounds and circumstances should be working on ""preventing future bloodshed"" and forging ""a nation worthy of our children's futures,"" as the President said. I thank President Obama for making the most significant presidential statement on gun violence in a decade and for starting this conversation. I'm hopeful that we will engage the nation and Congress around sound and serious ideas of how to protect more Americans from the threat of gun violence. And after the talking, then we need action.

1282411850,2011-04-07 17:16:34,"Gunman Opens Fire at School in Brazil, Killing 12 Children",https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/08/world/americas/08brazil.html?module=inline,en,False,,1,New York Times,http://nytimes.com,"Advertisement Supported by By Alexei Barrionuevo RIO DE JANEIRO — As family members mourned their loved ones and kept vigil at hospitals for the injured, this city searched for understanding Thursday after a shooting at a public school left 12 students dead and 12 others wounded. Brazil is no stranger to urban violence, especially the kind of violence in gang-controlled slums that have given this city one of the highest murder rates in the world. But the specter of the schoolhouse massacre was thought to be a mostly American affliction. On Thursday, the Tasso da Silveira elementary and middle school, a three-story aqua-and-yellow schoolhouse in the working-class neighborhood of Realengo, on the west side of Rio, joined the ranks of Columbine High School in 1999 and Virginia Tech University in 2007, sites of other school shootings. For the victims’ families, the massacre brought those tragedies home. “We hear about terrorists abroad and we think it will never happen here,” said Clemilson Perreira Chagas, 30, whose cousin Jessica Perreira, 15, was killed Thursday. “But it does.” The police said that Wellington Menezes de Oliveira, 24, entered Tasso de Silveira around 8 a.m. A former student at the school, Mr. Oliveira told a teacher who recognized him that he was there to speak to a class. Minutes later, with an ammunition belt strapped to his waist and a .38-caliber pistol in one hand and a .32-caliber gun in the other, he opened fire wildly in two first-floor classrooms. The classroom walls are covered with bullet holes from the shots that missed, the police said. The children began running and trying to hide. A boy who was wounded fled the school and found a police officer nearby, officials said. The officer, Sgt. Marcio Alves, saw Mr. Oliveira leaving a classroom and ordered him to drop the guns. Mr. Oliveira ignored the order and began climbing a staircase to more classrooms, Sergeant Alves recounted later. Sergeant Alves shot, hitting the gunman in the leg. Mr. Oliveira then shot himself in the head. During the attack, having stopped to reload twice, Mr. Oliveira killed 10 girls and 2 boys, ages 12 to 14. They died from bullet wounds mostly to the head and chest, said Martha Rocha, the chief of Rio’s Civil Police. A letter found in Mr. Oliveira’s pocket made it clear that the attack was premeditated, and that he intended to die, but it offered no motive for the shootings. Instead, he left explicit instructions for his burial — he wanted to be near his adopted mother, who died in 2009 — and the disposition of his house, which he wanted to donate to an animal shelter. He asked to be buried in a way that reflected some aspects of Islamic tradition, including in a white sheet he said he left in a bag on the first floor of the school, but he also asked Jesus for eternal life. In the only reference to his deed, he sought “God’s forgiveness for what I have done.” A longtime neighbor and former member of Mr. Oliveira’s church said Mr. Oliveira had been a lifelong Jehovah’s Witness before turning to Islam two years ago. Other neighbors on the street where he grew up said he had few friends and spent many hours in front of his computer on social networking sites. In the past year, several said, he had taken to wearing black clothing. “People thought it was strange when he began wearing black, but we could never imagine he was going to do something like this,” said Fabio Santos, 27, who said he knew him for more than 10 years. “Maybe it was because his mother and grandmother had died.” After his mother died, he and his father moved away. It was around that time that he left his job as a warehouse manager for a food exporter, Mr. Santos said. Mr. Oliveira came back to the Realengo house alone now and again, neighbors said. “He was a very lonely person,” said Elda Lira, 55, a neighbor who said she had known him since he was a baby. “He was always isolated and in his own world.” Sérgio Cabral, Rio’s governor, called him an “animal and psychopath.” Mr. Cabral has been at the heart of efforts to reduce gun violence in Rio ahead of the city’s twin billing on the world stage — the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games. But those efforts have been focused on clearing out violent drug gangs from some of Rio’s most dangerous slums, not on securing schools from armed former students. Brazil has also been struggling to contain the flow of arms that feed the violence. With students and family members in a state of shock, Eduardo Paes, Rio’s mayor, said the school would remain closed on Friday. But family members of the victims questioned whether the school should ever reopen. “I heard there was blood splattered all over the school,” said Bianca Assis, 24, whose cousin Edson Clayton, 14, was among the wounded. “What mother will allow her child to ever go back there?” As a minimum, she said, the state needed to provide more security in the schools. “If the school continues to be open” to unchecked visitors, “these kinds of things will continue to happen,” Ms. Assis said. “Today we had dead people, tomorrow we will have rapes.” Friends and family members huddled outside the Albert Schweitzer Hospital on Thursday, waiting anxiously for news, as surgeons inside treated wounded students. By early afternoon, news of the shooting had spread throughout the country, shocking officials. President Dilma Rousseff became visibly emotional at an event in Brasília when she asked those present to observe a minute of silence for the “defenseless children” in Realengo. “This type of crime is not characteristic of our country,” she said. “All of us here, men and women, are united to repudiate this type of violence.” Advertisement"
