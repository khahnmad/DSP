The victims — three women and a man — were at a residence in the Englewood neighborhood when the bullets started flying around 5:45 a.m. CT, Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown said. All four four were pronounced dead at the scene, a house in the 6200 block of South Morgan Street, Brown said. Brown released no other details about the four victims or what sparked the latest outbreak of gun violence in the Windy City. He said no arrests have been made and there was no sign of forced entry, but police have found shell casings inside the house and a large-capacity “drum magazine.” Mayor Lori Lightfoot called the mass shooting “a tragedy that’s ripped apart families and inflicted intense trauma on several individuals.” “It tells us that we still have much work to do in our mission to end gun violence here in Chicago and in particular, to limit the access of individuals to illegal guns,” Lightfoot said. Meanwhile, three men and a woman were recuperating in nearby hospitals police said. The woman was in critical condition at the University of Chicago Medical Center. Two men, ages 25 and 41, were both shot in the backs of their heads. Their conditions were not immediately available. Both are at Christ Hospital. Also, a 23-year-old man who had been shot in the back managed to get himself to St. Bernard Hospital and has since been transferred to the University of Chicago Medical Center. His condition was not known. A 2-year-old girl was removed from the residence and taken to Comer Children’s Hospital to be checked out, but did not appear to be injured, the Chicago Sun-Times reported, citing the police. It was the third mass shooting on the Southside in a little over the week. But before the recent spate of deadly shootings, violent crime had been declining in Chicago this year, according to police. While homicides tend to peak in big cities like Chicago this time of year, May was the second straight month the number of homicides in the city declined compared to the same month last year, police said. There was also less violent crime over Memorial Day weekend compared to last year. Corky Siemaszko is a senior writer for NBC News Digital. © 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL"

Shots reportedly broke out after an argument at a house in the Engelwood neighborhood of Chicago’s South Side reached a boiling point just before 6 a.m., The AP reported. The four shot and killed during the incident were all women, but police have yet to release their ages or identity, according to The AP.

However, police spokesman Tom Ahern said that investigators are searching for witnesses of the shooting to determine if whether there were multiple gunmen involved. Ahern also added that authorities were able to take a child safely from the house and put the child into protective custody, according to The AP. Tyrese Taylor was shot several times around 1:45 p.m. on a sidewalk in the 1100 block of South Karlov Avenue, not far from a U-Haul van the family had been loading. https://t.co/8YQvwsxjmI — ABC 7 Chicago (@ABC7Chicago) June 11, 2021  The Tuesday morning shooting in Engelwood comes on the heels of another mass shooting in Chicago’s South Side that left nine injured and one dead after two gunmen shot at a group standing on a sidewalk, according to The AP. Chicago, like many other major U.S. cities, has experienced a surge in violent crimes such as homicide over the past year. As of June 13, there have been 282 homicides in Chicago in 2021, outpacing 2020’s 269 homicides, according to The AP. Increases in violent crime have been particularly evident in areas that have seen Black Lives Matter and anti-police protests, some of which devolved into riots.

This one is by Madison Xu, age 16. By The Learning Network This essay, by Madison Xu, age 16, from Horace Mann School in the Bronx, N.Y., is one of the Top 10 winners of The Learning Network’s Eighth Annual Student Editorial Contest, for which we received 11,202 entries. You can find the work of all the winners and runners-up here. We Cannot Fight Anti-Asian Hate Without Dismantling Asian Stereotypes A few weeks ago, my aunt decided to close the nail salon she had been running for years. Early on in the pandemic, her business was hit hard, regulars refusing to return and associating her salon with the spread of Covid. Now, she fears for the safety of her salon employees — most of them Asian and Asian-American women. The New York Times has documented a surge of anti-Asian hate crimes during the coronavirus pandemic, including the deaths of six Asian women during the recent mass shooting in Atlanta. These incidents have rightly sparked protests and outrage, yet there can be no effective response unless we look beyond easy explanations. Talk of the former president’s xenophobic rhetoric, or the shooter’s “sex addiction,” only serves to distract from the underlying issue: America’s history of stereotyping, fetishizing and oppressing Asians and Asian-Americans — especially women. By the 20th century, mainstream media and popular culture had already categorized Asian women into tropes still resonant today, from the hypersexual “Dragon Lady” to the docile “Lotus Flower.” Predating the Chinese Exclusion Act, the Page Act of 1875 made it unlawful for East Asian women to enter the United States without proof that they were “virtuous.” That Asian women were painted as a “moral contagion” becomes even more chilling when juxtaposed with the Atlanta shooter’s claim that the massage parlors were, “a temptation for him that he wanted to eliminate.” Objects of desire easily become objects of hatred. The key: both are things for the dominant class to fetishize, feel entitled to — or dispose of. By now, many Americans understand how negative stereotypes of Black and Latinx people in the United States have enabled police brutality, anti-immigrant hysteria and violence. However, we tend to react differently to Asian stereotypes. While there are plenty of derogatory tropes (think bad drivers who eat dogs), Asians in this country are often viewed as smart and industrious — a “model minority.” But the truth is, all stereotypes are ultimately dehumanizing, stripping people of their individuality and objectifying them in ways that can lead to shameful violations like the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. Perhaps most dangerously, stereotypes like the submissive “Oriental” serving girl create artificial roles that women are forced to play, or to be punished for “not knowing their place.” When the dominant class feels threatened, even model minorities suddenly become invading Others, the alien “them” displacing “us” and threatening what is rightfully “ours.” Until we stop regarding Asian stereotypes and the fetishization of Asian women as innocuous, Asians and Asian-Americans will continue to face the threat of racist violence. Recognizing that anti-Asian prejudice is deeply rooted in American history is the first step toward dismantling those dangerous stereotypes.

After extending her condolences to the families of the four people killed and the four others wounded, Lightfoot said what Chicago needs is a partnership with Washington to stem the flow of illegal guns into the city. Though she didn’t elaborate, and while it is not yet clear whether illegal guns were involved in Tuesday’s shooting, she revived her demands for stricter gun control laws nationwide and said the type of heightened violence that has plagued the city recently is not unique to Chicago. “This is a national problem, and it needs a national solution,” Lightfoot said during an unrelated news conference. But when asked about how Chicago can safely reopen from the coronavirus pandemic with crime still present, the mayor balked and said, “The reality is our city is safe. And I stand by that.” Illinois could become the first Midwest state to ban energy companies from burning coal to generate electricity, with the end of gas-fired power possibly to follow. Phasing out combustion fuels — coal by 2035 and gas a decade later — is a key element of Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s plans to move Illinois into a clean energy future, but he first needs to muscle his legislation through Springfield this week. And on Monday, Lightfoot and Chicago Public Schools selected the district’s interim CEO, turning to longtime educator José Torres, who was previously president of the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy in Aurora and, before that, superintendent of Elgin-based District U-46. Welcome to the Spin. The Tribune’s Katherine Rosenberg-Douglas, Paige Fry, Jeremy Gorner and Gregory Pratt reported on at least the third mass shooting on the South Side in less than two weeks — and how the mayor responded as the city grapples with a spike in violence that began at the start of 2020. The latest mass shooting, which happened in a residential building in the 6200 block of South Morgan Street around 5:40 a.m., left four people dead and four others hospitalized, Chicago police said. Lightfoot called the shooting “a tragedy that’s ripped apart families and inflicted intense trauma on several individuals.” The mayor added that President Joe Biden’s administration reached out Tuesday morning following the mass shooting. She also said she spoke with several of her counterparts across the country regarding this weekend’s mass shooting in Austin, Texas, and she made a renewed plea for gun control. It’s an argument she makes frequently — as did her predecessors Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Richard M. Daley. “It tells us that we still have much work to do in our mission to end gun violence here in Chicago and in particular, to limit the access of individuals to illegal guns,” Lightfoot said. The mayor often has blamed the surge in violent crime on the pandemic and its ripple effects, such as the court system being largely closed for many months. But critics question the city’s strategies and leadership. That has led to occasional tensions between the city and county criminal justice system, with more finger-pointing Tuesday as Lightfoot said she fundamentally disagrees with an analysis by the Cook County state’s attorney’s office that Chicago police are making too many “nonviolent” gun arrests of people without prior convictions. “We are a city that’s awash in illegal guns,” Lightfoot said. “Those illegal guns cause deep pain and injury and death so the suggestion that somehow the Police Department is wasting its time arresting people who illegally possess firearms at the height of this crisis, I just fundamentally disagree with that.” More here. Chicago police sergeant alleges commander sent officers to the block his home sits on during last year’s unrest, the Tribune’s Annie Sweeney and William Lee write.

Pratt writes: “Lightfoot on Monday said a much-circulated email in which she berated an aide was ‘born out of frustration’ and she’s now in ‘a better place’ with her team. “In late January, Lightfoot sent her then-scheduler an email complaining that she doesn’t get enough of what she called ‘office time.’ That’s typically a less structured part of the day when the mayor can think, write or make long-term plans. “While it’s common for politicians to give staff members specific direction, it’s the way Lightfoot delivered her feedback that raised eyebrows in government and political circles. Lightfoot repeated several sentences — one 16 times — to highlight her displeasure over her schedule. “‘I need office time everyday!’ Lightfoot wrote 16 times in a row in the email, which the Tribune obtained via an open records request. “‘Not just once a week or some days, everyday!’ she wrote, 10 times.” More here. Illinois, one of the nation’s largest producers of coal, is on the verge of becoming the first Midwest state to ban energy companies from burning the lung-damaging, climate-changing fossil fuel to generate electricity, my colleague Michael Hawthorne writes. The end of gas-fired power might not be far behind. Phasing out the combustion fuels — coal by 2035 and gas a decade later — is a key element of Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s plans to move Illinois into a clean energy future. If the Chicago Democrat can push his legislation through the General Assembly this week, new government requirements would speed up a transition to climate-friendly electric generation and transportation that already is embraced by some in the private sector. Among other things, the bill would double the state’s commitment to renewable energy, with a goal of raising the amount of wind and solar power to 40% of the state’s electric generation by the end of the decade, up from 8% in 2019. As a state Senate committee convened ahead of a full chamber session Tuesday, however, it was clear a deal had not yet been reached, and the bill remained a work in progress. Rockton chemical fire could take 7 days to burn out, fire chief says, the Tribune’s Navya Gupta reports. More than a month after Chicago Public Schools CEO Janice Jackson announced her departure from head of the third-largest school district in the U.S., longtime educator José Torres was tapped to steer the ship until Jackson’s permanent replacement is found, Pratt and the Tribune’s Hannah Leone report. Lightfoot said Torres is not a candidate for the nationwide search for the permanent CEO. Torres recently left the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy in Aurora after more than six years as its president. Previously, he was superintendent of Elgin-based District U-46 — the second-largest school system in Illinois, following CPS — and served on the U.S. Department of Education’s Equity and Excellence Commission, according to his IMSA biography, which also states he holds three degrees from the University of Maryland, including a doctorate in educational administration. He will be at the helm of a school system that endured a two-week teachers strike in 2019 followed by a total shutdown of schools during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and a protracted fight with the Chicago Teachers Union over subsequently reopening them. Michael Smith, a youth programming director at the Obama Foundation and executive director of the former president’s My Brother’s Keeper Alliance, will be Biden’s nominee for CEO of the AmeriCorps service organization, the White House said Tuesday. He must be confirmed by the Senate. Smith said in a tweet, “No matter where I go, the proudest title I will ever hold is my brother’s keeper. I have never been more optimistic about how this mantra that became a movement will continue to grow.” Thanks for reading The Spin, the Tribune’s politics newsletter.

Lightfoot said Torres is not a candidate for the nationwide search for the permanent CEO. Torres recently left the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy in Aurora after more than six years as its president. Previously, he was superintendent of Elgin-based District U-46 — the second-largest school system in Illinois, following CPS — and served on the U.S. Department of Education’s Equity and Excellence Commission, according to his IMSA biography, which also states he holds three degrees from the University of Maryland, including a doctorate in educational administration. He will be at the helm of a school system that endured a two-week teachers strike in 2019 followed by a total shutdown of schools during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and a protracted fight with the Chicago Teachers Union over subsequently reopening them. Michael Smith, a youth programming director at the Obama Foundation and executive director of the former president’s My Brother’s Keeper Alliance, will be Biden’s nominee for CEO of the AmeriCorps service organization, the White House said Tuesday. He must be confirmed by the Senate. Smith said in a tweet, “No matter where I go, the proudest title I will ever hold is my brother’s keeper. I have never been more optimistic about how this mantra that became a movement will continue to grow.” Thanks for reading The Spin, the Tribune’s politics newsletter.

The comments from the mostly liberal, white people excusing the criminal would be hilarious if this crime wasn’t such harbinger for what’s coming to the rest of the states.

Despite complaints of “racism” for locking up products that are frequently stolen, the Walmart in Riverdale New York, initially defended its decision to lock up their oft-times stolen relocated black hair care products, claiming the decision to lock it up was data-driven. “We’re sensitive to this situation and also understand, like other retailers, that some products such as electronics, automotive, cosmetics and other personal care products are subject to additional security,” the company said in a statement Jan. 31, 2019. Then they realized keeping black people from stealing is racist and backed down. They took the popularly pilfered products out of the case creating an open season on Uncle Funky’s Daughter Curly Magic Curl Stimulator. Chicago’s Mayor and highest-ranking racist Lori Lightfoot just passed a law banning most police foot pursuits, meaning the cops CAN’T CHASE criminals. She claimed it was for the safety of the police but two officers were just shot while not engaging in a foot pursuit as per Lightfoot’s new rule. The message to criminals is clear, if a store locks up stuff you prefer to steal, call them racist and they will unlock it. Lefty politicians will decriminalize laws that keep you from taking what you are entitled to and will even tell the cops not to chase you. The media will ignore your crimes and even go so far as to blame racist white people for all those mass shootings in black neighborhoods. Maybe if libs treated black folks like equals instead of helpless victims we wouldn’t see so many black people commit crimes.

The Catholic Alt-Right Wants Him Silenced.,https://www.thedailybeast.com/father-james-martin-wants-the-church-to-accept-gays-but-the-catholic-alt-right-wants-him-silenced?source=articles&via=rss,en,False,,1707,Daily Beast,http://www.thedailybeast.com/,"SEARCH Father James Martin spent years pleading for the church to welcome the LGBT community. As the Catholic alt-right attacks him and the Vatican says no, is it an impossible mission? Senior Entertainment Reporter Five years ago, on June 12, 2016, 49 people were massacred at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. It was, at the time, the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, with an additional 53 patrons wounded. Pulse was a predominantly LGBT venue, an example of what’s always been true: For the marginalized LGBT community, the gay bar was a place of acceptance. A sanctuary. A church. When a gunman entered that gay club in Orlando, he infiltrated a safe space. It was where a group of people cultivated their comradeship and identity, gathered in solidarity to be themselves freely, empowered, made change, and, yes, had fun. Like parishioners to a church, these people—to include this writer, we—gravitate to these venues as a natural-born survival mechanism. And there, in that safe space, 49 people were killed. Father James Martin remembers his horror at the news of what happened at Pulse. And he remembers the pointed, unignorable silence afterward from the leaders of the Catholic Church. With other gun tragedies, bishops delivered statements about standing with the victims, often specifying, if applicable, the church denomination or common affiliation of the community that was attacked. But after Pulse, the deadliest mass shooting the U.S. had ever suffered, only a handful of bishops said anything. “They were silent,” Father Martin says in the new documentary, Building a Bridge, which premiered Tuesday at the Tribeca Film Festival. “I couldn’t believe it. It really angered me that, even in death, these people were largely invisible to the church.” The church’s reaction to Pulse galvanized Father Martin, a Jesuit priest in New York City and editor-at-large of the Jesuit magazine America. In 2017, he published the book Building a Bridge: How the Catholic Church and the LGBT Community Can Enter into a Relationship of Respect, Compassion, and Sensitivity. His outreach has taken him on a speaking tour that included a private audience with Pope Francis. For many Catholics, his suggestion that the LGBT community could be embraced within the doctrine of the church has provided an almost inarticulable and profound hope. For many others, including church leaders, his ideas amount to a rejection of Catholic teachings. Rather than building a bridge, to them, he is tearing down one that leads to the true Catholic word. His public profile has also made him a target of what he’s dubbed the “Catholic alt-right,” who organize social campaigns against him, protest his sermons, and amplify their own view that it is “homoheresy” to suggest that the church welcome LGBT members. The Catholic Church seems to be at an existential crossroads when it comes to the LGBT issue. In 2013, Pope Francis suggested a movement toward acceptance with his famous “Who am I to judge?” speech. But this March, the Vatican issued a decree stating that priests could not bless same-sex unions since God “cannot bless sin.” Father Martin, then, is a lightning rod in a raging storm—and in a religion that takes such acts of God seriously. Such thunderous tension is at the crux of Building a Bridge. Directed by Evan Mascagni and Shannon Post, the documentary is executive produced by Martin Scorsese, to give a sense of the weight the topic carries. The film is about Father Martin’s mission, which he lays out early on: “I want to talk about a bridge. And it’s a bridge between the institutional church and the LGBT Catholic community. Helping LGBT Catholics feel like they are part of their church, and that they are welcomed and loved. Some Catholics object to this, just putting it mildly.” (He giggles after that last line.) But more than that, it’s about the LGBT-identifying Catholics and families who have left the church because of its teachings. They are the people whose faith and ability to practice it, proudly and with a conscience, is affected by these conversations. For these people, this is a crisis as much as it is a discourse. It is the center of who they are and what they believe. It is their souls, their moral compass, and their idea of eternity. The official Vatican stance is that homosexuality is “objectively disordered,” though the catechism preaches against violence. Speaking from personal experience, when a person who grows up in the Catholic Church struggles with sexuality and coming out, it involves an intense confrontation with the religion that has been fundamental to your entire outlook on the world. That entails considering what you deserve from your church community as a gay person. It’s weighing ideas like “morality” and “sin” just because you have the audacity to understand who it is that you love. It’s contemplating what your salvation may look like. There are choices to make. You must grieve the loss of your faith and step away, or you must be so certain in your beliefs and your relationship with God that you can rationalize who you are with the church teachings. That’s a lot of faith to ask, yet many LGBT Catholics make that sacrifice. And still, there are many Catholics who will read about that traumatic journey and still conform to the traditional teachings. That these complicated feelings and journeys are given a spotlight is the collateral impact of Building a Bridge’s focus on Father Martin’s work and the volatile reaction it’s received. In the film, we watch as he sends a tweet that uses the catechism to bolster an argument for compassion towards the LGBT community, only to be immediately assaulted with vitriolic responses from Catholics who don’t want to hear it, accusing him of heresy. There’s a large chunk of screen time spent with Michael Voris, a host and antagonizer for lay apostolate and news website Church Militant. In web videos that blast with all the extremism of a Fox News segment, Voris brands Father Martin as Catholic Enemy No. 1 for his “gaying of the church.” Before his reversion to Catholicism, Voris engaged in homosexual activity. Now, he’s a leading voice in the orthodox interpretation of the LGBT community: It is not to be condoned or accepted. “Christ never gives a burden or a cross that they aren’t capable of carrying,” Voris says. “I don’t know what the cross is if you’re Father Martin and the whole gay thing. You can just go have sex with whoever you want to? You can just get married and be gay and the church has to conform to you? Where is the suffering? Where is the sacrifice? No pain, no gain. If you do not carry that cross, you do not get into the Kingdom of Heaven.” Even those you might expect to be on Father Martin’s side lob some of the sharpest criticisms. Out at St. Paul, a LGBT ministry in New York, held heated conversations with Father Martin after his book was first published. They took issue with the idea of “building a bridge from both sides” because that put an onus on the LGBT community to build their part of the bridge themselves. How are they supposed to build a two-way bridge when it’s the church that has the power? (Father Martin changed that part of the book for its second printing.) There can be endless debate about what Father Martin is doing. But it’s the emotion behind that debate that emanates from the film. Christine Leinonen is the mother of Christopher, one of the victims of the Pulse shooting. In one heartbreaking segment, she talks about how loved Christopher was, how proudly out he was as a gay man, and shows us the clothes he was wearing the night he was killed: a t-shirt and jeans with bullet holes through them. Her experience grieving him and the other queer people who were murdered that night, she says, gave her a new insight into the conversation surrounding homosexuality and the Catholic Church. “I loved my son, but it broke my heart to know there was one kid whose family wouldn’t come to get him because he was gay, because they believed that was what Catholicism taught them,” she says. “Why is it that this church I belong to, why aren’t they comforting me?… They should be marching with us, talking with us, being with us while our kids were killed.” We meet the Musselman family, whose three children all identify as LGBTQ. As practicing Catholics, reckoning with their faith and the rejection from their religious community is difficult. “It’s heartbreaking—like gut-wrenching, soul-crushing sadness—to watch someone look at your child or your children with disgust in their eyes,” the mother says. “Then you feel like this loss. Like a real loss. Because you love your kids and what else were you supposed to do? And you want to keep them in the church.” The family is among those who are spiritually helped and heartened by Father Martin’s work and his ideas. In fact, you see that everywhere Father Martin goes. There are people, eyes wet with tears, sharing stories about how Building a Bridge and Martin’s talks have helped them come around to acceptance of their own gay relatives. There are queer-questioning people who confess their fears about coming out and how the book is helping them work through it. There are out gay Catholics who see a path back to the church because of it. It’s deeply emotional because these feelings—that range from shame and hatred to desperation and even hope—have such deep roots. So deep that many never imagined that even the foundation to build a bridge might be possible. Still, especially if you’re a gay person who came through the Catholic Church, there are other complications to grapple with. As inspiring as what Father Martin is doing may be, how much is he the great rainbow hope and how much is he delusional? He’s such a kind, understanding, charming, and empathetic man. Some of us have had those Catholic leaders in our lives, the ones who are brave enough to be accepting publicly, not just implicitly, and implore that others be the same. Especially those who don’t want to hear it. But when these leaders are the exceptions—the beautiful, hopeful exceptions—we still may only be at base camp when it comes to scaling the mountain. The more time passes, the higher the summit seems to grow. There’s an inspiring, feel-good element to the Building a Bridge documentary. Strangely, that may be why you can’t help but emerge from it feeling a bit dejected. How do you make both fit: the optimism and desire for change with the cynicism of the church’s reality? Especially after the Vatican’s decree against homosexuality in March, it can feel impossible. But what is faith, if not certitude—maybe even hope—in the face of such impossibility?"

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. More than 50 kids in the Windy City have died from gunfire this year. Alderman Anthony Napolitano with insight. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot will introduce a measure Thursday to ban alcohol sales after midnight in an effort to address the serious ""nuisance issues"" near liquor stores after reaching a compromise with other elected leaders that saw her back off an earlier closing time. The mayor originally introduced the proposal as part of a package to help city businesses recover from the economic toll of the COVID-19 pandemic. A 9 p.m. liquor sale curfew took effect in the early days of the pandemic and later extended to 11 p.m., the Chicago Tribune reported. The compromise will be introduced to the city's Committee on License and Consumer Protection. Lightfoot proposed a 10 p.m. closing time, but influential aldermen balked, saying the city would be better off cracking down on problem businesses instead of penalizing all of them as many are still trying to recover, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. ""We believe a midnight closure is a reasonable compromise that addresses the serious nuisance issues raised by late-night liquor sales without unduly burdening our business community,"" Lightfoot said in a news release. CHICAGO POLICE RESCUE 7 PEOPLE FROM TWO LAKE MICHIGAN INCIDENTS The Chicago Police Department responds to more than 50 calls to 911 annually from every establishment that has a package goods liquor license, according to the city’s Business Affairs and Consumer Protection Department, WTTW-TV reported. Calls for disturbances to liquor stores fell by 75% when hours were limited, officials said. ""The midnight liquor curfew is a good compromise between the needs of businesses that are working to recover from the pandemic and the needs of residents that face quality of life issues in their neighborhoods,"" said 44th Ward Ald. Tom Tunney in a statement. The move comes as the city is slowly reopening its economy but also dealing with a series of highly publicized shootings that have dominated the headlines. Four people were killed early Tuesday and another four were injured when gunfire erupted inside a home in Englewood, one of Chicago's most troubled neighborhoods. Among the victims were three mothers. The shooting came days after a woman and nine other people were injured after two men opened fire on a group standing on a sidewalk. That mass shooting was the third in Chicago just over a week and one of several across the country over the weekend, according to the Times, sparking concern from law enforcement about what could a precursor to a violent summer. Citywide, Chicago has experienced 282 murders as of Sunday, compared to 269 during the same time period last year, according to police data.

1962313378,2021-06-15 15:49:23,Editorial: Pass it: A gun safety bill even gun-rights groups support,http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/voiceofthepeople/~3/yow-ZcaYp4Y/ct-editorial-aurora-mass-shooting-gun-control-legislation-foid-revocations-20210615-brfq4ypd5nbe5e4ym2svcebri4-story.html,en,False,,9,Chicago Tribune,http://www.chicagotribune.com/,"More than two years ago, Gary Martin walked into a disciplinary meeting with his supervisors at an Aurora valve manufacturing plant. They told him he was being let go. “Yeah, it’s over,” a survivor remembered him saying. Martin pulled out a .40-caliber handgun and killed four of the people in the room. He killed another co-worker elsewhere in the plant, and shot and wounded another co-worker and five police officers before dying in a shootout with police. As a convicted felon, Martin should never have been allowed to have a gun. His firearm owner’s identification card had been revoked. But there was no follow-up from law enforcement to ensure he had surrendered his handgun. “Some disgruntled person walked in and had access to a firearm that he shouldn’t have had access to,” Aurora police Chief Kristen Ziman said after that terrible Feb. 15, 2019, afternoon. Pledges to make sure someone like Martin would never again have access to guns followed. Two years later, nothing has changed. The spring legislative session in Springfield ended without movement on House Bill 3245 that would have addressed the problems exposed by the Aurora mass shooting. Fortunately, a second bill that addresses revoked FOID cards tentatively is on the agenda this week for a quick, two-day session of staggered House and Senate meetings. Lawmakers should pass it before they leave town again, and Gov. J.B. Pritzker should sign it into law. For the last two years, we, along with gun safety advocates, have called for raising the FOID card application fee from $10 to $20 so that a portion of that increase could fund a task force that would follow up with gun owners who’ve had their FOID revoked — but have yet to relinquish their guns. The law requires felons to lose access to firearms, but lax enforcement allows many of those individuals to keep them. A bill proposed by Rep. Jay Hoffman, D-Swansea, would set up that task force, which would “conduct enforcement operations against persons whose Firearm Owner’s Identification Cards have been revoked or suspended ...” Hoffman’s bill also would create for law enforcement agencies a database of people who have had their FOID cards revoked or suspended, and would broaden background checks to include person-to-person gun purchases. Last year, the Tribune reported that 80% of people who had their FOID cards revoked had failed to document that they had gotten rid of their guns, as the law requires. State records showed that, as of February 2020, 36,600 guns belonging to people who were ineligible to possess them had remained unaccounted for in Illinois. Gary Martin wasn’t the only revoked cardholder who kept his gun and later killed with it. In the case of Christopher Miller, the victim was his 18-month-old son. In September 2019, Miller appeared at the Joliet home of his estranged wife, choked her until she fell unconscious and then fatally shot their toddler, Colton, before killing himself. Like Martin, Miller had his FOID card revoked. He also had been arrested in Cook County and released on bond without anyone checking to see if his guns had been seized. His wife had told officials in DuPage County that he still had guns — and no one followed up. Lawmakers worried about the erosion of gun rights are missing the point on this one. No one is taking away guns from people who lawfully can possess them. This is about keeping guns out of the hands of people who’ve had their FOID cards revoked. The law that bans people with revoked FOIDs from having guns is already on the books; what has been missing is the means to facilitate enforcement of that law. If lawmakers again fail to act, we’d like to see them explain themselves to the families of the people Martin killed — Russell Beyer, Vicente Juarez, Clayton Parks, Josh Pinkard and Trevor Wehner — and the mother of Colton Miller. If a task force is the best way forward to supplement law enforcement in removing guns, it needs to get off the ground — now.

The new ordinance, unanimously approved by the City Council on Tuesday night, aims to deter an illegal practice known as straw purchasing, in which someone buys a gun for another person who is barred from owning firearms, such as a felon or minor. “We know a significant number of crooks and gangs get firearms through straw purchasing,” Mayor Sam Liccardo said. “This set of ordinances is really focused on narrowing the flow of guns to those which are clearly legal and hopefully doing something to deter the flow of guns that are unlawful to own.” The new law is just one part of a 10-point gun control plan that Liccardo unveiled last week in the wake of the mass shooting in late May at a San Jose rail yard. A disgruntled VTA employee fatally shot nine of his co-workers and then himself, according to police. The mayor’s plan also calls for a separate ordinance that would require gun owners to carry liability insurance and pay a fee to cover taxpayer costs associated with gun violence. The council is expected to consider that proposal this fall. Liccardo first announced in February 2019 that he wanted to make changes to the city’s gun-safety ordinance, including mandating that retailers video-record firearm purchases. He said the adoption of the video recording regulation was delayed, in part, because of the pandemic. San Jose joined Chicago and several smaller California cities, including Campbell, El Cerrito and San Carlos, in requiring the videotaping of gun sales, according to the Giffords Law Center. Walmart — the nation’s largest gun seller — began voluntarily videotaping gun sales in 2008. Liccardo said he is “trying to lead an effort to bring other cities and hopefully the state along” in adopting similar legislation. Gun-rights advocates, such as the Sacramento-based Firearms Policy Coalition, quickly slammed the new ordinance, calling it “outrageous and unconstitutional.” The organization added that it “will not hesitate” to challenge the city’s policies in federal court and “take every possible action to block their enforcement.” “It is outrageous that Mayor Liccardo wants to use Big Brother-style omniveillance to record gun owners’ every move, violating the privacy of millions, especially at-risk firearm purchasers,” the coalition wrote in a statement. “This Orwellian requirement would be rightly universally opposed were the City to impose similar video and audio-recording mandates in mosques and churches, book stores, or abortion clinics.” Speaking to some privacy concerns, City Attorney Nora Frimann said most retail stores already have some sort of surveillance system. The new law merely requires them to take an extra step to capture audio as well and to retain the videos for at least 30 days, giving law enforcement the opportunity to collect evidence they might need to solve certain gun crimes. “We think we’ve threaded the needle on this, and what we’re bringing forward is defensible,” Frimann said. The ordinance also bans the sale of guns or ammunition from residences in San Jose, mandates a license for gun transfers or sales, and requires sellers to annually maintain an inventory of firearms and ammunition. Under the ordinance, gun retailers must train employees to question and determine whether each potential customer is attempting to buy a firearm for another person. They also must display signs with information about gun laws, suicide prevention and domestic violence. Businesses will have three months to comply with the new rule. The ordinance received mixed feedback from community members. Sarah Huff Brancato, whose son Michael Munns was the first person shot and killed in the city last year, called into Tuesday night’s meeting to urge the council to enact the law. “These city ordinances are such important steps in forging forward to be proactive in the prevention of illegal guns entering in our precious community, our city, our backyards,” she said. Another person, who did not give a name, said the new requirements were a “wrongheaded and simplistic effort to solve the problem of gun violence.” “This is nothing more than another thinly-veiled attempt to completely eliminate gun ownership and the constitutional right for law-abiding citizens to defend themselves,” the caller said. “Tragedies like the one at the VTA, to which you are attempting to respond to, will not be eliminated by this regulation.” Although council members acknowledged the blowback that gun control measures evoke, they all agreed the ordinance needed their support. “Nobody will ever suggest that there is anything we can do to eliminate all incidents (of gun violence),” Councilmember David Cohen said. “But our goal is to make San Jose safer and to be a model for what cities can do to make sure guns don’t fall into the wrong hands.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters"

The council is expected to consider that proposal this fall. Liccardo first announced in February 2019 that he wanted to make changes to the city’s gun-safety ordinance, including mandating that retailers video-record firearm purchases. He said the adoption of the video recording regulation was delayed, in part, because of the pandemic. San Jose joined Chicago and several smaller California cities, including Campbell, El Cerrito and San Carlos, in requiring the videotaping of gun sales, according to the Giffords Law Center. Walmart — the nation’s largest gun seller — began voluntarily videotaping gun sales in 2008. Liccardo said he is “trying to lead an effort to bring other cities and hopefully the state along” in adopting similar legislation. Gun-rights advocates, such as the Sacramento-based Firearms Policy Coalition, quickly slammed the new ordinance, calling it “outrageous and unconstitutional.” The organization added that it “will not hesitate” to challenge the city’s policies in federal court and “take every possible action to block their enforcement.” “It is outrageous that Mayor Liccardo wants to use Big Brother-style omniveillance to record gun owners’ every move, violating the privacy of millions, especially at-risk firearm purchasers,” the coalition wrote in a statement. “This Orwellian requirement would be rightly universally opposed were the City to impose similar video and audio-recording mandates in mosques and churches, book stores, or abortion clinics.” Speaking to some privacy concerns, City Attorney Nora Frimann said most retail stores already have some sort of surveillance system. The new law merely requires them to take an extra step to capture audio as well and to retain the videos for at least 30 days, giving law enforcement the opportunity to collect evidence they might need to solve certain gun crimes. “We think we’ve threaded the needle on this, and what we’re bringing forward is defensible,” Frimann said. The ordinance also bans the sale of guns or ammunition from residences in San Jose, mandates a license for gun transfers or sales, and requires sellers to annually maintain an inventory of firearms and ammunition. Under the ordinance, gun retailers must train employees to question and determine whether each potential customer is attempting to buy a firearm for another person. They also must display signs with information about gun laws, suicide prevention and domestic violence. Businesses will have three months to comply with the new rule. The ordinance received mixed feedback from community members. Sarah Huff Brancato, whose son Michael Munns was the first person shot and killed in the city last year, called into Tuesday night’s meeting to urge the council to enact the law. “These city ordinances are such important steps in forging forward to be proactive in the prevention of illegal guns entering in our precious community, our city, our backyards,” she said. Another person, who did not give a name, said the new requirements were a “wrongheaded and simplistic effort to solve the problem of gun violence.” “This is nothing more than another thinly-veiled attempt to completely eliminate gun ownership and the constitutional right for law-abiding citizens to defend themselves,” the caller said. “Tragedies like the one at the VTA, to which you are attempting to respond to, will not be eliminated by this regulation.” Although council members acknowledged the blowback that gun control measures evoke, they all agreed the ordinance needed their support. “Nobody will ever suggest that there is anything we can do to eliminate all incidents (of gun violence),” Councilmember David Cohen said. “But our goal is to make San Jose safer and to be a model for what cities can do to make sure guns don’t fall into the wrong hands.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters"

1962783705,2021-06-16 07:01:21,Candidates make their cases for the role of Wauwatosa police chief in two hour public interview,http://rssfeeds.jsonline.com/~/654842582/0/milwaukee/news~Candidates-make-their-cases-for-the-role-of-Wauwatosa-police-chief-in-two-hour-public-interview/,en,False,,36,Milwaukee Journal Sentinel ,http://www.jsonline.com/,"Wauwatosa residents tuned in Monday night to get a glimpse of the men who could become their next police chief, after over a year of civil unrest and calls for police reform in the Milwaukee suburb. In a public meeting held virtually, all three candidates — Jeffrey Norman, James MacGillis and David Salazar — answered various questions, condensed down from over 90 questions submitted by Wauwatosa residents. The police and fire commission, whose chair is a former Wauwatosa police detective, hosted the forum. All three candidates have a history with the Milwaukee Police Department, and if selected, would lead a department of 100 officers — officers who have experienced a high profile fatal shooting by a police officer, a mass shooting, civil unrest and citywide curfews in just the last 18 months. The public will have until June 16 to offer feedback on the candidates. The three finalists for the Wauwatosa police chief position are Milwaukee Police Department veterans After offering their educational and professional backgrounds, the candidates dove headfirst into how they plan to uphold accountability and transparency in their department. The question centered around the usage of body camera footage, to which all candidates said was now a ""standard"" in policing and needs to be applied to situations with additional context and evidence. Norman noted that body camera footage should be not relied on completely, but it's important to share the footage with the public to provide additional information about a controversial police situation. ""Body cameras are a progressive and critical part of any forward-thinking department,"" Norman said. Salazar noted that body cameras should be a part of a ""robust"" system of accountability when it comes to use of force. Lack of policy and procedure surrounding the release of body camera footage, Salazar said, creates a lack of trust with the community. ""We as police leaders need to learn how to utilize that technology to quickly streamline the process of getting that video out in the hands of the public, so we can drive the narrative, so we can explain what happened and answer those important questions,"" Salazar said. MacGillis emphasized educating the community on police practices and policies, including body camera footage, as well as traffic stops and arrest procedures. ""Body-worn cameras are a great tool, but they're not a panacea,"" MacGillis said. ""When it comes to transparency, having the type of having good interaction with the community and sharing that video as early as possible is essential to gain some type of understanding that what we do in law enforcement is not always pretty."" Community-based policing, in which the police and the community they protect work hand in hand to prevent crime and promote public safety, has become a large part of the police reform conversation over the last year. Community-based policing, Salazar said, is not a designated role, so much as a philosophy that stretches across all members of the community. Community input should help shape police practices and policies, and that includes those protesting police actions. ""I think the people that are the most critical of the police, the most vocal about the police and their actions need not to be ignored,"" Salazar said. ""They don't need to stop protesting, and we need to actively engage with those individuals."" ""The citizens need to have a stake in how they are policed,"" said MacGillis. ""Otherwise, police will continue to be guilty of misconduct in the public's eye."" MacGillis' path to fixing that includes a proposed community advisory board for the department, made up of both police officers and community members. ""At the foundational level, it's about talking and listening,"" Norman said, but also about how the leader of department is exemplifying how to interact with the public. The police chief should be at the front of those talking and listening sessions, and any other community engagement practices. ""We as leaders should be comfortable with critical conversations of uncomfortable truths and be able to talk to individuals in regards to their perceptions of reality,"" Norman said. All three candidates agreed that there needs to be heavier training for police on mental health situations and collaboration between mental health workers and police officers. ""It's important to have a level of sensitivity and empathy, but also understand that there are some things that might not be within our wheelhouse,"" Norman said, noting that 40 hours of crisis intervention training does not make a police officer a licensed psychiatrist or social worker. Salazar, who worked as a crisis negotiator for several years, emphasized that continual mental health training for police officers is necessary, but that training can't happen alone. ""As the chief of police, I would be positioned uniquely to call upon the medical community of Wauwatosa for a roundtable discussion, to explain what we as law enforcement officers are encountering on a daily basis,"" Salazar said. That roundtable discussion would then lead to strategizing how best to handle individuals with mental illnesses. MacGillis also said that partnership is important, but so is training to differentiate between when a person is having a mental health crisis or suffering from a drug addiction or overdose. This difference, he said, is important for officers to recognize and respond to. ""It's really about utilizing those active listening skills, utilizing your ability to reach out and proactively speak with people, allow them to express their feelings. And, you know, given the expectations of what will be and what won't be tolerated,"" MacGillis said. The candidates were also asked questions related to the recent uptick in crime in Wauwatosa, how they plan to boost recruitment, retention and morale for police officers and handling protests and free speech alongside public safety. The fire and police commission is expected to pick a new police chief before the end of June. Samantha Hendrickson can be reached at 414-223-5383 or shendrickson@jrn.com.

But how they’ve dealt with being constantly online has varied drastically. By
      
        Scaachi Koul Posted on June 16, 2021, at 11:01 a.m. ET Netflix has categorized Bo Burnham’s latest special, Inside, as a “comedy,” which is outrageous because it’s clearly the horror movie of the year. I don’t know whether anything has scared me as much recently as watching all 90 minutes; it felt like peering into my own rotting core, my hand wrapped around a phone with every single social media app open. Inside has been praised as a rare decent piece of pandemic-inspired entertainment, but it’s also a nightmare about the internet, a tool we can’t escape and all seem to hate. Inside is Burnham’s fifth special. His first two Weird Al–esque offerings, a 2009 Comedy Central Presents episode and 2010’s Words, Words, Words, relied largely on musical wordplay. 2013’s what. and 2016’s Make Happy started to push in the direction of Inside: he sang more earworms, but the content became a little more political, a bit more bleak, and a lot funnier. (Make Happy’s “Straight White Man” continues to be the best explanation for what, exactly, straight white men want, which is: everything.) As the title suggests, Inside is shot in a single room in Burnham’s home, and Burnham is the sole writer, director, performer, editor, cinematographer, and musician. After experiencing panic attacks during his last live tour, he had stopped doing live comedy altogether. He was ready to start again in January 2020, but as he says in Inside, “The funniest thing happened.” The special is a cautionary tale about spending so much time online that you lose your sense of self, your mental health reaches a new all-time low (an “ATL,” as Burnham calls it), and you stop being able to relate to people in person. It’s also the natural conclusion of what might happen to your brain if you log on at 16 — as Burnham did, getting his start on YouTube in 2006 with clever songs and self-aware parodies. The first half of the special offers a few gems that are purely ha-ha funny, as opposed to OK-wow-yikes funny, like the strangely romantic song he sings about FaceTiming with his mother (and screaming at her to take her thumb off the fucking camera). The second half, on the other hand, is like watching someone’s fever dream. ”Welcome to the Internet” made me feel like I had taken a tab of particularly bad acid, while Burnham sang, “Could I interest you in everything, all of the time?” Most of the special is about the internet, from its two brief and goofy odes to Jeff Bezos to the legitimately gutting “That Funny Feeling,” which catalogs all the things that make Burnham feel despair: “Carpool Karaoke, Steve Aoki, Logan Paul / A gift shop at the gun range, a mass shooting at the mall.” Bo Burnham in Inside (2021) Inside could’ve easily veered into a pretentious rant about the dangers of being online, but what saves it from going off the deep end is Burnham’s self-awareness. He knows the internet can be a poison because it seems to have poisoned him. As a teenager on YouTube, he was wearing tie-dye T-shirts and playing the piano in his bedroom, singing songs about not knowing where the G-spot is. “This guy seems so happy!” wrote one commenter recently on a chipper and upbeat video of a 16-year-old Burnham, adding a brutal coda: “I bet he’ll be super happy when he’s 30.” “Why do you think Snapchat exists? Why do you think they’d make a company for 13-year-olds where a photo disappears after 24 hours?” Burnham said in 2019 while promoting Eighth Grade, the 2018 film he directed about a teenage aspiring content creator. “There are buildings full of 300 people who are all employed to give children what they want, not what they need.” Whether because of his discomfort with multi-billion-dollar tech companies or a personal desire to refocus, Burnham isn’t really online anymore. Although he was once especially active on not only YouTube, but also on Vine and Instagram, his accounts now do little more than promote whatever he’s releasing. Burnham has made the transition from internet comedian to successful stand-up mostly by choosing to become less and less online. Plenty of his contemporaries haven’t made, and perhaps have no interest in making, the same transition. YouTubers Shane Dawson and Jenna Marbles both became famous on YouTube around the time Burnham was making his early video content but have taken paths pretty different from his in their adult years. Increasingly, it seems like a life online can only take three routes: the Marbles way (disengaging completely), the Dawson way (engaging so much it blows your life up), or the Burnham way (wanting both to engage and disengage, and feeling dissatisfied either way). While most people know Dawson as a makeup influencer/conspiracy theory unpacker/YouTube’s Diane Sawyer, he once was a comedian who made act-outs and comedy shorts. He’s practically the poster boy for having your online past come back to haunt you: he’s had to release multiple apologies for racist videos in the last few years. His most recent apology, in June 2020, addressed myriad past controversies — his use of blackface and the n-word in his videos and making sexual jokes about Willow Smith when she was still a minor, among other infractions — but didn’t really win anyone over. He’s been silent since, though there are rumors he’s working on a #FreeBritney documentary. Shane Dawson in the June 2020 video ""Taking Accountability"" Despite his many scandals and a wide swath of detractors, Dawson could find an audience should he choose to return. Having become part of an online community, and eventually the leader of his own, he is well aware that the internet is where he holds the most fame and attention. Before Dawson logged off last year, makeup influencer Tati Westbrook said he “manipulated” her into starting a fight online in 2019. He immediately went live on Instagram — while her video was still playing in the background. “I’m losing my mind. I’m losing my mind. This is so fucked,” he said, with around 217,000 people watching. It’s a reckless impulse, even for someone from a generation that has been online since childhood. The internet isn’t fake — it’s real life — but it has commodified conflict and trauma in a way that, as Burnham explores in Inside, is pretty spooky for kids and adults alike. Marbles became a YouTuber in 2010 and quickly became famous through videos like “How to Trick People into Thinking You’re Good Looking.” That video was an instant classic when I was 19, though it uses a concept that now feels kind of rote: a conventionally attractive white woman puts on makeup while cracking deadpan jokes about how she’s ugly, awkward, and weird. But Marbles, too, was found to have done blackface in the past, and after she apologized, she chose to just get off the machine. “I’m literally just here to have a good time, and I don’t think I’m having a good time,” she said in her 2020 apology video, which has since been deleted. In the summer of 2020, Marbles ended her podcast, stopped streaming on Twitch, and ceased posting to YouTube. Even her Instagram is dormant. The most information anyone has about her at this point is that she’s staying offline, and that she got engaged a few months ago. Marbles could return to the internet too if she wanted; her apology and immediate self-ejection made her remorse seem sincere. Though fans may miss her, Marbles made the best choice available: she left the internet to try to be a person in the world. It’s not just comedians and other professional creators who make content for the internet — we all do, sometimes unwittingly, and the burnout from that churn is real. Burnham still has the urge to create something, and releasing a special on Netflix with almost no promotion and no interviews is as analog as it gets for someone with his background. He’s still in the ambivalent position of knowing that being online all the time is a recipe for emotional distress but still wanting to participate, just on new terms. In Inside, he never quite gets to answering why he still makes internet-friendly content, but he had to have known he was feeding the machine. TikTok has been showing me nothing but teenagers dancing and singing along to songs from the special all week. It feels inevitable, but isn’t this also exactly what he fears? Bo Burnham in Inside (2021) Burnham has continued to make art, though of a more socially conscious flavor than in the past, and he’s clearly wary of the companies and infrastructures that got him the audience he still has. After his first Jeff Bezos song (“Bezos I”), Burnham lies on the ground under a blanket, his head and microphone propped up on a pillow. “Maybe the flattening of the entire subjective human experience into a lifeless exchange of value that benefits nobody except for a handful of bug-eyed salamanders in Silicon Valley, maybe that, as a way of life, forever, maybe that’s not good,” he says. “I’m horny.” Later, in an interlude, Burnham sourly watches projected footage of himself as a teenager, glaring at this kid who doesn’t know what the internet is about to do to his mental health. At 30, he’s now warning Gen Z about their inevitable future: “Well, your fucking phones are poisoning your minds, okay, so when you develop a disassociative mental disorder in your late twenties, don’t come crawling back to me.” Inside is a warning to other artists and creators: The internet is fun until it isn’t, and when that happens, you can decide to sink in deeper, growing obsessed with intangible, often toxic communities that profit from conflict, or you can leave and try to have a life elsewhere, outside as opposed to in. Nearly half an hour into the special, Burnham sits on a stool like one might during a traditional stand-up set. But there’s no audience, no laugh track. “Is it necessary that every single person on this planet expresses every single opinion that they have on every single thing that occurs all at the same time?” he asks. “Can anyone, any single one, can anyone shut the fuck up about anything, any single thing? Can any single person shut the fuck up about any single thing for an hour? Is that possible?” Burnham seems aware of the irony of him not shutting up about anything for an hour and a half, but maybe that’s the point: It’s an impossible request. It’s human nature to want to be heard, and the internet has amplified our voices, sometimes for the better, but often for the worse. Now, it’s up to us to recognize when the world has heard enough. Burnham knows it better than anyone: No one really wants to shut the fuck up. ●  Scaachi Koul is a senior culture writer for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York.

Current | Bio | Archive Attorney General Merrick Garland vowed Tuesday that he would “do everything possible” to root out domestic terrorism. Although he claimed the Justice Department is “focused on violence, not ideology,” he’s also honed in on white conservative males. “The resolve and dedication with which the Justice Department has approached the investigation of the January 6 attack reflects the seriousness with which we take this assault on a mainstay of our democratic system,” Garland said. He’s trying to confirm what he told Congress last month — that violence incited by white supremacists pose “the most dangerous threat to our democracy” — and he’s using the January 6 riot to do it, an event that had nothing to do with race. And the FBI and DOJ are falling all over themselves to make it so, by keeping those arrested for the riot under lock and key with no opportunity to post bail, according to American Greatness senior contributor Julie Kelly. “It’s really important for people to understand, these people are in jail on pre-trial detention orders that are being requested by the Justice Department and signed off on by federal judges in Washington, D.C.,” Kelly said of the protesters. “These people have not engaged in one minute of a trial. In fact, their trials could be delayed until next year, which is really what the Justice Department is trying to do,” she added. “In these pre-trial detention orders, these people are denied bail.” No pre-trial bail for little more than trespassing in most cases? Judges may deny bail for heinous crimes, such as treason or murder, yet the only person killed on January 6 was Ashli Babbitt, a protester who was just standing there. Five months after that event, Babbitt‘s husband, Aaron Babbitt, and his attorney, Terrell Roberts, still don’t know the name of the Capitol Police officer who shot and killed her. Even former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is gaslighting on behalf of the attorney general. McCabe became a CNN senior law enforcement analyst after he was fired in 2018 for repeatedly lying to the DOJ’s inspector general over his role in the Russian collusion hoax. He was asked about a whole different act of domestic terrorism — James Hodgkinson’s 2017 mass shooting at a Republican congressional baseball practice, seriously injuring House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La, and four others. “The FBI still doesn’t know exactly what the shooter was up to,” McCabe told CNN Tuesday. “They never really uncovered the sort of detailed evidence that laid out a specific plot or an objective.” The FBI couldn’t figure out Hodgkinson’s “specific plot or an objective”? He posted a long list of anti-Trump and anti-Republican rants on social media, including: Also, he didn’t open fire on the team members until he’d confirmed they were Republicans. But his motive is all a mystery. FBI agents are still scratching their heads. NBC News is also supporting the notion that white supremacists commit the bulk of domestic terror attacks. It published a piece Tuesday headlined, “Viral images show people of color as anti-Asian perpetrators. That misses the big picture.” In other words, forget all the images you’ve seen of other minorities, especially Blacks, attacking Asians. It’s really white supremacists at work, and as partial proof, the author refers to research conducted by the University of Michigan called the Virulent Hate Project. It “examined media reports of anti-Asian incidents last year and found that upward of 75 percent of news stories identified perpetrators as male and white in instances of physical or verbal assault and harassment when the race of the perpetrator was confirmed.” Of the 679 acts of “harassment and vandalism,” 562 were verbal, including spoken, online, on signs or notes, or spreading rumors. They could conceivably include instances where politicians referred to COVID-19 as the “China virus” or the “Wuhan flu.” The attorney general is concentrating on so called “white supremacists” while ignoring Antifa and BLM terrorists ravaging Minneapolis, Seattle and Portland, Oregon to name a few, and by doing so he’s destroying his own credibility. Garland seems to be trying to make terror a racial issue, when acts of terror don’t have a racial identity. It’s intellectually dishonest, and is one step away from saying, “If you belong to a given race, you must be guilty of something.” It’s reminiscent of an oft-quoted line of Lavrentiy Beria, head of Joseph Stalin's secret police: “Show me the man, and I’ll show you the crime.” America is better than that. © 2021 Newsmax.

Councilors approved the new measures during a meeting Tuesday night. They were outlined last week by San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo.
Advertisement San Jose is the first U.S. city to require that sellers put every gun purchase on video. There are several other provisions in the gun control package. ""First, San Jose would become the first city in the United States to require every gun owner to have liability insurance for their firearms,"" Liccardo told KNTV-TV. ""Together, these rules create a constitutionally compliant mechanism to enable law enforcement to impound guns from high-risk individuals unwilling to follow the law."" The plan would also mandate that all gun owners pay a fee to offset damage done by gun violence, establishes gun buyback programs and bans ghost guns and assault-style weapons. City leaders said they expect that some parts of the plan will face challenges in court.
Advertisement The Firearms Policy Coalition criticized each part of Liccardo's plan, saying each is unconstitutional and will be defeated in court. Liccardo renewed his push for improved gun control measures after the shooting attack last month at the Valley Transportation Authority transit yard in San Jose. The shooter, Samuel James Cassidy, killed himself at the scene. "

Austin shooting victim Douglas Kantor's brother Nick tells 'America's Newsroom' that using his death to politicize gun control is the 'last thing' the family wants. The family of the man killed in Saturday's shooting in Austin, Texas, is speaking out against efforts to ""politicize"" the tragedy, telling Fox News that attempts to invoke the gun control debate are ""deeply disturbing."" Douglas Kantor, 25, died from his injuries at Dell Seton Medical Center after gunfire erupted around 1:30 a.m. on 6th Street, a popular strip of bars and restaurants where thousands of people gather every weekend. Thirteen others were injured with one in critical condition. AUSTIN MASS SHOOTING: 1 VICTIM DIES, BROTHER SAYS PUBLIC SHOULD KNOW HE ‘SUFFERED’ The shooting renewed calls from Texas Democrats for Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to veto the state's ""constitutional carry"" bill, which would remove permit requirements for people to carry handguns in public. The Texas Legislature send the bill to the governor's desk last month. Kantor's brother and uncle joined ""America's Newsroom"" Wednesday to condemn efforts to link the shooting to the gun control debate, arguing that what unfolded in Austin was an isolated incident between two parties that left innocent bystanders in the crossfire. ""This was not a mass shooting,"" Nick Kantor told co-host Bill Hemmer. ""This wasn't somebody on top of a rooftop gunning people down for no reason. This was rival members of groups that were having a problem with each other and decided that they were going to have a standoff in the middle of a street party that my brother was attending, and my brother was caught in the crossfire."" ""This should not be used to politicize any sort of gun control,"" he continued. ""The fact that that's what it seems like politicians are doing with this story is deeply disturbing to me and my family. This is the last thing we want. We want Doug's story to be told for what it was and not politicized for some agenda."" Two juvenile suspects have been arrested in connection to the shooting, according to local law enforcement. The 17-year-old suspect arrested Monday will be reportedly charged as an adult. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Kantor also spoke out against the ‘defund the police’ movement, calling it a ""nationwide crisis"" as major cities, including Austin, slash department funding.

1963020973,2021-06-16 04:00:00,Fr. James Martin on LGBT ministry: Love the &#039;most important&#039; church teaching,https://www.ncronline.org/news/culture/fr-james-martin-lgbt-ministry-love-most-important-church-teaching,en,False,,33885,ncronline.org,http://ncronline.org#spider,"Jump to navigation Free Newsletters Advertisement Advertisement Jesuit Fr. James Martin is one of the best-known Catholic advocates for LGBTQ dignity. Following the 2017 publication of the first edition of his book Building a Bridge: How the Catholic Church and the LGBT Community Can Enter into a Relationship of Respect, Compassion, and Sensitivity, Martin has spoken at events worldwide — and even to Pope Francis — about advocating for more compassionate treatment of the Catholic Church's LGBTQ community. Martin's life and work is the subject of a new documentary, ""Building a Bridge,"" which was executive produced by Martin Scorsese and debuted June 15 at the Tribeca Film Festival. The film was directed by Evan Mascagni and Shannon Post, and will be available to stream for viewers in the U.S. on the Tribeca website starting June 16. Ahead of the film's release, NCR spoke to Martin about the documentary and his ministry. This Q&A has been edited for length and clarity. NCR: What motivated you to participate in this film? Martin: The filmmakers approached me a few years ago. The filmmakers are people who focus on social justice issues. And so I thought, ""Sure, you can follow me around."" I actually thought it was going to be a little YouTube video. I didn't think it was going to be a real film. I thought even if they just put out a little film, it could help get the message out, and hopefully help more LGBTQ people and their families. In the film, Fr. Bryan Massingale refers to this period as an ""early spring"" in the church's relationship with the LGBTQ community. What signs of growth are visible in this relationship? That metaphor was all Bryan's. But there are signs of growth. You see signs of growth in Pope Francis' openness to the LGBTQ community, his appointment of various bishops who are more welcoming to that community, and especially on the local level at parishes and schools, where you have many more outreach groups and programs for LGBTQ Catholics. The mass shooting at the Pulse Nightclub, an LGBTQ nightclub in Orlando, Florida, was one of the worst in American history. Forty-nine people were killed. How did that tragedy galvanize you? Before 2016, I had written about LGBTQ people and advocated for them from time to time in America magazine. But I had never really done anything formally. I had never been part of an LGBTQ outreach group or ministry. The tepid response from many church leaders in the wake of the Pulse nightclub massacre just made me think that even in death, these people are invisible to the church. And so that led to a talk at New Ways Ministry, which led to a book, which led to this ministry, which I do with lots of other people. It invited me to be a little more public about advocating for the community. What surprised you the most about the reaction to the first edition of your book Building a Bridge? The reaction was shocking, both positive and negative. The positive reaction was surprising — it consisted of packed churches, standing ovations, long lines of people waiting to talk to me. The book doesn't challenge any church teaching, and I thought it was fairly mild. And yet the reaction — particularly from LGBTQ people and their families — was extraordinary. I was stunned. It was meant to be a little book — it's physically little — and it was meant to be just a modest contribution to parish life. It certainly wasn't intended to be a manifesto. The negative reaction was shocking, too, especially the personal vilification. It was not simply people challenging or critiquing some of the things that I was suggesting — even though nothing is against church teaching — but personal attacks, which I still get online daily, and sometimes in person. If I disagreed with somebody, I would never attack them personally. I wouldn't say you should go to hell, you should be excommunicated, you're a terrible Catholic or you're a heretic. So that was kind of shocking. It revealed how much homophobia and hatred there is in the church, which was sad. How do you handle these negative reactions to your book from conservative elements of the church and people who are posting abusive comments online? It bothered me at the beginning, because it was such a surprise, but then I realized that if I'm going to pattern my life after Jesus, he dealt with this too, and he was free of the need to be loved, liked or approved of by people. So if it's a legitimate critique or a thoughtful question, I'll answer it, but if it's just hatred, or homophobia, then I ignore it. I don't let it in. I don't let it make a claim on me. It's just from homophobic, hateful, mean people. Some people are just mean. It has very little to do with theology. It's like schoolyard bullying. Parts of the film focus on Michael Voris, founder of the ultraconservative, anti-gay Catholic group Church Militant, who says in the film that he once identified as gay. What are your thoughts on Voris and his story? It's baffling to me, because he talks in the movie about his life as a gay man. And yet, he's seemingly so angry about welcoming LGBTQ people into what is their church, too. I don't want to comment on him, but as I say in the film, I hope he finds some peace in his life. Because Church Militant seems to be motivated mainly by anger. I thought that the filmmakers did a good job of letting him explain his point of view. They flew out there, and they spent several days with him. No one can say that he wasn't given a chance to tell his story. On the more positive side, what were some of the most meaningful responses you received from readers of your book who connected with it? I get them every day through Facebook messages. I just got one an hour ago, from someone who talked about someone in their family who came out, who has read the book and felt more at home. Anytime I hear stories about people finding the book, and the book helping them to feel more at home in their church, is very gratifying. Ninety-five percent of the responses are positive. If I go to a parish talk, there'll be 400 people inside and five people outside protesting. Hearing from LGBTQ people or their parents who are trying to find a place in the church, and the book helps them to see how they're already at home — that's very gratifying. And it makes putting up with all the abuse online worthwhile. The documentary touches on critiques of the first edition of your book from some LGBTQ Catholics. How did you respond to such suggestions in your second edition? One of the great things about my publisher was that because there was so much of a response to the book, I asked them if I could do an updated edition, and they agreed immediately. Usually, that takes a year or two. I was able to incorporate a lot of the changes that people had suggested. I was very happy to be able to do that to make the book more realistic. The second edition is almost twice as long as the first edition, and it has many more stories and much more explanation. I wrote the first edition thinking this would just be almost like a little handbook. But when I realized that so many people were using it as a resource for how they thought about LGBT issues in the church, I thought the book needs to be a lot fuller. In the film, one critique of the first edition from the LGBTQ community was that the concept of ""building a bridge"" seemed to be asking LGBTQ people to meet the church halfway, when the church is the one with the institutional power. How do you understand the concept of ""building a bridge""? That was the most helpful critique. When I sketched that idea of a bridge, the idea that it would be a two-way bridge — that both sides would treat one another with compassion — made sense. Advertisement Advertisement But LGBTQ Catholics challenged me, and they were right. The bridge lanes aren't of equal size, because it is the institutional church that has marginalized the LGBTQ community, not the other way around. So I was very clear in the second edition that the onus is on the church to reach out, because they are in the position of institutional power. You talk in the documentary about speaking out on LGBTQ dignity without challenging church teaching. Some people — like Fr. Bryan Massingale in the film — have said there are teachings that need to be changed in order to afford LGBTQ people full dignity within the church. How do you navigate the tensions between working within the church and pushing the church to respect LGBTQ people? That's a great question. I do that by encouraging the church first to listen to the experiences of LGBTQ people, and to take seriously their responses to some of these church teachings. Secondly, I do so by stressing something which is more fundamental, which is Jesus's message of love, mercy and compassion. I'm not challenging any church teaching. In fact, I'm trying to get people to pay attention to the most important church teaching, which is Jesus's message of love. I think too often, we tend to say church teaching equals these three lines in the catechism about LGBTQ people or about homosexuals. Church teaching is not just a few lines. It's Jesus' example. And in Jesus, we see someone who is consistently reaching out to people around the margins. To me, that's the most fundamental of church teachings. I think that's the one we're overlooking the most. You've attained a high level of celebrity since Building a Bridge was published — both within the church and in mainstream media. How do you use this platform you now have? It's an outgrowth of my ministry as a Jesuit. And so it's not just focused on LGBTQ people, but on spreading the Gospel. The celebrity — I don't get too wrapped up in that because as many people support me as despise me, so it's easy not to get a big head. It's easy to keep humble. Being invited to comment in the media and having a social media platform is just another way of reaching people. And we need to go to where people are. That's what Jesus did. He met people where they were and he spoke their language. These days, that's being on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and even TikTok. In 2019, you had the opportunity to speak privately with Pope Francis. How did that conversation go? He asked me not to talk about the details, so we could speak freely, but it was one of the high points of my life. We spoke for half an hour about LGBTQ ministry in the church. And I left feeling inspired and consoled and just elated. It was really profound for me. When I left his study, I literally felt like I was walking on air. I had never felt that before. I felt lighter. It was a turning point for me. Where do you think the church needs to go from here? What challenges remain ahead for building bridges between the church and LGBTQ Catholics? I think the first thing that the church needs to do is to listen to the experiences of LGBTQ people, which the church, for the most part, is still not doing. It's preaching about them, and issuing condemnations about them and making statements about them without actually listening to them. That's the first thing. The second thing is the church has to stop targeting LGBTQ people for these firings, as if they're the only ones whose lives don't conform to church teaching. And third, in countries where bishops still align themselves with discriminatory policies against LGBTQ people, the church should speak up. An easy thing for the church to support would be the decriminalization of homosexuality. In some countries, you can be executed for being gay, and in other countries, people are rounded up. There was just a situation in Uganda where they arrested 44 people at an LGBT shelter. In many places, LGBT issues are life issues. Those are some easy things the church could do. No. 1, listen; No. 2, stop targeting; and No. 3, advocate for them when their lives are endangered. Madeleine Davison is an NCR Bertelsen intern. Her email address is mdavison@ncronline.org.

The law comes less than a month after the recent mass shooting that occurred at Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA). (RELATED: San Jose Shooter Was Previously Questioned By Border Officials) The shooting occurred on May 26 when a former employee of the VTA, released fire on co-workers, killing nine people before taking his own life. The suspect was identified as Samuel Cassidy.   A post shared by Santa Clara County Sheriff (@sccosheriff) The new law, which was unanimously approved by the city council Tuesday, aimed to “deter an illegal practice known as straw purchasing, in which someone buys a gun for another person.” “We know a significant number of crooks and gangs get firearms through straw purchasing,” Mayor Sam Liccardo said in a statement. “This set of ordinances is really focused on narrowing the flow of guns to those which are clearly legal and hopefully doing something to deter the flow of guns that are unlawful to own.” The ordinance, which mandates not only the videotaping of gun purchases but also bans the sale of guns or ammunition from residences in San Jose is just one part of Mayor Liccardo’s comprehensive 10-point gun control plan, according to a local NBC station. Today, we propose innovative initiatives to reduce the harms of gun violence. We must do more to protect the community from the horrors of gun violence. Learn more about our proposals: https://t.co/3BBSoltLei — Sam Liccardo (@sliccardo) June 8, 2021 The law mandates a license for gun transfer sales and requires that sellers maintain an annual inventory of firearms and ammunition. Gun retailers must also train employees to determine whether a prospective customer is attempting to buy a firearm for another person. The ordinance will require the stores to display signs with information about gun laws, suicide prevention and domestic violence. The Mercury Press reported that gun-rights advocates, like the Sacramento-based Firearms Policy Coalition, quickly disapproved of the new ordinance. They called it “outrageous and unconstitutional.” The advocacy group added that it “will not hesitate” to challenge the city’s policies in federal court and “take every possible action to block their enforcement.” “Nobody will ever suggest that there is anything we can do to eliminate all incidents (of gun violence),” Councilmember David Cohen said. “But our goal is to make San Jose safer and to be a model for what cities can do to make sure guns don’t fall into the wrong hands.”  The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006"

Still, the number “911” is entrenched in a lot of people’s idea of public safety in the United States: an estimated 240 million times a year, every year, people in varying levels of crisis type those three numbers into their phone in order to summon help, preferably fast. (For a little perspective, there are just over 328 million people currently living in the U.S.) Despite its ubiquity, 911 is a relatively young institution: According to the National 911 Program, the system itself is only 53 years old. Its effectiveness is hard to quantify. Per a 2019 report from the Vera Institute of Justice, the patchwork nature of 911 dispatch, with different 911 systems in play at city, county, and state levels, makes it difficult to determine who is calling 911, why, and how successful our current emergency services are at dealing with those calls. Instead, we’re forced to fall back on metrics like call response time or call volume, which paint a broad and inconsistent picture. Luckily, 911 isn’t the only number that people in danger can call. In fact, as consensus on the effectiveness of policing (and, subsequently, affiliated entities like 911) begins to shift, more and more focus has been directed at alternative systems of reporting violence and managing crises—especially organizations that explicitly refuse to call the cops. The desire to divest crisis response from policing hit attorney Mallory Sepler-King hard during the George Floyd uprisings. When she saw lists circulating on social media of 911 alternatives in cities across the U.S. she decided to centralize all the resources she could find in one place, the aptly named database dontcallthepolice.com. “As a country, we’ve been really programmed to view the police as a catch-all fix for everything that scares us or worries us, or any risks or harm that we encounter. That’s not what the police are trained to do and it's not something they are equipped to do in many of these situations,” Sepler-King told VICE—something that many police officers themselves have also pointed out. “It's important that people be deprogrammed from that and realize that there are specialized resources that can help with their situation that aren't going to put people at risk, and that it can actually provide better help to them.” If you’ve been looking for help that doesn’t involve the police but don’t know how that would work in practice, here’s how to connect with alternate emergency services and what to expect when you do get in touch. 911 exists as a conduit to emergency services—sometimes that means rapid response medical assistance, sometimes it means fire departments, and sometimes it means law enforcement. Because the way these systems are intertwined varies depending on where you are, it’s difficult to ensure that calling 911 and requesting an ambulance won’t mean a few squad cars full of cops tag along too. Bearing that in mind, there are some situations where calling 911 is probably going to be your only option if there are no unarmed violence or crisis responders in your area, like an active house fire; if there’s an intruder in your home while you or your family members are too; if someone you know has been abducted; or during a mass shooting scenario. Involving cops has been shown to escalate mental health crises because police contact with people experiencing mental illness is statistically more likely to be fatal, especially if the person experiencing the mental health crisis is Black, transgender, or both. Calling the police on someone “suspicious” who “may be armed” also carries heavy risk, especially if that person is Black—a reality painfully exemplified by the killing of Tamir Rice, shot by a cop after someone called 911 to report that the 12-year-old was playing with an airsoft gun in a public park. Beyond those extremes, it can be worth taking a step back to assess when else calling 911 could potentially escalate the risk of violence—especially against people who are already vulnerable. For situations that make you nervous but aren’t a direct, physical threat, brush up on bystander intervention tactics and practice them whenever possible. If your neighbor is throwing a raucous party, you could knock on their door and ask them to cool it. If you’re living near a park where you think unhoused people are using drugs and causing a disturbance, you could contact a local organization that works with people experiencing housing insecurity and see if they have guidance to offer or the capacity to assist. There are also some situations, like theft or property damage, where filing a police report might be necessary for, say, car insurance or renters insurance purposes—but that kind of inquiry might be better suited for 311, a hotline that’s explicitly designed for fielding non-emergency calls from people who still need assistance with a pressing problem. (Caveat: do a little research ahead of time to see if 311 is available in your area.) If you call 311 to report that someone broke into your apartment or rear-ended you, for example, a trained representative can help guide you through the experience before you may need to interact with police. Currently, dontcallthepolice.com lists local resources for more than 70 different metropolitan areas across North America, from NYC and Los Angeles to Prince George’s County, Maryland, and Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Each locality has a host of hotlines and warmlines (an early intervention tool for people pre-crisis who need emotional support) divvied up under one of eight categories: domestic violence/sexual assault, LGBTQ+, youth, elders, crime, substance abuse, mental health, and housing. “As I went through that process, it became even more apparent to me how important it is to centralize this information because it's not something that you can stick into Google and find on a whim,” Sepler-King said. Sepler-King said she makes sure to vet any resource she lists, calling through to each organization to confirm she correctly understands the need they meet. “I also ask specific questions about in which situations would the police be called, so that I can make sure people are aware of those risks,” Sepler-King said. “Especially for mental health organizations and domestic violence organizations. Most people are required by law to call the police if they believe there's an immediate risk of harm.” It might sound counterintuitive, but another place to look for 911 alternatives iscould be within your city’s government. Prominent examples include Minneapolis’s Office of Violence Prevention, based out of the city’s health department; Eugene, Oregon’s CAHOOTS program, made up of mobile crisis intervention responders; or San Francisco’s Human Rights Commission, which takes reports of hate crimes according to a report from PBS member station KQED. While these programs may still involve law enforcement, it’s no coincidence that calls to defund the police often include demands to strengthen programs like these through better funding, or establish them by hiring mental health responders and decoupling 911 dispatch centers from police departments in an effort to build up “real” public safety. Services available will vary on a line-by-line basis, so it’s smart to read up on an organization before you place a call—ideally, well in advance of a time where you might need to scroll to a hotline saved in your phone under “SOS - Mental Health Crisis” or “SOS - Tenant Harassment” as quickly as possible. Still, expect to describe your problem and, hopefully, be connected to resources that can assist you in the moment or in the near future. People staffing these specialized hotlines might be trained to personalize the experience and tailor it to the caller’s needs, rather than passing them on to the next person ASAP. This can include giving callers the opportunity to just vent. “People want to call just to talk about how they navigate being underestimated and marginalized in this country,” Vanessa Green, founder of Call BlackLine, a free, volunteer-run 24-hour hotline for BIPOC to discuss negative experiences with racism and discrimination, told VICE. “For Black people, and we know this in general for people of color, those kinds of experiences sit in your heart and in your soul. Most of my listeners have experienced those things, so when people call us and say, ‘I fucking hate them,’ We’re like ‘I hear you! That happened to me at Walmart too,’ or whatever it is.” Trans Lifeline, a national, nonprofit hotline operated by trans people for trans people that offers peer-to-peer counseling and a microgrant program, exclusively uses trans operators. That pays off when it comes to providing the peer listening experience for trans callers. “We don't have a script or any particular motions that we put a caller through,” Ivan Staklo, hotline program director at Trans Lifeline, told VICE. “We don't ask for a person's location or for their name or anything like that, whatever person wants to share. So we start from a blank slate, and our operators are trained to support people around whatever they might need support with, with the understanding that our primary role is to provide a trans peer for our trans peers to talk to. We're not experts, we don't have indefinite access to all the resources in the world, but we can try to help people find stuff or navigate the resources that they're looking through.” Questions about how to connect with local mutual aid, help with an imperious landlord, fears about a loved one’s immigration status or the presence of ICE in a community, healthcare worries, reporting hate-based harassment, resources for dealing with workplace misconduct, tips on finding community as a young queer person living in a conservative area—these are all great reasons to call a warmline, especially one with a peer on the other end. Another thing to expect? Operators or listeners might not be available, which could mean waiting on hold or simply calling back later. Staklo said Trans Lifeline has 40 operators active per week, some paid but mostly volunteers, and that Trans Lifeline’s hotline doesn’t have a hold system. Green said that Call BlackLine only has around six active listeners, which can make fielding calls—especially around hectic times in the national news cycle, or when they are getting a lot of hate calls from anti-BLM folks—particularly challenging. Green stressed that that’s not for a lack of desire—instead, it’s all about capacity, which she said is difficult to build as a Black-led organization that refuses to work with law enforcement. “We don't get a lot of grants, and the grants we do get are miniscule. Most of my listeners are poor, Black, and disabled, and I want to pay them a living wage,” she said. As such, Call BlackLine largely relies on individual donors—but because Green sees it as a vital and necessary resource, she said she will continue to do everything she can to keep it running. “You can’t live in the United States and not need counseling, but there's a gap in the United States with services—especially free, adequate, good mental health services,” Green said. “So, my heart comes into play. I tell them, ‘Oh, yes, call back tomorrow!’ even though we don’t always have the capacity.” Sepler-King said Call BlackLine and Trans Lifeline were the only two resources she came across where nothing a caller says could trigger a call to 911 (unless, per Staklo, the caller specifically requests it). “We don't even deal with certain crisis centers that engage the police,” Green said. “People trust that this line won't call the police. Because when Black people and indigenous people of color are in crisis, they get killed.” Green founded Call BlackLine in 2016 in collaboration with Black queer femme comrades in Black Lives Matter Hudson Valley. While the hotline was originally intended as a way for BIPOC to report negative encounters with law enforcement and local vigilantes, Green said it’s evolved into a much bigger project with wider parameters: people call to talk about negative customer service experiences, negative workplace experiences, how painful it is to be marginalized in the U.S.—or even to unpack past trauma induced by calling conventional emergency services. “People will call and be like whispering to me, ‘So is this anonymous? Are you going to tell somebody?’ and I’m like, ‘What the hell happened to you?’” Green said. “And they tell me, ‘I had a terrible experience of being hospitalized when all I said was that I felt like killing myself.’” Staklo said operators for Trans Lifeline’s hotline constantly field similar concerns. Hotline operators field calls from trans people in need of help with mental health issues, housing insecurity, unemployment, employment discrimination, financial instability, domestic violence calls—needs that have intensified during the pandemic. Still, Staklo said callers often ask for assurance that there’s no way cops or EMS will get involved without their permission. “Even people who call who are not dealing with crisis, one of the first things that they ask us is, ‘If I say the wrong thing, are you going to call the cops on me?’” Staklo told VICE. “And that'll be somebody who's looking to talk about something as mundane as ‘Where do I find a binder?,’ something that has nothing to do with a mental health crisis.” Green recalled one call from a woman requesting help with her autistic brother who’d been picked up by cops. She was too afraid to contact the police about his whereabouts because she herself had been involuntarily institutionalized in the past. “This woman was hysterical, I’ll never forget her,” Green said. “She was treated so horribly, and she thought her brother, especially because he’s on the spectrum, would be treated the same way.” Green said the woman got word from mental health advocates that her brother had been released into their custody while she was still on the phone with Green at Call BlackLine. “She goes, ‘Oh my God, thank you so much for listening, because I was just ready to just go in there and fuck the police up.’” Correction: An earlier version of this article said that Trans Lifeline’s operators were mostly paid with some volunteers, when in fact most are volunteers and some are paid.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Retired Navy SEAL Jocko Willink reacts to a U.S. Army recruitment video featuring a lesbian wedding on ‘Unfiltered with Dan Bongino' The U.S. Army has hidden or downplayed the extent to which its firearms disappear, significantly understating losses and thefts even as some weapons are used in street crimes. The Army’s pattern of secrecy and suppression dates back nearly a decade, when The Associated Press began investigating weapons accountability within the military. Officials fought the release of information for years, then offered misleading answers that contradict internal records. Military guns aren’t just disappearing. Stolen guns have been used in shootings, brandished to rob and threaten people and recovered in the hands of felons. Thieves sold assault rifles to a street gang. Army officials cited information that suggests only a couple of hundred firearms vanished during the 2010s. Internal Army memos that AP obtained show losses many times higher. Efforts to suppress information date to 2012, when AP filed a Freedom of Information Act request seeking records from a registry where all four armed services are supposed to report firearms loss or theft. The former Army insider who oversaw this registry described how he pulled an accounting of the Army’s lost or stolen weapons, but learned later that his superiors blocked its release. As AP continued to press for information, including through legal challenges, the Army produced a list of missing weapons that was so clearly incomplete officials later disavowed it. They then produced a second set of records that also did not give a full count. Secrecy surrounding a sensitive topic extends beyond the Army. The Air Force wouldn’t provide data on missing weapons, saying answers would have to await a federal records request AP filed 1.5 years ago. The broader Department of Defense also has not released reports of weapons losses that it receives from the armed services. It would only provide approximate totals for two years of AP’s 2010 through 2019 study period. The Pentagon stopped regularly sharing information about missing weapons with Congress years ago, apparently in the 1990s. Defense Department officials said they would still notify lawmakers if a theft or loss meets the definition of being ""significant,"" but no such notification has been made since at least 2017. On Tuesday, when AP first published its investigation, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., demanded during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that the Pentagon resurrect regular reporting. In a written statement to AP, the Pentagon said it ""looks forward to continuing to work with Congress to ensure appropriate oversight."" Blumenthal also challenged Army Secretary Christine Wormuth on her branch’s release of information. CALIFORNIA FILES APPEAL AFTER JUDGE OVERTURNS DECADES-OLD ASSAULT WEAPON BAN ""I’d be happy to look into how we’ve handled this issue,"" Wormuth replied. She described herself as ""open to"" a new reporting requirement and said the number of military firearms obtained by civilians is likely small. Poor record-keeping in the military’s vast inventory systems means lost or stolen guns can be listed on property records as safe. Security breakdowns were evident all the way down to individual units, which have destroyed records, falsified inventory checks and ignored procedures. Brig. Gen. Duane Miller, the No. 2 law enforcement official in the Army, said that when a weapon does vanish the case is thoroughly investigated. He pointed out that weapons cases are a small fraction of the more than 10,000 felony cases Army investigators open each year. ""I absolutely believe that the procedures we had in place absolutely mitigated any weapon from getting lost or stolen,"" Miller said of his own experience as a commander. ""But does it happen? It sure does."" The Associated Press began investigating the loss and theft of military firearms by asking a simple question in 2011: How many guns are unaccounted for across the Army, Marines Corps, Navy and Air Force? AP was told the answer could be found in the Department of Defense Small Arms and Light Weapons Registry. That centralized database, which the Army oversees, tracks the life cycle of rifles, pistols, shotguns, machine guns and more -- from supply depots to unit armories, through deployments, until the weapon is destroyed or sold. Getting data from the registry, however, would require a formal Freedom of Information Act request. That request, filed in 2012, came to Charles Royal, then the longtime Army civilian employee who was in charge of the registry at Redstone Arsenal in Alabama. Royal was accustomed to inquiries. Military and civilian law enforcement agencies would call him thousands of times each year, often because they were looking for a military weapon or had recovered one. In response to AP’s request, Royal pulled and double-checked data on missing weapons. Royal then showed the results to his boss, the deputy commander of his department. ""After he got it, he said, ‘We can’t be letting this out like this,’"" said Royal, who retired in 2014, in an interview last year. SAN JOSE MAYOR ROLLS OUT NEW GUN CONTROL PROPOSAL DAYS AFTER RAILYARD MASS SHOOTING His boss didn’t say exactly why, but Royal said the release he prepared on weapons loss was heavily scrutinized within the Army. ""The numbers that we were going to give was going to kind of freak everybody out to a certain extent,"" Royal said -- not just because they were firearms, but also because the military requires strict supervision of them. AP was unable to reach Royal’s supervisor and an Army spokesman had no comment on the handling of the FOIA request. In 2013, the Army said it would not release any records. The AP appealed that decision and, nearly four years later, Army lawyers agreed that registry records should be public. It wasn’t until 2019 that the Army released a small batch of data. The records from the registry showed 288 firearms over six years. Though years in the making, the response was clearly incomplete. Standing in the stacks at the public library in Decatur, Alabama, last fall, Royal reviewed the seven printed pages of records that Army eventually provided AP. ""This is worthless,"" he said. Told that in multiple years, the Army reported just a single missing weapon, Royal was skeptical. ""Out of the millions that they handled, that’s wrong,"" he said in a later interview. AP has appealed the FOIA release for a second time. The data weren’t even accurate when compared to Army criminal investigation records. Using the unique serial numbers assigned to every weapon, AP identified 19 missing firearms that were not in the registry data. This included a M240B machine gun that an Army National Guard unit reported missing in Wyoming in 2014. The Army could not explain the discrepancy. Reporters also filed another records act request for criminal cases opened by Army investigators. In response, Army’s Criminal Investigation Command produced summaries of closed investigations into missing or stolen weapons, weapons parts, explosives or ammunition. Army spokesman Lt. Col. Brandon Kelley said that the records were ""the Army’s most accurate list of physical losses."" Yet again, the total from the records provided -- 230 missing rifles or handguns during the 2010s -- was a clear undercount. The records did not reflect several major closed cases and excluded open cases, which typically take years to finish. That meant any weapons investigators are actively trying to track down were not part of the total. Army’s first two answers -- 288 and 230 -- are contradicted by an internal analysis, one that officials initially denied they had done. Asked in an interview whether the Army analyzes trends of missing weapons, Miller said no -- there were breakdowns of murders, rapes and property crimes, but not weapons loss or theft. ""I don’t spend a lot of time tracking this data,"" Miller said. In fact, in 2019 and 2020, the Army distributed memos describing military weapons loss as having ""the highest importance."" The numbers of missing ""arms and arms components remain the same or increased"" over the seven years covered by the memos, called ALARACTs. A trend analysis in the document cited theft and ""neglect"" as the most common factors. The memos counted 1,303 missing rifles and handguns from 2013-2019. During the same seven years, the investigative records the Army said were authoritative showed 62 lost or stolen rifles or handguns. Army officials said that some number they couldn’t specify were recovered among the 1,303. The data, which could include some combat losses and may include some duplications, came from criminal investigations and incident reports. The internal memos are not ""an authoritative document,"" and were not closely checked with public release in mind, Army spokesman Kelley said. Members of Miller’s physical security division were tracking the data, though Miller said he wasn’t personally aware of the memos until AP brought them to his attention. He said that that if he were, he would have shared them. ""When one weapon is lost, I’m concerned. When 100 weapons are lost, I’m concerned. When 500 are lost, I’m concerned,"" Miller said in a second interview. Each armed service is supposed to inform the Office of the Secretary of Defense of losses or thefts. That office also has not released data to AP, but spokesman John Kirby gave approximate numbers of missing weapons for the past few years. The numbers were lower than AP’s totals.

Tahanie Aboushi is currently running as a progressive under the Democratic ticket, with plans of altering prosecutorial powers for certain crimes, including a range of misdemeanors and specific felonies, the WSJ reported. Aboushi’s campaign has vowed to hold prosecutors to a higher standard and cut district office budgets by at least 50%. Aboushi told the WSJ that she would provide an alternative-to-incarceration program “in every case” with no exceptions, including for crimes such as gunpoint robbery, rape, and even murder. She has received a bevy of celebrity endorsements, including from Rashida Tlaib, Shaun King, and Bernie Sanders as a result of her progressive policies. Aboushi still hasn’t made it out of her primary, however, and if she doesn’t make it past the seven other candidates, her fallback is to run on the Working Families Party ticket, the WSJ reported. My family’s experience—and that of too many others—makes one thing clear: Mass incarceration is a policy failure. It doesn’t keep us safe. It undermines stability & success at every level. New Yorkers need a new direction, and that’s exactly why I’m running for #ManhattanDA. — Tahanie Aboushi (@TahanieNYC) June 15, 2021  Her inspiration for running, according to the campaign website, is from her father’s experience with the justice system. Ahmad Aboushi was found guilty on 17 counts for being involved in the hijacking of tractor trailers and the distribution of stolen cigarettes in 1999, court documents show, the WSJ reported. After failing to overturn his 1999 conviction in an appeals court, he was reportedly released from prison. Aboushi told the WSJ that she blamed prosecutors for wrecking her childhood and wrongfully imprisoning her father. “I never doubted his innocence,” she said. This emboldened Aboushi to not just become an attorney, but also “make sure that we are focused on justice, not on revenge punishment or convicting at all costs.” (Related: Report: Philadelphia DA Brushed Off Crime Spike Hours After Mass Shooting) Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Four men and one woman were shot about 9:20 p.m. Tuesday near Garfield Park, possibly ""by multiple offenders,"" police said. They were rushed to area hospitals, where a 38-year-old man was listed in critical condition while the others were listed in good condition. The shooting came about 16 hours after          three women and a man were fatally shot  and four other people suffered gunshot wounds inside a house on the South Side. Shermetria L. Williams, 19, of the suburb of Harvey, was among the dead, the Cook County Medical Examiner’s office said Wednesday. The office on Tuesday identified another victim as Ratanya Aryiel Rogers, 28, of Chicago. The names of the other two will be released after next of kin have been notified, the office said. Police have not made any arrests in either shooting, nor have they made arrests in the death of a 16-year-old boy who was shot Tuesday night in the city's Gage Park neighborhood. Police said a gunman opened fire on him and a 20-year-old man who was critically injured. Those and other shootings added to a growing roster of people who have been shot in the city and around the United States. Several mass shootings over the weekend         stoked concerns about a spike in U.S. gun violence heading into the summer, as coronavirus restrictions ease and more people are free to socialize. Chicago, which saw a dramatic spike in the number of homicides in 2020, is on a pace to eclipse that year's total. Even before the latest shootings, according to the police department's statistics there were 282 homicides as of Sunday compared with 269 for the same period in 2020. A database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University that tracks mass killings — defined as four or more dead, not including the perpetrator — shows Tuesday’s shooting in Chicago was the 18th mass killing, of which 17 were shootings, so far this year in the U.S. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
1963138852,2021-06-16 15:38:42,Editorial: Beyond time to recalibrate criminal justice reform in Chicago,https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-straw-purchasing-john-lausch-20210616-vi3auuf5fjgybbgyygyszqe6ym-story.html#ed=rss_www.chicagotribune.com/arcio/rss/category/opinion/,en,False,,104826,Hoy Chicago,http://www.chicagotribune.com/hoy/,"U.S. Attorney John Lausch’s office, along with Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms officials, announced on Wednesday their continuing campaign to target illegal straw purchases — legal firearm buyers supplying guns to those who can’t pass background checks. Meanwhile, Mayor Lori Lightfoot called for help from President Joe Biden’s administration to close gun loopholes — again. She also announced a plan for the summer to focus on 15 areas of the city with the most violence for an all-hands-on-deck prevention effort. And legislators in Springfield have passed numerous laws increasing penalties for those caught illegally carrying guns. They approved a massive crackdown on gun dealers that Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed into law in 2019. Has it worked as promised to improve safety or save lives? No. Chicago this week is proof of the mayhem that continues to unfold: two mass shootings in Englewood and Garfield Park, four dead, 13 shot. Early Saturday, nine injured, one killed in Chatham. In May, five shot, two killed in Gresham. In March, 15 people shot, two fatally, at a Park Manor pop-up party. Can police do more to respond to calls about large gatherings? Yes. Can aldermen do more to crack down on unruly parties? Yes. Will the ongoing campaign to reduce illegal straw purchasing make a difference? Maybe. It’s worth the effort. The push during the next month called “Don’t Lie for the Other Guy” will remind those tempted to buy weapons and hand them off that the penalty is up to 10 years in jail or up to $250,000 in fines. Legal firearm purchases require background checks and full compliance with local and state laws. For those who know they can’t pass those bench marks, they often rely on a “straw purchase” from someone else. It’s a felony. But little will change the trajectory of crime in Chicago until the perpetrators of violence are apprehended and stopped. The “benefit of the doubt” factor overwhelming our judicial and prosecutorial systems is failing us. We are less safe in Chicago because of it and especially in neighborhoods where accused offenders return while on bond or electronic monitoring, awaiting adjudication of their cases. That is not news. The Tribune and others have been reporting consistently on the failures of electronic monitoring. Just one example from this horrific week in Chicago: “Man charged in shooting was free on gun charge,” in Wednesday’s print Tribune. Marvin Flanagan, who already had a long rap sheet, was free on bond on a weapons charge when police allege he killed a man in December in Humboldt Park. Now he’s in custody. But he wasn’t when he is suspected of shooting and killing Miguel Perez outside his home. Both Lightfoot and police Superintendent David Brown criticized State’s Attorney Kim Foxx this week for her suggestion that cops are unnecessarily arresting people in illegal possession of guns. “Obviously, common sense is not so common,” Brown said during a news conference. “We should all know that illegal gun possession makes us less safe, not more safe. And I would argue the idea of decriminalizing illegal gun possession is the most ridiculous thing I’ve heard in my 40 years of law enforcement.” So who will defend the law-abiding residents trapped in their homes, and scared, due to gun violence in their streets? Where are those elected officials? In New York City as the mayoral primary approaches June 22, polls show crime and quality of life are top issues for voters there. In the city where crime reduction became the subject of international study, murders are up 17% over 2020. Shootings have increased 77% this year over last. It’s painfully familiar. To Foxx, Chief Judge Timothy Evans, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle and other elected officials who support criminal justice reform efforts that move toward decriminalization, more bond and electronic monitoring, it’s beyond time to recalibrate. Lives are at stake. Join the discussion on Twitter @chitribopinions and on Facebook. Submit a letter, of no more than 400 words, to the editor here or email letters@chicagotribune.com.

A deadly mass shooting on a Baltimore street left one person dead and five others wounded Wednesday in what authorities called a ""very brazen"" and ""very cowardly"" act. Officers found four victims with gunshot wounds in the 2100 block of West Lexington Street after reports of shots fired just before 2:30 p.m., Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison told reporters. They were taken to a hospital. Two other victims went to local hospitals separately. One of them was later pronounced dead, Harrison said. The wounded victims were identified as males that range in age from 16 to 44-years-old. The teenager was shot in the forearm. The other survivors were listed in critical but stable condition. The sixth victim, also a male, was pronounced dead at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center, police said. Harrison did not disclose any other details about the victims but said bilingual officers who speak Spanish were being utilized for the investigation. Authorities believe two of three suspects were walking up North Smallwood Street and began firing at the six victims, who were all together, when they reached the intersection of West Lexington Street. Harrison called the shooting a ""very brazen, very cowardly"" act of shooting ""indiscriminately"" into a block. No motive was disclosed. The gunmen fled the area, possibly in a burgundy-colored car, officials said. Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said the community needs to work together to combat gun violence involving young people.

""That they be so weak, they're afraid that their basic little conflict that could have bruised their ego for some petty dispute can end in the loss of life."" Investigators were canvassing the area for the suspects and are asking the public to turn in any video evidence of the shooting to police. The incident comes amid a series of mass shootings across the country. In Chicago, four people were killed and another four were wounded in a shooting inside a home. A Texas high school student was arrested Monday in connection to a June 12 shooting in which one person died and 13 others were injured.

1963186452,2021-06-16 17:37:28,Congress Backs National Memorial Designation for Former Pulse Nightclub Site,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/16/us/pulse-nightclub-shooting-memorial.html,en,False,,1,New York Times,http://nytimes.com,"Advertisement Supported by Congress has adopted legislation to formally designate the site of the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., as a memorial to the 49 people who were killed there on June 12, 2016. By Michael Levenson Five years after a gunman attacked a popular gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., killing 49 people and wounding dozens more, Congress has adopted legislation to formally designate the site as the National Pulse Memorial. President Biden has said he plans to sign the legislation, “enshrining in law what has been true since that terrible day five years ago: Pulse nightclub is hallowed ground.” The legislation, H.R. 49, named for the number of people killed in the rampage on June 12, 2016, is largely ceremonial and is part of an effort to transform the former site of the Pulse nightclub at 1912 South Orange Avenue into a permanent memorial that will feature a reflecting pool encircling the Pulse building and a nearby museum with vertical gardens, public plazas and a rooftop promenade. The county, the state and multiple corporations have agreed to give millions toward the $45 million project. The federal legislation specifies that the national memorial will not accept federal funds and will not be part of the National Park system. The site is currently home to an interim memorial that invites visitors to leave flowers and mementos at an “offering wall,” and to view the former nightclub building, according to the onePULSE Foundation, a nonprofit that was started by Barbara Poma, the former owner of the Pulse nightclub, to commemorate the lives lost in the attack. “It is so meaningful to everyone here,” Ms. Poma said of the memorial designation by Congress. “This is such a huge, I believe, sign to the community, the L.G.B.T.Q.+ community, that what happened at Pulse matters and it will never be forgotten.” Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, wearing a rainbow-colored ribbon, held a ceremony on Wednesday to recognize the passage of the legislation. “Pulse was a peaceful haven where mostly young, mostly L.G.B.T.Q. Americans could enjoy music, dancing and celebration — a sense of community,” Ms. Pelosi said. “Our hearts break again, thinking of how this sanctuary of safety and solidarity was violated by this horrific act of hatred, leaving behind unimaginable pain in the Orlando community.” Ms. Pelosi reiterated her support for tougher gun laws, including enhanced background checks. She recalled meeting with survivors of the Pulse shooting after the attack, and said their message was clear: “Stop this violence. Don’t let this happen to other people.” “It’s really important for the survivors to know we are not going away until the job is done,” she said. Omar Mateen, who had used Facebook to pledge his allegiance to the Islamic State, carried out the rampage at Pulse, which Mr. Biden pointed out was the deadliest attack on L.G.B.T.Q. Americans and, at the time, the deadliest mass shooting by a single gunman. Federal investigators have said they do not believe that Mr. Mateen, who was 29 and who was killed by the police, received any specific training or support from the Islamic State. On Saturday, the fifth anniversary of the attack, Mr. Biden urged Congress to adopt stricter gun laws, including measures that would prevent gun buyers from bypassing background checks and that would ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. “In the memory of all of those lost at the Pulse nightclub five years ago,’’ he said, “let us continue the work to be a nation at our best — one that recognizes and protects the dignity and safety of every American.” Advertisement"
1963186456,2021-06-16 17:31:43,"Man, 20, Is Found Guilty in Colorado School Shooting",https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/16/us/devon-erickson-shooting-guilty.html,en,False,,1,New York Times,http://nytimes.com,"Advertisement Supported by Devon Erickson was one of two students who planned and carried out an attack at the STEM School Highlands Ranch in which one student was killed and eight others were injured on May 7, 2019. By Maria Cramer A 20-year-old man has been convicted of murder for his role in a mass shooting at his Colorado high school in which one student was killed and eight others were injured in 2019. Devon Erickson was 18 when he and another teenager, Alec McKinney, entered the STEM School Highlands Ranch, where they were students, and began shooting inside a classroom on May 7, 2019. The shooting, in an English class where students were watching “The Princess Bride” three days before the last day of school, killed Kendrick Castillo, 18, a gentle teenager who was fascinated with cars and engineering and who tried to stop the attack. A jury convicted Mr. Erickson on Tuesday of 46 counts related to the shootings, including first-degree murder for the death of Mr. Castillo. Mr. Erickson, who was convicted after a 12-day trial, was also found guilty of conspiring to murder six other students who were shot during the attack but survived. Two other students in another classroom were also injured, according to prosecutors. After the verdict, John Castillo, Kendrick Castillo’s father, said the jury’s decision provided a measure of justice for his son, his only child. “I feel that he was with us. He was probably with those jurors helping this decision,” he told reporters after the verdict. “We’ll never quit missing him. We’ll never quit honoring him.” John Kellner, the district attorney for Colorado’s 18th Judicial District, said many more people would have been hurt and killed if it had not been for Mr. Castillo and other students who lunged at Mr. Erickson and Mr. McKinney. The mandatory penalty for first-degree murder in Colorado is life in prison without the possibility of parole, Mr. Kellner said. “There are hundreds of years on top of that that will be mandatory as well,” he told reporters after the verdict was announced. Mitchell Kraus, a student at the school who testified during the trial, said the verdict gave him a sense of relief and closure. “Now that I can be sure that this monster, to be honest, is never going to see the light of day again, it’s just a weight off my back,” Mr. Kraus told reporters. Mr. Erickson’s lawyers, David Kaplan and Julia Stancil, argued at the trial that he did not intend to kill anyone that day. They said that he was malnourished and depressed and that he had been using cocaine and methamphetamines in large quantities. Mr. Erickson, who is 5 feet 5 inches tall, weighed 95 pounds at the time of his arrest, according to a police affidavit. His lawyers said in their opening statement that before meeting Mr. McKinney, Mr. Erickson was a warm, funny teenager who loved music and was kind to people who were bullied. In 2019, when his mother became ill and his family life fractured, Mr. Erickson became depressed. The lawyers said that he fell under the influence of Mr. McKinney, who was 16 when the shootings occurred, and was “the puppet master.” Mr. Kaplan declined comment on the verdict on Wednesday. Mr. McKinney, whose legal name is Maya McKinney, told the authorities that he targeted several students who “always made fun of him, ‘hated him,’ called him names and said he was disgusting for trying to be a guy,” according to an affidavit from the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office. One student had broken Mr. McKinney’s laptop and repeatedly referred to him as “a she,” the affidavit states. Mr. McKinney also told the authorities that the suicidal and homicidal thoughts he’d had since he was 12 came back to him in the weeks before the shooting. Prosecutors said that both Mr. McKinney and Mr. Erickson fired guns they had taken after breaking into a locked cabinet in Mr. Erickson’s home. During the trial, prosecutors called Mr. McKinney to the stand. He testified that he and Mr. Erickson planned the attack together. The plan was to kill everyone in the classroom and then for Mr. Erickson to kill Mr. McKinney so Mr. Erickson would look heroic, Mr. McKinney said. Mr. Kraus, the student who testified at Mr. Erickson’s trial, told reporters that before the shootings, he walked down a hallway with Mr. Erickson. “The entire time not once did he turn to me and say, ‘This is about to happen, this is something that you can avoid,’” he said. “He just completely acted like it was normal.” Mr. McKinney pleaded guilty last year to 17 counts related to the shootings, including first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder after deliberation, and six counts of attempted murder after deliberation. He was sentenced to life in prison and an additional 38 years. Under Colorado law, the mandatory minimum sentence for someone convicted of committing first-degree murder at the age of 16 is life in prison with the possibility of parole after 40 years minus earned time. If Mr. McKinney were to be accepted into a special program for prisoners under 18, he could be released within 20 or 25 years, said Vikki Migoya, a spokeswoman for Mr. Kellner’s office. Mr. Erickson will be sentenced on Sept. 17. Advertisement"
1963205042,2021-06-16 18:09:14,Meet the moderators.,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/06/16/nyregion/nyc-mayor-debate/meet-the-moderators,en,False,,1,New York Times,http://nytimes.com,"The Democratic candidates sparred over homelessness, gun violence, education and policing in a wide-ranging debate. It was their final match-up before the June 22 primary. 5 takeaways from the final Democratic debate for New York mayor. By Emma G. Fitzsimmons and Dana Rubinstein The final debate in the race for the Democratic nomination for mayor was a serious event focused on the grave issues facing New York City: crime, homelessness, mental health needs and the ever-present lack of affordable housing. With all eight leading Democrats qualifying for the debate, the stage was crowded and the cross-talk abundant. The stakes were high. The debate came just six days before the Democratic primary, which is all but certain to determine the next mayor of New York. That mayor will be responsible for guiding the city out of an economic malaise caused by a once-in-a-century pandemic. Here are five takeaways. Debates are an opportunity for trailing candidates to damage the person at the top, but no one succeeded in hurting Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president who is leading in the polls. The debate was certainly testy, with several candidates taking aim at each other, but failing to make solid contact. Andrew Yang, the former presidential candidate, focused on attacking Mr. Adams, a former police captain, particularly on the issue of public safety. Mr. Yang highlighted his recent endorsement from the police captains’ union. “Eric’s former colleagues in the police captains’ union — people who worked with him for years, people who know him best — they just endorsed me,” Mr. Yang said. Maya Wiley, a former counsel to Mayor Bill de Blasio, criticized Mr. Adams for his support of the stop-and-frisk policing tactic in some cases. “The worst idea I’ve ever heard is bringing back stop and frisk and the anti-crime unit from Eric Adams,” she said. Mr. Adams defended himself, saying that he would not allow stop and frisk to be used to abuse people. Public safety, which continues to poll as one of the most pressing concerns among the electorate, again took center stage. Mr. Adams, who was both a police officer and a police reformer, argued that his professional experience best equipped him to tackle crime. Raymond J. McGuire, a former Wall Street executive, and Kathryn Garcia, the city’s former sanitation commissioner, explicitly rejected the defund-the-police movement, which Ms. Garcia referred to as a “hashtag.” “You need to sit down and really think through these things,” she said. Mr. McGuire said he thought the movement to defund the police “will end up in disaster for New Yorkers.” The debate about policing also touched on whether to put more officers on the subway. Scott Stringer, Dianne Morales and Ms. Wiley rejected the idea of putting more officers on trains and platforms. The other candidates said they supported the idea. The candidates clashed over the city’s homelessness problem and whether the solution should focus on helping those who are living on the streets or making everyone else feel safer. “Mentally ill homeless men are changing the character of our neighborhoods,” said Mr. Yang, who lives near Times Square. “Families are leaving as a result.” Mr. Yang promised to increase the number of inpatient “psych beds” in the city. His response differed from those of other candidates, who agreed on several overarching solutions, including responding to more 911 calls with mental health professionals. Mr. Stringer, who spoke of the need to build tens of thousands of units of “truly affordable housing,” went on the attack, characterizing Mr. Yang’s proposal as “psych beds for all.” Ms. Wiley mentioned the struggles of a formerly homeless man who goes by the name Shams DaBaron, who emerged as a spokesman for the residents of one of the hotels housing homeless people, The Lucerne, and who has endorsed Ms. Wiley’s campaign. “When the response was to send more police into the subways where he was riding because the congregate shelters were so dangerous, he asked for help, and what he got was handcuffed and taken to jail,” Ms. Wiley said, adding that outreach to try to get people to accept placement in shelters needed to be done by “the right people,” rather than the police. Later on in the debate, Mr. Yang returned to his original point. “Yes, mentally ill people have rights, but you know who else have rights?” Mr. Yang asked. “We do. The people and families of the city. We have the right to walk the street and not fear for our safety because a mentally ill person is going to lash out at us.” The candidates were encouraged to sling a little mud when moderators asked them to name the worst idea they had heard from one of their competitors. Mr. Adams took aim at Mr. Yang’s “universal basic income” proposal for New York City, which is less ambitious than the one he proposed on the 2020 presidential campaign trail. He wants to provide 500,000 New Yorkers living in poverty with an average of $2,000 per year. After Ms. Wiley criticized Mr. Adams on stop and frisk, Mr. McGuire and Ms. Morales got into a dispute over the defund-the-police movement. “Black and brown communities do not want either defund or stop and frisk,” Mr. McGuire said. “You are not speaking for all Black and brown communities because I am a member of that community, and you are certainly not speaking for me,” Ms. Morales responded. Ms. Morales said she thought adding more police officers to the subway system, an idea supported by several candidates, was the worst suggestion she had heard. Mr. Yang criticized Mr. Adams for once telling off-duty officers to take their guns to churches to keep them safe. Mr. Stringer criticized Mr. Yang’s ideas to put a casino on Governors Island, which is not legal, and to entice “TikTok hype houses” to come to the city. The candidates were asked to name a “legacy development project” they would embrace as mayor, like the revitalization of Times Square. It was a chance to be creative and visionary, but their answers were lackluster. Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor, built an extension of the 7 train line to Hudson Yards. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has highlighted a series of infrastructure projects, from the Mario M. Cuomo Bridge, which replaced the Tappan Zee Bridge just north of the city, to the new Moynihan Train Hall across from Pennsylvania Station. Mr. Yang answered, “The legacy I want to leave is a city that is working for us and our families,” before adding that he supports the QueensWay, a proposal to create a park on an old railway, and completing the water tunnel to carry the city’s water supply. Mr. Adams named his plan for tax credits for low-income New Yorkers. Ms. Garcia said she wanted to focus on climate change, including electrifying school buses and turning Rikers Island, which is currently home to a notorious jail, into “renewable Rikers with wind and solar and battery storage.” By Andy Newman and Mihir Zaveri transcript “The fact is, mentally ill homeless men are changing the character of our neighborhoods. A woman my wife, Ellen, is friends with — and her mom grew up in Hell’s Kitchen — was punched in the face by a mentally ill man, sent a picture of her bruised face around the mom group, spread like wildfire. This is happening in New York City. And we’re not talking enough about it. Families are leaving as a result, in East Harlem, the neighborhood has been changed. Upper West Side, the neighborhood has been changed. We owe our people and our families better than this. And I’m frustrated by the political nature of these responses. I mean, we’re not talking about housing affordability. We’re talking about the hundreds of mentally ill people we all see around us every day on the streets and the subways. We need to get them off of our streets and our subways, into a better environment. And when you ask what I’m going to do differently, I’m going to rebuild the stock of psych beds in our city because the number has gone down 14 percent — it should be going up 100 percent until there are resources necessary for anyone who’s mentally ill to not be on our streets. It’s not right for them. It’s not right for a city. There will be no recovery until we resolve this. I will fix this.” Moderator: “Thank you.” “Yes, mentally ill people have rights. But you know who else have rights? We do. The people and families of the city. We have the right to walk the street and not fear for our safety because a mentally ill person is going to lash out at us.” The Democratic candidates for New York mayor clashed at Wednesday night’s debate over how to help those who showed signs of untreated mental illness on city streets. Andrew Yang said it was crucial to get people with untreated mental illness off the streets, citing a series of attacks against Asian New Yorkers, many of which were committed by mentally ill people. He said the city should be able to identify people who need help — like people who are violent or unconscious — and get them medication, even in some cases where they don’t ask for help. “Yes, mentally ill people have rights, but you know who else have rights? We do: the people and families of the city,” Mr. Yang said. “We have the right to walk the street and not fear for our safety because a mentally ill person is going to lash out at us.” With the comments, Mr. Yang doubled down on remarks he had made earlier in the evening, when he was asked about people experiencing homelessness. “Mentally ill homeless men are changing the character of our neighborhoods,” he said, adding that families were leaving New York City because of their presence on the streets. “We’re talking about the hundreds of mentally ill people we see around us every day on the streets and the subways,” he said. “We need to get them off of our streets and our subways into a better environment.” Together, the comments reflected the aggressive rhetoric Mr. Yang has been using in recent days when talking about social issues and crime. His comments drew fire on social media from people who said they lacked empathy or understanding, and stigmatized people with mental illness. Many pointed out research that shows people with serious mental illness are far more likely to be victims of violent crime — not perpetrators. In a tweet on Thursday night, Mr. Yang responded to some of the criticism, saying he has “been an advocate for mental health and will continue” and that he had received counseling as a young person. “Full context here was mental illness is behind half of anti-Asian hate crimes,” he said. “We need to get them compassionate comprehensive care — and not let them languish on our streets.” His rhetoric also contrasted with the other candidates who emphasized reform of the way the city addresses mental health. Ray McGuire said he would make more use of Kendra’s law, which allows courts to compel those arrested to undergo psychiatric treatment when they are believed to be dangerous. Scott Stringer noted that a large percentage of 911 calls are not for crimes in progress but to report people with mental health issues. Last year, the police responded to 154,045 calls involving people deemed emotionally disturbed. Mr. Stringer recommended the city adopt a system used in Eugene, Ore., where mental health professionals respond to emergency calls. Dianne Morales made the issue personal. “Everyone on this stage has someone in their lives who has a mental health problem, if not themselves,” she said, adding that her daughter had “had mental health needs for years.” She said that despite being “someone who’s connected,” she had struggled to get her daughter appropriate care. Ms. Morales said the city needed to create “integrated community health clinics” where people could get access a “continuum of care ranging from peer counseling to much more intensive treatment.” Joseph Goldstein contributed reporting. Emma Fitzsimmons The final debate in the mayoral primary is over. Go vote! Early voting is open from now until June 20, and Election Day is June 22. Luis Ferré Sadurní Asked about their worst moment on the campaign trail, many candidates use the opportunity to talk about how they consoled grieving families over lost ones or housing. None mention the most turbulent moments of their campaigns, such as when Scott Stringer was accused by a woman of sexual misconduct or when staffers of the Dianne Morales campaign quit en masse over unionization efforts. Joseph Goldstein Dianne Morales proposed requiring delis to sell fresh fruit and vegetables. Ashley Southall If voters are looking for mayor who’s a healthy sleeper, the candidates might be in trouble. None said they got more than 7 hours a sleep each night, the minimum recommended for adults by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Jeff Mays The candidates are stretching their answers to the question of what they would ban to make New Yorkers healthy. Shaun Donovan says he would ban food deserts and neighborhoods that don’t have parks, though it’s unclear how you would ban those things. Mr. Adams said he would ban schools without rooftop farms. Kathryn Garcia would ban corn syrup. Luis Ferré Sadurní Eric Adams, the apparent leader of the race according to recent polls, emerged relatively unscathed from this debate. Besides a back-and-forth with Andrew Yang at the beginning of the debate, there were few, if any, forceful attacks against him from the other candidates Dana Rubinstein None of the candidates will admit to getting more than six hours of sleep. Mihir Zaveri We need to “shake and rock” the boat by building housing affordable to the poorest New Yorkers on vacant city-owned land, Scott Stringer says. Every other candidate has also discussed vacant city-owned land. It’s not clear that much of that land would be suitable for housing, and many of those lots may be clustered in the boroughs outside Manhattan. Mihir Zaveri Eric Adams takes a crack at the same question on if there is a level of income that should not get a city subsidy. Eric Adams also does not have a solid answer, but says the level should be lower than the scenario tossed out in the question, $137,000. Kathryn Garcia says she would target an income level of about $54,000 for a family of three, or lower. Dana Rubinstein Eric Adams is staying true to a central theme of his campaign — that he would be New York City’s first blue collar mayor in a very long time, if ever. He has repeatedly brought up his threadbare youth and just mentioned the time he worked as a dishwasher. Mihir Zaveri Moderator Sally Goldenberg clarifies the question: is there a level of income that the city should not subsidize housing for? Andrew Yang does not land on a solid number. Anne Barnard Big missed opportunity: On the climate lightning round, the confusing/imprecise wording of the questions made it hard for candidates to give yes or no questions and deeply obscured where they stand on several extremely important issues. By Jeffery C. Mays Andrew Lang, 43, who lives in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, described the mayor’s race and choosing a candidate as “rough.” “It’s weird to see how small the election seems for the amount of people that it governs,” he said. “The bureaucracy is nuts. They all look like they need help.” Mr. Lang said he was leaning toward not ranking candidates and only voting for one candidate, Maya Wiley. “I want to vote for a woman,” Mr. Lang said. “She’s progressive and she seems in tune with parents.” A woman mayor, he said, would have more compassion for the people of the city. “Let’s let a woman run the show for a little bit.” Mihir Zaveri Private developers who include affordable units have access to tax breaks and other incentives. Not every candidate has said explicitly they would change this, but Dianne Morales says she would redirect those investments. The real estate industry has said it may not be economically feasible to include units affordable to lower income New Yorkers without subsidies. Mihir Zaveri Another question on affordable housing, which notes that developments can technically include units for those that make up $137,000, which I’m presuming was for a family of three. Almost every candidate has criticized such an approach, or sought to change it. Dana Rubinstein We have entered a strange new portion of the debate, where the candidates seem to be answering policy questions in unison, and collaboratively – together they tackled the question of whether to cut off all new natural gas infrastructure in new construction and whether to require energy-efficient retrofits. By Eliza Shapiro The mayoral candidates were asked during the final Democratic debate whether they would prioritize integrating city public schools or improving them. But many experts would say that’s a false choice. In fact, research has shown that desegregation is a school improvement plan. Decades of attempts to improve city schools at scale without integration have had mixed results, at best. Most of the candidates took issue with the premise of the question, and said that integration and school improvement can and should complement each other. Even some of the candidates who have not promised major changes on integration, including Kathryn Garcia and Andrew Yang, said Wednesday that they would pursue some desegregation policies to boost city schools. Ms. Garcia spoke about her plan to boost arts and early literacy in public schools, and Mr. Yang returned to a favorite topic of his: the failures of remote learning during the pandemic. Eric Adams spoke about his own experience attending segregated schools as a child in New York City, and said students needed to be exposed to more diverse environments. Maya Wiley, who has spent the last few years pushing for school desegregation policies, has been at times muted on this highly contentious issue during the campaign. Still, she reiterated her plan to eliminate admissions rules she considers discriminatory, which sets her apart from many of her competitors. Anne Barnard On climate change: All but Andrew Yang say citywide composting should be mandated. All say that buildings should be retrofitted to reduce planet-warming emissions -- but landlords may need help to finance that. (A 2019 city law starts this process with the largest buildings). Ashley Southall In mentioning her daughter’s experience, Dianne Morales tapped into a sentiment we come across often in our crime reporting, which is how difficult it is to get help for those experiencing mental illness before there is violence or tragedy. Jeff Mays Andrew Yang is focusing on the mentally ill and dangerousness tonight. Most mental health advocates warn against equating mental illness and violence. Dianne Morales said the framing of the conversation is “fundamentally flawed.” Mihir Zaveri The discussion on supportive housing also touches on a theme nearly every candidate has focused on: combining the strategies to tackle the housing crisis with those designed to address homelessness. The candidates have criticized the city for treating each issue in its own silo. By Dana Rubinstein The final Democratic debate before the mayoral primary has been a testy one — with several candidates peevishly taking aim at each other, but failing to make solid contact. As usual, Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, seemed irritated by Andrew Yang, and Mr. Yang by Mr. Adams. Their personal animus felt tangible, particularly when Mr. Yang accused Mr. Adams of trying to win support from the police captains union, which Mr. Adams denied. (The union endorsed Mr. Yang.) Ray McGuire, the former Citigroup executive, and Dianne Morales, a former nonprofit executive, got into an off-topic dispute over whether Mr. McGuire could legitimately claim to speak for Black people. Scott Stringer, the New York City comptroller, and Mr. Yang got into it over the value of Mr. Yang’s guaranteed income proposal, which Mr. Stringer said would amount to no more than $5 a day. Mr. Stringer said that was a pittance. Mr. Yang disagreed. The candidates had a hard time coming up with one legacy development project they wanted to complete as mayor, and proposed few novel ideas when asked how they would deal with homelessness. So far, little has taken place that would seem to move the needle on these candidates’ relative standing in the polls, which have mostly shown Mr. Adams as the front-runner. Mihir Zaveri Kathryn Garcia emphasizes the need for supportive housing -- housing that includes social services for homeless people, which many other candidates have also said they would push for. It is one of the areas that Mayor Bill de Blasio has faced criticism for not investing in enough. Luis Ferré Sadurní Maya Wiley highlights, again, her plan to hire an additional 2,500 teachers. She’s hammered that point on the campaign trail repeatedly. I’d bet that resonates more with the average voter than a back-and-forth over how the city’s pension fund is managed. Ashley Southall The candidates are talking about integrating schools 67 years after the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling in Brown v. Board of Education declaring educational segregation unconstitutional. Jeff Mays Ray McGuire stormed into the race with support from the business community and raised $5 million in three months, but his campaign has not caught on with voters. McGuire has been more feisty tonight, perhaps realizing this is his last chance to impress voters before the June 22 primary. Luis Ferré Sadurní Ray McGuire has been combative in this debate. Just now, he criticized Maya Wiley for her efforts during her time in the de Blasio administration implementing broadband for low-income New Yorkers. A few minutes later, he clashed with Scott Stringer over his management of the city’s pension fund. Eliza Shapiro The candidates are asked whether integrating schools or improving them is more important. But many experts would say that’s a false choice. In fact, research has shown that desegregation is a school improvement plan. Decades of attempts to improve city schools at scale without integration have had mixed results, at best. Patrick McGeehan Apparently no buildings, bridges or tunnels will be named after the next mayor or the mayor’s relatives. Asked to name a legacy development project they would create, all the candidates named less egocentric goals like green roofs on schools, solar panels and broadband for all. Anne Barnard Scott Stringer also cites his achievement of divesting city funds from fossil-fuel companies. Dana Rubinstein In a twist on the old political saw about putting a chicken in every pot, Scott Stringer promises a solar panel on every roof and an electric battery in every basement. Anne Barnard Climate change is an existential threat, Kathryn Garcia says: “a new green NYC” would be her legacy infrastructure project. Rikers Island needs to be a renewable energy hub, every school needs a green roof to retain stormwater, reduce stormwater runoff and be an eco-classroom, and 10,000 school buses need to be electrified. By Michael Gold The candidates were encouraged to sling a little mud when moderators asked them to name the worst idea they’d heard from one of their competitors. As might be expected in a race where concerns about crime have dominated, most of the answers and at least one heated exchange were about police and public safety. Both Kathryn Garcia, who has been hesitant to criticize other candidates on a debate stage, and Ray McGuire took issue with rivals who they claimed were oversimplifying the issue of policing. “These are complicated times,” said Ms. Garcia, the former sanitation commissioner, “and several of my opponents are using hashtags, #DefundthePolice. I just don’t think that’s the right approach. You need to sit down and really think through these things.” Mr. McGuire, a former Wall Street executive, said that he thought the movement to defund the police “will end up in disaster for New Yorkers.” Maya Wiley, a civil rights lawyer and a progressive, then said that she believed that suggestions by Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, to bring back stop-and-frisk policing and a plainclothes anti-crime unit were the worst ideas she had heard on the campaign trail. Then the sparring started, in a lengthy exchange over race and policing that involved the four Black candidates on the stage. First, Mr. Adams deflected Ms. Wiley’s criticism of his proposals by pointing out that her family had helped pay for her neighborhood’s private security patrol. Ms. Wiley tried to deflect the deflection, saying that New Yorkers understood that public safety meant more than increasing policing and required other investments. Then, Mr. McGuire jumped in to say that he thought both defunding the police and the return of stop and frisk were detrimental for “Black and brown” communities. He was quickly attacked by Dianne Morales, who is Afro-Latina, and who noted that many of the activists who started the defund the police movement were Black and Latino and said that Mr. McGuire could not purport to speak for them. “How dare you assume to speak for Black and brown communities as a monolith,” she said. “You cannot do that.” “Yes, I can. I just did,” Mr. McGuire shot back. “You know what else I’m going to do? I’m going to do it again.” After the heated crossfire, Shaun Donovan declined to answer the original question, speaking about one of his own campaign ideas instead of criticizing a rival’s proposal. Ms. Morales then said that she thought adding more police officers to the subway system, an idea supported by several candidates, was the worst suggestion she’d heard. At the start of the segment, Andrew Yang criticized Mr. Adams for once telling off-duty officers to bring their guns to churches to keep them safe. Mr. Adams shot back by criticizing Mr. Yang’s modified version of a universal basic income plan, which would give payments to the poorest New Yorkers. He called the idea “Monopoly money.” Scott Stringer also said the worst ideas he’d heard were Mr. Yang’s, highlighting his suggestions to put a casino on Governors Island, which is not legal, and to entice “TikTok hype houses” to come to the city. Ashley Southall Ray McGuire invokes Stevie Wonder and James Brown to criticize his rivals for “talking loud, saying nothing” in their answers to budget questions. But he didn’t give a straight answer when asked whether he would support a tax hike on the wealthy, who have supported his candidacy. Dana Rubinstein The candidates are apparently incapable of naming one legacy development project they’d like to facilitate as mayor. Patrick McGeehan Ray McGuire, sounding like Ronald Reagan, says cutting the budget won’t work, the answer is growth. Luis Ferré Sadurní Ray McGuire, a Wall Street executive, who has received generous campaign contributions from the business community doesn’t quite answer the question when asked if he would support tax increases on the wealthy. Lawmakers in Albany recently increased the income tax rate on the rich. Dana Rubinstein Scott Stringer demonstrates that he is ready to dodge questions as a mayor. When asked what give-backs he would demand from the teacher’s union, which endorsed him, he trots out a tried and true mayoral evasion tactic: He says he will not negotiate labor contracts in public. Patrick McGeehan Kathryn Garcia said the $22 billion in pandemic federal aid the city has received is a “gift that we need to make use of.” But she did not specify how she would spend that money. Eliza Shapiro Scott Stringer, who has been endorsed by the city’s teachers’ union, declines to say how he would re-negotiate that contract to find savings in the city budget. He says he won’t negotiate the budget in public, but notes his deep experience with the city budget as comptroller. He is, of course, clearly trying not to say anything that might ruffle feathers at the UFT. Jeff Mays Eric Adams talks about growing up poor when he responds to many questions. Tonight he mentioned it in response to a question about the city’s economic recovery. It speaks to how Mr. Adams has, more than any other candidate, cultivated a base among poor and working-class New Yorkers. Patrick McGeehan Kathryn Garcia says she would reduce the projected $5 billion budget deficit by sitting down with unions to “work on real productivity changes,” as well as streamlining city services and seeking efficiencies. By Precious Fondren Elena Aleksandrova, 32, lives in Flatbush, Brooklyn. She cast her vote, with Maya Wiley as her first choice, at Erasmus Hall High School on Tuesday afternoon. Ms. Aleksandrova said she thought there were a lot of problems facing the city, but the biggest concern for her was New York’s recovery after the pandemic. “There are many problems, obviously, but recovering post-Covid is a big issue. I think housing is also an enormous issue,” she said. “Obviously education — as a teacher, I think that’s also something that needs to be addressed.” By Andy Newman The city’s chronic homelessness has taken on greater urgency over the course of the campaign this spring, as New York has seen an apparent rash of random assaults, often carried out by people who appeared to be homeless, mentally ill, or both. The candidates clashed Wednesday night over whether this was more of a problem for those who are afflicted with mental illness and homelessness, or for everyone else. Andrew Yang said the solution was simple. “We need to get them off of our streets and our subways into a better environment,” he said of mentally ill people on the streets and subways. “There will be no recovery until we resolve this.” He promised to double the inventory of inpatient psychiatric beds in the city, a nod to the fact that many hospitals have gotten rid of psychiatric beds to build Covid-19 units. Scott Stringer, who had spoken of the need to build tens of thousands of units of “truly affordable housing,” went on the attack. “That is the greatest non-answer I’ve ever heard in all of our debates,” he barked at Mr. Yang. “Not one specific idea.” He defied Mr. Yang to tell him how much his plan would cost. The exchange came hours after Mayor Bill de Blasio announced plans to move 8,000 homeless people from the hotel rooms they were moved into during the pandemic back to barrackslike congregate shelters by the end of July, to make way for tourists. Many of the hotels are in Manhattan neighborhoods where long-term residents have complained that the hotel guests use drugs and create other nuisances. Other candidates shied away from Mr. Yang’s harsh rhetoric. Maya Wiley mentioned the struggles of a formerly homeless man who goes by the name Shams DaBaron and emerged as a spokesman for the residents of one of the hotels, The Lucerne. “When the response was to send more police into the subways where he was riding because the congregate shelters were so dangerous, he asked for help, and what he got was handcuffed and taken to jail,” Ms. Wiley said, adding that outreach to try to get people to accept placement in shelters needed to be done by “the right people,” rather than the police. By Michael Gold Andrew Yang and Eric Adams sparred over whether Mr. Adams, once a police captain, had sought the endorsement of his former union, a fiery back-and-forth that represented the complicated role of police unions in a Democratic race dominated by conversations about police reform and public safety. On Monday, Mr. Yang received the endorsement of the Captains Endowment Association, the union that once represented Mr. Adams. When asked at the debate to explain why he was the candidate best equipped to tackle a violent rise in crime, Mr. Yang pointed to the endorsement from Mr. Adams’s old co-workers. “The people you should ask about this are Eric’s former colleagues in the police captain’s union,” Mr. Yang said. “The people who worked with him for years, who know him best. They just endorsed me.” Mr. Adams tried to dismiss the endorsement, suggesting that he hadn’t asked for it and that was the only reason Mr. Yang had received it. But Mr. Yang accused him of lying, saying that NBC had reported otherwise. “I never went in front of them,” Mr. Adams said after a beat, looking more flustered than he has in past debates. “I said, months ago, I’m not taking any of the union’s endorsements.” But Mr. Yang suggested that the head of the captains’ union had said differently. Mr. Yang has said that he thinks it is important for New York City’s mayor to have a good relationship with police. On Tuesday, he expressed openness to receiving the endorsement of the Police Benevolent Association and Sergeants Benevolent Association, the city’s two largest police unions, both of which are run mostly by white conservatives. Mr. Adams has tried to distance himself from both unions recently. At the debate, he said the captains’ union had not endorsed him because of his record of police reform. The captains, he said, remembered him as someone who “fought against the abuse of stop and frisk, who fought against heavy-handed policing, who fought against treating our young people for marijuana arrests.” By Precious Fondren Youla Duke, 62, said the biggest issue the next mayor should tackle immediately is crime. “The thing on the subway and the buses with all these different incidents,” she said. “It’s getting to be ridiculous. People are fearful to go on the train and on the bus like me. I walk everywhere I got to go now.” Ms. Duke, who lives in Flatbush, Brooklyn, said her top choice is Eric Adams, because of his record as a police officer. “I do love him,” she said. “He wants to work for the community and for the people, and to prevent the gun violence and all this stuff, which is good.” By Ashley Wong Philip and Rita Harris, both 70 and retired, live three blocks away from the polling place at the Bronx Supreme Court, where they voted on Tuesday. Though both have lived in the Bronx for over 30 years, this is the first time they have voted in a mayoral election. The couple are fed up with the rise in gun violence, they said, as well as the rate of homelessness and sanitation issues. “Get the guns off the street,” Mrs. Harris said. “Every time you open the TV,” she said, you see “drive-by shootings.” “Normally we vote for the president, but this time we said, ‘Let’s come vote for the mayor,’” Mrs. Harris said. “We want something to change. We want New York City to be New York City.” By Michael Gold Kathryn Garcia was one of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s senior cabinet members until last fall, when she left her job as the city’s sanitation commissioner to prepare for her campaign for mayor. Ms. Garcia, 51, had never sought elected office before, but she has an extensive city government résumé and developed a reputation as a go-to problem solver. She has campaigned on that experience and her knowledge of city government, hoping it would resonate with voters. After flying under the radar, Ms. Garcia’s campaign began to pick up steam in recent weeks, particularly after endorsements from the editorial boards of The New York Times and The Daily News. The wider name recognition has brought more attention to her policy positions and track record at the Sanitation Department, where she oversaw programs that are vital to making New York function, including trash collection and snow removal. But as she has gained more support, she has also faced more attacks from her rivals that were absent during the earlier phases of the campaign, including criticism this week from Eric Adams regarding allegations that women and minority workers at the Sanitation Department received unequal pay, a charge Ms. Garcia said was “mudslinging.” By Katie Glueck Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller, has worked in and around politics and government for decades. He served on a community planning board as a teenager and rose steadily through New York City’s Democratic ranks from there. He was a district leader, a state assemblyman and the Manhattan borough president before defeating former Gov. Eliot Spitzer in the 2013 Democratic primary on the way to becoming comptroller. Mr. Stringer, 61, has cast himself as both a progressive candidate and a seasoned government veteran who is prepared to “manage the hell out of the city” from his first day as mayor. His bid has been complicated by two allegations of unwanted sexual advances from decades ago, both of which he has denied. A number of progressive officials who had endorsed him no longer do, but he has retained some support from labor groups, most notably the teachers’ union. By Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura Shaun Donovan, a self-described housing nerd, was the federal housing secretary under President Barack Obama and New York City’s housing commissioner under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. Mr. Donovan, 55, has proposed creating 30,000 affordable housing units per year, investing $2 billion in repairs to the city’s existing housing stock and ensuring that every New Yorker lives within a 15-minute walk of school, health care and coffee shops. He has also vowed to create the city’s first-ever chief equity officer and to give every child $1,000 at birth. He wants to significantly reduce the number of police and to appoint a police commissioner of color. He also says that he wants state lawmakers to pass legislation that would enable most convictions to be automatically removed from a person’s record after a certain period of time. By Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura Eric Adams is among the most politically seasoned candidates in the race: Before being elected to his current job as Brooklyn borough president in 2013, he spent six years in the New York State Senate. He began his career in the Police Department, rising to captain while pushing for reform as a result of his own experience being beaten by officers as a teenager. Mr. Adams, 60, has run as a political moderate, opposing calls to defund the police while proposing to publicly identify officers whom the Police Department is monitoring for bad behavior. Other elements of his platform include giving New Yorkers real-time ratings for how government agencies perform, appointing an “efficiency czar” and using drones to perform building inspections. Some of Mr. Adams’s critics claim that he is too cozy with real estate interests, and they have noted that he was a registered Republican from 1995 to 2002. He has also faced several ethics investigations, including one that found he violated conflict-of-interest rules by soliciting money for a nonprofit organization he controls from donors who had business with the city. His opponents have also questioned whether he lives part-time in New Jersey, which, if true, would not render him ineligible as a candidate but, they say, would underline questions about his transparency as a politician. By Mihir Zaveri Tonight’s two-hour debate will be moderated by four veteran journalists with decades of experience covering local government and a variety of national news stories: David Ushery, an anchor at WNBC; Melissa Russo, WNBC’s government affairs reporter; Allan Villafaña, an anchor at Telemundo 47; and Sally Goldenberg, Politico New York’s City Hall bureau chief. Mr. Ushery, an anchor on the 4 p.m. and 11 p.m. editions of News 4 New York, joined WNBC in 2013 and has covered several big news stories, including the unrest following the murder of George Floyd and the 2012 mass shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. He joined WNBC from WABC, where he was a reporter and an anchor. Ms. Russo joined WNBC in 1998 and has covered four New York City mayors and dozens of elections. She has also pursued a variety of stories as part of WNBC’s investigative team, including recent exposés on the lack of protective gear at a nonprofit serving adults with disabilities during the pandemic and a rat infestation at a public housing day camp. Mr. Villafaña, who joined Telemundo in 2012, is a news anchor for Noticiero 47 Telemundo. He appears on the station’s Primera Edición broadcast, from 5 a.m. to 7 a.m., during the week, as well as its noon broadcast, Al Mediodía. He also hosts a weekend program on public affairs, Focus New York, which airs on Sundays at 8 a.m. Ms. Goldenberg joined the City Hall team at Politico in 2013 to cover the administration of Bill de Blasio. Before that, she worked at The New York Post, covering Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the City Council. She also worked for The Staten Island Advance from 2005 to 2008 and The New Jersey Star-Ledger from 2002 to 2005. The moderators are likely to have a challenge ahead of them: All eight leading Democratic candidates will participate tonight. The last time they were onstage together, on June 2, the debate devolved into a chaotic, tumultuous two hours in which the candidates talked over each other and repeated talking points they’d delivered before. The debate, which is being held at NBC's headquarters at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, will be hosted by WNBC and co-hosted by Telemundo 47, Politico, the Citizens Budget Commission and the New York Urban League."
1963234329,2021-06-16 19:12:50,Police: Fatal Austin mass shooting arose from a teenage feud,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/police-fatal-austin-mass-shooting-arose-teenage-feud-78325286,en,True,,39000,ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/,"Police say a deadly weekend mass shooting in Austin's famed entertainment district arose from a feud between two groups of Central Texas teenagers On Location: October 14, 2021 A deadly weekend mass shooting in Austin’s famed entertainment district  arose from a feud between two groups of Central Texas teenagers, according to a police affidavit filed Wednesday. Harker Heights High School student Jeremiah Tabb, 17, was arrested at school Monday and remained in Travis County Jail on Wednesday. He is charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, a second-degree felony punishable by two to 20 years in prison. Bond is set at $500,000, but a police spokesman said it was unclear if he had an attorney to speak on his behalf. In the arrest affidavit filed by Austin police filed in a Travis County district court Wednesday, a wounded male juvenile is quoted as telling detectives at an Austin hospital that he was with friends on East Sixth Street, a famous entertainment strip, when they began exchanging stares with a youth he identified as JT and JT's friends. The male juvenile, who was not identified by name, said he had attended the same Killeen middle school as JT, who said to the juvenile's group, “What y'all wanna do? Y'all wanna fight?” The juvenile said he answered, “It's whatever,"" at which point JT pulled a handgun from his waistband and opened fire. A companion of the juvenile, also a juvenile, drew his own gun and returned fire. One person was killed and more than a dozen others were wounded. Police showed a yearbook photo of Tabb to the hospitalized juvenile, who identified him as the one who shot him. He told police that Tabb had already shot him in the leg in Killeen a few days earlier. Police in Killeen, 70 miles (113 kilometers) north of Austin, have a complaint on file from that shooting, according to the affidavit. Police found eight spent shell casings on the sidewalk where Tabb and his group were standing, all of which were determined to have likely come from the same gun, the affidavit states. There was no word on whether shell casings were found in the street, where the juvenile's group was walking. The juvenile gunman also remained under detention. Police have released no information on that suspect, nor on whether they have determined who fired the shot that killed Douglas John Kantor, 25. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Surprise, Mr. President!",https://pjmedia.com/columns/kevindowneyjr/2021/06/16/eleven-mass-shootings-in-four-days-who-is-responsible-surprise-mr-president-n1455063,en,False,,19082,PJ Media,http://pjmedia.com,"The U.S. had a staggering 11 mass shootings in the last four days and 35 shootings from June 1 to June 15, 11:59 p.m. Shootings are up almost 40% from 2020, which saw a record-breaking 600+ shootings, up roughly 33% from 2019. Let’s see what happens when the summer heat kicks in. Suggestion: lock and load. Lefty news would have us believing that mass shooters are typically white, Trump-loving, tobaccy chawin’ good ole boys, driving around in pick-ups and flyin’ Dixie. Gropey Joe Biden and Merrick Garland keep warning us that the nation’s biggest threat comes from the roughly 5,000 white supremacists, though news reports of their supposed crimes is such intriguingly scarce. Weird, right? Here is a look at the last 11 mass shootings in the U.S. Stats Of the last 11 mass shootings, three were confirmed to have been committed by black males, one in Albertville, Ala., on June 15, one in Cincinnati on June 12, and two black shooters in Austin on June 12, where 14 people got shot. Of the remaining shootings, four took place in neighborhoods that are at least 90.1% black. I don’t know any white supremacists but I believe it’s safe to say they would likely avoid black neighborhoods. Also, if a white guy in a MAGA hat shot 10 people in a black Chicago neighborhood, the media, reluctant to release a description of a black shooter, would trip over themselves to report a white shooter. So I think it’s safe to say the shooters were definitely not white, and most likely black. Of the four remaining shootings, one — at a drag strip in Ohio — likely involved an Hispanic shooter, since all the people involved in the fight are arguing in Spanish. The cops know who the suspect is but oddly won’t release his name. That leaves three shootings, one in Lansing, Mich., one in Louisville, Ky., and one in Boynton Beach, Fla., where too little info is given to even have a clue as to who was doing the shootings, though the media LOVES to report a white guy committing a mass shooting, so… extrapolate what you will. Of the 11 shootings, none are linked to white people. Sorry, Mr. President. It isn’t cops and white supremacists that are shooting unarmed black men. As per Gun violence archive, which has compiled data on the shootings mentioned here, a mass shooting involves four or more people getting shot, not including the shooter, in a fluid situation. June 15, Chicago, Ill.: Four people were shot, none killed. Despite the Left’s belief that mass shootings are a plague on the U.S., no news reports mention a description of the shooter, nor do they report that the shooting took place in a part of Chicago that is 95.58% black. June 15, Albertville, Ala.:  A workplace shooting at a fire hydrant manufacturer left two dead and two wounded when a black employee showed up and began shooting his co-workers. Two of them died, one of whom was white and one of whom was black. Both were men. Police have no motives yet. The gunman drove to his mother’s grave and killed himself. June 15, Chicago, Ill.: Eight people were shot, four of whom died. All the pictured victims and their families are black. The shooting took place in a neighborhood that is 95.31% black. No description of the suspect or suspects could be found. I’d think the liberal news would be going out of their way to identify the person or persons that shot eight black people. June 14, Boynton Beach, Fla.:  One man was killed and three were injured in a shooting on I-95. Few details were available and there was no mention of a suspect description. June 14, Lansing, Mich.:  Two were killed and two were wounded in a 1:00 a.m. shooting near a park. A 19-year-old male and a 16-year-old male were killed, a 14-year-old female was wounded, and a 17-year-old male was  wounded. There was no suspect information available even though 2 teens were killed and two more were injured. June 13, West Salem, Ohio: A shooting at a drag strip left one dead and four wounded. Even though a video shows a fight amongst Hispanic men, no descriptions of the suspects were published, and the video wasn’t immediately released. June 13, Louisville, Ky.:  One male was killed and three people were wounded in a shooting that took place in a majority-black neighborhood (43.03%) around midnight. Details are suspiciously vague. The sexes of the wounded people weren’t released. The shooting took place outside of a house. June 12, Cincinnati, Ohio: Five people were shot and wounded, none killed, by a black man out on an OR bond for a weapons charge. “Weapons-related offenses and an OR bond and for those that don’t know what that means, it means they walked out the door without posting a single dime,” stated Cincinnati Fraternal Order of Police President Dan Hils. The victims include an eight year old and a six year old, the former of whom is still on a ventilator, shot by a guy who should have been in jail. Thank you, Democrats! June 12, Chicago, Ill.:  A black woman was killed and 9 other people were wounded in the Chatham section of Chicago which is 96.66% black. Chatham ranks ninth in Chicago’s most shootiest neighborhoods. June 12, Austin, Texas:  Fourteen people were shot, one of whom was killed, when two high school enemies from Killeen, Texas, decided to shoot it out at approximately 1:30 a.m. in Austin. Democrats are using the tragedy to urge Texas Governor Abbott to veto a permitless carry bill, even though neither of the two teens arrested is old enough to own a handgun in Texas, where the legal age is 21. Authorities were reluctant to release info about the shooters, as reported by PJM’s Paula Bolyard. June 12, Cleveland, Ohio: Three were killed and four wounded at a gas station known for violence. All the victims and families shown are black. The neighborhood is 90.1% black. No description of the suspect(s). Kevin Downey, Jr. Is a comedian and columnist.

Wednesday, 16 June 2021 02:43 PM The man charged with shooting and wounding multiple people in three separate attacks over the weekend told police that his actions were racially motivated, saying that he targeted ""military-looking white males,"" the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer reports. Justin Tyran Roberts, 39, is accused of assaulting five people on Friday and Saturday in Columbus, Georgia, and Phenix City, Alabama. During a court appearance on Monday related to one of the incidents, a shooting on Saturday at about 2 p.m., Detective Brandon Lockhard testified that Roberts told police ""I had to have him,"" referring to the victim, who was shot as he entered his vehicle in a parking area under the Oglethorpe Bridge. Lockhard said later that during an interview at police headquarters, Roberts, who is Black, ""explained throughout his life, specifically white males had taken from him, and also what he described as ‘military-looking white males’ had taken from him."" Roberts claimed that these men had been ""shooting at him in a wooded area with a slingshot,"" and given him wounds that became infected, but police found no injuries that matched. His public defender, Robin King, asked the judge, Julius Hunter, to order a mental health evaluation for her client. ""The officer’s testimony has demonstrated that Mr. Roberts is having delusions and a disconnect from reality,"" she said, and Hunter agreed. The prosecutor, Nicholas Hud, noted during the hearing that Roberts has previously been convicted of multiple felonies, including having stolen a firearm and of possessing a gun while a convicted felon. He also said that the random nature of the attacks and the racial motivation illustrates that Roberts presents a public safety risk and that the victims of the shooting did not want Roberts released on bond. Police found Roberts about two hours after the Saturday shooting sitting outside with a 9-millimeter pistol that had been stolen last week. He faces charges of aggravated assault, using a gun to commit a crime, and carrying a firearm as a convicted felon, and will be held without bond.  © 2021 Newsmax. All rights reserved.

'Tucker Carlson Tonight' host evaluates the Chicago mayor's priorities amid crime spike We want to start with an insurrection — an insurrection against the rule of law, against civilization itself — that’s been going on for more than a year in the city of Chicago. Since the death of George Floyd last May, Chicago’s mayor, Lori Lightfoot, has embraced every part of the equity and inclusion agenda. Lightfoot banned the police from chasing criminals, even in the case of some very serious offensives. And her D.A. refuses to prosecute many crimes. The results? Nearly 200 more people have been murdered this year than last. Many more dead people, hundreds. Yesterday, there was yet another mass killing in Chicago. REPORTER: Denice Mathis, Ratanya Rogers, Blake Lee, and Shermetria Williams all killed in Chicago’s mass shooting. The shooting happened at 5:45 Tuesday morning in Englewood. … Of the eight people that were shot, four died. The other four victims are in the hospital. Two of them reported to be in critical condition.  The attack is the third mass shooting in Chicago in a little more than a week. The third mass shooting in just over a week, each one of them was a far greater human tragedy than anything that happened at the Capitol on January 6. But as the bodies in Chicago accumulate, the people who run the city barely notice. In fact, they make it possible. Four days before Christmas, a 28-year-old named Marvin Flanagan murdered a man during a home invasion. Flanagan should have been in jail at the time. He was a five-time felon with convictions for armed robbery. But officials let him out, and he promptly committed murder. CHICAGO SHOOTING VICTIMS INCLUDE 3 MOTHERS, 1 WHO WAS SET TO GRADUATE This now common in the city of Chicago. Marvin Flanagan is just one of the dozens of criminals who’ve been let out of jail in Chicago recently, only to go on to shoot or murder someone else. Lori Lightfoot did this. But she accepts no responsibility for doing. Instead, she blames firearms, and demands more money from the federal government: LIGHTFOOT: Cities individually cannot tackle this problem on its own. We just cannot. In Chicago, we've done absolutely everything possible and we need help from the federal government because this is a national problem. It’s a national problem, the gun problem. Is it really? Chicago has long had some of the strictest gun control in the nation. Montana has virtually none. Who’s got a higher murder rate? This entire conversation is nonsense. Lori Lightfoot has no idea what she’s talking about, and in fact, she’s not very interested. As long as her own security detail shows up on time, Lightfoot doesn’t think much about crime. What she thinks about is radical social change — and this week, she got an assist from the U.S. Congress. Starting this Saturday, our country will get a new Independence Day, to supplant the old one, which people like Lori Lightfoot complained was racist. Not a single member of either party in the Senate opposed it. Republicans, in fact, co-sponsored the resolution. ""Happy that my bill to recognize Juneteenth as a national holiday just passed the Senate,"" wrote John Cornyn, a supposedly conservative senator from Texas. TUCKER CARLSON: AMERICANS SHOULD APPLY FOR ASYLUM IN EL SALVADOR, IT'S SAFER THAN BALTIMORE AND CHICAGO Lori Lightfoot is thrilled by this. Unlike John Cornyn, she understands the power of symbols. They’re immensely important, that’s why we have them. For Flag Day on Monday -- a holiday designed to honor the American flag -- Lightfoot is flying something called the ""Pan African"" flag. It's now up in city hall. That, and the Juneteenth flag. LIGHTFOOT: We must also recognize that freedom has been illusory for far too many American residents, including Black people.  So we must embrace all American history and today on Juneteenth, we will be raising another flag: the Juneteenth flag. ""Freedom has been illusory."" Really? What’s she saying? Well, she’s saying your old Independence Day, and the nation it celebrates is a lie. This is the kind of thing Lori Lightfoot spends her time doing — that and berating her staff. Thanks to an open record request from the Chicago Tribune, we’ve got some of Lori Lightfoot’s emails. Turns out she’s every bit the person you thought she was. In January, for example, Lightfoot told her staff: ""I need office time every day!"" exclamation point. She wrote that same line sixteen times in a row: ""I need office time every day!"" ""I need office time every day!"" ""I need office time every day!""  And so on. Thirteen more times. Demented. And then, for clarity: ""Not just once a week or some days, every day!"" Lightfoot wrote that exact same line ten more times in a row. EMAIL REVEALS LORI LIGHTFOOT BERATING AID FOR NOT SCHEDULING MORE ‘OFFICE TIME’ She needs help. But not as much helps as her staff needs. Someone ought to stage a hostage extraction for their sake. Lightfoot ended her email with this: ""If this doesn't change immediately, I will just start unilaterally canceling things every day. Have I made myself clear, finally?!"" So, as the bodies piled up, hundreds more under her tenure as mayor, you have to wonder, how long did it take Lightfoot to write all of that? Was she shaking, spitting, and screaming as she did? Of course, she was. But apparently, it didn’t work. It wasn’t enough. Things did not improve in the mayor’s office, despite those missives. In May of last year, Lightfoot announced a new policy for memos that arrive late. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Late memos won’t just be rejected -- they'd be torn by rage-filled fingers into millions of tiny little pieces, and cast into the wind, like chaff. Given the right weather conditions, memo fragments might blow over Lake Michigan and fall on Grand Rapids. In an email to her staff, Lightfoot attached a picture of a ripped-up document, for emphasis. Lori Lightfoot, human shredding machine. And yet still, somehow, this person remains mayor of America’s third-largest city. How long can that continue?

	Brent Lang Executive Editor of Film and Media In person, Ann Dowd, sweet, solicitous and ready to laugh at herself, is far removed from Gilead, the totalitarian state where Aunt Lydia, her alter ego on “The Handmaid’s Tale,” rules with an iron fist, doling out punishment for the slightest infraction. As she sips a cappuccino and raises her voice ever so slightly to compete with the whooshing sounds of a nearby subway or a fire truck’s siren, she confesses that she wonders why she agreed to tackle her next acting challenge. Dowd, you see, is about to launch a sold-out solo version of “Enemy of the People,” a production that will see the actor assume all the roles in Henrik Ibsen’s morality tale. Moreover, she’ll bring the story — about a town doctor who risks everything to expose a scandal involving contaminated water — to life in the Park Avenue Armory, a cavernous space that dwarfs even the largest Broadway venue.  “Theater was where I learned about acting. But stepping back into live theater on a regular basis is how you find out where your courage lies,” says Dowd. This won’t be a literal adaptation, as one should expect from Robert Icke, the show’s director, who has previously put a modern spin on such canonical classics as “1984” and “Mary Stuart.” Instead, audiences sit with friends and family in pods and are asked to vote on the action of the play at key moments. The majority opinion then determines what direction the plot takes and how the story resolves. “We’re asking important questions about does our democracy work?” Dowd notes. “How do we decide what’s the right thing to do?” Those questions have a newfound urgency in a polarized America, where a yawning gulf exists between left and right, and even the idea of a subscribing to a shared set of facts is being challenged. In an age of QAnon and social media fueled conspiracy theories, the very notion of a “known world” is under attack. “What is with our need to turn people into enemies,” asks Dowd. “That’s happening so much today. Without getting too much into politics, what happened to the Republican party? Isn’t their integrity worth more than being reelected. You’re going to sacrifice that for Trump? And when you hear someone like [far-right congresswoman] Marjorie Taylor Greene talk, you think, I’m sorry hon, but you’ve left the planet.” For Dowd, “Enemy of the People” is the latest project in a whirlwind series of exciting film, television and theater turns. The actor’s career has been in overdrive since she earned critical raves for the 2012 indie “Compliance.” Since then she’s appeared in “Hereditary” and “The Leftovers” and, to Emmy-winning effect, on “The Handmaid’s Tale.” She’s also earning Oscar buzz for her work in “Mass,” a drama about a meeting between the parents of the victim and the perpetrator of a mass shooting, which premiered to glowing reviews in Sundance and is scheduled for release this fall. “It was one of the most extraordinary experiences I’ve ever had,” says Dowd. “That character showed up and she was loving and kind and broken.”  It must be hard to channel the all-encompassing grief required for “Mass” or the moral outrage needed for “Enemy of the People,” but Dowd says she learned an important lesson long ago. “People always ask me about ‘Handmaid’s,’ how do you play someone so evil?” says Dowd. “It’s make-believe, babe.

It was the deadliest domestic terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11. It was also the most violent attack on the LGBTQ community the country had ever seen. “I think what really struck me was the lack of response from most of the bishops in the United States,” says Father James Martin in Building a Bridge, a new Martin Scorsese-produced documentary that debuted at the Tribeca Film Festival this week (and can be viewed at home through June 23rd). “In other gun tragedies, the U.S. bishops and local bishops will say we stand with the victims of wherever it is. I couldn’t believe that there was only a handful of bishops that said anything. It was at that time the largest mass shooting in U.S. history. And they were silent.” Related Stories

						100 Best Sitcoms of All Time That silence became a turning point in Father Martin’s ministry: “It just really angered me that even in death, these people were largely invisible to the church.” Building a Bridge powerfully documents his effort to change that, to spread a message of inclusivity in a faith tradition that has long viewed homosexuality as an “abomination.” Rolling Stone recently talked with the documentary’s directors, Evan Mascagni and Shannon Post, about the impact of that message — and about the future of a faith that seems, however haltingly, to be on the precipice of change.   What was your entry into this topic?Evan Mascagni: I was raised in a really Catholic community in Kentucky, and stopped practicing Catholicism regularly once I got into college. But my mom started telling me, “Oh, there are progressive voices in the church. There’s this cool priest I follow on Instagram, and he’s in New York and you’re in New York.” She’d been bugging me to go to one of his talks, and I was just kind of blowing it off. And then I was like, “You know, I will go meet this priest.” And I was just blown away at the energy at his talks, at the people in the pews. It just was so unlike anything I had experienced as a Catholic growing up, especially in Kentucky. Immediately I was thinking, “Oh, wow, there’s a story here.” Shannon Post: Christine [Leinonen] in the film is the mother of one of my friends from college [who was killed in the Pulse massacre]. We used to go to Pulse together in college. And so when Evan told me about Father Martin and how he was inspired by the Pulse massacre, I saw it as a way to connect. And then just personally, I am queer. I was not raised Catholic, but I was raised Christian, and I always felt like the church wasn’t the place for me. I just connected personally to his message. When you interviewed him, were you open to him about your disbelief?Mascagni: Yeah. I think my issue fundamentally with the Catholic Church is like Father Martin says: Jesus’ message is one of love and inclusion. Right? And I feel like the Catholic Church that I grew up in, that wasn’t the message I was hearing. So it was refreshing to finally hear someone who I felt like was actually preaching the gospel, preaching the word of Jesus as it should be preached and not using it to contribute to divisiveness or spew hatred or bigotry. That was actually quite refreshing for me — and a glimpse at the Catholic Church that I hope it could be. It was healing. It was just quite nice to finally feel somewhat reassured that there were other people out there that interpreted the word of Jesus in the same way.  Martin Scorsese [an executive producer on the film] actually had this quote when someone asked him if he was still Catholic, and he was like, “Still Catholic? Like, what do you mean?” You know, it’s a part of you. It’s ingrained in you. It’s the way you were brought up. It’s the culture — everything about it. You know, I haven’t been excommunicated from the church. I’m a baptized Catholic. I don’t attend mass regularly or participate in any of the sacraments or anything like that, but it’s an identity. It’s hard to totally escape that Catholic identity when it’s all you knew growing up. Since you mentioned Scorsese, can you talk a little bit about how he got involved as a producer?Mascagni: They heard we were doing a documentary on Father Martin and were curious to learn more, and we sent them a rough cut. And then someone on his team emailed and they were like, “Hey, Evan, we’ve got Marty on the line. Are you free?” And I’m, like, freaking out. But yeah, we talked, and he was really interested in the subject — I think for some of the same reasons that we were — and gave us some really insightful feedback and creative ideas that we implemented. It’s an honor to have him endorse the film and the subject and the topic. Well, Father Martin’s reaction to the Pulse shooting was just so powerful —t his kind of disbelief that the church wasn’t speaking out more and the fact that that galvanized him. Shannon, do you mind talking a little bit about how you first heard about what had happened at Pulse?Post: I’m from Florida. I went to college in Orlando, and I was getting texts from friends that night. Christine’s son and I, we share a best friend — or we shared a best friend — and she called me in the morning and said he wasn’t answering his phone and they couldn’t find him. I think I was in shock for a while. It took so long to find out what happened that we kind of knew what happened before we really knew. What’s your understanding of the history of inclusivity, or lack thereof, in the Catholic Church?Mascagni: I think there were a lot of people long before Father Martin working on this issue. New Ways Ministry and Sister Janine is a great example of an individual who’s been doing this work for a very long time. But I think what drew us to Father Martin was that he had the attention of the hierarchy because he was very careful to not challenge any church teaching. You know, in his book, it’s a pretty mild message, right? Treat LGBTQ people with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. I was kind of blown away that he got so much pushback and that groups like Church Militant [an alt-right Catholic organization] were able to get his talks canceled and were just able to put so much pressure on these local parishes. And that made us realize like, “Oh, wow, the Catholic Church still has a very long way to go.” That’s something we tried to show in the film as well.  I do want to talk to you about Michael Voris [the leader of Church Militant]. Was it hard to get him to participate in the film?Post: I actually reached out to them initially. They were very open. I think his attitude is there’s no such thing as bad publicity. Mascagni: Yeah, he was really open and honest, as you can see in the film. And, you know, it was a balancing act, right? Like, as a filmmaker, you don’t want to give someone a platform to spew hatred and bigotry. But on the other hand, we saw a real impact he was having on Father Martin’s ministry. They were getting talks canceled. They were spamming his social media. And the more we were following, the more we realized this wasn’t just some fringe group, so we felt it was important to at least show what Father Martin was up against in his ministry. Why don’t more people in these faith traditions see that Jesus would want people to be included? It shouldn’t be that revolutionary to just include people.Mascagni: I just feel that Father Martin’s message has been resonating and getting so much attention and publicity because this is something that has been building up in Catholics. This is an issue that has not been addressed by the hierarchy for way too long. And I think people are sick of it. People are leaving the Catholic Church. You can look at Father Martin’s comments when this recent news came out that the Catholic Church can’t bless same-sex unions. You know, that’s a last straw for people. People have had enough: “Why would I stay in this place that’s not going to accept me, not going to love me?” So I think he’s really just struck a nerve. I do want to talk about the pope’s announcement about same-sex unions, which came at the end of the film.Mascagni: It’s heartbreaking, really. I mean, prior to that coming out, this film ended on a very positive note. Father Martin was meeting with Pope Francis, the Vatican released an image of Father Martin and Pope Francis meeting together. Things were looking good. And then this bomb just gets dropped on us. It’s just, you know, two steps forward, one step back. I think it just raised the stakes even more to show why this message is so important to get out there.  Did working on this documentary change your relationship to like your own faith?Mascagni: I’m not as cynical as I used to be. I used to just think everything about the Catholic Church needed reform and needed to be changed — and I’m particularly interested in how you change an institution from within. You know, there’s over a billion Catholics. It’s one of the most powerful institutions in the world. And watching Father Martin’s work and watching the real impact it was having on real people was super inspiring and made me a lot less cynical. Post: Yeah, I’m kind of the same. I don’t go to church. I’m not a believer yet, but I think it was really healing for me to see that there are LGBT people, queer people, who have a home in a church and who identify as Catholic — seeing that that’s a possibility. So I’m a lot more open to it now. In This Article:

Gov. Greg Abbott (R) signed a permitless carry bill into law on Wednesday, essentially eliminating some of the last remaining safeguards for possessing a lethal weapon in public for those aged 21 and up. The state already allows these citizens to carry rifles openly without a license. In addition to removing handgun permits, House Bill 1927, which goes into effect on Sept. 1, expunges past convictions of individuals who have a misdemeanor or felony conviction for unlawfully carrying a firearm. These individuals will also legally be allowed to own a firearm again. People will still be prohibited from possessing a gun if convicted of a violent crime; however, background checks that would enforce this policy will not be imposed. The state already does not require background checks for private gun sales. Supporters of the right to carry a gun without a permit refer to it as “Constitutional carry,” arguing that American’s right to bear arms under the Second Amendment does not include restrictions. Abbott has referenced this in his support for the right, previously calling the bill “the strongest Second Amendment legislation in Texas history.” At least 20 other states have similar laws. Texas will be the most populous state among them. Prior to this bill, Texans wanting to carry a handgun have had to go through firearms training, submit fingerprints for a criminal background check, and complete a written exam and a shooting proficiency exam. Gun-control groups that advocated against the bill pointed to the state’s recent history of mass shootings. These include a 2019 shooting at an El Paso Walmart that killed 22 people and wounded more than two dozen others; a 2019 shooting during a police chase in Odessa that left eight people dead and 22 others wounded; and a 2018 shooting at a Houston-area high school that killed 10 people and wounded 10 others. Most recently, over the weekend a shooting in downtown Austin left 14 people wounded. Texas has had at least 22 mass shootings so far this year, leaving 23 people dead and more than 90 others wounded, according to records kept by nonprofit research group the Gun Violence Archive. Rep. Veronica Escobar (D) was among those criticizing efforts to expand gun rights across the state even as gun violence continues to rise. “After the attack on El Paso, Gov. Abbott promised that he would take action against gun violence,” she said Wednesday on Twitter. “Almost two years later, he has chosen to betray the victims of gun violence and legislators who believed him, proving he is neither a man of his word nor a leader with courage.” Abbott, after that shooting, suggested legislative policies that were largely aimed at preventing criminals from obtaining guns. Authorities have said that the gunman in the El Paso shooting legally obtained the AK-47 used. One poll conducted in April found that most Texans don’t think adults should be allowed to carry handguns in public without permits or licenses. Almost half of Texas voters also said they would prefer to have stricter gun laws, while 30% said they would leave them alone and 20% would loosen them.

These include a 2019 shooting at an El Paso Walmart that killed 22 people and wounded more than two dozen others; a 2019 shooting during a police chase in Odessa that left eight people dead and 22 others wounded; and a 2018 shooting at a Houston-area high school that killed 10 people and wounded 10 others. Most recently, over the weekend a shooting in downtown Austin left 14 people wounded. Texas has had at least 22 mass shootings so far this year, leaving 23 people dead and more than 90 others wounded, according to records kept by nonprofit research group the Gun Violence Archive. Rep. Veronica Escobar (D) was among those criticizing efforts to expand gun rights across the state even as gun violence continues to rise. “After the attack on El Paso, Gov. Abbott promised that he would take action against gun violence,” she said Wednesday on Twitter. “Almost two years later, he has chosen to betray the victims of gun violence and legislators who believed him, proving he is neither a man of his word nor a leader with courage.” Abbott, after that shooting, suggested legislative policies that were largely aimed at preventing criminals from obtaining guns.

No arrests have been made in         the Tuesday morning shooting, police said Thursday. The killings were among         recent massing shootings in Chicago and elsewhere in the country that have prompted         fears about a spike in U.S. gun violence heading into the summer. Police received a call about shots fired from people on the second floor of the house at about 5:45 a.m., and when they arrived they found four people dead in various rooms, according to a report based on preliminary information. All had been shot in the head, as had three of the victims who survived, and the other surviving victim was shot in the back. According to the report, several .45-caliber and 9 mm shells were found throughout the house. The Cook County Medical Examiner’s office on Thursday released the names of two of the dead: Denise Mathis, 32, of suburban Burnham, and Blake Lee, 36, of Chicago. The office earlier identified the other two killed as Shermetria Williams, 19, and Ratanya Aryiel Rogers, 28. Police spokesman Steve Rusanov told the         Chicago Sun-Times that the suspects had broken into the home. Earlier in the week, police Superintendent David Brown said that there were no signs of forced entry and that police believed the shooting stemmed from an argument. A police spokesman did not immediately respond to a call from The Associated Press about whether detectives still believe the shooting occurred after an argument. A database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University that tracks mass killings — defined as four or more dead, not including the perpetrator — showed that Tuesday’s shooting in Chicago was the 18th mass killing, of which 17 were shootings, this year in the U.S. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Join us on @TwitterSpaces Sept. 7 at 7:05 pm ET. Submit your questions here: https://t.co/jdAyKB5g7m pic.twitter.com/hB32ZmPkk7 — PBS NewsHour (@NewsHour) September 7, 2021 —– Every day for more than four years, Kiah Morris lived in fear. She developed a safety routine for her family with the help of an international security expert, installed security cameras outside their home and received firearms training. When Morris took office as a Democratic state representative in Vermont in 2015, she was the first Black woman elected to the state’s legislature in 26 years. Her district was located in a county with an estimated population of 36,589 that was about 96 percent white, according to 2015 Census Bureau data. Morris said she entered public office as an advocate for marginalized communities, speaking candidly about racial justice and economic inequality. But the same advocacy that helped her get elected also put a target on her back. Between 2016 and 2018, Morris, her husband and their neighbors reported at least 26 incidents to local police in which she and her family felt threatened, including suspicious vehicles parked outside Morris’ home, a break-in and theft from Morris’ car, and threatening online messages, according to a report issued by the Vermont attorney general’s office. In 2016, police officers discovered neckties scattered in a cemetery near Morris’ home; her husband later reported that a number of his neckties were missing from their basement, the attorney general’s report said. That same year, Morris obtained a protective order against a self-proclaimed white supremacist who made it a priority, in his words, to “troll the hell out of” Morris online and at in-person events. Ultimately, it all became too much. Morris announced her immediate resignation in a 2018 Facebook post, about three months before the end of her second term. “It is mentally exhausting to live in constant fear, feeling like you’re in a state of constant fight or flight and not knowing who to trust,” Morris told the PBS NewsHour. Morris’ experience is one shared by many Black women in politics. Black women have long faced challenges running for office for a variety of reasons, from a lack of access to fundraising or capital to a lack of internal support from their political parties, said Stefanie Brown James, co-founder of The Collective PAC, which advocates for Black Democratic candidates.  Across the country, groups like The Collective have tried to help Black women overcome those barriers, and the political sphere has slowly been diversifying. The current session of Congress began with a historic high of 26 Black women out of 535 voting members. A record nine Black women currently serve as mayors of the country’s largest 100 cities. This year, Kamala Harris became the country’s first woman, first Black and first Asian vice president. Yet as many people celebrate this growing representation, women and people of color continue to bear the brunt of harassment and threats at all levels of government. The abuse is compounded for Black women, who experience both systemic racism and sexism. An Amnesty International study examining abusive tweets targeted at women journalists and politicians in the U.S. and U.K. in 2017 found that Black women were 84 percent “more likely than white women to be mentioned in abusive or problematic tweets.” READ MORE: How Americans are reacting to George Floyd’s death one year later That reality may jeopardize further representation in politics by causing some Black women to step away from public office while making others hesitant to run in the first place. In Vermont, Morris and James said they know several other Black women who have left political and civic leadership roles due to harassment or threats. The PBS NewsHour requested interviews with more than 61 Black women who have held office or have run for office at various levels of government and across the political spectrum. Eighteen of the women, 16 of them Democrats, spoke with the NewsHour about their experiences. Twelve of the women currently hold office, four are former candidates and two are former office holders. Their positions range from representatives in the U.S. Congress to city council members across 14 different states. All but one recounted racist and sexist abuse, ranging from public attacks of their physical appearances to death threats. They described how policy disagreements and valid critiques of their work often turn into threatening or violent behavior. While criticism of their male colleagues tends to focus on name-calling, women in public-facing roles are more likely to face physical threats, said Mary Anne Franks, a professor at the University of Miami’s School of Law, who researches the intersection of civil rights and technology. For women of color, those threats are often sexualized or rooted in racial stereotypes, she added. Though the issue has been well-documented, lawmakers at the state and federal levels have struggled to strengthen protections against stalking and harassment, an effort made more difficult by online technology. First Amendment protections can complicate efforts to stop online harassment, and generally public figures are given fewer protections than private citizens, Franks said. Some of the women interviewed by the NewsHour have reported abuse to their local law enforcement or to personal and capitol security. But some expressed concern that police and other leaders in power do not take their concerns seriously. One woman said this belief stops her from reporting threats to police. Nearly all of the women have adopted a tolerance of the abuse — including death threats — as either “part of the job” or a reality they must endure in order to represent their communities. But many also said they’ve had enough and are advocating for more protections and better systems to report and mitigate such attacks. “Yes, I signed up for people not to agree with me. … But that doesn’t mean that you get to harass me. That doesn’t mean that you get to leave messages or attack me or attack my wife,” said Michele Rayner-Goolsby, a Florida legislator who is the first openly queer Black woman to hold public office in Florida. “I didn’t sign up for that, and no one signs up for that.” A normalization of violence



Rhonda Fields’ decision to run for office stemmed from a tragedy. Her 22-year-old son Javad Marshall Fields was shot and killed in Colorado in 2005, days before he was set to testify in a murder trial. Fields said she never wanted to see another family endure such heartbreak.


She took office as a Democratic state representative in 2011, and five years later won a state senate seat, becoming the first African American woman elected to her district in Aurora, Colorado.


A year and a half into her first term as a representative, a man walked into a movie theater in Aurora with multiple firearms and opened fire on the crowd, killing 12 people and injuring 70 others.

The mass shooting prompted Fields to co-sponsor gun control legislation requiring background checks for private and online gun sales and banning high-capacity magazines. Both bills were signed into law by the governor in 2013. The legislation was met with fierce opposition and Fields and her family became targets of violent threats.



“I just thought this came with the job, but when they used my daughter’s name, when they said, ‘We’re going to come after you and your daughter and your family, and there will be lots of blood,’ that’s when it became real,” Fields told the NewsHour. “I had already lost a son to gun violence, but now you’re talking about going after my daughter, my only surviving child.”

One email attacked Fields and a fellow state representative by repeatedly calling Fields sexist and racist slurs, and said, “Hopefully somebody Gifords [sic] both of your a***s with a gun,” referring to the 2011 shooting of former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz. The author of the messages was arrested and charged with harassment and attempting to influence a public servant. The charges were later dropped when Fields requested that the case be dismissed because he agreed to a permanent restraining order mandating that he stay at least 100 yards away from her at all times.


Fields’ early years in office aligned with a growing demand for more diversity in politics and legislation to address systemic inequities. As more Black women came into positions of power, threats often accompanied their decision to speak more openly about race and social justice.


“Any time that Black women call attention to racial injustice, they’re going to be punished for it because society does not want to deal with that racist, sexist oppression,” said Moya Bailey, assistant professor of Africana studies and women’s, gender and sexuality studies at Northeastern University. Bailey coined the term “misogynoir” as a way to identify anti-Black misogyny.


Mona Lena Krook, a political science professor with Rutgers University, found in her research for a book that women in politics reported spikes in abuse when they spoke out on controversial issues like racial injustice.


Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby experienced this first-hand.


Mosby entered office in 2015 as one of several prosecutors around the country considered to be more progressive for their promises to reform the system. She immediately had to deal with people doubting her abilities, despite graduating from a top law school and previously working in the office of the state’s attorney.


Three months into her first term, 25-year-old Freddie Gray died after his spinal cord was severed during an arrest by Baltimore police officers. The medical examiner ruled the death a homicide. Gray’s death came less than a year after Eric Garner and Michael Brown were killed by police, propelling the Movement for Black Lives.


Soon after Mosby filed charges against the six police officers involved in Gray’s death, she began receiving death threats. Six years later, they haven’t stopped, even after three of the officers were acquitted and the charges against the remaining officers were dropped.





“I have a book full of death threats and hate mail,” Mosby said. “It can be overwhelming at times. And it’s something that has been consistent throughout my tenure.” 


Mosby has received emails describing her being “gunned down” and her husband being “burned and dismembered,” letters telling her that the position of state’s attorney is only respectable when held by a white person and telling her to jump off a bridge — the examples of violent ideation and hate seem endless, she said. In early 2020, after attending a rally to support St. Louis circuit attorney Kim Gardner, who was facing backlash for suing city leadership for racial discrimination, Mosby received a voicemail saying “if we’d known you all were going to be this much trouble we would have picked our own f***ing cotton.”


“I was professionally attacked. I was personally attacked. I have a book full of death threats and hate mail,” Mosby said. “It can be overwhelming at times. And it’s something that has been consistent throughout my tenure.”

Kim Foxx, who defeated an incumbent state’s attorney in 2016 to become the first Black woman to be the top prosecutor in Cook County, Illinois, was also part of the wave of “progressive prosecutors.” She sought to make the office more transparent, promote bail reform, vacate wrongful convictions and rethink the volume of criminal charges. When the state legislature voted to legalize recreational marijuana in 2019, Foxx began expunging past marijuana convictions.


But Foxx has seen her fair share of backlash, notably for her office’s decision in April 2019 to drop charges against Jussie Smollett, an actor accused of staging an attack against himself in Chicago, which he reported to police as a racist and homophobic hate crime. A 2020 report by a special prosecutor did not find evidence to warrant criminal charges against Foxx or her office for how they handled the case, but said there were “substantial abuses of discretion and operational failures” in the decision to drop charges against Smollett. Members of the Chicago Police Department wanted to see Smollett held accountable for wasting law enforcement resources.


Chicago’s Fraternal Order of Police union organized a protest outside of Foxx’s office, during which Foxx said male demonstrators engaged in “offensive, sexist behavior,” including “rubbing [her] face — [her] picture — on their genitalia.” The union’s president, John Catanzara, told the NewsHour that the protest was peaceful, with no injuries or damages. Unrelated to the protest, Catanzara is currently under investigation by the Chicago Police Board and has been stripped of pay for allegedly posting obscene and racist social media messages and allegedly filing a false police report.


Amid the tension, hateful calls and emails to Foxx’s office became overwhelming for her receptionist and assistant, she said. A now-defunct site called Second City Cop Blog, run by an anonymous author, posted racist and sexist insults and nicknames about her almost daily, alongside what the author claimed were critiques of her role as state’s attorney. In addition, the blogger posted Foxx’s home address and invited people to pay her a visit, she added. The author appeared to have close ties to the Chicago Police, but a spokesperson for the department would not comment on whether a current or former officer ran the blog.


Foxx, who has two daughters, said it was difficult to protect her children from the offensive language online. But she said she was advised not to speak out to avoid “giving [the harassment] oxygen.” Keeping the reality of her situation silent felt like “a prison,” she said. 


For Kentucky state Rep. Attica Scott, harassment accelerated following her arrest on Sept. 24, 2020, at a demonstration calling for justice for Breonna Taylor, who was killed by Louisville police during a raid in March 2020  . Scott was charged with felony rioting and misdemeanor failure to disperse. The charges against her were ultimately dropped. Scott, her daughter and a local activist filed a lawsuit against the officers who arrested them that night for violating their constitutional rights. The Louisville Metro Police Department declined to comment on the lawsuit.


“It doesn’t make sense to me. I feel like the police set me up as a target when they arrested me,” said Scott, who in 2016 became the first Black woman in 20 years to be elected to the Kentucky legislature. “To a certain extent, I feel helpless.”


Scott recalled being sent an email in which the author said they would have shot her if they had been one of the officers who arrested her in September. She has also received threats to burn down her home and a voicemail from someone warning that their neighbor wants to shoot and kill her. Threats are so common, it almost feels normal now, she said.


A typical day for Scott usually begins with some kind of abusive, racist or sexist message, she said. She’ll feel deflated for a moment, but then moves on to her legislative duties. She doesn’t have time to process, she said, and representing her community feels like her calling.


“I do think I really have convinced myself that this is the way it is,” she said.


Research indicates these types of experiences can have a significant effect on women’s physical and mental health, including their ability to hold down a regular job, said Sarah Sobieraj, a sociology professor with Tufts University.


Nearly three years after Morris’ resignation from the Vermont legislature, the events leading up to that decision still haunt her. She and her husband sold his childhood home in Bennington where they lived to relocate to a different city. But anxiety remains for each member of their family. Morris said her 10-year-old son created a panic room in one of the closets of their new home in case they need to hide for safety.


“I’m still not OK,” Morris said. “It was a shame, but what [staying in office] was going to cost me and my family … You can’t ask that of anyone. How dare we as a society ask that of anyone?”

U.S. Capitol breach highlights heightened level of danger



U.S. Rep. Nikema Williams, D-Ga., has never felt safe in elected office. Her tenure as a Georgia state senator began with her being arrested by the state capitol’s police while protesting with her constituents in 2018. Her charges were later dropped.


She thought she would be safer in the U.S. Congress, she told the PBS NewsHour in April. But in her first week in Congress a violent mob stormed the U.S. Capitol in an effort to support former President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. The Jan. 6 attack resulted in multiple deaths.


On Jan. 24, U.S. Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., tweeted that a white man who had previously tagged her in violent social media posts participated in the insurrection. That same man has been charged with assaulting a U.S. Capitol Police officer, among other crimes related to his involvement in the Jan. 6 breach.


The Capitol riot reflected a growing threat that sparked fierce conversations about lawmakers’ vulnerability and U.S. Capitol security protocols, which trickled down to other levels of government as the FBI warned of plans for armed extremists to protest at state capitals following the D.C. attack.


Acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman testified before a Senate committee in April that threats against members of Congress increased nearly 65 percent between January and April of this year, compared to the same period in 2020. From 2017 to 2020, threats increased 119 percent, she added.


The U.S. Capitol Police did not respond to the NewsHour’s request for more specific information about the race and gender of Congress members targeted by those threats. Williams said many are aimed at members of color like herself.


In search of solutions to better protect lawmakers and their staff, the House passed a $1.9 billion emergency funding bill last month to bolster security at the Capitol, which would include enhanced security for members of Congress. The bill is currently being considered in the Senate.


Reps. Bush, Ilhan Omar and Ayanna Pressley, all Black women, voted against the bill, stating in a press release that “a bill that pours $1.9 billion into increased police surveillance and force without addressing the underlying threats of organized and violent white supremacy, radicalization, and disinformation that led to this attack will not prevent it from happening again.”


A bipartisan report issued jointly by the Senate Rules and Homeland Security Committees in June cited a number of security failures leading to the Capitol breach. Among them, the report said, U.S. Capitol Police had information about possible violence on Jan. 6, but did not share the full scope of that intelligence with rank-and-file officers or other law enforcement partners.


The committees’ recommendations included better training and equipment for Capitol Police officers.


With safety concerns still unresolved, Black women in Congress said they continue to feel at risk. Williams said she pays for 24-hour security for her and her family using campaign funds, which the FEC allowed following the Jan. 6 attack. Two weeks of security costs her $18,000. “I have to take these things seriously because it is my life. It’s my family’s life. It’s our safety,” she said. Williams no longer reads the messages she receives and her staff manages her inboxes. A spokesperson for Williams said in June they have not received any official guidance on how to address harassment and threats.


U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood, D-Ill., told the NewsHour she does not have security with her all the time, but she has taken advantage of available security resources, including working with the Sergeant at Arms to improve her office’s cybersecurity and to conduct security assessments of her residence.


Still, she believes an attack against her is “a matter of time, unless there’s increased processes put in place to streamline the reporting and investigations … and leadership from the top that says this is not OK,” she said in March.


In addition to concerns about outside threats, the country has also witnessed escalating conflict between lawmakers themselves on Capitol Hill. Multiple news reports have detailed instances of shouting in the Capitol halls and debate over whether lawmakers should be able to carry firearms, which they are currently legally permitted to do on Capitol grounds.


When metal detectors were installed just outside the House floor in January, a number of lawmakers spoke out against the new security system and others were fined for bypassing them.


This tense dynamic on Capitol Hill is also cause for concern, Underwood said. “We have to have accountability in all of our workplaces, including the United States Congress,” she said. “You can’t threaten a colleague, you can’t bring a weapon to work because you don’t like your colleague, and you can’t threaten to use your weapon at work against your colleague and expect to keep your job.” When asked if there was a specific incident that concerned her, Underwood’s team said she was speaking generally.


A spokesperson for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said, “The speaker takes the safety and security of members and all who work in the Capitol extremely seriously, and has taken measures such as the [metal detectors] around the House floor to ensure safety.”


In addition to Pelosi’s office, the NewsHour contacted the office of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., the office of Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., and the press office for the Committee on House Administration to ask about the tension between lawmakers and the existing protocols for when lawmakers receive credible threats. The offices did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

‘I am not willing to die to do this work’


When Black women in politics experience abusive behavior or harassment it can be difficult to determine where they can turn for help or what legal and institutional resources are available to them.


For Scott in Kentucky, security would help her feel safer, but she doesn’t have a way to pay for it, she said. Kentucky state law does not address security in its campaign finance laws, and she said she doubts that paying for security with campaign money would be permitted.


Scott feels safe in her Louisville community, but when working at the state capitol she feels vulnerable. She thinks about ways she could escape if an active shooter came in wanting to kill Black legislators.


She doesn’t report harassment to law enforcement, even if they are credible threats. She feels the police see her as an enemy because she advocates for police accountability. She doesn’t believe they will protect her.

“I just have those threats,” Scott said. “There’s no reporting system, at least to my knowledge, for those of us who are legislators who receive threats of any kind. We don’t have a system in place for that.” The Kentucky state legislature did not respond to NewsHour’s questions about their reporting system for threats to lawmakers.


Some women in office do turn to law enforcement to address their security concerns. Coral Evans, the former mayor of Flagstaff, Arizona, experienced physical intimidation during her campaign and two terms from 2016 to 2020. She told the NewsHour of four different trespassing incidents, including one in which a stranger confronted Evans’ daughter in the front yard of their home and made what Evans perceived to be a threat.


Evans said she reported these incidents to police. They were “super supportive,” she said, but their ability to intervene in many cases was limited by the fact that she was a public figure.


“As a public official, you have people that send you emails constantly, they are calling you constantly, they walk up to you in grocery stores. And they’re allowed to do that because you’re a public official,” Evans said. “It’s harder to prove harassment and intimidation and stuff like that if you’re a public official.”


Evans said she’s noticed a change in the treatment of public officials in the last four years. To her, the “shift” resulted in people feeling like they could “say whatever they want” to her — including one constituent telling her, “You’re elected to serve me, I own you.”


Evans, who has long been acquainted with the chief of police, said that during a conversation he recommended that she put up ‘no trespassing’ signs outside her home, advice she followed, but she continued to deal with intruders. “I’m standing here in my yard with my ‘no trespassing’ signs, talking to a guy that’s trespassing,” Evans said of one incident.


Morris in Vermont also filed multiple reports with the police department in Bennington. In several cases the police  determined there was no sufficient evidence to pursue criminal action. A number of the complaints were then investigated by the Vermont attorney general’s office but also did not result in any criminal charges against the man at the center of her harassment allegations. Morris said part of her decision to resign from office was because her lawyer said he could better protect her if she were a private citizen rather than a politician. After she left office, Morris filed a complaint with Vermont’s Human Rights Commission in 2019 alleging discrimination by the Bennington Police Department and the Town of Bennington.

In a report, an investigator with the commission concluded in March 2021 that the Bennington police chief failed to disclose relevant information about Morris’ harasser to her, including his possession of high-capacity firearms and details of an interview with his ex-wife during which she expressed concern for Morris’ safety. The investigator recommended the commission find reasonable grounds that the Town of Bennington discriminated against Morris “on the basis of race and color.” The Town of Bennington publicly apologized to Morris in April and agreed to pay $137,000 to Morris and her family.

This outcome and level of acknowledgement is unusual in cases involving harassment, particularly when it comes to someone in the public eye, Franks of the University of Miami said. Targets of abuse either in person or online face a patchwork of complicated stalking and harassment laws that may offer limited protections.


In-person harassment usually falls under state jurisdiction unless it takes place on federal property or involves interstate contact. But there’s often a high bar to restrict a potential perpetrator’s ability to be in the same place as a potential target.


“It’s so hard to tell the difference between a person who’s just doing things that are not only legal, but also protected,” Franks said. “You’re allowed to go to public places. You’re allowed to show up at the grocery store. You’re allowed to drive to someone’s house. … How do we determine when that becomes illegal?”


First Amendment protections also blur the lines of what constitutes illegal speech, particularly speech directed at public figures.


“The reasoning behind this is twofold: that public officials have made a voluntary choice to serve the public interest and to be in the public eye, and that public officials have more means at their disposal to respond to false or distressing statements,” Franks said.


A series of Supreme Court cases have established this precedent for public figures, including in the New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, a 1964 landmark case in which the high court ruled that First Amendment protections gave public officials limited means to sue for defamation.


For online language, the limitations are less clearly defined because many of the notable cases defining the boundaries of free speech were decided before existing internet culture. Therefore, direct, in-person threats are typically treated much more seriously than online abuse.


“It is incredibly easy to harass a woman online or be abusive online without facing any consequences,” Sobieraj of Tufts University said. “Our laws are based and designed around having a crime and a perpetrator … And in this case, a lot of the time, we have neither. We don’t have anything that’s technically a crime. Identifying a perpetrator is incredibly difficult because of IP-obscuring technologies that exist and the fact that anybody could do it from a public library or a hotel business center.”

Online harassment or stalking is more likely to fall under federal authority because it crosses state lines, Franks said, adding that two crucial components for successful legal action are that the perpetrator has established a pattern of harmful behavior and has shown an intent to cause harm. Both of these can be incredibly difficult to prove, especially given the vague context of online posts and the fact that online abuse may involve multiple actors who have not engaged in multiple offenses individually.


Despite these challenges, sometimes the law does align in public officials’ favor. Stacey Plaskett, a Black congresswoman representing the U.S. Virgin Islands, became a target in 2016 when two of her former staffers used email and social media to distribute nude images of Plaskett and her husband taken from Plaskett’s cell phone. The two former staffers pleaded guilty to charges that included conspiracy and cyberstalking. The legal elements that worked in favor of the prosecution were that there was a clear breach of Plaskett’s privacy and a clear intent to cause her harm, Franks said.

“Revenge porn” and sexualized threats are commonly used against women in public positions. In many cases, explicit images may be acquired without the victim’s consent; in other situations the images can be falsified, such as editing a victim’s face onto the photo of another person’s body. To begin the process of filling the legal gaps of online abuse, some lawmakers are pushing to further define the parameters of this behavior, giving victims of harassment and abuse more legal recourse.


As a Colorado state representative in 2014, Fields sponsored a bill to more clearly define cyberbullying of minors and make it a misdemeanor offense. That bill passed in the state House but faced accusations of First Amendment violations and stalled in the state Senate. In 2018, after Fields became a state senator, she worked with other lawmakers to sponsor a bill signed by the governor that redefined the existing revenge porn law by removing requirements like the need to prove a target endured emotional distress.

Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby has been receiving death threats since 2015. She said the abuse can be overwhelming, but that using her position for justice keeps her going. Photo taken remotely through a projector by Chloe Jones/PBS NewsHour.

At the federal level, a bill known as the SHIELD Act would address things like “revenge porn” and “sextortion” by making it a federal crime to post nonconsensual sexually explicit images online. The bill was introduced in the House in 2019 but never reached a vote. It has since been added as an amendment to the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2021 that was passed in the House in March, but has not yet received a vote from the Senate. The bill aims to provide resources and protections for targets of domestic violence, sexual assault stalking and technological abuse. Notably, the latest version would prohibit anyone convicted of misdemeanor stalking or domestic abuse from being able to purchase a firearm.


Franks and Sobieraj said that online platforms such as Twitter and Facebook also have a responsibility to regulate their users’ language and posts — something lawmakers have debated for years. Twitter, for example, could moderate mentions and replies directed at public figures by making the tweets subject to review before they can be publicly available, Sobieraj said. Franks also advocates for reforming the existing laws that protect online platforms from liability for illegal content posted on their sites.


As the subject of harassment and its effects gain increased attention, more women are pushing back on the narrative that they need to accept racism, misogyny or abuse in order to hold a public position. Krook of Rutgers University said there is growing public solidarity among women in politics to raise awareness on the issue. Last year, five Democratic congresswomen, four of them women of color, introduced a resolution in the House to recognize violence against women in politics as a global phenomenon that requires more research. However, it did not reach a vote in the House.



If harassment and abuse is left unchecked, experts fear it could undo some of the recent progress on diverse representation in public office. Multiple academics said harassment of women — especially women of marginalized groups —  can lead to declining political involvement. Some women may leave office, which Krook noted also cuts off a pipeline for younger people from underrepresented backgrounds to enter politics. Others may censor themselves.


“In order to fully understand social problems or design effective policy interventions, you really need to hear from a wide variety of people with different views and perspectives and experiences and life histories in order to get the richest picture possible,” Sobieraj said.


Nadia Brown, an associate professor of political science and African American studies at Purdue University, said legislators from underrepresented backgrounds use their lived experiences to inform their policymaking decisions, which can result in policy that improves circumstances for marginalized communities on the whole.


A challenge for Black women in politics, those interviewed by the NewsHour said, is balancing their determination to remain in office and serve their communities with fighting the abuse and harassment that threaten their personal wellbeing.


Underwood said she loves serving her constituents in Congress, but said there are other ways to work for her community outside of public office. “If this job turns into one where the threats continue to escalate, I will not continue to do it,” she said, “I am not willing to die to do this work.”

Graphic: Megan McGrew  Rhonda Fields’ decision to run for office stemmed from a tragedy. Her 22-year-old son Javad Marshall Fields was shot and killed in Colorado in 2005, days before he was set to testify in a murder trial. Fields said she never wanted to see another family endure such heartbreak. She took office as a Democratic state representative in 2011, and five years later won a state senate seat, becoming the first African American woman elected to her district in Aurora, Colorado. A year and a half into her first term as a representative, a man walked into a movie theater in Aurora with multiple firearms and opened fire on the crowd, killing 12 people and injuring 70 others. READ MORE: Racial bias trainings surged after George Floyd’s death. A year later, experts are still waiting for ‘bold’ change The mass shooting prompted Fields to co-sponsor gun control legislation requiring background checks for private and online gun sales and banning high-capacity magazines. Both bills were signed into law by the governor in 2013. The legislation was met with fierce opposition and Fields and her family became targets of violent threats. “I just thought this came with the job, but when they used my daughter’s name, when they said, ‘We’re going to come after you and your daughter and your family, and there will be lots of blood,’ that’s when it became real,” Fields told the NewsHour. “I had already lost a son to gun violence, but now you’re talking about going after my daughter, my only surviving child.”

The following is an excerpt of a letter sent to Colorado state legislator Rhonda Fields. It contains explicit and racist language.

One email attacked Fields and a fellow state representative by repeatedly calling Fields sexist and racist slurs, and said, “Hopefully somebody Gifords [sic] both of your a***s with a gun,” referring to the 2011 shooting of former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz. The author of the messages was arrested and charged with harassment and attempting to influence a public servant. The charges were later dropped when Fields requested that the case be dismissed because he agreed to a permanent restraining order mandating that he stay at least 100 yards away from her at all times.


Fields’ early years in office aligned with a growing demand for more diversity in politics and legislation to address systemic inequities. As more Black women came into positions of power, threats often accompanied their decision to speak more openly about race and social justice.


“Any time that Black women call attention to racial injustice, they’re going to be punished for it because society does not want to deal with that racist, sexist oppression,” said Moya Bailey, assistant professor of Africana studies and women’s, gender and sexuality studies at Northeastern University. Bailey coined the term “misogynoir” as a way to identify anti-Black misogyny.


Mona Lena Krook, a political science professor with Rutgers University, found in her research for a book that women in politics reported spikes in abuse when they spoke out on controversial issues like racial injustice.


Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby experienced this first-hand.


Mosby entered office in 2015 as one of several prosecutors around the country considered to be more progressive for their promises to reform the system. She immediately had to deal with people doubting her abilities, despite graduating from a top law school and previously working in the office of the state’s attorney.


Three months into her first term, 25-year-old Freddie Gray died after his spinal cord was severed during an arrest by Baltimore police officers. The medical examiner ruled the death a homicide. Gray’s death came less than a year after Eric Garner and Michael Brown were killed by police, propelling the Movement for Black Lives.


Soon after Mosby filed charges against the six police officers involved in Gray’s death, she began receiving death threats. Six years later, they haven’t stopped, even after three of the officers were acquitted and the charges against the remaining officers were dropped.





“I have a book full of death threats and hate mail,” Mosby said. “It can be overwhelming at times. And it’s something that has been consistent throughout my tenure.” 


Mosby has received emails describing her being “gunned down” and her husband being “burned and dismembered,” letters telling her that the position of state’s attorney is only respectable when held by a white person and telling her to jump off a bridge — the examples of violent ideation and hate seem endless, she said. In early 2020, after attending a rally to support St. Louis circuit attorney Kim Gardner, who was facing backlash for suing city leadership for racial discrimination, Mosby received a voicemail saying “if we’d known you all were going to be this much trouble we would have picked our own f***ing cotton.”


“I was professionally attacked. I was personally attacked. I have a book full of death threats and hate mail,” Mosby said. “It can be overwhelming at times. And it’s something that has been consistent throughout my tenure.”

Kim Foxx, who defeated an incumbent state’s attorney in 2016 to become the first Black woman to be the top prosecutor in Cook County, Illinois, was also part of the wave of “progressive prosecutors.” She sought to make the office more transparent, promote bail reform, vacate wrongful convictions and rethink the volume of criminal charges. When the state legislature voted to legalize recreational marijuana in 2019, Foxx began expunging past marijuana convictions.


But Foxx has seen her fair share of backlash, notably for her office’s decision in April 2019 to drop charges against Jussie Smollett, an actor accused of staging an attack against himself in Chicago, which he reported to police as a racist and homophobic hate crime. A 2020 report by a special prosecutor did not find evidence to warrant criminal charges against Foxx or her office for how they handled the case, but said there were “substantial abuses of discretion and operational failures” in the decision to drop charges against Smollett. Members of the Chicago Police Department wanted to see Smollett held accountable for wasting law enforcement resources.


Chicago’s Fraternal Order of Police union organized a protest outside of Foxx’s office, during which Foxx said male demonstrators engaged in “offensive, sexist behavior,” including “rubbing [her] face — [her] picture — on their genitalia.” The union’s president, John Catanzara, told the NewsHour that the protest was peaceful, with no injuries or damages. Unrelated to the protest, Catanzara is currently under investigation by the Chicago Police Board and has been stripped of pay for allegedly posting obscene and racist social media messages and allegedly filing a false police report.


Amid the tension, hateful calls and emails to Foxx’s office became overwhelming for her receptionist and assistant, she said. A now-defunct site called Second City Cop Blog, run by an anonymous author, posted racist and sexist insults and nicknames about her almost daily, alongside what the author claimed were critiques of her role as state’s attorney. In addition, the blogger posted Foxx’s home address and invited people to pay her a visit, she added. The author appeared to have close ties to the Chicago Police, but a spokesperson for the department would not comment on whether a current or former officer ran the blog.


Foxx, who has two daughters, said it was difficult to protect her children from the offensive language online. But she said she was advised not to speak out to avoid “giving [the harassment] oxygen.” Keeping the reality of her situation silent felt like “a prison,” she said. 


For Kentucky state Rep. Attica Scott, harassment accelerated following her arrest on Sept. 24, 2020, at a demonstration calling for justice for Breonna Taylor, who was killed by Louisville police during a raid in March 2020  . Scott was charged with felony rioting and misdemeanor failure to disperse. The charges against her were ultimately dropped. Scott, her daughter and a local activist filed a lawsuit against the officers who arrested them that night for violating their constitutional rights. The Louisville Metro Police Department declined to comment on the lawsuit.


“It doesn’t make sense to me. I feel like the police set me up as a target when they arrested me,” said Scott, who in 2016 became the first Black woman in 20 years to be elected to the Kentucky legislature. “To a certain extent, I feel helpless.”


Scott recalled being sent an email in which the author said they would have shot her if they had been one of the officers who arrested her in September. She has also received threats to burn down her home and a voicemail from someone warning that their neighbor wants to shoot and kill her. Threats are so common, it almost feels normal now, she said.


A typical day for Scott usually begins with some kind of abusive, racist or sexist message, she said. She’ll feel deflated for a moment, but then moves on to her legislative duties. She doesn’t have time to process, she said, and representing her community feels like her calling.


“I do think I really have convinced myself that this is the way it is,” she said.


Research indicates these types of experiences can have a significant effect on women’s physical and mental health, including their ability to hold down a regular job, said Sarah Sobieraj, a sociology professor with Tufts University.


Nearly three years after Morris’ resignation from the Vermont legislature, the events leading up to that decision still haunt her. She and her husband sold his childhood home in Bennington where they lived to relocate to a different city. But anxiety remains for each member of their family. Morris said her 10-year-old son created a panic room in one of the closets of their new home in case they need to hide for safety.


“I’m still not OK,” Morris said. “It was a shame, but what [staying in office] was going to cost me and my family … You can’t ask that of anyone. How dare we as a society ask that of anyone?”

U.S. Capitol breach highlights heightened level of danger



U.S. Rep. Nikema Williams, D-Ga., has never felt safe in elected office. Her tenure as a Georgia state senator began with her being arrested by the state capitol’s police while protesting with her constituents in 2018. Her charges were later dropped.


She thought she would be safer in the U.S. Congress, she told the PBS NewsHour in April. But in her first week in Congress a violent mob stormed the U.S. Capitol in an effort to support former President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. The Jan. 6 attack resulted in multiple deaths.


On Jan. 24, U.S. Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., tweeted that a white man who had previously tagged her in violent social media posts participated in the insurrection. That same man has been charged with assaulting a U.S. Capitol Police officer, among other crimes related to his involvement in the Jan. 6 breach.


The Capitol riot reflected a growing threat that sparked fierce conversations about lawmakers’ vulnerability and U.S. Capitol security protocols, which trickled down to other levels of government as the FBI warned of plans for armed extremists to protest at state capitals following the D.C. attack.


Acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman testified before a Senate committee in April that threats against members of Congress increased nearly 65 percent between January and April of this year, compared to the same period in 2020. From 2017 to 2020, threats increased 119 percent, she added.


The U.S. Capitol Police did not respond to the NewsHour’s request for more specific information about the race and gender of Congress members targeted by those threats. Williams said many are aimed at members of color like herself.


In search of solutions to better protect lawmakers and their staff, the House passed a $1.9 billion emergency funding bill last month to bolster security at the Capitol, which would include enhanced security for members of Congress. The bill is currently being considered in the Senate.


Reps. Bush, Ilhan Omar and Ayanna Pressley, all Black women, voted against the bill, stating in a press release that “a bill that pours $1.9 billion into increased police surveillance and force without addressing the underlying threats of organized and violent white supremacy, radicalization, and disinformation that led to this attack will not prevent it from happening again.”


A bipartisan report issued jointly by the Senate Rules and Homeland Security Committees in June cited a number of security failures leading to the Capitol breach. Among them, the report said, U.S. Capitol Police had information about possible violence on Jan. 6, but did not share the full scope of that intelligence with rank-and-file officers or other law enforcement partners.


The committees’ recommendations included better training and equipment for Capitol Police officers.


With safety concerns still unresolved, Black women in Congress said they continue to feel at risk. Williams said she pays for 24-hour security for her and her family using campaign funds, which the FEC allowed following the Jan. 6 attack. Two weeks of security costs her $18,000. “I have to take these things seriously because it is my life. It’s my family’s life. It’s our safety,” she said. Williams no longer reads the messages she receives and her staff manages her inboxes. A spokesperson for Williams said in June they have not received any official guidance on how to address harassment and threats.


U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood, D-Ill., told the NewsHour she does not have security with her all the time, but she has taken advantage of available security resources, including working with the Sergeant at Arms to improve her office’s cybersecurity and to conduct security assessments of her residence.


Still, she believes an attack against her is “a matter of time, unless there’s increased processes put in place to streamline the reporting and investigations … and leadership from the top that says this is not OK,” she said in March.


In addition to concerns about outside threats, the country has also witnessed escalating conflict between lawmakers themselves on Capitol Hill. Multiple news reports have detailed instances of shouting in the Capitol halls and debate over whether lawmakers should be able to carry firearms, which they are currently legally permitted to do on Capitol grounds.


When metal detectors were installed just outside the House floor in January, a number of lawmakers spoke out against the new security system and others were fined for bypassing them.


This tense dynamic on Capitol Hill is also cause for concern, Underwood said. “We have to have accountability in all of our workplaces, including the United States Congress,” she said. “You can’t threaten a colleague, you can’t bring a weapon to work because you don’t like your colleague, and you can’t threaten to use your weapon at work against your colleague and expect to keep your job.” When asked if there was a specific incident that concerned her, Underwood’s team said she was speaking generally.


A spokesperson for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said, “The speaker takes the safety and security of members and all who work in the Capitol extremely seriously, and has taken measures such as the [metal detectors] around the House floor to ensure safety.”


In addition to Pelosi’s office, the NewsHour contacted the office of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., the office of Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., and the press office for the Committee on House Administration to ask about the tension between lawmakers and the existing protocols for when lawmakers receive credible threats. The offices did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

‘I am not willing to die to do this work’


When Black women in politics experience abusive behavior or harassment it can be difficult to determine where they can turn for help or what legal and institutional resources are available to them.


For Scott in Kentucky, security would help her feel safer, but she doesn’t have a way to pay for it, she said. Kentucky state law does not address security in its campaign finance laws, and she said she doubts that paying for security with campaign money would be permitted.


Scott feels safe in her Louisville community, but when working at the state capitol she feels vulnerable. She thinks about ways she could escape if an active shooter came in wanting to kill Black legislators.


She doesn’t report harassment to law enforcement, even if they are credible threats. She feels the police see her as an enemy because she advocates for police accountability. She doesn’t believe they will protect her.


https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2021/06/Voicemail_v3.mp4

“I just have those threats,” Scott said. “There’s no reporting system, at least to my knowledge, for those of us who are legislators who receive threats of any kind. We don’t have a system in place for that.” The Kentucky state legislature did not respond to NewsHour’s questions about their reporting system for threats to lawmakers.


Some women in office do turn to law enforcement to address their security concerns. Coral Evans, the former mayor of Flagstaff, Arizona, experienced physical intimidation during her campaign and two terms from 2016 to 2020. She told the NewsHour of four different trespassing incidents, including one in which a stranger confronted Evans’ daughter in the front yard of their home and made what Evans perceived to be a threat.


Evans said she reported these incidents to police. They were “super supportive,” she said, but their ability to intervene in many cases was limited by the fact that she was a public figure.


“As a public official, you have people that send you emails constantly, they are calling you constantly, they walk up to you in grocery stores. And they’re allowed to do that because you’re a public official,” Evans said. “It’s harder to prove harassment and intimidation and stuff like that if you’re a public official.”


Evans said she’s noticed a change in the treatment of public officials in the last four years. To her, the “shift” resulted in people feeling like they could “say whatever they want” to her — including one constituent telling her, “You’re elected to serve me, I own you.”


Evans, who has long been acquainted with the chief of police, said that during a conversation he recommended that she put up ‘no trespassing’ signs outside her home, advice she followed, but she continued to deal with intruders. “I’m standing here in my yard with my ‘no trespassing’ signs, talking to a guy that’s trespassing,” Evans said of one incident.


Morris in Vermont also filed multiple reports with the police department in Bennington. In several cases the police  determined there was no sufficient evidence to pursue criminal action. A number of the complaints were then investigated by the Vermont attorney general’s office but also did not result in any criminal charges against the man at the center of her harassment allegations. Morris said part of her decision to resign from office was because her lawyer said he could better protect her if she were a private citizen rather than a politician. After she left office, Morris filed a complaint with Vermont’s Human Rights Commission in 2019 alleging discrimination by the Bennington Police Department and the Town of Bennington.

In a report, an investigator with the commission concluded in March 2021 that the Bennington police chief failed to disclose relevant information about Morris’ harasser to her, including his possession of high-capacity firearms and details of an interview with his ex-wife during which she expressed concern for Morris’ safety. The investigator recommended the commission find reasonable grounds that the Town of Bennington discriminated against Morris “on the basis of race and color.” The Town of Bennington publicly apologized to Morris in April and agreed to pay $137,000 to Morris and her family.

First Amendment protections also blur the lines of what constitutes illegal speech, particularly speech directed at public figures.

Notably, the latest version would prohibit anyone convicted of misdemeanor stalking or domestic abuse from being able to purchase a firearm.


Franks and Sobieraj said that online platforms such as Twitter and Facebook also have a responsibility to regulate their users’ language and posts — something lawmakers have debated for years. Twitter, for example, could moderate mentions and replies directed at public figures by making the tweets subject to review before they can be publicly available, Sobieraj said. Franks also advocates for reforming the existing laws that protect online platforms from liability for illegal content posted on their sites.


As the subject of harassment and its effects gain increased attention, more women are pushing back on the narrative that they need to accept racism, misogyny or abuse in order to hold a public position. Krook of Rutgers University said there is growing public solidarity among women in politics to raise awareness on the issue. Last year, five Democratic congresswomen, four of them women of color, introduced a resolution in the House to recognize violence against women in politics as a global phenomenon that requires more research. However, it did not reach a vote in the House.



If harassment and abuse is left unchecked, experts fear it could undo some of the recent progress on diverse representation in public office. Multiple academics said harassment of women — especially women of marginalized groups —  can lead to declining political involvement. Some women may leave office, which Krook noted also cuts off a pipeline for younger people from underrepresented backgrounds to enter politics. Others may censor themselves.


“In order to fully understand social problems or design effective policy interventions, you really need to hear from a wide variety of people with different views and perspectives and experiences and life histories in order to get the richest picture possible,” Sobieraj said.


Nadia Brown, an associate professor of political science and African American studies at Purdue University, said legislators from underrepresented backgrounds use their lived experiences to inform their policymaking decisions, which can result in policy that improves circumstances for marginalized communities on the whole.


A challenge for Black women in politics, those interviewed by the NewsHour said, is balancing their determination to remain in office and serve their communities with fighting the abuse and harassment that threaten their personal wellbeing.


Underwood said she loves serving her constituents in Congress, but said there are other ways to work for her community outside of public office. “If this job turns into one where the threats continue to escalate, I will not continue to do it,” she said, “I am not willing to die to do this work.”

Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz. The author of the messages was arrested and charged with harassment and attempting to influence a public servant. The charges were later dropped when Fields requested that the case be dismissed because he agreed to a permanent restraining order mandating that he stay at least 100 yards away from her at all times.


Fields’ early years in office aligned with a growing demand for more diversity in politics and legislation to address systemic inequities. As more Black women came into positions of power, threats often accompanied their decision to speak more openly about race and social justice.


“Any time that Black women call attention to racial injustice, they’re going to be punished for it because society does not want to deal with that racist, sexist oppression,” said Moya Bailey, assistant professor of Africana studies and women’s, gender and sexuality studies at Northeastern University. Bailey coined the term “misogynoir” as a way to identify anti-Black misogyny.


Mona Lena Krook, a political science professor with Rutgers University, found in her research for a book that women in politics reported spikes in abuse when they spoke out on controversial issues like racial injustice.


Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby experienced this first-hand.


Mosby entered office in 2015 as one of several prosecutors around the country considered to be more progressive for their promises to reform the system. She immediately had to deal with people doubting her abilities, despite graduating from a top law school and previously working in the office of the state’s attorney.


Three months into her first term, 25-year-old Freddie Gray died after his spinal cord was severed during an arrest by Baltimore police officers. The medical examiner ruled the death a homicide. Gray’s death came less than a year after Eric Garner and Michael Brown were killed by police, propelling the Movement for Black Lives.


Soon after Mosby filed charges against the six police officers involved in Gray’s death, she began receiving death threats. Six years later, they haven’t stopped, even after three of the officers were acquitted and the charges against the remaining officers were dropped.





“I have a book full of death threats and hate mail,” Mosby said. “It can be overwhelming at times. And it’s something that has been consistent throughout my tenure.” 


Mosby has received emails describing her being “gunned down” and her husband being “burned and dismembered,” letters telling her that the position of state’s attorney is only respectable when held by a white person and telling her to jump off a bridge — the examples of violent ideation and hate seem endless, she said. In early 2020, after attending a rally to support St. Louis circuit attorney Kim Gardner, who was facing backlash for suing city leadership for racial discrimination, Mosby received a voicemail saying “if we’d known you all were going to be this much trouble we would have picked our own f***ing cotton.”


“I was professionally attacked. I was personally attacked. I have a book full of death threats and hate mail,” Mosby said. “It can be overwhelming at times. And it’s something that has been consistent throughout my tenure.”

Kim Foxx, who defeated an incumbent state’s attorney in 2016 to become the first Black woman to be the top prosecutor in Cook County, Illinois, was also part of the wave of “progressive prosecutors.” She sought to make the office more transparent, promote bail reform, vacate wrongful convictions and rethink the volume of criminal charges. When the state legislature voted to legalize recreational marijuana in 2019, Foxx began expunging past marijuana convictions.


But Foxx has seen her fair share of backlash, notably for her office’s decision in April 2019 to drop charges against Jussie Smollett, an actor accused of staging an attack against himself in Chicago, which he reported to police as a racist and homophobic hate crime. A 2020 report by a special prosecutor did not find evidence to warrant criminal charges against Foxx or her office for how they handled the case, but said there were “substantial abuses of discretion and operational failures” in the decision to drop charges against Smollett. Members of the Chicago Police Department wanted to see Smollett held accountable for wasting law enforcement resources.


Chicago’s Fraternal Order of Police union organized a protest outside of Foxx’s office, during which Foxx said male demonstrators engaged in “offensive, sexist behavior,” including “rubbing [her] face — [her] picture — on their genitalia.” The union’s president, John Catanzara, told the NewsHour that the protest was peaceful, with no injuries or damages. Unrelated to the protest, Catanzara is currently under investigation by the Chicago Police Board and has been stripped of pay for allegedly posting obscene and racist social media messages and allegedly filing a false police report.


Amid the tension, hateful calls and emails to Foxx’s office became overwhelming for her receptionist and assistant, she said. A now-defunct site called Second City Cop Blog, run by an anonymous author, posted racist and sexist insults and nicknames about her almost daily, alongside what the author claimed were critiques of her role as state’s attorney. In addition, the blogger posted Foxx’s home address and invited people to pay her a visit, she added. The author appeared to have close ties to the Chicago Police, but a spokesperson for the department would not comment on whether a current or former officer ran the blog.


Foxx, who has two daughters, said it was difficult to protect her children from the offensive language online. But she said she was advised not to speak out to avoid “giving [the harassment] oxygen.” Keeping the reality of her situation silent felt like “a prison,” she said. 


For Kentucky state Rep. Attica Scott, harassment accelerated following her arrest on Sept. 24, 2020, at a demonstration calling for justice for Breonna Taylor, who was killed by Louisville police during a raid in March 2020  . Scott was charged with felony rioting and misdemeanor failure to disperse. The charges against her were ultimately dropped. Scott, her daughter and a local activist filed a lawsuit against the officers who arrested them that night for violating their constitutional rights. The Louisville Metro Police Department declined to comment on the lawsuit.


“It doesn’t make sense to me. I feel like the police set me up as a target when they arrested me,” said Scott, who in 2016 became the first Black woman in 20 years to be elected to the Kentucky legislature. “To a certain extent, I feel helpless.”


Scott recalled being sent an email in which the author said they would have shot her if they had been one of the officers who arrested her in September. She has also received threats to burn down her home and a voicemail from someone warning that their neighbor wants to shoot and kill her. Threats are so common, it almost feels normal now, she said.


A typical day for Scott usually begins with some kind of abusive, racist or sexist message, she said. She’ll feel deflated for a moment, but then moves on to her legislative duties. She doesn’t have time to process, she said, and representing her community feels like her calling.


“I do think I really have convinced myself that this is the way it is,” she said.


Research indicates these types of experiences can have a significant effect on women’s physical and mental health, including their ability to hold down a regular job, said Sarah Sobieraj, a sociology professor with Tufts University.


Nearly three years after Morris’ resignation from the Vermont legislature, the events leading up to that decision still haunt her. She and her husband sold his childhood home in Bennington where they lived to relocate to a different city. But anxiety remains for each member of their family. Morris said her 10-year-old son created a panic room in one of the closets of their new home in case they need to hide for safety.


“I’m still not OK,” Morris said. “It was a shame, but what [staying in office] was going to cost me and my family … You can’t ask that of anyone. How dare we as a society ask that of anyone?”

U.S. Capitol breach highlights heightened level of danger



U.S. Rep. Nikema Williams, D-Ga., has never felt safe in elected office. Her tenure as a Georgia state senator began with her being arrested by the state capitol’s police while protesting with her constituents in 2018. Her charges were later dropped.


She thought she would be safer in the U.S. Congress, she told the PBS NewsHour in April. But in her first week in Congress a violent mob stormed the U.S. Capitol in an effort to support former President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. The Jan. 6 attack resulted in multiple deaths.


On Jan. 24, U.S. Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., tweeted that a white man who had previously tagged her in violent social media posts participated in the insurrection. That same man has been charged with assaulting a U.S. Capitol Police officer, among other crimes related to his involvement in the Jan. 6 breach.


The Capitol riot reflected a growing threat that sparked fierce conversations about lawmakers’ vulnerability and U.S. Capitol security protocols, which trickled down to other levels of government as the FBI warned of plans for armed extremists to protest at state capitals following the D.C. attack.


Acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman testified before a Senate committee in April that threats against members of Congress increased nearly 65 percent between January and April of this year, compared to the same period in 2020. From 2017 to 2020, threats increased 119 percent, she added.


The U.S. Capitol Police did not respond to the NewsHour’s request for more specific information about the race and gender of Congress members targeted by those threats. Williams said many are aimed at members of color like herself.


In search of solutions to better protect lawmakers and their staff, the House passed a $1.9 billion emergency funding bill last month to bolster security at the Capitol, which would include enhanced security for members of Congress. The bill is currently being considered in the Senate.


Reps. Bush, Ilhan Omar and Ayanna Pressley, all Black women, voted against the bill, stating in a press release that “a bill that pours $1.9 billion into increased police surveillance and force without addressing the underlying threats of organized and violent white supremacy, radicalization, and disinformation that led to this attack will not prevent it from happening again.”


A bipartisan report issued jointly by the Senate Rules and Homeland Security Committees in June cited a number of security failures leading to the Capitol breach. Among them, the report said, U.S. Capitol Police had information about possible violence on Jan. 6, but did not share the full scope of that intelligence with rank-and-file officers or other law enforcement partners.


The committees’ recommendations included better training and equipment for Capitol Police officers.


With safety concerns still unresolved, Black women in Congress said they continue to feel at risk. Williams said she pays for 24-hour security for her and her family using campaign funds, which the FEC allowed following the Jan. 6 attack. Two weeks of security costs her $18,000. “I have to take these things seriously because it is my life. It’s my family’s life. It’s our safety,” she said. Williams no longer reads the messages she receives and her staff manages her inboxes. A spokesperson for Williams said in June they have not received any official guidance on how to address harassment and threats.


U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood, D-Ill., told the NewsHour she does not have security with her all the time, but she has taken advantage of available security resources, including working with the Sergeant at Arms to improve her office’s cybersecurity and to conduct security assessments of her residence.


Still, she believes an attack against her is “a matter of time, unless there’s increased processes put in place to streamline the reporting and investigations … and leadership from the top that says this is not OK,” she said in March.


In addition to concerns about outside threats, the country has also witnessed escalating conflict between lawmakers themselves on Capitol Hill. Multiple news reports have detailed instances of shouting in the Capitol halls and debate over whether lawmakers should be able to carry firearms, which they are currently legally permitted to do on Capitol grounds.


When metal detectors were installed just outside the House floor in January, a number of lawmakers spoke out against the new security system and others were fined for bypassing them.


This tense dynamic on Capitol Hill is also cause for concern, Underwood said. “We have to have accountability in all of our workplaces, including the United States Congress,” she said. “You can’t threaten a colleague, you can’t bring a weapon to work because you don’t like your colleague, and you can’t threaten to use your weapon at work against your colleague and expect to keep your job.” When asked if there was a specific incident that concerned her, Underwood’s team said she was speaking generally.


A spokesperson for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said, “The speaker takes the safety and security of members and all who work in the Capitol extremely seriously, and has taken measures such as the [metal detectors] around the House floor to ensure safety.”


In addition to Pelosi’s office, the NewsHour contacted the office of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., the office of Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., and the press office for the Committee on House Administration to ask about the tension between lawmakers and the existing protocols for when lawmakers receive credible threats. The offices did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

‘I am not willing to die to do this work’


When Black women in politics experience abusive behavior or harassment it can be difficult to determine where they can turn for help or what legal and institutional resources are available to them.


For Scott in Kentucky, security would help her feel safer, but she doesn’t have a way to pay for it, she said. Kentucky state law does not address security in its campaign finance laws, and she said she doubts that paying for security with campaign money would be permitted.


Scott feels safe in her Louisville community, but when working at the state capitol she feels vulnerable. She thinks about ways she could escape if an active shooter came in wanting to kill Black legislators.


She doesn’t report harassment to law enforcement, even if they are credible threats. She feels the police see her as an enemy because she advocates for police accountability. She doesn’t believe they will protect her.


https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2021/06/Voicemail_v3.mp4

“I just have those threats,” Scott said. “There’s no reporting system, at least to my knowledge, for those of us who are legislators who receive threats of any kind. We don’t have a system in place for that.” The Kentucky state legislature did not respond to NewsHour’s questions about their reporting system for threats to lawmakers.


Some women in office do turn to law enforcement to address their security concerns. Coral Evans, the former mayor of Flagstaff, Arizona, experienced physical intimidation during her campaign and two terms from 2016 to 2020. She told the NewsHour of four different trespassing incidents, including one in which a stranger confronted Evans’ daughter in the front yard of their home and made what Evans perceived to be a threat.


Evans said she reported these incidents to police. They were “super supportive,” she said, but their ability to intervene in many cases was limited by the fact that she was a public figure.


“As a public official, you have people that send you emails constantly, they are calling you constantly, they walk up to you in grocery stores. And they’re allowed to do that because you’re a public official,” Evans said. “It’s harder to prove harassment and intimidation and stuff like that if you’re a public official.”


Evans said she’s noticed a change in the treatment of public officials in the last four years. To her, the “shift” resulted in people feeling like they could “say whatever they want” to her — including one constituent telling her, “You’re elected to serve me, I own you.”


Evans, who has long been acquainted with the chief of police, said that during a conversation he recommended that she put up ‘no trespassing’ signs outside her home, advice she followed, but she continued to deal with intruders. “I’m standing here in my yard with my ‘no trespassing’ signs, talking to a guy that’s trespassing,” Evans said of one incident.


Morris in Vermont also filed multiple reports with the police department in Bennington. In several cases the police  determined there was no sufficient evidence to pursue criminal action. A number of the complaints were then investigated by the Vermont attorney general’s office but also did not result in any criminal charges against the man at the center of her harassment allegations. Morris said part of her decision to resign from office was because her lawyer said he could better protect her if she were a private citizen rather than a politician. After she left office, Morris filed a complaint with Vermont’s Human Rights Commission in 2019 alleging discrimination by the Bennington Police Department and the Town of Bennington.

In a report, an investigator with the commission concluded in March 2021 that the Bennington police chief failed to disclose relevant information about Morris’ harasser to her, including his possession of high-capacity firearms and details of an interview with his ex-wife during which she expressed concern for Morris’ safety. The investigator recommended the commission find reasonable grounds that the Town of Bennington discriminated against Morris “on the basis of race and color.” The Town of Bennington publicly apologized to Morris in April and agreed to pay $137,000 to Morris and her family.

This outcome and level of acknowledgement is unusual in cases involving harassment, particularly when it comes to someone in the public eye, Franks of the University of Miami said. Targets of abuse either in person or online face a patchwork of complicated stalking and harassment laws that may offer limited protections.


In-person harassment usually falls under state jurisdiction unless it takes place on federal property or involves interstate contact. But there’s often a high bar to restrict a potential perpetrator’s ability to be in the same place as a potential target.


“It’s so hard to tell the difference between a person who’s just doing things that are not only legal, but also protected,” Franks said. “You’re allowed to go to public places. You’re allowed to show up at the grocery store. You’re allowed to drive to someone’s house. … How do we determine when that becomes illegal?”


First Amendment protections also blur the lines of what constitutes illegal speech, particularly speech directed at public figures.


“The reasoning behind this is twofold: that public officials have made a voluntary choice to serve the public interest and to be in the public eye, and that public officials have more means at their disposal to respond to false or distressing statements,” Franks said.


A series of Supreme Court cases have established this precedent for public figures, including in the New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, a 1964 landmark case in which the high court ruled that First Amendment protections gave public officials limited means to sue for defamation.


For online language, the limitations are less clearly defined because many of the notable cases defining the boundaries of free speech were decided before existing internet culture. Therefore, direct, in-person threats are typically treated much more seriously than online abuse.


“It is incredibly easy to harass a woman online or be abusive online without facing any consequences,” Sobieraj of Tufts University said. “Our laws are based and designed around having a crime and a perpetrator … And in this case, a lot of the time, we have neither. We don’t have anything that’s technically a crime. Identifying a perpetrator is incredibly difficult because of IP-obscuring technologies that exist and the fact that anybody could do it from a public library or a hotel business center.”

Online harassment or stalking is more likely to fall under federal authority because it crosses state lines, Franks said, adding that two crucial components for successful legal action are that the perpetrator has established a pattern of harmful behavior and has shown an intent to cause harm. Both of these can be incredibly difficult to prove, especially given the vague context of online posts and the fact that online abuse may involve multiple actors who have not engaged in multiple offenses individually.


Despite these challenges, sometimes the law does align in public officials’ favor. Stacey Plaskett, a Black congresswoman representing the U.S. Virgin Islands, became a target in 2016 when two of her former staffers used email and social media to distribute nude images of Plaskett and her husband taken from Plaskett’s cell phone. The two former staffers pleaded guilty to charges that included conspiracy and cyberstalking. The legal elements that worked in favor of the prosecution were that there was a clear breach of Plaskett’s privacy and a clear intent to cause her harm, Franks said.

“Revenge porn” and sexualized threats are commonly used against women in public positions. In many cases, explicit images may be acquired without the victim’s consent; in other situations the images can be falsified, such as editing a victim’s face onto the photo of another person’s body. To begin the process of filling the legal gaps of online abuse, some lawmakers are pushing to further define the parameters of this behavior, giving victims of harassment and abuse more legal recourse.


As a Colorado state representative in 2014, Fields sponsored a bill to more clearly define cyberbullying of minors and make it a misdemeanor offense. That bill passed in the state House but faced accusations of First Amendment violations and stalled in the state Senate. In 2018, after Fields became a state senator, she worked with other lawmakers to sponsor a bill signed by the governor that redefined the existing revenge porn law by removing requirements like the need to prove a target endured emotional distress.

Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby has been receiving death threats since 2015. She said the abuse can be overwhelming, but that using her position for justice keeps her going. Photo taken remotely through a projector by Chloe Jones/PBS NewsHour.

At the federal level, a bill known as the SHIELD Act would address things like “revenge porn” and “sextortion” by making it a federal crime to post nonconsensual sexually explicit images online. The bill was introduced in the House in 2019 but never reached a vote. It has since been added as an amendment to the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2021 that was passed in the House in March, but has not yet received a vote from the Senate. The bill aims to provide resources and protections for targets of domestic violence, sexual assault stalking and technological abuse. Notably, the latest version would prohibit anyone convicted of misdemeanor stalking or domestic abuse from being able to purchase a firearm.


Franks and Sobieraj said that online platforms such as Twitter and Facebook also have a responsibility to regulate their users’ language and posts — something lawmakers have debated for years. Twitter, for example, could moderate mentions and replies directed at public figures by making the tweets subject to review before they can be publicly available, Sobieraj said.

A typical day for Scott usually begins with some kind of abusive, racist or sexist message, she said. She’ll feel deflated for a moment, but then moves on to her legislative duties. She doesn’t have time to process, she said, and representing her community feels like her calling. “I do think I really have convinced myself that this is the way it is,” she said. Research indicates these types of experiences can have a significant effect on women’s physical and mental health, including their ability to hold down a regular job, said Sarah Sobieraj, a sociology professor with Tufts University. Nearly three years after Morris’ resignation from the Vermont legislature, the events leading up to that decision still haunt her. She and her husband sold his childhood home in Bennington where they lived to relocate to a different city. But anxiety remains for each member of their family. Morris said her 10-year-old son created a panic room in one of the closets of their new home in case they need to hide for safety. “I’m still not OK,” Morris said. “It was a shame, but what [staying in office] was going to cost me and my family … You can’t ask that of anyone. How dare we as a society ask that of anyone?” Colorado State Senator Rhonda Fields faced racist abuse after she introduced gun control legislation in 2013 following the Aurora mass shooting.

U.S. Capitol breach highlights heightened level of danger



U.S. Rep. Nikema Williams, D-Ga., has never felt safe in elected office. Her tenure as a Georgia state senator began with her being arrested by the state capitol’s police while protesting with her constituents in 2018. Her charges were later dropped.


She thought she would be safer in the U.S. Congress, she told the PBS NewsHour in April. But in her first week in Congress a violent mob stormed the U.S. Capitol in an effort to support former President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. The Jan. 6 attack resulted in multiple deaths.


On Jan. 24, U.S. Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., tweeted that a white man who had previously tagged her in violent social media posts participated in the insurrection. That same man has been charged with assaulting a U.S. Capitol Police officer, among other crimes related to his involvement in the Jan. 6 breach.


The Capitol riot reflected a growing threat that sparked fierce conversations about lawmakers’ vulnerability and U.S. Capitol security protocols, which trickled down to other levels of government as the FBI warned of plans for armed extremists to protest at state capitals following the D.C. attack.


Acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman testified before a Senate committee in April that threats against members of Congress increased nearly 65 percent between January and April of this year, compared to the same period in 2020. From 2017 to 2020, threats increased 119 percent, she added.


The U.S. Capitol Police did not respond to the NewsHour’s request for more specific information about the race and gender of Congress members targeted by those threats. Williams said many are aimed at members of color like herself.


In search of solutions to better protect lawmakers and their staff, the House passed a $1.9 billion emergency funding bill last month to bolster security at the Capitol, which would include enhanced security for members of Congress. The bill is currently being considered in the Senate.


Reps. Bush, Ilhan Omar and Ayanna Pressley, all Black women, voted against the bill, stating in a press release that “a bill that pours $1.9 billion into increased police surveillance and force without addressing the underlying threats of organized and violent white supremacy, radicalization, and disinformation that led to this attack will not prevent it from happening again.”


A bipartisan report issued jointly by the Senate Rules and Homeland Security Committees in June cited a number of security failures leading to the Capitol breach. Among them, the report said, U.S. Capitol Police had information about possible violence on Jan. 6, but did not share the full scope of that intelligence with rank-and-file officers or other law enforcement partners.


The committees’ recommendations included better training and equipment for Capitol Police officers.


With safety concerns still unresolved, Black women in Congress said they continue to feel at risk. Williams said she pays for 24-hour security for her and her family using campaign funds, which the FEC allowed following the Jan. 6 attack. Two weeks of security costs her $18,000. “I have to take these things seriously because it is my life. It’s my family’s life. It’s our safety,” she said. Williams no longer reads the messages she receives and her staff manages her inboxes. A spokesperson for Williams said in June they have not received any official guidance on how to address harassment and threats.


U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood, D-Ill., told the NewsHour she does not have security with her all the time, but she has taken advantage of available security resources, including working with the Sergeant at Arms to improve her office’s cybersecurity and to conduct security assessments of her residence.


Still, she believes an attack against her is “a matter of time, unless there’s increased processes put in place to streamline the reporting and investigations … and leadership from the top that says this is not OK,” she said in March.


In addition to concerns about outside threats, the country has also witnessed escalating conflict between lawmakers themselves on Capitol Hill. Multiple news reports have detailed instances of shouting in the Capitol halls and debate over whether lawmakers should be able to carry firearms, which they are currently legally permitted to do on Capitol grounds.


When metal detectors were installed just outside the House floor in January, a number of lawmakers spoke out against the new security system and others were fined for bypassing them.


This tense dynamic on Capitol Hill is also cause for concern, Underwood said. “We have to have accountability in all of our workplaces, including the United States Congress,” she said. “You can’t threaten a colleague, you can’t bring a weapon to work because you don’t like your colleague, and you can’t threaten to use your weapon at work against your colleague and expect to keep your job.” When asked if there was a specific incident that concerned her, Underwood’s team said she was speaking generally.


A spokesperson for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said, “The speaker takes the safety and security of members and all who work in the Capitol extremely seriously, and has taken measures such as the [metal detectors] around the House floor to ensure safety.”


In addition to Pelosi’s office, the NewsHour contacted the office of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., the office of Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., and the press office for the Committee on House Administration to ask about the tension between lawmakers and the existing protocols for when lawmakers receive credible threats. The offices did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

‘I am not willing to die to do this work’


When Black women in politics experience abusive behavior or harassment it can be difficult to determine where they can turn for help or what legal and institutional resources are available to them.


For Scott in Kentucky, security would help her feel safer, but she doesn’t have a way to pay for it, she said. Kentucky state law does not address security in its campaign finance laws, and she said she doubts that paying for security with campaign money would be permitted.


Scott feels safe in her Louisville community, but when working at the state capitol she feels vulnerable. She thinks about ways she could escape if an active shooter came in wanting to kill Black legislators.


She doesn’t report harassment to law enforcement, even if they are credible threats. She feels the police see her as an enemy because she advocates for police accountability. She doesn’t believe they will protect her.


https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2021/06/Voicemail_v3.mp4

“I just have those threats,” Scott said. “There’s no reporting system, at least to my knowledge, for those of us who are legislators who receive threats of any kind. We don’t have a system in place for that.” The Kentucky state legislature did not respond to NewsHour’s questions about their reporting system for threats to lawmakers.


Some women in office do turn to law enforcement to address their security concerns. Coral Evans, the former mayor of Flagstaff, Arizona, experienced physical intimidation during her campaign and two terms from 2016 to 2020. She told the NewsHour of four different trespassing incidents, including one in which a stranger confronted Evans’ daughter in the front yard of their home and made what Evans perceived to be a threat.


Evans said she reported these incidents to police. They were “super supportive,” she said, but their ability to intervene in many cases was limited by the fact that she was a public figure.


“As a public official, you have people that send you emails constantly, they are calling you constantly, they walk up to you in grocery stores. And they’re allowed to do that because you’re a public official,” Evans said. “It’s harder to prove harassment and intimidation and stuff like that if you’re a public official.”


Evans said she’s noticed a change in the treatment of public officials in the last four years. To her, the “shift” resulted in people feeling like they could “say whatever they want” to her — including one constituent telling her, “You’re elected to serve me, I own you.”


Evans, who has long been acquainted with the chief of police, said that during a conversation he recommended that she put up ‘no trespassing’ signs outside her home, advice she followed, but she continued to deal with intruders. “I’m standing here in my yard with my ‘no trespassing’ signs, talking to a guy that’s trespassing,” Evans said of one incident.


Morris in Vermont also filed multiple reports with the police department in Bennington. In several cases the police  determined there was no sufficient evidence to pursue criminal action. A number of the complaints were then investigated by the Vermont attorney general’s office but also did not result in any criminal charges against the man at the center of her harassment allegations. Morris said part of her decision to resign from office was because her lawyer said he could better protect her if she were a private citizen rather than a politician. After she left office, Morris filed a complaint with Vermont’s Human Rights Commission in 2019 alleging discrimination by the Bennington Police Department and the Town of Bennington.

In a report, an investigator with the commission concluded in March 2021 that the Bennington police chief failed to disclose relevant information about Morris’ harasser to her, including his possession of high-capacity firearms and details of an interview with his ex-wife during which she expressed concern for Morris’ safety. The investigator recommended the commission find reasonable grounds that the Town of Bennington discriminated against Morris “on the basis of race and color.” The Town of Bennington publicly apologized to Morris in April and agreed to pay $137,000 to Morris and her family.

This outcome and level of acknowledgement is unusual in cases involving harassment, particularly when it comes to someone in the public eye, Franks of the University of Miami said. Targets of abuse either in person or online face a patchwork of complicated stalking and harassment laws that may offer limited protections.


In-person harassment usually falls under state jurisdiction unless it takes place on federal property or involves interstate contact. But there’s often a high bar to restrict a potential perpetrator’s ability to be in the same place as a potential target.


“It’s so hard to tell the difference between a person who’s just doing things that are not only legal, but also protected,” Franks said. “You’re allowed to go to public places. You’re allowed to show up at the grocery store. You’re allowed to drive to someone’s house. … How do we determine when that becomes illegal?”


First Amendment protections also blur the lines of what constitutes illegal speech, particularly speech directed at public figures.


“The reasoning behind this is twofold: that public officials have made a voluntary choice to serve the public interest and to be in the public eye, and that public officials have more means at their disposal to respond to false or distressing statements,” Franks said.


A series of Supreme Court cases have established this precedent for public figures, including in the New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, a 1964 landmark case in which the high court ruled that First Amendment protections gave public officials limited means to sue for defamation.


For online language, the limitations are less clearly defined because many of the notable cases defining the boundaries of free speech were decided before existing internet culture. Therefore, direct, in-person threats are typically treated much more seriously than online abuse.


“It is incredibly easy to harass a woman online or be abusive online without facing any consequences,” Sobieraj of Tufts University said. “Our laws are based and designed around having a crime and a perpetrator … And in this case, a lot of the time, we have neither. We don’t have anything that’s technically a crime. Identifying a perpetrator is incredibly difficult because of IP-obscuring technologies that exist and the fact that anybody could do it from a public library or a hotel business center.”

Online harassment or stalking is more likely to fall under federal authority because it crosses state lines, Franks said, adding that two crucial components for successful legal action are that the perpetrator has established a pattern of harmful behavior and has shown an intent to cause harm. Both of these can be incredibly difficult to prove, especially given the vague context of online posts and the fact that online abuse may involve multiple actors who have not engaged in multiple offenses individually.


Despite these challenges, sometimes the law does align in public officials’ favor. Stacey Plaskett, a Black congresswoman representing the U.S. Virgin Islands, became a target in 2016 when two of her former staffers used email and social media to distribute nude images of Plaskett and her husband taken from Plaskett’s cell phone. The two former staffers pleaded guilty to charges that included conspiracy and cyberstalking. The legal elements that worked in favor of the prosecution were that there was a clear breach of Plaskett’s privacy and a clear intent to cause her harm, Franks said.

“Revenge porn” and sexualized threats are commonly used against women in public positions. In many cases, explicit images may be acquired without the victim’s consent; in other situations the images can be falsified, such as editing a victim’s face onto the photo of another person’s body. To begin the process of filling the legal gaps of online abuse, some lawmakers are pushing to further define the parameters of this behavior, giving victims of harassment and abuse more legal recourse.


As a Colorado state representative in 2014, Fields sponsored a bill to more clearly define cyberbullying of minors and make it a misdemeanor offense. That bill passed in the state House but faced accusations of First Amendment violations and stalled in the state Senate. In 2018, after Fields became a state senator, she worked with other lawmakers to sponsor a bill signed by the governor that redefined the existing revenge porn law by removing requirements like the need to prove a target endured emotional distress.

Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby has been receiving death threats since 2015. She said the abuse can be overwhelming, but that using her position for justice keeps her going. Photo taken remotely through a projector by Chloe Jones/PBS NewsHour.

At the federal level, a bill known as the SHIELD Act would address things like “revenge porn” and “sextortion” by making it a federal crime to post nonconsensual sexually explicit images online. The bill was introduced in the House in 2019 but never reached a vote. It has since been added as an amendment to the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2021 that was passed in the House in March, but has not yet received a vote from the Senate. The bill aims to provide resources and protections for targets of domestic violence, sexual assault stalking and technological abuse. Notably, the latest version would prohibit anyone convicted of misdemeanor stalking or domestic abuse from being able to purchase a firearm.


Franks and Sobieraj said that online platforms such as Twitter and Facebook also have a responsibility to regulate their users’ language and posts — something lawmakers have debated for years. Twitter, for example, could moderate mentions and replies directed at public figures by making the tweets subject to review before they can be publicly available, Sobieraj said. Franks also advocates for reforming the existing laws that protect online platforms from liability for illegal content posted on their sites.


As the subject of harassment and its effects gain increased attention, more women are pushing back on the narrative that they need to accept racism, misogyny or abuse in order to hold a public position. Krook of Rutgers University said there is growing public solidarity among women in politics to raise awareness on the issue. Last year, five Democratic congresswomen, four of them women of color, introduced a resolution in the House to recognize violence against women in politics as a global phenomenon that requires more research. However, it did not reach a vote in the House.



If harassment and abuse is left unchecked, experts fear it could undo some of the recent progress on diverse representation in public office. Multiple academics said harassment of women — especially women of marginalized groups —  can lead to declining political involvement. Some women may leave office, which Krook noted also cuts off a pipeline for younger people from underrepresented backgrounds to enter politics. Others may censor themselves.


“In order to fully understand social problems or design effective policy interventions, you really need to hear from a wide variety of people with different views and perspectives and experiences and life histories in order to get the richest picture possible,” Sobieraj said.


Nadia Brown, an associate professor of political science and African American studies at Purdue University, said legislators from underrepresented backgrounds use their lived experiences to inform their policymaking decisions, which can result in policy that improves circumstances for marginalized communities on the whole.


A challenge for Black women in politics, those interviewed by the NewsHour said, is balancing their determination to remain in office and serve their communities with fighting the abuse and harassment that threaten their personal wellbeing.


Underwood said she loves serving her constituents in Congress, but said there are other ways to work for her community outside of public office. “If this job turns into one where the threats continue to escalate, I will not continue to do it,” she said, “I am not willing to die to do this work.”

Underwood said she loves serving her constituents in Congress, but said there are other ways to work for her community outside of public office. “If this job turns into one where the threats continue to escalate, I will not continue to do it,” she said, “I am not willing to die to do this work.” EDITING/PRODUCTION CREDITS:

1964156737,2021-06-17 14:00:00,Why Bo Burnham’s ‘Inside’ Resonates And Captures Our Zeitgeist Perfectly,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattklein/2021/06/17/why-bo-burnhams-inside-resonates-and-captures-our-zeitgeist/,en,False,,1104,Forbes,http://www.forbes.com/,"""All Eyes on Me"" Bo Burnham’s Inside has been streaming on Netflix for weeks now, but for those who know, know: It stays with you. Maybe longer than some may like. It’s part stand-up, part musical special, part experimental film, but attempting to typecast the work feels counterproductive. If we glean anything from the piece it’s: Does any of this even matter? As long we’re grinding out more content, who cares what exactly it is? This article notwithstanding. Inside’s title is loaded—inside one’s home, head, internet and dark zeitgeist. And it’s the 8K clarity snapshot of today’s online cultural moment that makes Inside so refreshing… yet so uncomfortably grim. Reality has never been streamed back at us so articulately… and musically. There’s a lot of referential commentary about the internet today, but so little nuanced understanding of it. As Bo puts it, it’s the difference between a Taco Bell hashtag Chalupa *dab* emoji ad vs. an empathic reflection of the struggle to attract attention online as a middle schooler (ex. Bo’s 2018 film Eighth Grade). Inside is no different. It falls into that rare category of deeper meditations about our lives online. Bo doesn’t just offer a reflection of our online complex, he delivers a rare two-way mirror—an unfiltered look inside the social production process, which he and young adults know all too well. He’s us, and we’re him. After all, he helped kindle our desire and the standard of internet fame today, literally paving the golden brick road for viral possibility on YouTube 14 years ago. It’s this unique perspective which adds the complexity to his meditation. There’s a palatable tinge of guilt. He’s opened Pandora’s Box. He guiltily suffers alongside us, while continuing to deliver even more content… despite the agony required. “Daddy made you some content.” His lonely, anxiety-fueled COVID-19 journey isn’t unique, and because it isn’t, it resonates even more. Still, no one else could tell this story so well—he’s experienced just a little bit more as he’s now swallowed up inside the system. Netflix payments and all. According to Letterboxd, the social network for film lovers, Inside has a higher rating than nearly all the classics: Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Rocky, Jaws, and even The Shining, arguably just the predated and fictionalized version of Inside. Its rating is so high, likely not because it defies genres or is so artistic for a solo endeavor, but it respectfully addresses the viewer beyond conventionally breaking the fourth wall. Deadpool is child’s play. Today’s entertainment glut drowns us, sucking us in, and permits an escape from reality. Inside does the exact opposite. It looks at us dead in the eyes and recites back all what we already know. It’s sugar-coated nihilism. Simply put: our mental health is dire, our world is hopeless, and our internet is off its rails. Admittance lessens the weight. Thank you Bo for finally saying it. We’re no longer alone with this dread. Bo documents the pressures of performance, content creation and mere existence in the throws of our Creator, Influencer and Capitalistic Economies… none of which have significantly paused amidst a global pandemic. When our AFK (away from keyboard) experiences become the reverse-engineered source material for our now prioritized URL lives, the figure and ground reverses. No longer is everyday life organically captured. Everyday life is now scripted and manipulated to make for better (funnier, sexier, more outrageous, etc.) content to publish. Content is our livelihood, whether it’s for attention or money. When fiery outrage to emotional anguish catches eyes and cashes checks, it’s hard to tell if Bo is helplessly stranded inside the system, or actually playing into it. It makes no difference. Inside addresses this tension. It’s about Bo’s struggle and questioned responsibility to create during an eerily solemn moment. In “Comedy,” he sings: The more I love, the more I see nothing to joke about Is comedy over? Should I leave you alone? His internal dilemma becomes his deliverable, but also our entertainment. Conflict as content. He doesn’t want to ignore the tension, yet he keeps creating. But hasn’t that been our entire last year? The limbo between addressing our mortality and fear of a deadly virus yet striving to live life as normal. Hoarding canned soup for the end of the world while getting our work timesheets in on time. Bo presents this middle. And the middle is a funny feeling… ""That Funny Feeling"" “That Funny Feeling” is perhaps the strongest proof distillation of our moment and of Inside. With a projected campfire setting behind him, Bo plays an acoustic guitar citing these extreme tensions we live within: the sparkly and the dark, the pretend and the all too real. The livе-action Lion King, the Pepsi Halftime Show Twenty-thousand years of this, seven more to go Carpool Karaoke, Steve Aoki, Logan Paul A gift shop at the gun range, a mass shooting at the mall Juxtaposing soulless Disney remakes for profit and today’s vapid celebs, with the looming climate crisis, over-consumption, mental illness and terrorism, creates an ickiness. Or a funny feeling. Nothing brought up is new—if anything, it’s all trite—but what is new is addressing, and singing, the co-existence of all of these things together—the glittering, monotonous and acceptable, and the depressing, ignored and sensitive. Inside isn’t about one thing, it’s about everything. The film and particularly “That Funny Feeling” zooms out as far as we could go to acknowledge it all. The whole zeitgeist. This un-cropped screenshot of everything is what evokes our appreciation but distress. It’s true reality TV. It’s pandemic isolation in light of an unhinged internet, in light of rising water levels, in light of video game culture, in light of self-doubt and perfectionism, in light of hyper-woke paranoia, in light of income inequality, in light of text-based horniness, in light of a mental breakdown. Despite all of this crushing complexity, the request still stands: “All Eyes on Me.” Let’s get the performance on with and the content out. The show must go on. The pain plays a starring role. Best representing Inside and its theme of funny feelings is its very release. Seemingly “delayed” as Bo labors to get it across the finish line, Inside is finally released as vaccines are rolled out and restrictions are lifted. The pandemic is over. But it’s as if Bo is too late. We’ve moved on. Back to normal. Which leads us to the most powerful sensation… Watching Inside, or re-watching our pandemic so soon, is a hit of reality. A funny feeling. Matt Klein is a cultural theorist and  strategist whose work focuses on the psychosocial implications of our technology.

Douglas Kantor, 25, was struck in the abdomen by spray gunfire early Saturday morning in downtown Austin's 6th street, a popular strip with bars and restaurants, after a dispute between two groups of teenagers turned violent. Kantor, a Ford employee and recent college graduate, was visiting friends from Michigan when he was killed. His family said he suffered in the hospital for more than a day before succumbing to his injuries.  In all, 14 people were injured in the shooting, including many who were innocent bystanders. Two juvenile suspects have been arrested in connection with the incident. In response to the shooting, Democratic politicians in the state renewed calls for increased gun control, particularly demanding Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to veto the state's new ""constitutional carry"" bill, which allows for Texans to carry handguns in public without a permit.  But Kantor's family, speaking with Fox News on Wednesday, decried the attempts to ""politicize"" Douglas' death. Family of shooting victim says politicizing his death is 'disturbing'

www.youtube.com  ""This was not a mass shooting,"" Nick Kantor said. ""This wasn't somebody on top of a rooftop gunning people down for no reason. This was rival members of groups that were having a problem with each other and decided that they were going to have a standoff in the middle of a street party that my brother was attending, and my brother was caught in the crossfire."" ""This should not be used to politicize any sort of gun control,"" he argued. ""The fact that that's what it seems like politicians are doing with this story is deeply disturbing to me and my family. This is the last thing we want. We want Doug's story to be told for what it was and not politicized for some agenda."" Instead, Nick Kantor blamed the city's ""defund the police"" initiative for hurting law enforcement's efforts to fight crime in the city. Last summer, the Austin City Council unanimously approved a proposal to cut its police department budget by one-third — or $150 million — and reallocate those funds to increase abortion access, food programs, and ""alternative forms of public safety."" ""This is a nationwide crisis,"" Kantor said. ""Defunding the police just gives a false sense of security to those people who abide by the laws,"" Kantor said. ""My brother went out here seeing plenty of police presence in Austin and feeling safe, not realizing that there were gang members walking among him with guns.""

1964222147,2021-06-17 15:16:31,Florida GOP insists typo is to blame after facing brutal backlash for labeling Jewish Democrat an anti-Semite,https://www.rawstory.com/florida-gop-jewish-lawmaker/,en,False,,1127,Raw Story,http://rawstory.com,"In a very strange excuse this week, Florida Republican Party Executive Director Helen Aguirre Ferré claimed there was a ""typo"" to blame for her accusation that all 2022 Democrats in her state were anti-Semitic, Politico reported. ""While @GovRonDeSantis works on policies and signs legislation in support of Florida's Jewish communities, Pelosi calls an anti semitic, @CharlieCrist, a valued leader. Crist, @valdemings & @NikkiFried won't stand up to Pelosi doing nothing to defend Florida's Jewish community,"" (sic) the now-deleted tweet said. ""It was a total mistake, human error,"" claimed Florida GOP spokesperson Alia Faraj-Johnson. She claimed she meant to say that Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) was anti-Semitic, not Fried or Crist. It's unclear how the Republicans accidentally typed Nikki Fried and Charlie Crist instead of Ilhan Omar. The names don't appear to feature similar letters. ""It picked up the wrong name at the wrong place,"" the spokesperson said. It was Ferré who called it a ""typo."" ""That was a typo that was corrected and glad to know Fried is paying attention to us,"" she said. ""Are Nikki, Charlie and Val going to denounce Ilhan Omar anytime soon?"" Omar doesn't represent Florida, but Republicans frequently demand that Democrats publically declare support or opposition to other Democrats. Republicans, however, don't provide the same denunciations when GOP officials like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) cited a Jewish space laser as the cause of wildfires in California. Greene also announced that the 2018 mass shooting in Parkland Florida was a ""false flag planned shooting."" There is not one mention of Greene on the Florida GOP's website, certainly no one denouncing her attacks on Parkland citizens. Read the full report. Former President Donald Trump unexpectedly brought up salacious allegations made in the Steele dossier during a Thursday speech at a Florida retreat for GOP senators and donors. Trump brought up the infamous ""pee tape"" allegation that was included in a dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele.    I want to share a thought with you. It may sound strange. It's that the 2020 presidential election may have been the Republican Party's best and last shot of an authoritarian takeover of the country. Now that it has failed, now that a majority of the American people understands what's going on and what's at stake, everything we are seeing now, no matter how scary it is, is a slow unwinding of an all-but-spent threat. I'm getting ahead of myself, I know. We don't know what we can't know until the time has come in which knowing is possible. So I might be right about this, but I don't know if I am, because I can't know if I am until months or years from now. But there are small things suggesting to me, yeah, I could be right. What happened yesterday, for instance.              Efforts by former President Donald Trump to punish a perceived political foe were reversed by the Biden administration. ""Hours before he was scheduled to retire in 2018, Andrew G. McCabe, then the F.B.I.'s deputy director, was fired by the Justice Department, depriving him of his pension and prompting cheers from President Donald J. Trump, who had been hounding him over his role in the Russia investigation,"" The New York Times reports. ""On Thursday, the department reversed Mr. McCabe's firing, settling a lawsuit he filed asserting that he was dismissed for political reasons.""       Copyright © 2021 Raw Story Media, Inc.

1964313743,2021-05-25 00:00:00,Beto O'Rourke considers run for Texas governor,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/05/25/beto-orourke-considers-run-texas-governor/7430957002/,en,False,,4,USA Today,http://www.usatoday.com,"AUSTIN, Texas — There's no road trip, no soul searching. No beard or blogging. But Beto O'Rourke is making a political life decision again. Three years after becoming Democrats' breakout star out of Texas, and a year removed from crashing back to Earth in a short-lived presidential run, O'Rourke is again weighing another campaign — this time for governor. But now O'Rourke, who teased an announcement of his bid for the White House on the cover of Vanity Fair, is being quiet about it. He says he hasn't ruled out anything, but isn't saying much else. And Texas Democrats are itching for an answer. ""Impatience is not the word for it,"" Texas Democratic Party chairman Gilberto Hinojosa said. ""But anxious is."" For months, O'Rourke has kept his options open. A top aide to the former Texas congressman and presidential candidate said O'Rouke, 48, has not ruled out challenging Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in 2022 but has taken no formal steps toward a campaign, like calling donors or recruiting staff. The aide spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss private deliberations more freely. If O'Rourke jumped in, it would be his third straight election cycle as a candidate, following his narrow loss for U.S. Senate in 2018 and failed White House run last year. A comeback in Texas could be complicated by liberal positions he took while seeking the presidency, but likely no other Democrat would enter the governor's race with the same ability to quickly raise the massive campaign funds needed to compete in the state. There is no timeline on a decision, according to the aide, who said O'Rourke only recently has been able to think more about running now that he's finished teaching virtual classes at two Texas universities. For one, he led a seminar on the struggle for voting rights — O'Rourke's most visible cause lately, as state lawmakers are set to approve a sweeping bill that would restrict polling hours and reduce options to cast a ballot. Ipsos/Reuters poll: A quarter of Americans believe Donald Trump remains 'true president' of the US Texas is the last big battleground in the GOP's nationwide campaign to impose new voting restrictions, driven by former President Donald Trump's false claims that the election was stolen from him. That fight is the latest way O'Rourke has remained an out-front presence, following the coronavirus pandemic and February's catastrophic freeze and blackouts across much of Texas that killed more than 150 people. He hasn't let up on Abbott, who is expected to seek a third term. ""These jokers can't even keep the lights on, or the heat on, or the water on when the temperature drops. Now they want to take away our election?"" O'Rourke told protesters this month at the Texas Capitol. More: Gov. Greg Abbott signs 'fetal heartbeat' bill banning most abortions in Texas The decision facing O'Rourke comes at a dark moment for Texas Democrats, even by the standards of a hapless 25 years of getting clobbered in statewide elections and steamrolled in the Legislature. For one, they are still wobbling after their massive expectations for a 2020 breakthrough flopped spectacularly. The party had hoped to flip the Texas House and O'Rourke led a massive campaign to do just that, but failed to give Democrats a single extra seat. The Election Day wipeout emboldened Texas Republicans, who have responded by muscling through staunchly conservative measures over guns, abortion and teaching curriculum that Democrats are all but powerless to stop. Any Texas Democrat running for governor faces long odds against the well-funded Abbott, who could ultimately face a stiffer challenge from actor Matthew McConaughey and his musings about joining the race himself. Still, O'Rourke went from virtual unknown to nearly upsetting Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018, and relishes the role of underdog. While weighing his presidential run in early 2019, O'Rourke briefly grew a beard. He hit the road and wrote long, quasi-philosophical blog posts. When he did finally announce, it coincided with the Vanity Fair cover, which proved more memorable than most of his time actually campaigning. More: In overnight vote, Texas Senate approves bill limiting how race, racism can be taught in public school classrooms Hinojosa said he encouraged O'Rourke to consider running for governor after last year's letdown for Democrats. He said he's itching for an answer because the current hole at the top of the ticket is keeping others in the party sidelined for 2022 until they know whether there will be a strong gubernatorial candidate who could boost their own chances downballot. ""I told him that I thought that we needed a strong candidate for governor and he certainly fit that mold, and that, in my opinion, if anybody could beat Abbott, he could beat him,"" Hinojosa said of his conversation with O'Rourke. Republicans who already hold massive advantages statewide are looking to extend their territory along the Texas-Mexico border, historically a Democratic stronghold, which swung heavily toward Trump in November. In Webb County, which includes Laredo, Trump cut in half his vote deficit from 2016. More: Beto O'Rourke rallies in Texas kick-off in El Paso, blocks from US-Mexico border Sylvia Bruni, the county's Democratic Party chairwoman, said she hopes O'Rourke runs but knows his presidential bid could hurt his chances. O'Rourke remade his campaign after a mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso in August 2019 and during one debate even made a full-throated call on national TV for confiscating assault rifles, saying ""Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15."" That kind of comment isn't forgotten easily in Laredo, which Bruni describes tongue-in-cheek as an area where ""your guns are more important than your wife."" In April, O'Rourke drove 600 miles to Laredo to knock on doors and canvass for new voters. Bruni registered another 256 new voters Thursday at a high school, and worries the election bill heading to Abbott's desk will make casting their first ballot harder. ""No one else has surfaced,"" she said of Democrats' non-O'Rourke prospects for governor. ""I haven't seen anyone out there."" Weissert reported from Washington."

Silver, pink and white star balloons surrounded her. Behind her, a small cross, one of four, that lined the front of an Englewood home had her younger sister’s name: Shermetria Williams. “This is her favorite song!” she shouted before someone queued up “Heaven” by Beyoncé. “Say her name!” a man shouted. “Mia!” Deon Williams, saying her sister’s nickname, and other family shouted back, mixed with the names of the other three victims who were all fatally shot inside the home Tuesday morning. “Do you feel the spirit?” Deon, 49, yelled. “In your soul?” Diamond Williams, another sister of Shermetria, hugged loved ones as she cried and the balloons raised above them. “She didn’t deserve this,” Diamond said. Around 7 p.m. Wednesday, they swayed together next to small tea lights that spelled out Shermetria’s nicknames as other community members made a semicircle around them. Friends and family swapped stories of how they heard what had happened. How they used process of elimination to know which four victims went to hospitals and which four were lying dead inside the house. The others who died were 28-year-old Ratanya Aryiel Rogers, 32-year-old Denice “Niecy” Mathis and 35-year-old Blake Lee, according to the Cook County medical examiner’s office. Those who survived were a 23-year-old man, a 25-year-old woman, a 25-year-old man and a 41-year-old man. No arrests had been made as of Friday afternoon, police said. The cat of one of the injured victims ran up and down the steps of the home, unable to enter, and around the front yard. Chicago police squad cars blocked off the street and detectives walked up to pull aside some attendees. Shermetria, 19, had only started going around the house recently, her cousin said on the day of the shooting. She was younger than the others, set to graduate the day she died. She started seeing the man who lived in the apartment after she attended one of his parties. She left behind a 2-year-old daughter who also lost her father to gun violence, Diamond said. “I want mercy on Chicago. We can’t get her back,” Deon said. “But for her daughter, we have to come together as a family.” Robyn Eddmonds, 34, a longtime friend of the three others who were killed, said that the white stone house in the 6200 block of South Morgan Street is where people could get together and party but their things would always still be there in the morning. She looked at the house and said she still can’t believe the shooting was real. “This should’ve never happened to them like that,” she said. “This isn’t the house where stuff like that happens at.” “Shouldn’t have happened at all,” neighbor Michelle Bolton added. Donald Coleman, older brother of Niecy Mathis, said in a phone interview with the Tribune that his sister left behind five kids, ages 2 to 14, the oldest a girl and the rest boys. Mathis was the party girl of 12 siblings, he said, but she had always put her kids first and made sure they were set before she went out. “She was a really, really, really great mother,” he said. “She went above and beyond for her kids. She always made a way for her kids.” Mathis grew up in Englewood. She loved to travel, having gone to Miami and Houston earlier this year. She had a trip planned to Orlando, Florida, to take her kids to Disney World. She took them to Six Flags on the Friday before the shooting and then to a water park on Sunday. Coleman, 38, said he last saw her via FaceTime the day before she was killed. His other sister was doing Mathis’ hair, two big braids, and Coleman called her “ugly,” a joke he always made when she got her hair done. When he woke up Tuesday morning, his phone went off nonstop. He knew something had to be wrong. No one ever called him at 5 or 6 in the morning. He went on Facebook and saw people tagging his sister in posts about the shooting. He hopped onto the expressway and drove to the scene. He said he had to see it for himself. “At the time, you don’t want to believe it’s true. You want to believe that she made it,” he said. “That it wasn’t her. That she wasn’t one of the victims.” Police let the family members stand near the home, but they couldn’t go in. Coleman watched the detectives walk in and out as his sister, who was the “Robin” to his “Batman,” was inside. Officers asked family members what clothes their loved ones were wearing. Coleman stood outside the house and cried when he knew it was true. “First time crying in years, many years,” he said. “I cried.” Mathis and two of the others killed were really close, Coleman said. They were part of a group that called themselves the “Creep Squad” because they would stay up so late. He knew the two victims, who he said both also had kids, and one just celebrated her birthday. Coleman said he and others in the community don’t believe the police narrative that they were killed while partying. Their theory is that they were sleeping when someone came in and shot seven of the eight victims in the head, one in the back. He wants whomever is responsible to be prosecuted to the fullest extend of the law, he said. The day of the shooting, the Englewood community and the family of the victims gathered on Racine Avenue and 60th Street, he said. At least 100 people released 200 pink and blue balloons. For his sister, Coleman wants a grand exit. He’s thinking a horse and carriage for her funeral. “They was all the life of the party. They wouldn’t hurt a fly,” he said. “They were the same type of people. All full of life. All loving. They all cared about their kids. “They really hit home with this. They took some good people.” pfry@chicagotribune.com Twitter @paigexfry CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune","Deon Williams looked up at the sky.

She looked at the house and said she still can’t believe the shooting was real. “This should’ve never happened to them like that,” she said. “This isn’t the house where stuff like that happens at.” “Shouldn’t have happened at all,” neighbor Michelle Bolton added. Donald Coleman, older brother of Niecy Mathis, said in a phone interview with the Tribune that his sister left behind five kids, ages 2 to 14, the oldest a girl and the rest boys. Mathis was the party girl of 12 siblings, he said, but she had always put her kids first and made sure they were set before she went out. “She was a really, really, really great mother,” he said. “She went above and beyond for her kids. She always made a way for her kids.” Mathis grew up in Englewood. She loved to travel, having gone to Miami and Houston earlier this year. She had a trip planned to Orlando, Florida, to take her kids to Disney World. She took them to Six Flags on the Friday before the shooting and then to a water park on Sunday. Coleman, 38, said he last saw her via FaceTime the day before she was killed. His other sister was doing Mathis’ hair, two big braids, and Coleman called her “ugly,” a joke he always made when she got her hair done. When he woke up Tuesday morning, his phone went off nonstop. He knew something had to be wrong. No one ever called him at 5 or 6 in the morning. He went on Facebook and saw people tagging his sister in posts about the shooting. He hopped onto the expressway and drove to the scene. He said he had to see it for himself. “At the time, you don’t want to believe it’s true. You want to believe that she made it,” he said. “That it wasn’t her. That she wasn’t one of the victims.” Police let the family members stand near the home, but they couldn’t go in. Coleman watched the detectives walk in and out as his sister, who was the “Robin” to his “Batman,” was inside. Officers asked family members what clothes their loved ones were wearing. Coleman stood outside the house and cried when he knew it was true. “First time crying in years, many years,” he said. “I cried.” Mathis and two of the others killed were really close, Coleman said. They were part of a group that called themselves the “Creep Squad” because they would stay up so late. He knew the two victims, who he said both also had kids, and one just celebrated her birthday. Coleman said he and others in the community don’t believe the police narrative that they were killed while partying. Their theory is that they were sleeping when someone came in and shot seven of the eight victims in the head, one in the back. He wants whomever is responsible to be prosecuted to the fullest extend of the law, he said. The day of the shooting, the Englewood community and the family of the victims gathered on Racine Avenue and 60th Street, he said. At least 100 people released 200 pink and blue balloons. For his sister, Coleman wants a grand exit. He’s thinking a horse and carriage for her funeral. “They was all the life of the party. They wouldn’t hurt a fly,” he said. “They were the same type of people. All full of life. All loving. They all cared about their kids. “They really hit home with this. They took some good people.” pfry@chicagotribune.com Twitter @paigexfry CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"
1964358189,2021-06-17 18:40:30,Families of Charleston shooting victims on the country's future,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/charleston-shooting-victims-families-six-years-later/,en,False,,1752,CBS News,http://www.cbsnews.com/,"Watch CBSN Live By Tori B. Powell June 17, 2021 / 6:26 PM
          / CBS News Six years ago, a White gunman opened fire in the basement of a predominantly Black church in Charleston, South Carolina, killing nine of its congregants and shaking the nation. Today, the church is still operating, providing a symbol of hope and forgiveness that the clergy, families and victims say is led by the church's rich historical legacy and faith. Established in 1816, the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, commonly referred to as Mother Emanuel, was the site of speeches by abolitionists and civil rights leaders like Booker T. Washington, Martin Luther King Jr. and Wyatt T. Walker. The church has been the subject of racist attacks throughout its history: In 1822, the church was burned down by an angry White mob; in 1832 the city outlawed the church for having an all-Black congregation. In 2015, 21-year-old Dylann Roof targeted Mother Emanuel with what investigators later said were intentions to ignite a race war. Eight people died on the scene, and a ninth died later at a local hospital. The following year, Roof was convicted on 33 federal charges. He was sentenced to nine life sentences on state murder charges and sentenced to death on federal charges. CBS contributor Antjuan Seawright spoke with families of the victims on how the massacre impacted their lives and on their outlook for the future. Reverend Eric Manning became pastor of Mother Emmanuel about a year after the mass shooting. Despite the long history of attacks on his church, he said that his congregation is still encouraged about the future. ""Even in the face of all of the political turmoil, even still in the systemic racism that we are continuing to deal with day in and day out...there is a hope,"" Manning said. ""Every morning when we wake up, it becomes a day of hope. It becomes a day of thanks-giving and it becomes a day of reflection and doing the best that we can do to bring all of God's children together."" Forgiveness has been crucial in keeping Mother Emanuel running for more than 200 years, he said. ""Forgiveness doesn't necessarily ever excuse anyone for the act that they have done,"" he said. ""You still have to have the consequences for your actions, same way as Dylann Roof. Forgiven? Yes, but he has the consequences for his actions — but what forgiveness begins to say to us is that, 'I am no longer going to allow you the power over me. I'm going to release that.'"" Manning said messages of love, grace and understanding continue to be shared within his congregation. He encourages everyone, regardless of race, to attend his church's services, and urges congregants to ""leave your party affiliation behind"" to focus on justice. ""Every day, when I come in, I'm always constantly reminded that downstairs on the lower level there was a murder that took place of nine beautiful people,"" he said. ""And every morning when I come in, I pause, and I reflect. And I do— I try to do my job, first always bringing glory to God, and then second, remembering the Emanuel Nine, remembering the survivors, and then praying that I will continue to be able to uphold their legacy, uphold their memories in a way which will continue to draw more people."" The pastor said that he doesn't believe that the country's environment has gotten better six years after the massacre. ""It has progressively gotten worse,"" Manning said, referencing police brutality incidents and mass shootings of recent years. ""I pray that it will begin to change a little bit."" South Carolina is one of three states in the country that does not have legislation to protect citizens against hate crimes. The state has also yet to close what is widely referred to as the ""Charleston Loophole,"" which allows people to purchase firearms after three days if the FBI has not yet completed a background check. Eliana Pinckney, who was 11 years old when her father, Reverend Clementa Pinckney, was murdered in the attack, said that she too is ""frustrated by the lack of change"" in the country, but added that she is ""hopeful"" for her generation as they reach voting age. ""I'm very, very excited to see the revolution that my generation is capable of,"" said Pinckney, who is now 17. The teenager said that she is proud to be regarded as a hero, along with her younger sister Malana and her mother Jennifer. On the day of the shooting, Eliana said she was home with her grandmother while her mother and Malana attended Bible study with Clementa, who was the pastor at the time. When shots rang out in the basement, Jennifer recalled grabbing her young daughter and hiding in a secretary's office, where she locked the door and hid underneath a desk. ""Bullets came flying through the office,"" Jennifer told CBS News. ""[Malana] was asking me like, is her daddy going to die and so forth."" She said that she heard what sounded like a man trying to leave near the secretary's office before Roof shot the person. Jennifer said that she heard him say that he ""had to do this."" The mother and her young daughter sat under the desk with their hands over each other's mouths until she retrieved her phone from her husband's office to call 911. ""When it was time for me to walk out there was pools of blood, ceiling, walls, floor,"" Jennifer recalled. ""It was a sight I'll never forget for the rest of my life."" Malana said that she doesn't regret going to church on that night. ""I do give my gratitude because, without this, I don't know where I would be today and I'm just really thankful for that part."" ""It's six years later and I still have my ups and downs,"" Jennifer said. ""I still can remember that day like it was yesterday. I've had to become not only just mom but dad as well and we've had our little times."" Eliana described her mother as ""the best parent of all time"" and said her dad ""is the greatest teacher"" that she has ever had. Eliana will be attending Temple University in the fall, where she said she will study musical theater and public relations. Malana will be going into the eighth grade, which she said she is ""very excited"" for. Jennifer said that her late husband would be proud of his girls if he was still alive today.

Silver, pink and white star balloons surrounded her. Behind her, a small cross, one of four, that lined the front of an Englewood home had her younger sister’s name: Shermetria Williams. “This is her favorite song!” she shouted before someone queued up “Heaven” by Beyoncé. “Say her name!” a man shouted. “Mia!” Deon Williams, saying her sister’s nickname, and other family shouted back, mixed with the names of the other three victims who were all fatally shot inside the home Tuesday morning. “Do you feel the spirit?” Deon, 49, yelled. “In your soul?” Diamond Williams, another sister of Shermetria, hugged loved ones as she cried and the balloons raised above them. “She didn’t deserve this,” Diamond said. Around 7 p.m. Wednesday, they swayed together next to small tea lights that spelled out Shermetria’s nicknames as other community members made a semicircle around them. Friends and family swapped stories of how they heard what had happened. How they used process of elimination to know which four victims went to hospitals and which four were lying dead inside the house. The others who died were 28-year-old Ratanya Aryiel Rogers, 32-year-old Denice “Niecy” Mathis and 35-year-old Blake Lee, according to the Cook County medical examiner’s office. Those who survived were a 23-year-old man, a 25-year-old woman, a 25-year-old man and a 41-year-old man. No arrests had been made as of Friday afternoon, police said. The cat of one of the injured victims ran up and down the steps of the home, unable to enter, and around the front yard. Chicago police squad cars blocked off the street and detectives walked up to pull aside some attendees. Shermetria, 19, had only started going around the house recently, her cousin said on the day of the shooting. She was younger than the others, set to graduate the day she died. She started seeing the man who lived in the apartment after she attended one of his parties.

VTA’s board on Friday approved an emergency declaration granting its general manager expanded authority to lease temporary space and start repair work at the Guadalupe Yard, the headquarters of the light rail system where a gunman opened fire early on the morning of May 26, killing nine of his colleagues before taking his own life. The three-line rail network that runs for more than 40 miles through the South Bay was shut down hours after the shooting. VTA initially replicated its train service with buses but soon stopped those to preserve coaches for regular bus routes. As a result, thousands of riders who once relied on the light rail system have had to find another way to get around. Restarting the service is a logistically and emotionally challenging task — 379 VTA employees worked at the yard, the only facility where light rail trains are stored and maintained. The shooting occurred around 6:30 a.m., the hub’s busiest time of day, sending workers running for safety or barricading themselves in offices. The sprawling complex houses the Operations Control Center that manages both VTA’s bus and light rail systems, which one official compared to an air traffic control tower for the South Bay transit network. While the authority has not yet set a date for restarting the light rail system, interim VTA General Manager Evelynn Tran said it has launched a task force to oversee the effort and hopes to have service back “in the coming weeks.” “We are appreciative of our riders’ continued patience, and we are anxious to start serving the public once again,” Tran told the board Friday. But more than three weeks after the shooting, there are still many unanswered questions about what it will take to do so. For example, will VTA’s light rail trains run again, or will the lines  be served by “bus bridges” instead? VTA spokeswoman Stacey Hendler Ross said the authority’s task force has not made any decisions on that front and “everything is on the table.” It’s also unclear what the authority plans to do with the Guadalupe Yard — if it will make significant renovations at the complex, as has been done at other mass shooting sites, and what temporary facilities VTA might build or rent to run the system in the meantime. The Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office has turned the facility back over to VTA, Hendler Ross said. In a memo to the agency’s board, VTA staff said the shooting caused “significant damage to property including equipment necessary for the operation and control of light rail.” They added that some of the victims in the shooting were gunned down just outside the Operations Control Center. Management of the VTA bus system has been moved since the shooting to a temporary facility. Meanwhile, with budget negotiations unfolding in the Legislature and California flush with a record surplus, state Sen. Dave Cortese, D-San Jose, said he is seeking funding from the state that could help VTA in its recovery effort. A spokeswoman for Cortese declined to say how much he is seeking, or how it would be used. “We are working with local community leaders and labor leaders to assess and fund immediate needs to assist workers and get trains back on the streets,” Cortese said in a statement.

The VTA board’s emergency declaration temporarily exempts the authority from the typical bidding process for contracts, which staff said would take too long as they look to restart service as soon as possible. The general manager would have the power to enter into agreements worth as much as $2 million, up from $1 million, without board approval. The action allows authority leaders to spend up to $10 million in total on the effort, though Tran indicated the still-undetermined cost would likely be lower. The powers expire after 90 days.

The annual average number of Americans who are injured or killed by gun violence is horrifying. And we’re already nearing the annual average in June. This is a national public health crisis like no other — and, worse, it’s now the leading cause of death for children and young adults. Despite this disturbing trend, federal lawmakers have failed to act. Meanwhile, among the skyrocketing numbers of victims hurt or murdered by guns are more than 5,000 children. I know the relentless agony of having a child murdered in a mass shooting; an agony that’s quickly, sickeningly, becoming common. We cannot just wait for a bipartisan legislative solution to end this epidemic. Common-sense gun laws are only one part of a holistic solution that must include community-based action. Research by the Secret Service shows that gun violence is preventable if we know the warning signs and get help. It’s more important than ever to learn these signs and take them seriously. We must look out for one another to protect our children. Mark Barden, Newtown, Conn.

The malfunction posed the biggest drama on an otherwise-mundane start to a Wednesday morning as train operators and rail controllers chatted away on two-way radios, sharing “10-20” locations and “10-4” affirmations. Punctuating the dispatch code as the sun rose, they even wished each other well. “Have a good day.” “You have a good day, too.” Moments later, the focus shifted, as the shooting began. “What we have right now is shots fired,” a rail controller broadcasted from the operations control center in the Guadalupe rail yard that functions as the headquarters of the South Bay’s light rail network. “Make sure your doors are closed.”  His voice is tense and rushed, but clear and collected. A telephone rings unanswered on the line. Voices overlap with dial tones and busy signals and snippets of confusion are heard: “Shots … I need … Oh, OK, the security guard’s down there, what …” The cacophony of voices, both male and female, are captured in more than 12 minutes of riveting dispatch recordings released late Friday by the VTA. They tell a chilling story of both rising panic and yet extraordinary calm, as a disgruntled employee killed nine co-workers and himself in a May 26 rampage. And for the first time, the audio makes clear just how crucial VTA’s employees and communications network were in responding to the Bay Area’s deadliest mass shooting. In more than eight chaotic minutes, they warned trapped co-workers to barricade themselves, stopped trains from entering the gates and tried to alert officers and each other to the mystery shooter’s movements. The audio recordings come from several sources — rail controllers on headsets in the VTA’s nerve center, train operators on their routes and mechanics and other workers with handheld radios across the rail yard. Exactly who is speaking at which point isn’t clear. Some give first names; others identify themselves with numbers.  About 100 employees were working at the railyard when the shooting broke out and about 20 trains were in service. At 6:33 a.m., one of the rail controllers called Santa Clara County’s nearby emergency dispatch center. “We have, we have shots fired in Building B at Guadalupe,” he tells a dispatcher. “OK. How many? What happened?” she responds. “Building B. Shots were fired. That’s all I have.” As word spreads in the early moments, some workers sound uncertain of the danger, bewildered that a mass shooting could be underway. “Is something going on?” one woman asks, softly. “I’m getting yells from people in Building B to call police,” a man responds. Another worker on a different channel reports: “I think one of the guys said there’s a shooter.” “That’s right,” a controller responds. “Be safe. I don’t know where you’re at, but don’t go there, near it.” A moment later, another controller is on the radio, ordering trains to remain in place, repeating: “All trains, all trains in the yard, hold your 10-20.” At one point, security camera footage also released by VTA on Friday shows workers running out of buildings and across the rail yard. One woman, still inside, sounds breathless on the radio. “Yeah, honey, what’s going on?” “Secure, whoever is with you, secure the doors.” Not once did the shooter’s name come up: Samuel Cassidy, a longtime VTA mechanic. It wasn’t clear if he too was monitoring the radio. The communications system that likely saved many VTA workers was the same one that Cassidy was admonished for abusing several months earlier. VTA documents obtained by the Bay Area News Group show he lost his temper over the radio — one of five times VTA investigated Cassidy’s conduct in recent years, including a run-in with a colleague that prompted another co-worker to reportedly say: “He scares me. If someone was to go postal, it’d be him.” What exactly set off Cassidy that morning remains unknown. He brought a black satchel to work filled with three semiautomatic handguns and numerous rounds of ammunition. He was attending a union meeting in the power department in the rail yard’s Building B with his fellow crew members and union president John Courtney when the bloodshed began. “We just heard the shots over in the power department,” someone radioed in from the other side of the building at 6:35 a.m. “And it sounded just like a gun?” the controller asked from the building next door. “Oh, it’s a gun,” he quickly confirmed. “So you’re locked down over there — and if you have any other updates, give us a call, and grab a radio just in case you need to call us,” the controller said. “How many shots were fired?” “At least 10 or 15 and people were screaming over there.” “Do you have a description?” the controller asked. “I do not,” someone else answered. “Just heard, it looks like John Courtney said shots were fired.” At that point, the voices on the radio had no idea that Cassidy had killed six members of his crew but spared Courtney, and then walked calmly across the railyard to Building A, where the controllers were trying to manage the crisis from the third floor. “Everyone is screaming and yelling and running out,” another voice can be heard to say. “Shelter in place, hide,” a controller told one train operator who had recently pulled into the yard. “Go ahead and just stay clear. We’ve got county rolling and all that good stuff. Just be safe.” “10-4, thank you.” With alerts being shared across four separate radio channels, some employees were still just learning what was happening as they arrived at the yard. “Don’t pull in there. Somebody’s shooting a gun. There’s 10 to 15 shots so just remain at a safe location,” a controller warned one employee at 6:36 a.m. “Don’t let nobody inside there. Stay on the outside.” “Is there an active shooter inside the yard?” the employee asked. “Yes.” “Then I’m coming in the yard,” the man said, his voice shaking before quickly revealing: “I’m armed.” “All right,” the controller responds. “Whatever your protocol is, do it.” It isn’t clear whether the worker was a train operator or possibly a security guard; VTA officials said later in an interview that employees are not authorized to carry guns. By then, Cassidy had made his way into Building A and was heading up the stairs. He would kill three more workers along the way, including train operator Taptej Singh in the stairwell and supervisor Paul Megia, who had ushered their co-workers to safety. About that time, at 6:37 a.m., you can hear 10 seconds of dial tone on the audiotapes — then three sets of gunshots — as Cassidy apparently made his way toward the top floor where the rail controllers were on their headsets in the Operations Control Center. “Someone’s shooting right outside the door, upstairs,” someone says. Moments later, a brigade of law enforcement officers arrived and another voice is heard. “We’re staging right here. We need eyes. He’s right outside OCC?” he asks. “That’s affirmative. Third floor, past stairwell,” another voice says. Then, sirens fill the radio as officers enter the rail yard. “You guys OK? Are you guys OK?” someone asks at 6:39 a.m. The shooter is on the third floor, someone replies, and still active. “Do you have a description?” “Negative.” Guns drawn, officers rushed up an outside stairwell and moved toward the control center, video from their body cameras showed. They found Cassidy slumped over in a chair, with his gun nearby, between the control room and VTA’s administrative offices. Through all of the horror, Abrar Ahmad, transportation superintendent of service management, said on Saturday he was proud of how the workers communicated and handled such a personal crisis. “I’m not surprised they were calm,” he said. “That’s what they do.” One of the last radio communications — 10 minutes into the chaos — was the most tragic. After all the shooting and the screaming and the calm, one voice confirmed what everyone had feared. It’s not clear from the recording exactly where the discovery was made, but it would be the first of nine. “We got one down.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters"

1966259658,2021-06-19 20:52:25,Colorado governor signs gun reform bills into law,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colorado-gun-law-cities-polis/,en,False,,1752,CBS News,http://www.cbsnews.com/,"Watch CBSN Live By Tori B. Powell June 19, 2021 / 8:52 PM
          / CBS News Colorado governor Jared Polis on Saturday signed three gun reform bills into law. The new regulations come on the heels of a mass shooting in Boulder earlier this year. Bill SB21-256 allows cities in Colorado to establish their own gun regulation, overwriting a previous state law that ""prohibits a local government from enacting an ordinance, regulation, or other law that prohibits the sale, purchase, or possession of a firearm."" While the new law gives local jurisdictions more latitude to set their own gun control regulations, it does prohibit them from enacting regulations that are ""less restrictive"" than state law. Ten days before the March mass shooting that left 10 dead, a Boulder County District Court judge blocked the city's ban on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines. The judge ruled that the 2018 law violated a previous law from 2003 that made gun regulations a state interest to prevent ""a patchwork of inconsistent local laws involving firearms."" SB21-256 now makes gun control ""a matter of state and local concern."" Polis also signed legislation which will prohibit gun dealers from transferring firearms to another person who was convicted of specified misdemeanor offenses or who hasn't had a background check successfully completed. The third bill requires the Office of Gun Violence Prevention within the Department of Health and Environment to conduct public awareness campaigns that ""educate the general public about state and federal laws and existing resources relating to gun violence prevention."" ""Recent tragedies around Colorado and the country demand quick and decisive action,"" Polis said in a statement Saturday. ""Together these measures will make our communities safer, keep firearms out of the hands of those who would do harm to themselves or others, and get those in crisis help as soon as possible."" On March 22, Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, 21, allegedly opened fire and killed 10 people in a Boulder grocery store and parking lot. A police officer was among the victims. Law enforcement said that Alissa legally purchased the semi-automatic Ruger AR-556 pistol that was used in the shooting only six days before the attack. He faces a total of 115 charges, including 47 attempted murder charges, and has a preliminary court hearing scheduled for September 7, according to CBS Denver. Boulder Mayor Sam Weaver told ""CBS This Morning"" in March that he supports a federal ban on assault rifles and that he thinks the shooting may have been avoided has one been in place. ""The availability of assault-style weapons is too high,"" he said. Colorado Senate Majority Leader Stephen Fenberg said that the newly signed legislation is a step towards creating a ""framework that, over time, will result in saving lives."" ""There's something that I think a mass shooting does to the psyche of a community collectively, even if you weren't individually involved or impacted and it really kind of disrupts the way you move through your daily life through your world,"" he said at a signing ceremony Saturday. ""Although the topic of these three bills are about pain, and loss and trauma, I'm here today grounded in hope. I'm hopeful because step by step, bill by bill, we here in Colorado are creating safer communities."" Tori B. Powell is a breaking news reporter at CBS News.

                since Months after ten people were killed in a mass shooting at a Boulder, Colorado supermarket, the state's government took swift action. Legislators have passed six gun laws since the shooting in March, with Gov. Jared Polis signing three of them into law Saturday. The recently adopted laws expand background checks for gun purchases and create an office of gun violence prevention. The third gives local jurisdictions control over gun rights by repealing an existing ban that prevented cities from passing their own gun laws and has renewed interest in Boulder for an assault weapons ban. Almost all states have similar laws, known as preemption laws, that prevent local gun laws, according to the National Rifle Association. Read more: 2 Democrats are pushing for decriminalizing possession of all drugs, including cocaine, heroin, and meth Despite the former ban, Boulder had enacted its own local ban on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines in 2018, though it had not yet been enforced. On March 12, a judge ruled the ban violated Colorado state law, citing the preemption law, and struck it down. Just 10 days later, a gunman killed 10 people at a supermarket in the city using an AR-556, an AR-15-style semi-automatic pistol, that he had purchased days prior. The gun would have been covered by the ban, according to The Denver Post, because it included guns that can use external magazines. He purchased the gun in another city, though Boulder's ban would have made it illegal for him to carry it in the city. Boulder is again looking at the ban now that the new state bill allows for cities to set their own gun laws. Mayor Sam Weaver told The Wall Street Journal he believes the new bill will negate the legal challenges to the assault weapons ban, effectively putting it into effect. He also said the city will do what it takes to make the ban enforceable. ""In theory, if we didn't have this law, you could go buy an assault weapon, and then walk across the street and shoot a bunch of students,"" Weaver told The Journal. ""So we would like to have it in place to prevent rash actions with assault weapons in Boulder."" The preemption laws gained traction in the 1980s after Democrat-led cities passed gun laws in states controlled by lawmakers who were more conservative, The Journal reported. The NRA and other gun-rights advocates have strongly supported pre-emption laws. Polis signed two additional gun bills into law earlier this year following the supermarket shooting, including regulations for gun storage and requirements for reporting stolen or missing firearms. Another bill that passed and awaits the governor's signature seeks to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. Have a news tip? Contact this reporter at kvlamis@insider.com. For you For you"

Rick Hutzell, who worked at the Annapolis paper for more than three decades, wrote a farewell column that was published on the paper’s website Saturday morning. Hutzell said he took a buyout that was offered by the newspaper’s parent company. The Capital Gazette was owned by Tribune Publishing until it was purchased last month by hedge fund Alden Global Capital. Hutzell was editor of the paper when five employees were shot to death in the newsroom in 2018. “The murder of my five friends, Rob Hiaasen, Gerald Fischman, Wendi Winters, John McNamara and Rebecca Smith, changed me,” he wrote on Saturday. “I always enjoyed the job. But I became consumed with the notion that it was my purpose to save the paper. A man with a shotgun tried to kill us — to kill me and the newspaper I’ve poured my life into for 33 years. I wasn’t going to let it die.” “Of course, it wasn’t my responsibility alone,” he continued. “Together with a group of very talented journalists and other employees in Annapolis, Baltimore and across Tribune Publishing, we kept publishing.” The paper published on schedule and won the Pulitzer citation. The man behind the attack, Jarrod Ramos, has pleaded guilty but not criminally responsible, citing insanity. A trial to determine whether he is criminally responsible is set to begin later this month. Hutzell said he’s not sure what’s next. But he said the buyout represented a chance for something new. “I came to The Capital in October 1987, and promptly told Managing Editor Tom Marquardt I planned to stay for two years and then join the Associated Press and see the world,” he wrote. “One love of my life, Chara, two kids, two houses, four dogs, two convertibles and one Pulitzer Prize later, it’s clear I had no idea what I was talking about. “I wish I could say it’s all been grand, and I’m headed off to retirement. But it hasn’t, and I’m not.” Copyright © 2021, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc. All rights reserved.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Zuhdi Jasser joins 'Life, Liberty & Levin' with analysis. Dr. Zuhdi Jasser, president of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy, warned of growing extreme sentiment on the left, as evidenced by what ""Life, Liberty & Levin"" host Mark Levin described as the ""Marxism"" of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and the physical and political ""embrace"" by President Joe Biden of Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. – the latter a member of the far-left ""Squad."" ""Look at Bernie Sanders. Nobody dares to seriously question Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders is a Marxist,"" said Levin. ""If you were to ask Black Lives Matter members or leaders if they support any politician, it would be Bernie Sanders."" Levin told Jasser that Sanders has yet to be pressed on the supporter of his who targeted Republican members of Congress at an Alexandria, Va., baseball diamond – a mass shooting that nearly killed House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana. He contrasted the relative silence in the media and those in Washington about shooter James Hodgkinson and his vocal support for Sanders with the treatment of ""every single Trump supporter as a White Supremacist"" in the time since right-wing activists broke into the U.S. Capitol and assaulted law enforcement on January 6. ""When there's violence done by Bernie Sanders supporters, the media basically squelch it … [but Attorney General Merrick Garland then] gives this outrageous speech [this week] where he draws in the media to his own employees at the Department of Justice, where I was once chief of staff,"" said Levin, who worked in that role under Attorney General Ed Meese. ""There's a lot going on in this country in terms of a movement towards tyranny that concerns me greatly. Do you agree or disagree with that?"" Jasser said such a disparate dynamic ""starts with Biden from the top."" ""He had a tarmac staged embrace of Rashida Tlaib in what he called her a fighter, called her courageous. And she is no different than [Palestinian Leader Mahmoud] Abbas's Fatah in her secularism and her embrace of Hamas."" Jasser also described fellow far-left ""Squad"" member Ilhan Omar of Minneapolis as ""basically a Hamas supporter."" ""At the end of the day, the Democratic Party is embracing them. You see now sort of an unleashing of jihadis,"" he said, pointing to Hamas' terrorism in the Middle East. On the regional level, Jasser said this emergence of extremism was evidenced earlier this month when Fairfax County, Va., school board member Abrar Omeish gave an incendiary speech to the graduates The president of the student government introduced her, noting that she campaigned for presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and that her father, Esam Omeish, was a ""leader and board member of the Dar al-Hijrah Islamic Center"" – the namesake of a mosque attended by two 9/11 hijackers in 2001, the radical imam Anwar Al-Awlaki, and Nidal Hasan -- the 2009 Fort Hood shooter. At another point in the address, Omeish, 24, told the students in Arabic to remember their ""jihad."" When asked by Levin why Democrats are embracing these types of individuals, Jasser replied that they are ideologically ""collectivist."" ""They're anti-American. They really don't appreciate or love the institutions. But in America, which is based on our founding fathers, our constitutionalism, our classic liberalism of liberty, if you will, but at the end of the day, Mark, they're afraid of them.""

He had dropped off food on his friend’s porch and was back in his car when a firefight began. When the shooting stopped, more than 200 shell casings littered an East Oakland neighborhood. Three men were wounded in the Jan. 21 shooting  — and Avalos was dead. It was the city’s first mass shooting of 2021. So far this year, Oakland has seen a dramatic rise in gun crimes, from homicides to shootings to armed robberies and carjackings. But there is another troubling trend: mass shootings — defined as single incidents with four or more gunshot victims — are up, too. The city has had six mass shootings in less than six months, the most of any California city. That’s already more than the four that occurred all of last year. The shootings happened outside a downtown club, in the front yard of a family gathering, on Lakeshore Avenue near Lake Merritt and aboard a party bus, where a group of women were celebrating a friend’s 21st birthday party. The latest came on Saturday around 6:22 p.m., when one person was killed and six others wounded on Lakeshore Avenue at Lake Merritt, where about 1,000 were gathered. These mass shootings are less publicized than massacres that occur at places of worship, movie theaters and nightclubs, and at workplaces, like the deadly VTA shooting in San Jose last month, in which an employee shot and killed nine co-workers. But they have left their own scars on Oakland residents and neighborhoods. Police arrested two men who ran from the scene of Saturday’s shooting with firearms, and are investigating whether they are connected or responsible for the shooting. Oakland police have not announced arrests in the other five mass shootings this year. “These are terrible incidents, tragic incidents,” said Oakland police Capt. Tony Jones, who runs the city’s Ceasefire program to reduce violence. “I don’t know why the public doesn’t look at it that way when it happens in Oakland. They just don’t seem to catch on with the public and the outrage you would see that occurs in other cities. I just don’t know why. We certainly feel it at OPD.” On average, Oakland experienced four mass shootings a year between 2016 and 2020, with 88 people wounded and six killed, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Though the city was the site of the Oikos University massacre in April 2012, when nursing student One L. Goh shot and killed seven people, most of the bloodshed happens on city streets. The worst year, 2016, saw 35 people wounded in seven separate shootings. That included eight injured on 14th Street near City Hall, and a 16-year-old killed and three other teenagers wounded while attending a vigil for friends who drowned in a Stanislaus County reservoir. Citywide, all gun-related crimes are up. In the first half of 2021, there have been about 330 shootings causing injuries including death, an increase of about 77% compared with this time last year. Shootings of occupied vehicles and homes increased by 79%, robberies where guns were used are up 57%, while carjackings rose a staggering 104%. Police have recovered 504 guns so far in 2021, about the same rate of seizures as last year. Most of the weapons were linked to felonies, according to police department statistics, and appear to be coming in from out of state. Oakland police officials attribute the rise in violence in part to the increase of guns on the street, where tension between gangs appearing to battle over turf came with the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Police have also seen a troubling level of gunfire at shooting sites. It is not unusual for crime scene technicians to mark 70, 80 and 90 casings fired at one scene. “When was the last time you heard of somebody at 1:30 p.m., one block away from the Oakland Police Department, getting out of a car with machine guns and shooting somebody,” Jones said, referring to a May 24 homicide on 8th Street. Oakland residents, in particular East Oakland, are hearing gunfire each night, officials have said. Shotspotter activations are up 119% over last year, with two-thirds of the 3,924 activations occurring in East Oakland. Ari Freilich, state policy director with the Giffords Law Center, said “unfortunately Oakland’s experience is consistent with many cities this year.” Crime in major cities spiked over the pandemic, along with gun sales and a proliferation of ghost guns, which can be bought online as kits and assembled at home, Freilich said. Two weeks before the deadly VTA shooting in San Jose, at least two gunmen unleashed terror on a group of women and girls on a party bus headed from San Francisco back to Oakland. The gunmen stalked the bus, first shooting at it on Interstate 580, and following it onto city streets, firing more before the wounded bus driver managed to get to the Eastmont Police Substation. Two teenage girls, 16 and 19, were killed and six other women — one who was inside a parked car — were wounded. One remains in critical condition. Police estimate the shooters fired about 70 rounds. Investigators do not believe the women were the intended targets. Before Saturday’s shooting at Lake Merritt, the most recent mass shooting occurred June 6, when five men were shot at a family gathering outside a home in the 5100 block of Ygnacio Avenue in East Oakland. On May 8, three men and a woman were wounded in a shooting in the 1400 block of Lakeshore Avenue, near Lake Merritt. Six men were wounded on Feb. 13 in Old Oakland, outside a downtown club. All of them survived. “Most times when we have a killing, the person who dies never had anything to do with it,” said Antoine Towers of the Oakland Violence Prevention Coalition. But “any kind of harm leaves a scar, even if you are not the one who got shot. Just hearing a shot” can cause trauma, he said. Avalos, a 38-year-old San Lorenzo resident, was one of those unintended victims. He came to the city’s Stonehurst neighborhood to bring food to a friend quarantined after a COVID diagnosis, authorities said. Multiple gunmen sprayed the area of 107th Avenue and Apricot Street with more than 200 bullets. Avalos was fatally wounded; three others were shot but survived. Related Articles

While the majority of victims in Oakland mass shootings survive, they carry their wounds with them, said Freilich. “These are life-altering traumatic experiences both physically and mentally,” Freilich said. “Their lives will never be the same. Many survivors will have a lifetime of medical bills and painful and just enormous trauma.” In the Avalos killing, Oakland police and Crime Stoppers of Oakland are offering a reward of up to $25,000 for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the homicide and shooting. Anyone with information is asked to call 510-238-3821. In the party bus double homicide and shooting a reward of up to $40,000 is being offered.

Two teenage girls, 16 and 19, were killed and six other women — one who was inside a parked car — were wounded. One remains in critical condition. Police estimate the shooters fired about 70 rounds. Investigators do not believe the women were the intended targets. Before Saturday’s shooting at Lake Merritt, the most recent mass shooting occurred June 6, when five men were shot at a family gathering outside a home in the 5100 block of Ygnacio Avenue in East Oakland. On May 8, three men and a woman were wounded in a shooting in the 1400 block of Lakeshore Avenue, near Lake Merritt. Six men were wounded on Feb. 13 in Old Oakland, outside a downtown club. All of them survived. “Most times when we have a killing, the person who dies never had anything to do with it,” said Antoine Towers of the Oakland Violence Prevention Coalition. But “any kind of harm leaves a scar, even if you are not the one who got shot. Just hearing a shot” can cause trauma, he said. Avalos, a 38-year-old San Lorenzo resident, was one of those unintended victims. He came to the city’s Stonehurst neighborhood to bring food to a friend quarantined after a COVID diagnosis, authorities said. Multiple gunmen sprayed the area of 107th Avenue and Apricot Street with more than 200 bullets. Avalos was fatally wounded; three others were shot but survived. Related Articles

While the majority of victims in Oakland mass shootings survive, they carry their wounds with them, said Freilich. “These are life-altering traumatic experiences both physically and mentally,” Freilich said. “Their lives will never be the same. Many survivors will have a lifetime of medical bills and painful and just enormous trauma.” In the Avalos killing, Oakland police and Crime Stoppers of Oakland are offering a reward of up to $25,000 for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the homicide and shooting. Anyone with information is asked to call 510-238-3821. In the party bus double homicide and shooting a reward of up to $40,000 is being offered. Tipsters are asked to call the California Highway Patrol tip line at 707-917-4491. In the three other Oakland mass shootings, investigators are asking individuals with information to call 510-238-3426. Get Morning Report and other email newsletters"

1966883177,2021-06-20 12:58:38,Boulder to Pursue 'Assault Weapons' Ban After State Preemption Law Repealed,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/UoAIp1RenmI/,en,False,,19334,Breitbart,http://www.breitbart.com,"Leaders in Boulder, Colorado, will seek an “assault weapons” ban for their city after Gov. Jared Polis (D) signed a repeal of the state’s preemption law. Preemption laws mandate that cities and municipalities are barred from enacting gun control which is more stringent than that at the state level. The Wall Street Journal reported that Polis signed the repeal on Saturday. Boulder enacted a ban in 2018, only to have it blocked by a County District Judge earlier this year. The judge’s ruling was in light of preemption. Boulder Mayor Sam Weaver (D) believes the “assault weapons” ban will now go into effect, but also indicated that if the “city needs to take any other steps to enforce the ban, it will do so.” California has an “assault weapons” ban, and nine people were killed in San Jose in a mass shooting on May 26, 2021. New York has an “assault weapons” ban and on May 8, 2021, the Daily Mail reported that “shooting incidents in New York City are up 83 percent from last year, and 94 percent from 2019.” Chicago sits in Cook County, which has an “assault weapons” ban. Yet the Chicago Tribune points out a total of 1,587 people were shot January 1, 2021, through June 14, 2021.

""They Are Us"" is expected to focus on Ardern's role during the mass shooting at a pair of Christchurch mosques, Al Noor and the Linwood Islamic Center. With a death toll of 51 people, it is the country’s deadliest terrorist attack. Ardern’s decisive response to the massacre was praised internationally. The film's title is taken from a line in a speech she gave in the wake of the attack, referring to the victims. Adern is set to be played by Australian actress Rose Byrne, according to Deadline. The killer, Australian white supremacist Brenton Harrison Tarrant, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in August 2020. But some members of New Zealand’s Muslim community, which is still grappling with the attack more than two years later, have expressed anger over both the film's reported narrative and its timing. The National Islamic Youth Association started an online petition, now with more than 72,000 signatures, calling on FilmNation Entertainment, the producers of the movie, to shut the project down for allegedly sidelining the victims and centering its narrative on a white woman — Ardern. Family members of the victims of the attacks and Christchurch’s mayor, Lianne Dalziel, are among those to have signed the petition. “I was shocked to read coverage of FilmNation's sense of entitlement that leads them to believe they can make this film,” Dalziel wrote in a tweet. FilmNation Entertainment did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Adibah Khan, a spokesperson for the National Islamic Youth Association, told NBC News that victims and their families had hardly been consulted and the organization was ""completely blindsided"" by news of the film. Khan added that while the association commends Ardern on her ""amazing and world-leading"" response, there are many other voices which need to be heard. ""You cannot produce a film about the response to the attacks without talking about the root cause,"" Khan said. ""We must recognize the deep-rooted prejudices and Islamophobia that are present in our society."" Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics One of the producers of the film, Philippa Campbell, has pulled out of the project and apologized for her involvement. “I now agree that the events of March 15, 2019, are too raw for film at this time and do not wish to be involved in a project that is causing such distress,” New Zealand-based producer Campbell said in a statement to public broadcaster Television New Zealand. Ardern has also criticized the project, telling TVNZ, that the project “feels very soon and very raw” for the nation. ""While there are so many stories that should be told at some point, I don't consider mine to be one of them,” she said. The Muslim Association of Canterbury, the organization that manages the Al-Noor Mosque, at first questioned whether the timing of the movie was right, in a statement to public broadcaster Radio New Zealand. However, a subsequent joint statement released the association and movie producer Ayman Jamal said they will work together to address the concerns of those affected by the attacks and consult more victims. Jamal said that while they consulted some victims' families, they ""deeply regret"" that they did not speak to all. ""We are devastated by the pain and concerns caused by the announcement of the film,"" Jamal said in the statement. ""This was never our intention and we believe we owe a clarification to those families who lost their loved ones, survivors and witnesses regarding the film, its purpose and intention.” Jamal added that they spoke with over 20 victims of the attack as well as two imams during initial consultations over a year ago. “At the time the Christchurch Muslim community was going through a lot, and we were engaging only with those families who were ready to share their story with us at that time,” he added. Weeks after the shooting, New Zealand's Parliament approved changes to its gun laws, putting in place further restrictions on gun ownership. © 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL"

It was the latest recent shooting with multiple people killed in the Bay Area. There are no agreed-upon definitions of what constitutes a mass shooting, according to a Rand Corp. analysis last month, though Congress in 2013 defined mass killing as a single incident that leaves three or more people dead. The Associated Press and other organizations have defined it as four people fatally injured, excluding the shooter. Here’s a list of other deadly Bay Area shootings with multiple victims.  May 26, 2021: VTA rail yard, San Jose 10 dead, including the gunman In the Bay Area’s deadliest shooting, a worker killed nine co-workers and then himself at the Valley Transportation Authority light rail yard near the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office in San Jose.

March 21, 2012: Oikos University, Oakland7 dead, 3 wounded One L. Goh, of Alameda, killed seven people and wounded three others in a shooting rampage at Oikos University, a small Oakland nursing college. He will spend the rest of his life in prison under a plea deal.

Goh told police he went to the Oikos campus in East Oakland that day to confront a specific administrator. Oct. 5, 2011: Lehigh Hanson’s Permanente Cement Plant, Cupertino4 dead, including the shooter, 7 wounded Shareef Allman gunned down three coworkers at a Cupertino cement plant and wounded seven other people before he was shot to death by police in a gunfight.

March 21, 2009: Oakland police shooting5 dead, including the shooter Lovelle Mixon shot to death four Oakland police officers, two during what appeared to be a routine traffic stop by motorcycle officers. The other two officers were members of a SWAT team who were killed inside an apartment where the gunman was hiding. Officers shot and killed the 27-year-old parolee.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) has given a supporter an AR-15 pistol valued at $2,860. The semi-automatic weapon features a seven-inch barrel and a ""cherry bomb muzzle brake."" Supporters could register to win the weapon by giving their name, email address, and zip code to the congresswoman's re-election campaign. On Monday, Greene posted a photo to Twitter announcing the gun had been won by a man named Marvin who was seen wearing a ""Don't blame me, I voted for Trump"" T-shirt and red, ""keep America great"" hat while holding the firearm. Here's some of what people were saying about the giveaway:                   Former President Donald Trump unexpectedly brought up salacious allegations made in the Steele dossier during a Thursday speech at a Florida retreat for GOP senators and donors. Trump brought up the infamous ""pee tape"" allegation that was included in a dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele.    I want to share a thought with you. It may sound strange. It's that the 2020 presidential election may have been the Republican Party's best and last shot of an authoritarian takeover of the country. Now that it has failed, now that a majority of the American people understands what's going on and what's at stake, everything we are seeing now, no matter how scary it is, is a slow unwinding of an all-but-spent threat. I'm getting ahead of myself, I know. We don't know what we can't know until the time has come in which knowing is possible. So I might be right about this, but I don't know if I am, because I can't know if I am until months or years from now. But there are small things suggesting to me, yeah, I could be right. What happened yesterday, for instance.              Efforts by former President Donald Trump to punish a perceived political foe were reversed by the Biden administration. ""Hours before he was scheduled to retire in 2018, Andrew G. McCabe, then the F.B.I.'s deputy director, was fired by the Justice Department, depriving him of his pension and prompting cheers from President Donald J. Trump, who had been hounding him over his role in the Russia investigation,"" The New York Times reports. ""On Thursday, the department reversed Mr. McCabe's firing, settling a lawsuit he filed asserting that he was dismissed for political reasons.""       Copyright © 2021 Raw Story Media, Inc.

1967890562,2021-06-21 16:38:44,Father of Pharrell’s cousin killed in police shooting files $50M federal lawsuit,https://nypost.com/2021/06/21/father-of-pharrells-cousin-killed-in-police-shooting-files-50m-lawsuit/,en,False,,7,New York Post,http://www.nypost.com/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. The father of Pharrell Williams’ late cousin filed a $50 million wrongful death lawsuit Monday after his son was fatally shot by police in Virginia. Wayne Lynch claimed his 25-year-old son, Donovan, was a “young, innocent, black man” who was shot “unlawfully and without warning” in March by a cop responding to a shooting that did not involve him. The suit, filed in the Eastern District of Virginia, is against the City of Virginia Beach as well as city cop Solomon Simmons III, who had not previously been identified as the shooter. The lawsuit said that the star producer’s cousin was a victim of “arbitrary, deadly violence by the police” while innocently walking to his car with friends after a night out. “Officer Simmons was on his way to respond to an incident in which Mr. Lynch was not a suspect and not involved,” the lawsuit said of a mass shooting that happened nearby. “Mr. Lynch posed no threat to Officer Simmons or anyone else,” the lawsuit said, describing the 6-foot-5, 305-pound former linebacker “a gentle giant — and a man who could not be mistaken for another.” But “Virginia Beach Police Officer Solomon D Simmons shot Mr. Lynch twice, killing him on the streets he grew up on,” the lawsuit insisted. Police at the time said Lynch was “brandishing” a gun, an allegation his family and witnesses have repeatedly denied, the Virginian-Pilot noted. The cop failed to identify himself, did not activate his body camera and shot Lynch before attempting to stop him in a “non-violent or non-lethal manner,” the lawsuit alleged. Simmons also “failed to render life-saving medical aide … after shooting him twice,” according to the suit. The grieving dad is seeking $50 million plus costs on seven counts, including wrongful death, excessive force and gross negligence. His legal team includes Alex Spiro, a high-profile attorney who has represented the likes of Jay-Z, Robert Kraft and billionaire Tesla founder Elon Musk. Pharrell — a Virginia Beach native — first shared news of his cousin’s death in a since-deleted social media post. He later spoke at Lynch’s memorial service in April and has called for a federal probe. City spokeswoman Julie Hill told The Virginian-Pilot Monday that the city had not received service of the lawsuit and could not comment. “Once we receive and digest it, we will respond to it accordingly,” she said. Simmons did not return the paper’s calls for comment. Share Selection"

The man who was killed was a 22-year-old resident of San Francisco, Armstrong said, though his identity was not released publicly. “We don’t believe that this was a random shooting,” Armstrong said. “We believe that this was directly related to group and gang violence … related to the city of San Francisco.” Related Articles

Police have not yet definitively identified the people responsible for the shooting, which took place around 6:22 p.m. in the 2200 block of Lakeshore Avenue. Authorities are working with San Francisco police’s gang units to investigate the case, police officials said. “There seems to be some group or gang feud going on, and it appears they may have met or encountered each other during the festivities at the lake,” Oakland police Lt. Leo Sanchez said. “We have no evidence yet … that there’s any Oakland gang ties involved in this, in the actual shooting,” Sanchez said. Two men who were seen running from the area while carrying firearms were arrested on the night of the shooting, but police said Monday they do not appear to be associated with the shooting.

Police officials said that they believed some, but not all, of those struck by gunfire were intended targets of the violence. “I think some of the individuals that were shot and injured, to include the individual that unfortunately passed away, I believe were targeted individuals,” Sanchez said. “There were individuals also that were just part of the festivities, part of the gathering, and were caught up in the crossfire,” he said. Police said those wounded range in age from 16 to their mid-60s. Four of them are males, and three are females.  Several of them were still hospitalized in stable condition as of Monday. Police estimated Monday that there were roughly 10,000 people around Lake Merritt as a whole Saturday. Multiple events were being held, including at Lake Merritt Amphitheater, where hundreds of people gathered throughout the day to commemorate June 19, 1865, when the last enslaved people in Texas finally learned that President Lincoln had signed the Emancipation Proclamation two years earlier. Police said about 5,000 people were in the area of the shooting when it occurred. Rev. Damita Davis-Howard, director of Oakland’s Ceasefire program, said the shooting was a “tragedy.” She added that it hit even harder that it occurred during such a historically and culturally significant date. “We should have a safe space to celebrate culturally, everybody. No matter whether you’re celebrating Pride month, or Juneteenth, you want to feel safe in your community. The lake was that safe space,” Davis-Howard said Monday. “This is something that is very, very real and deep felt to many African Americans who live here in Oakland, who live in California, who live across this nation … so to have gun violence interrupt that kind of life and living, is just unacceptable. “I’m near tears to think that we could not successfully celebrate something that means so much to so many people,” she added. Oakland has seen six mass shootings so far this year — defined as single incidents with four or more gunshot victims — the most of any California city, and already more than the four that occurred all of last year. Shootings overall are increasing in Oakland this year, as well, consistent with many major cities that have seen spikes in crimes over the course of the pandemic. There have been about 330 shootings in Oakland causing injuries including death, an increase of about 77% compared with this time last year. Though Armstrong noted there were upwards of 60 police officers around the Lake Merritt area Saturday before the shooting, he said police can’t prevent people from using guns. “The community has to come together to deter people from participating in this activity,” he said. “Oakland is not OK with that, this entire city is not OK with this level of violence.” Todd Walker, a funeral attendant and Oakland community activist, said he didn’t doubt the chief’s sincerity, but felt there’s not enough focus on reducing gun violence in general, and getting guns off the street. “There are shootings everyday,” he said. “They never talk about it, at least in the flatlands. This (shooting) was by Lake Merritt, that’s the reason this is so big now.” “You can hear 100 rounds being fired. Where the police at?

But Superintendent David Brown would not elaborate on why such a drastic step was taken against Enrique Badillo Sr. for his ownership of a building. He said there were “multiple reasons” the discipline, which he linked to the fatal shooting. Badillo has an unlisted phone number and could not be reached for comment. Police said Monday that the investigation was continuing but that no arrests have been made. They have said they believe someone broke into the house and shot eight people; four of them died at the scene and a fifth died on Saturday. All the people who died had been shot in the head. Even before the mass shooting prompted the department to strip Badillo of his police powers, there were questions about the building and his ownership of it. Police had responded to numerous calls about disturbances at the residence, Brown said at a news conference last week. In November 2019, police responding to a call of a person shot at the residence found a man had been injured by gunfire.         The Chicago Sun-Times reported that officers found shell casings and dice on the floor, and a witness told officers that there were at least 50 people in a party where people were drinking and playing dice when shots rang out. That shooting prompted an inspection by the city’s building department that revealed a number of building code violations and the city filed a “public nuisance” lawsuit. But the lawsuit stalled because city officials were unable to reach the building's owner until after last Tuesday's shooting. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

This (shooting) was by Lake Merritt, that’s the reason this is so big now.” “You can hear 100 rounds being fired. Where the police at? If you can unload a 100-round clip before the police come and get away, it don’t make no sense.” Staff writer David DeBolt contributed to this story. Get Morning Report and other email newsletters"

The department’s new policy envisions resuming the coverage of sex reassignment surgeries for veterans. It will help overcome a “dark history” of discrimination, McDonough said Saturday at a Pride Month event in Orlando, according to The Washington Post. NEW: The Department of Veteran Affairs is beginning the process of offering gender confirmation surgeries through its health care system, Veteran Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough announced during a Pride event in Florida today.https://t.co/I2tc54s3bx — Axios (@axios) June 19, 2021  The announcement of the two-year plan follows President Joe Biden’s Jan. 25 executive order that both revoked former President Donald Trump’s ban on recruitment of transgender people into the military, and reversed a 2013 regulation that prohibited the VA department from funding or performing sex reassignment surgeries. “This time [two years] will allow VA to develop capacity to meet the surgical needs that transgender veterans have called for and deserved for a long time, and I am proud to begin the process of delivering it,” McDonough said, according to The Washington Post. “We’re making these changes not only because they are the right thing to do but because they can save lives,” the VA secretary stated at the event marking the fifth anniversary of a mass shooting at a gay nightclub that resulted in 49 deaths. (RELATED: Pentagon Set To Roll Out Policy That Provides The Military With Access To Gender Transition Treatments) The National Center for Transgender Equality estimated that there were about 134,000 transgender veterans, only 4,000 of whom are interested in undergoing a sex reassignment surgery, according to The Washington Post. The Department of Defense previously claimed it spent $8 million on transgender care from 2016 to 2019.  The annual health care budget for the military is more than $50 billion, according to The Associated Press.

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: ARVADA, Colo. — A gunman is believed to have shot and killed an officer and another person in a shopping district in a Denver suburb Monday before being fatally shot by police, authorities said. An officer responded to a call at 1:15 p.m. about a suspicious incident near the library in the city of Arvada, and about 15 minutes later, a 911 call came in about shots fired and the officer hit, Deputy Chief Ed Brady said at a news conference. The officer who was killed has been identified as Gordon Beesley, a 19-year Arvada department veteran, police said later Monday, according to The Denver Post. Another person believed to have been shot by the gunman was taken to a hospital and died, police said. The attacker also was shot and killed. Authorities didn’t immediately describe the circumstances of the shooting but said no one else is believed to have been involved. Earlier, police said there were two suspects. The shooting occurred in Olde Town Arvada, the city’s downtown district with shops, restaurants, breweries and other businesses. It’s listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is about 7 miles (10 kilometers) northwest of downtown Denver. It comes three months after a gunman opened fire and killed 10 people, including a police officer, at a supermarket in Boulder, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northwest of Arvada. The Arvada officer’s death, just the third in Police Department history, was especially painful after the mass shooting in nearby Boulder, Arvada Mayor Marc Williams said. Arvada police helped respond and investigate that attack, he said. “This is by far the saddest day for our Police Department,” Williams said. The mayor said he was in his car in the area shortly before 2 p.m. “when literally I saw 11 police cars with their flashing lights and sirens on race past me. I knew something serious had happened. I didn’t know how serious.” Arvada resident Brady Turner said he was pulling into the Army and Navy store in the area when he noticed police cars driving in behind him and a person on a stretcher being put into an ambulance in between the parking lot and the store. He said he took off in his car. “I just got out of there,” Turner said. About five minutes later, he heard gunshots near the library about a block away. Arvada closed its City Hall and canceled a City Council meeting to provide resources to investigators and other first responders. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis issued a statement expressing his condolences to the officer’s family and friends, while the Colorado State Patrol tweeted: “All our love to the @ArvadaPolice and the family, blood and blue, of their fallen officer. We stand with you.” Police vehicles drove behind a hearse carrying the body of the slain officer to the Jefferson County coroner’s office, and some residents lined a street with flags to watch the procession. John Garrod of Arvada held a black and white flag with blue stripes at the beginning of a line of about 30 police cars before the procession, a flag he hangs outside his house whenever an officer is killed. His son, brother-in-law and nephew are all in law enforcement, he said. “It breaks my heart whenever this happens but especially when it happens so close to home,” Garrod said. “These are the same officers I wave to when I am walking my dog.”Related Articles

We've received your submission. A veteran Colorado police officer was killed along with an innocent bystander during a confrontation with a gunman in the Denver suburb of Arvada on Monday, police said. The alleged gunman was also killed by police after the initial deadly clash. The names of the people involved weren’t released at a press briefing by the Arvada Police Department late Monday afternoon. The unnamed officer responded to a call at about 1:15 p.m. of a “suspicious incident” near the library in the Olde Town neighborhood of Arvada, Deputy Police Chief Ed Brady told reporters. Fifteen minutes later, 911 calls came in reporting gunshots and officer down, Brady said. Police issued a shelter-in-place order and extensively searched a Ford pickup truck apparently looking for explosives, according to CBS 4 Denver. Brady said the second person appeared to be a victim but the investigation is ongoing. “At this time, we believe this person was shot and killed by the gunman,” he said at the briefing. “We are working to identify this individual and we will release more information, the coroner’s office will release more information, as they get it.” “One suspect has also been shot and killed and his identity will be released by the coroner’s office,” he said. “There is no threat to the public at this point. We are not searching for anyone else. The shelter-in-place has been lifted.” The officer is the first member of the Arvada department who was shot and killed in the line of duty in the department’s history, Denver 7 said. Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D) tweeted out that he was monitoring the situation. “I’m devastated to learn of the loss of one of Arvada’s police officers,” Perlmutter said. “Thank you to the first responders at the scene who are working to keep our community safe.” The shooting follows a mass shooting in March that killed 10 people at King Soopers supermarket in Boulder – about 20 miles from Arvada.

                    Vignesh Ramachandran Lakhwant Singh was working in his suburban Denver liquor store in April 2020 when a man walked in, assaulted him, damaged products, shouted profanity and yelled “go back to your country.” Singh, who is Sikh and wears a turban, followed the man outside to take a photo of his license plate so he could report the incident. The man then rammed his car into Singh, injuring his arms, legs and head, and breaking his pelvis, which required surgery. According to law enforcement, the suspect, a white man, targeted Singh because he believed he was an “Arab.” Almost three months after the attack and following pressure from the Sikh community and other civil rights advocates, the Jefferson County District Attorney’s office in Colorado brought several charges against the suspect, including those for a bias-motivated crime. The case remains pending while authorities determine the suspect’s mental competence. Singh’s experience was another example of the gaps in the way hate crimes are recorded and reported — for several communities, but especially Sikhs, who are often misunderstood by the public and law enforcement because of their unique religious traditions, like covering their hair with turbans. They are among several groups for which hate crime data may be failing to reveal the scale of the problem. Several high-profile incidents against Sikhs have included discussion of hate crime as motivation. In April, a shooter killed eight people, including four Sikhs, in a mass shooting at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis; while the motive is still under investigation, Indianapolis police said the perpetrator visited white supremacist websites before the attack. Eight years earlier, another white supremacist killed six people at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. Just days after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, a gunman fatally shot a Sikh owner of an Arizona gas station. But many others fall through the cracks. Crime data collection by the government and law enforcement is a fragmented, often voluntary and messy process, likely hiding the true scale of how bias-motivated crimes are affecting communities of color and faith, experts say. As hate crimes against East and Southeast Asians, in particular, have surged since the pandemic’s start, advocates have called on the government for more and better data collection. In 2019, the most recent year the FBI has released national statistics, local law enforcement agencies reported 7,314 hate crime incidents around the country. But more than half of hate crime victimizations generally go unreported to law enforcement, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Groups outside government, like Stop AAPI Hate, have recorded much higher numbers — 6,600 reports of hate crimes against the Asian American community since March 2020, bringing a larger scale of violence and harassment to the attention of lawmakers, the media and the public. The quality of data collected by the government could change under the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act and Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act that Congress passed on May 18 and President Joe Biden signed into law two days later. The new legislation acknowledges that “a complete understanding of the national problem posed by hate crimes is hindered by incomplete data from Federal, State, and local jurisdictions” through the FBI’s existing Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. The legislation is intended to help modernize the federal hate crime reporting system and will provide grants to local law enforcement departments to help better train them to report hate crime data. WATCH: In rare moment of bipartisanship, Congress passes COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act Kevin Grisham, who studies hate crimes at California State University, San Bernardino’s Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, said there has been a consistent discrepancy between the FBI data and what Asian Americans actually experience. Grisham said sometimes incidents against Sikhs are misidentified by law enforcement who might record a crime as bias against another religion other than Sikhism. “That skews the data and really hurts policy decision makers,” Grisham said. For years, the Sikh community, including the advocacy group the Sikh Coalition, pushed authorities to recognize anti-Sikh hate crimes, and the FBI agreed to start doing so in 2015. Since then, the department has tracked 142 anti-Sikh incidents as part of the annual UCR program, which aggregates numbers from law enforcement agencies across the country. There are an estimated 500,000 Sikhs living in America. The FBI acknowledged in a statement to the PBS NewsHour that before it added an anti-Sikh category, these crimes were categorized under a more general “other” category within religious bias. “Disaggregating this data has allowed the FBI UCR Program to provide more specific religion bias data to the nation,” the FBI said. “The addition of the anti-Sikh category has led to more accurate statistics and understanding of the threat which lends itself to a more targeted and effective mitigative effort.” Anti-Arab hate crimes — tracked under category “Code 31” — were also excluded from federal statistics until 2015. “Just as Bias Motivation Code 31 (Anti-Arab) was rendered invalid in federal data collections, so too were anti-Arab hate crime victims rendered invisible in official statistics,” the Arab American Institute said in a report about this issue. Maya Berry, the institute’s executive director, says hate crimes can be misclassified into the wrong bias category when law enforcement aren’t appropriately trained or from mistakes made in data entry. “We know there’s a massive underreporting problem,” Berry said. “Communities have to understand what is happening in order to respond to this crisis of hate in this country, and part of that is understanding victims targeted.” Collection of the UCR data — the largest federal government-led effort around hate crime data — is largely voluntary. Local law enforcement agencies choose whether to participate, which makes the national data unreliable and incomplete. Alabama agencies reported zero hate crimes to the FBI in 2019, but that is based on the two agencies out of hundreds of agencies in the state that reported data to the FBI. Grisham said the incomplete data means that communities can ignore issues related to hate and bias. “If you don’t know what’s going on within communities, you can’t figure out how to address them,” Grisham said. “If the public was more aware of what was really going on, there would be more of a call for action.” The largest concentrations of Sikh communities in the U.S. are on the two coasts — especially in California, New York and New Jersey, according to the Sikh Coalition. There are more than 40,000 Sikh Americans in and around Fresno, California. The city’s police department said it does share its data with the FBI’s UCR program, but they have no recorded anti-Sikh incidents in 2020 or from January through April of 2021. “For the police department, data is important no matter what you’re tracking — hate incidents, property crimes,” said Lt. Rob Beckwith with the Fresno Police Department. “Data really helps us decide how we’re going to deploy resources to the right areas.” While the processes vary from agency to agency, some of the nation’s most-resourced police agencies have more comprehensive programs around hate crimes. The New York City Police Department, the largest law enforcement agency in the country, regularly publishes hate crime statistics online and has documented protocol on what officers should do when encountering bias-motivated incidents. The Los Angeles Police Department has assigned hate crime investigators to 21 stations across the city, who help oversee its investigations. And the Chicago Police Department publishes the UCR data they send the FBI on a publicly accessible dashboard. Even when hate crime data is collected, community advocates say it’s not doing much beyond sharing the scale of the problem. Rupinder Singh, the Sikh American blogger behind American Turban, says law enforcement agencies and policymakers have not made clear what they envision doing or changing because of the data. Singh also believes the burden needs to be put on the perpetrators of the crimes, rather than the victims. “We’re not talking about what’s causing the fire. We’re talking about what’s burning,” Singh said. “We should really be looking at the source: Who’s perpetrating it? Why? How are they coming to perpetrate these actions? And how do we deconstruct that? How do we address that? We’re not having that conversation.” Prosecuting hate crimes can be a complicated process, and the threshold for even proving a crime was bias-motivated can be challenging in the United States’ legal system. The prosecution has to prove that the defendant’s state of mind was hate-motivated, which can require extensive and time-consuming collection of evidence, said Arusha Gordon, associate director of the James Byrd Jr. Center to Stop Hate at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. While sometimes the bigotry is obvious, like a perpetrator who has published an online manifesto that shows intention, often the evidence is murkier and law enforcement has to dig into the weeds. WATCH: Sikhs reflect on targeted attacks after FedEx shooting In California, for example, just 59 cases in 2015 resulted in hate crime convictions in a year in which there were 837 reported hate crime incidents, 189 of which were prosecuted as hate crime cases. Gordon said the process often breaks down in the beginning after a hate crime occurs. “I do think there is a large number of hate crimes which simply don’t get reported to law enforcement, because law enforcement doesn’t have the trust of the targeted communities,” Gordon said. Gordon said she applauds the jurisdictions that build trust and combat hate, but many avoid it because they don’t want their jurisdiction to be associated with hate crimes. “As a result of inadequate law enforcement responses to hate and white supremacist activity, the perpetrators and the groups committing these violent acts are only emboldened to escalate their campaign of hate against minority communities,” said Sim J. Singh, senior manager of policy and advocacy for the Sikh Coalition. “They think that they can get away with it.” He believes having better data will help identify the prevention strategies required to keep communities safe. “The data collection shows essentially the tip of the iceberg when it comes to hate crimes,” Singh said. “In order to develop effective policy solutions to combat hate, policymakers first have to understand the scope of the problem.” Left:

Benitez's decision to overturn California's ban on assault weapons. On June 4, Benitez declared that the state's 30-year ban on assault weapons was unconstitutional and ""has had no effect"" on stopping mass shootings. He also compared the AR-15 semiautomatic rifle to a Swiss Army knife, calling it ""good for both home and battle."" His decision was quickly condemned by state officials, victims of gun violence, and gun control advocates. Benitez, who was nominated by former President George W. Bush, gave the state 30 days to appeal. On Jun 10, California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed an appeal. After the 9th Circuit put the hold on Benitez's decision, Bonta tweeted, ""This leaves our assault weapons laws in effect while appellate proceedings continue. We won't stop defending these life-saving laws."" The case is expected to make it to the Supreme Court.

Police in South Florida on Monday released frantic 911 calls from the May 30 mass shooting at the banquet hall in Miami-Dade County that resulted in three deaths and 20 injuries. The Miami Herald reported that the calls included one from a woman who told operators that she was shot and could feel herself dying. ""I’m lying here dying,"" she said, according to the paper. ""Oh my God, I feel myself…ma’am please help me."" The paper said the woman drifted off and the operator urged her to respond. Four minutes passed and the paper said an individual—apparently a paramedic—could be heard addressing a woman who said she was shot in the arm. The Herald said it was uncle if the woman who made the call survived. The gunfire erupted on May 30 at the El Mula Banquet Hall in northwest Miami-Dade County. The banquet hall had been rented out for a concert. Three people got out of an SUV and opened fire into a crowd outside with assault rifles and handguns, police director Alfredo ""Freddy"" Ramirez III said.

1968376218,2021-06-22 04:57:49,Police officer among 3 dead in Denver-area shooting,https://www.aol.com/news/1-officer-hurt-shooting-denver-203902082-085749329.html,en,True,"police,murders and attempted murders",150985,AOL News,http://news.aol.com/," ARVADA, Colo. (AP) — A gunman is believed to have shot and killed an officer and another person in a shopping district in a Denver suburb Monday before being fatally shot by police, authorities said. An officer responded to a call at 1:15 p.m. about a suspicious incident near the library in the city of Arvada, and about 15 minutes later, a 911 call came in about shots fired and the officer hit, Deputy Chief Ed Brady said at a news conference. The officer who was killed has been identified as Gordon Beesley, a 19-year Arvada department veteran, police said later Monday, according to The Denver Post. Another person believed to have been shot by the gunman was taken to a hospital and died, police said. The attacker also was shot and killed. Authorities didn't immediately describe the circumstances of the shooting but said no one else is believed to have been involved. Earlier, police said there were two suspects. The shooting occurred in Olde Town Arvada, the city’s downtown district with shops, restaurants, breweries and other businesses. It’s listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is about 7 miles (10 kilometers) northwest of downtown Denver. It comes three months after a gunman opened fire and killed 10 people, including a police officer, at a supermarket in Boulder, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northwest of Arvada. The Arvada officer’s death, just the third in Police Department history, was especially painful after the mass shooting in nearby Boulder, Arvada Mayor Marc Williams said. Arvada police helped respond and investigate that attack, he said. “This is by far the saddest day for our Police Department,” Williams said. The mayor said he was in his car in the area shortly before 2 p.m. “when literally I saw 11 police cars with their flashing lights and sirens on race past me. I knew something serious had happened. I didn’t know how serious.” Arvada resident Brady Turner said he was pulling into the Army and Navy store in the area when he noticed police cars driving in behind him and a person on a stretcher being put into an ambulance in between the parking lot and the store. He said he took off in his car. “I just got out of there,” Turner said. About five minutes later, he heard gunshots near the library about a block away. Arvada closed its City Hall and canceled a City Council meeting to provide resources to investigators and other first responders. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis issued a statement expressing his condolences to the officer’s family and friends, while the Colorado State Patrol tweeted: “All our love to the @ArvadaPolice and the family, blood and blue, of their fallen officer. We stand with you.” Police vehicles drove behind a hearse carrying the body of the slain officer to the Jefferson County coroner's office, and some residents lined a street with flags to watch the procession. John Garrod of Arvada held a black and white flag with blue stripes at the beginning of a line of about 30 police cars before the procession, a flag he hangs outside his house whenever an officer is killed. His son, brother-in-law and nephew are all in law enforcement, he said. “It breaks my heart whenever this happens but especially when it happens so close to home,"" Garrod said. “These are the same officers I wave to when I am walking my dog.""

1968438638,2021-06-22 06:00:02,A mass shooting prompted a California mayor to take action. He couldn’t stop another one,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/22/san-jose-mass-shooting-gun-control-legislation-california,en,False,"gun control,firearms",1751,Guardian US,https://www.theguardian.com/us,"Two years ago legislation was introduced to require gun insurance. It’s facing a legal minefield Last modified on Wed 23 Jun 2021 16.26 BST On 28 July 2019, a gunman opened fire on a crowd at the Gilroy garlic festival, killing six-year-old Stephen Romero, 13-year-old Keyla Salazar and 25-year-old Trevor Irby, and injuring 17 others. The mass shooting sent shock waves through the community, located 30 miles south of San Jose in California’s Bay Area, as it elicited all-too-familiar calls from elected officials that “thoughts and prayers” were no longer a sufficient response.  Among them was San Jose’s mayor Sam Liccardo, who two weeks later unveiled a first-of-its-kind proposal that would require gun owners in the US’ 10th largest city to buy liability insurance for their weapons. Those that didn’t buy the insurance would be required to pay a fee to cover the cost of gun violence in the city. But in the 22 months following the announcement, the initiative failed to make it in front of the San Jose city council. Then, another mass shooting rattled San Jose. On the morning of 26 May, a 57-year-old Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority maintenance worker shot and killed nine of his co-workers at the transit agency’s rail yard in San Jose before killing himself. In the weeks following, Liccardo lurched back into action, reannouncing his gun insurance proposal with the addition that paying a fee would be required by all gun owners – regardless of whether or not they purchased insurance. The city council passed a law first proposed by the mayor in February 2019 that mandates gun stores to record the sale of weapons and ammunition. The road to passing meaningful gun legislation in San Jose has been a long one. Liccardo, for his part, blames the delays on the pandemic as the health experts who were supposed to study the costs of gun violence became overwhelmed as the coronavirus spread through the Bay Area. And he pointed at the legal minefield the city’s team of attorneys has had to navigate as they determined how to enact a gun insurance mandate no city in the country had tried before. But the drawn-out process in San Jose points to a broader trend – the extreme difficulty in enacting comprehensive gun legislation in the United States – even after mass shootings. “When episodes of mass shootings happened in New Zealand or Australia or the UK, those governments took the responsibility to say, ‘We’re going to take measures that will reduce gun violence significantly in our community.’” Liccardo said. “The result was a dramatic reduction in gun harm. It should not surprise anyone that in a country where we seemingly lack the will to do much of anything substantial to really reduce gun violence in our country, that it takes a horrible tragedy.” Faced with Republican opposition, gun control legislation has historically failed in the US Congress, even following mass shootings, said Christopher Poliquin, an assistant professor of strategy at UCLA’s Anderson School of Management. Instead, most gun policy – whether that be the loosening or tightening of restrictions – has been enacted by state legislatures. Most initiatives on gun restrictions follow mass shootings, Poliquin added, despite the prevalence of everyday community gun violence in the country. Overall, mass shootings made up just 0.2% of all gun deaths in the US in 2019, yet high-profile attacks tend to have the most impact on policymakers, Poliquin said. Liccardo likens his gun insurance mandate to other “harm reduction strategies” that have helped decrease smoking and injuries and deaths from car collisions. The insurance would cover accidental discharges and intentional acts by someone who borrowed, stole or otherwise acquired a gun. It would not, however, cover costs associated with “intentional acts” of gun violence by the gun owner. City officials have yet to determine how much the fee to help cover the cost of gun violence in San Jose will be, but the money will pay for police and other emergency services strained by gun-related injuries and deaths. In California, gun violence costs the state approximately $22.6bn each year, with $1.2bn falling on the shoulders of taxpayers. If San Jose passes Liccardo’s gun insurance proposal, the policy could have ripple effects on other cities across California, as other mayors have already expressed interest in enacting similar legislation. But first, it’ll have to withstand legal scrutiny as second amendment groups prepare to sue San Jose. Sam Paredes, the executive director of Gun Owners of California, expects “the mayor will have his rear end handed to him in a basket by the courts”. “They’re allowed to exercise an enumerated right in the constitution,” Paredes said of gun owners. “You can’t force an insurance policy against an enumerated right.” The threat of legal action is a part of the terrain of gun control in the US, and in most states, local lawmaker’s hands are tied on the issue due to preemption laws. These laws prevent local governments from regulating guns in certain areas, such as licensing or permitting. California is just one of two states with limited firearm preemption laws, and five states have no preemption law at all. “The gun lobby has spent decades working to make it so that local jurisdictions don’t have the freedom to govern on this issue, and take the steps they feel are necessary to protect their communities,” said Allison Anderman, senior counsel at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. “This is obviously so that newer cities or more liberal cities in more conservative states aren’t going to do what the state legislature won’t do and limit gun access, because that’s not good for gun industry profits.” Even if the gun insurance proposal overcomes the legal test, Liccardo himself recognizes that it is unlikely to stop a mass shooting from happening again in San Jose. Instead, he says it will enable the city to identify “high-risk” gun owners. If any officer responding to a domestic violence call in the home finds that there is a gun without insurance, “it provides an opportunity for the officer to seize the gun on site”, Liccardo says. “That’s actually really important because that’s a particular context where we know gun possession is highly correlated to gun violence,” he added. Anderman, who has been working with Liccardo’s office on the gun insurance policy, agrees that “the scope of harm that it could ameliorate is fairly narrow”. However, it will provide victims of gun violence with the monetary compensation they may not otherwise receive. Next month marks the two-year anniversary of the Gilroy garlic festival shooting, and the families of those killed are still grappling with the trauma of that day. Katiuska Pimentel Vargas remembers her niece, Keyla, as resilient, sweet and generous. Before the gunman cut her life short, the 13-year-old saved up her birthday money to buy her friends ice-cream from the paleteros when their parents were short on cash. She loved art and animals, including her beloved guinea pig, Albert. It was “disappointing” to see San Jose wait this long to take action, Vargas said. Still, she wants others to know that there are people behind the numbers, that Keyla isn’t just a number, but one of more than 14,000 who died from gun violence in 2019. “We just want people to remember what happened so we don’t forget the pain that families continue to go through,” Vargas said. “I don’t want another family to live through what we have been through.”","Two years ago legislation was introduced to require gun insurance.

It should not surprise anyone that in a country where we seemingly lack the will to do much of anything substantial to really reduce gun violence in our country, that it takes a horrible tragedy.” Faced with Republican opposition, gun control legislation has historically failed in the US Congress, even following mass shootings, said Christopher Poliquin, an assistant professor of strategy at UCLA’s Anderson School of Management. Instead, most gun policy – whether that be the loosening or tightening of restrictions – has been enacted by state legislatures. Most initiatives on gun restrictions follow mass shootings, Poliquin added, despite the prevalence of everyday community gun violence in the country. Overall, mass shootings made up just 0.2% of all gun deaths in the US in 2019, yet high-profile attacks tend to have the most impact on policymakers, Poliquin said. Liccardo likens his gun insurance mandate to other “harm reduction strategies” that have helped decrease smoking and injuries and deaths from car collisions. The insurance would cover accidental discharges and intentional acts by someone who borrowed, stole or otherwise acquired a gun. It would not, however, cover costs associated with “intentional acts” of gun violence by the gun owner. City officials have yet to determine how much the fee to help cover the cost of gun violence in San Jose will be, but the money will pay for police and other emergency services strained by gun-related injuries and deaths. In California, gun violence costs the state approximately $22.6bn each year, with $1.2bn falling on the shoulders of taxpayers. If San Jose passes Liccardo’s gun insurance proposal, the policy could have ripple effects on other cities across California, as other mayors have already expressed interest in enacting similar legislation. But first, it’ll have to withstand legal scrutiny as second amendment groups prepare to sue San Jose. Sam Paredes, the executive director of Gun Owners of California, expects “the mayor will have his rear end handed to him in a basket by the courts”. “They’re allowed to exercise an enumerated right in the constitution,” Paredes said of gun owners. “You can’t force an insurance policy against an enumerated right.” The threat of legal action is a part of the terrain of gun control in the US, and in most states, local lawmaker’s hands are tied on the issue due to preemption laws. These laws prevent local governments from regulating guns in certain areas, such as licensing or permitting. California is just one of two states with limited firearm preemption laws, and five states have no preemption law at all. “The gun lobby has spent decades working to make it so that local jurisdictions don’t have the freedom to govern on this issue, and take the steps they feel are necessary to protect their communities,” said Allison Anderman, senior counsel at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. “This is obviously so that newer cities or more liberal cities in more conservative states aren’t going to do what the state legislature won’t do and limit gun access, because that’s not good for gun industry profits.” Even if the gun insurance proposal overcomes the legal test, Liccardo himself recognizes that it is unlikely to stop a mass shooting from happening again in San Jose. Instead, he says it will enable the city to identify “high-risk” gun owners. If any officer responding to a domestic violence call in the home finds that there is a gun without insurance, “it provides an opportunity for the officer to seize the gun on site”, Liccardo says. “That’s actually really important because that’s a particular context where we know gun possession is highly correlated to gun violence,” he added. Anderman, who has been working with Liccardo’s office on the gun insurance policy, agrees that “the scope of harm that it could ameliorate is fairly narrow”. However, it will provide victims of gun violence with the monetary compensation they may not otherwise receive. Next month marks the two-year anniversary of the Gilroy garlic festival shooting, and the families of those killed are still grappling with the trauma of that day. Katiuska Pimentel Vargas remembers her niece, Keyla, as resilient, sweet and generous. Before the gunman cut her life short, the 13-year-old saved up her birthday money to buy her friends ice-cream from the paleteros when their parents were short on cash. She loved art and animals, including her beloved guinea pig, Albert. It was “disappointing” to see San Jose wait this long to take action, Vargas said. Still, she wants others to know that there are people behind the numbers, that Keyla isn’t just a number, but one of more than 14,000 who died from gun violence in 2019. “We just want people to remember what happened so we don’t forget the pain that families continue to go through,” Vargas said. “I don’t want another family to live through what we have been through.”"

Addressing a news conference, Ed Brady, the deputy chief of the Arvada Police Department, said that police responded to a call about “a suspicious incident” near the Arvada library at 1.15 p.m. Fifteen minutes later, a 911 call informed that a police officer was hit as shots were fired in the area, he said. The slain officer was identified as Gordon Beesley, a 19-year veteran police officer, police were cited as saying by The Denver Post. The gunman, who fatally shot the police officer, was killed by police and another person, who was believed to have been shot by the attacker, was taken to a hospital where he died, AP reported. The shooting occurred in the busy shopping district of Olde Town Arvada, a town that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, just seven miles northwest of downtown Denver, the report said. No other details describing the circumstances of the shooting were immediately available. Reacting to the incident, Mayor Marc Williams called it “by far the saddest day for our police department,” USA Today reported. He said that the police officer’s death, just the third in police department history, was “especially painful” after the Boulder mass shooting. In a tweet, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis extended his condolences to the fallen police officer’s family and friends following a similar tweet from the Colorado State Patrol, citing their appreciation to their deceased colleague.   Arvada closed its city hall and canceled a city council meeting in order to allow officers to conduct a thorough investigation in the area. Police officers from nearby communities and residents lined the streets as a show of support and respect as the hearse drove the Arvada police officer's body to the coroner’s office, a video cited by Denver7 showed. Last month, six people were killed in a mass shooting at a birthday party in Colorado Springs, just 80 miles south of the city. According to an earlier USA Today report, Colorado places sixth among the highest rate of mass shootings compared to the other states. The US has suffered a spate of mass shootings in recent weeks, including at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis, an office building in California, a grocery store in Colorado and at several spas in Atlanta Photo: AFP / Alex Edelman"
1968559061,2021-06-22 06:30:00,Hate-Crime Laws Don’t Work as Their Supporters Intended,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/06/hate-crimes-not-used-prosecutors/619179/?utm_source=feed,en,False,"politics and government,law and legislation,united states politics and government,blacks,editorials,discrimination",1110,Atlantic,http://www.theatlantic.com/,"Prosecutors aren’t charging suspects with hate crimes, even in clear-cut cases. About the author: Avlana Eisenberg is the Gary & Sallyn Pajcic Professor of Law at Florida State University. The recent congressional vote to pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act was notably bipartisan. Sponsored by Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii and Democratic Representative Grace Meng of New York, the bill was signed by President Joe Biden on May 20 after it passed a nearly unanimous Senate (with only Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, opposed) and was approved 364–62 by the House. The bill is intended to complement existing hate-crime laws, and specifically to beef up state and local reporting of hate crimes. This sort of across-the-aisle consensus seems impossible in 2021. Yet most Americans appear to agree that crimes are more harmful if committed because of prejudice, and that they thus deserve additional punishment. Nevertheless, hate-crime laws do have their critics. Some on the left argue that criminal law is the last thing that will help communities of color, and that hate-crime laws will be applied disproportionately against the most marginalized, serving only to worsen our mass-incarceration crisis. Others on the right insist that hate-crime laws penalize people for protected speech and scapegoat individuals for systemic racism. However, there may be a more basic reason hate-crime statutes might not work as their framers intended: Few of these laws are ever actually enforced. Hate crimes are notoriously underreported by victims to police. Even when they are reported and police identify a possible bias motive, individual prosecutors have sole discretion over whether to charge a particular case as a hate crime, and they often decline to do so. Read: The people vs. hate Why aren’t more perpetrators charged with hate crimes? My academic research into prosecutorial decision making has included interviews with dozens of prosecutors (under promise of anonymity) in more than 30 states. Many said they often avoid adding hate-crime charges even—and perhaps especially—when the crime is particularly horrific. This seemingly surprising pattern makes sense if one understands the challenges and incentives facing prosecutors. First, prosecutors prefer not to bring charges when they doubt that they can secure a conviction. Many prosecutors believe that proving an actor’s motive—what was really driving their actions—is immensely difficult. As one prosecutor told me, “It’s impossible to know what’s in someone’s heart.” Jurors faced with evidence that a perpetrator acted for multiple reasons may well acquit on an added hate-crime charge because they are unwilling to treat bias as the sole or predominant motive, as many hate-crime statutes require. Second, when a crime is particularly heinous and the defendant is already facing a long prison sentence—or even multiple life sentences—a hate-crime conviction would not have any practical effect. Without the possibility of a meaningful increase in penalty, prosecutors have little incentive to expend the additional resources and personnel necessary to pursue hate-crime charges. When discussing cases involving serious injury or death, a common refrain from prosecutors was some version of “I don’t need anything more to charge.” As one prosecutor elaborated, “Hate-crime charges wouldn’t give us more, and aren’t worth the time in such cases.” By contrast, a higher penalty could result if lower-level crimes not involving bodily harm—such as defacement of a building or hateful graffiti—were charged as hate crimes. But prosecutors tend not to pursue these cases as aggressively, since they’re considered less important and many are difficult to trace back to the perpetrators. Prosecutors with whom I spoke also expressed concern about jury reaction in an otherwise straightforward case. In more conservative states, some prosecutors worried that focusing on the race, gender, or sexual orientation of a victim could make their job harder, even hindering their ability to win cases. One prosecutor noted that “a person who is perfectly willing to convict a murderer … might be less inclined to do so if asked to render a verdict under a hate-crime statute based on sexual orientation.” Some prosecutors in more liberal states reported a different concern: Some sympathetic would-be jurors have been disqualified during voir dire for lack of impartiality because they expressed “too much disgust” at the suggestion that the defendant acted out of prejudice. When prosecutors do choose to bring hate-crime charges, they often do so because of external factors. In high-profile cases—for example, the recent Atlanta-area mass shooting that claimed the lives of eight people, six of whom were women of Asian descent—a prosecutor might charge the suspect with a hate crime as a symbolic gesture, even if it will not affect the defendant’s maximum sentence. For prosecutors working in designated hate-crime units, which exist in some large cities, prosecuting hate crimes is central to their mandate, and they may be more likely to pursue hate-crime charges. Prosecutors with whom I spoke stressed that without such a designated unit or or at least one attorney in the office whose primary focus is hate-crime prosecution, hate-crime cases aren’t likely to surface with any consistency. Some prosecutors may also bring hate-crime charges in cases that don’t appear to support them as a way to gain leverage in plea negotiations. In New York State, for example, where age is a protected category that includes anyone age 60 or older, prosecutors have included hate-crime charges in swindling cases that involved elderly victims but where there was no evidence of animus toward the elderly. By charging defendants suspected of stealing less than $1 million with hate crimes, New York prosecutors have obtained plea deals that include prison time. This is because, even though under New York law a conviction for theft of less than $1 million carries no mandatory prison time, a conviction for grand larceny as a hate crime, even for stealing a much smaller amount, carries a minimum of one year in prison and could result in a sentence of up to 25 years. Read: Are prosecutors the key to justice reform? Defense attorneys have been critical of using hate-crime laws as plea-bargaining chips. Some leaders of nonprofit organizations focused on combatting hate crimes have also expressed skepticism, insisting that hate-crime charges should not be brought against those who committed “crimes of opportunity.” Instead, they maintain that these charges should be limited to situations in which the driving force behind the crime was bias based on a person’s identity, an approach that would be more in keeping with the pro-tolerance, anti-prejudice messages intended by legislators. Ultimately, there is a massive gap between the stated purpose of hate-crime laws and how they are used in practice. This mismatch may be disastrous for the morale of affected community groups—and for the relationships between these groups and law enforcement. Under-enforcing hate-crime laws can send the message that legal progress is a waste of time, that the lives of members of an affected group are not valued, and that this country’s laws do not protect them. In the era of Black Lives Matter, when law enforcement has already lost significant credibility with communities of color, this concern is especially salient. One option for addressing the under-enforcement of hate-crime laws would be to make these laws more user-friendly for victims and law enforcement alike. Providing additional resources to improve hate-crime reporting and investigation—as the recent COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act aims to do—is one approach. Another would be shifting prosecutors’ incentives, such as by increasing penalties for hate-crime convictions. But changing the existing incentives might be difficult, especially in light of the sweeping criminal code and already-harsh prison sentences. Moreover, we should hesitate before taking any steps that might further expand America’s carceral state. Kristy Parker: Prosecute the police Given the limitations of criminal law as a vehicle for achieving broad social-justice goals, we should also consider other ways to publicly affirm that bias-motivated crimes cause unique harms that ripple through impacted communities. The trust that law enforcement can build with victims and victims’ groups through increased transparency and coalition-building may be crucial to sending the message that crimes against these communities are taken seriously. Prosecutors can play a central role by forming partnerships with community organizations to improve public trust. When there is evidence of a bias motive, a prosecutor could explain why charging a hate crime in that case might be strategically inadvisable. Taking the time to explain to a victim that his or her concerns are being handled with care may prevent the victim from feeling ignored. Prosecutors with whom I spoke who follow this approach—envisioning a core element of their job as building bridges with communities—stressed the importance of “an ongoing dialogue” and reported extremely positive results. Studies by the Yale Law professor Tom Tyler and others in the field of procedural justice have documented that a person’s belief in the fairness and legitimacy of a system—such as law enforcement—depends more on whether that person feels heard and that their dignity is respected than on the outcome of a given case. This finding should inspire criminal-justice policy makers to channel resources into fostering a more robust dialogue with community members. This human project of affirming the dignity of impacted group members is entirely separate from the legal project of developing a winning litigation strategy—but it requires no less diligence, patience, and vision."

An officer responded to a call at 1:15 p.m. about a suspicious incident near the library in the city of Arvada, and about 15 minutes later, a 911 call came in about shots fired and the officer hit, Deputy Chief Ed Brady said at a news conference. The officer who was killed has been identified as Gordon Beesley, a 19-year Arvada department veteran, police said later Monday, according to The Denver Post. Another person believed to have been shot by the gunman was taken to a hospital and died, police said. The attacker also was shot and killed. Authorities didn’t immediately describe the circumstances of the shooting but said no one else is believed to have been involved. Earlier, police said there were two suspects. The shooting occurred in Olde Town Arvada, the city’s downtown district with shops, restaurants, breweries and other businesses. It’s listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is about 7 miles (10 kilometers) northwest of downtown Denver. It comes three months after a gunman opened fire and killed 10 people, including a police officer, at a supermarket in Boulder, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northwest of Arvada. The Arvada officer’s death, just the third in Police Department history, was especially painful after the mass shooting in nearby Boulder, Arvada Mayor Marc Williams said. Arvada police helped respond and investigate that attack, he said. “This is by far the saddest day for our Police Department,” Williams said. The mayor said he was in his car in the area shortly before 2 p.m. “when literally I saw 11 police cars with their flashing lights and sirens on race past me. I knew something serious had happened. I didn’t know how serious.” Arvada resident Brady Turner said he was pulling into the Army and Navy store in the area when he noticed police cars driving in behind him and a person on a stretcher being put into an ambulance in between the parking lot and the store. He said he took off in his car. “I just got out of there,” Turner said. About five minutes later, he heard gunshots near the library about a block away. Arvada closed its City Hall and canceled a City Council meeting to provide resources to investigators and other first responders. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis issued a statement expressing his condolences to the officer’s family and friends, while the Colorado State Patrol tweeted: “All our love to the @ArvadaPolice and the family, blood and blue, of their fallen officer. We stand with you.” Police vehicles drove behind a hearse carrying the body of the slain officer to the Jefferson County coroner’s office, and some residents lined a street with flags to watch the procession. John Garrod of Arvada held a black and white flag with blue stripes at the beginning of a line of about 30 police cars before the procession, a flag he hangs outside his house whenever an officer is killed. His son, brother-in-law and nephew are all in law enforcement, he said. “It breaks my heart whenever this happens but especially when it happens so close to home,” Garrod said. “These are the same officers I wave to when I am walking my dog.” © Copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

Chicago Tribune columnist Clarence Page says issues with the mayor's office, police department, police unions and community support groups need correction in the Windy City. The Chicago Police Department’s (CPD) decision to strip an officer of his police powers was a result, in part, of the man’s ownership of a house on the city's South Side where gunmen killed five people and injured three others, the agency’s top cop said Monday. CPD Superintendent David O. Brown said there were ""multiple reasons"" for the discipline against Enrique Badillo Sr., linking the decision in part to the June 15 fatal shooting. Brown would not elaborate on why such a drastic step was taken against Badillo for his ownership of a building. The investigation is ongoing, but no arrests had been made as of Monday, police said at the time. Authorities have said they believe someone broke into the house and shot eight people; four of them died at the scene and a fifth died on Saturday. All of the deceased victims had been shot in the head, police said. CHICAGO WEEKEND VIOLENCE: 54 PEOPLE WOUNDED IN DOZENS OF SHOOTINGS, 8 KILLED, POLICE SAY Even before the mass shooting prompted the department to strip Badillo of his police powers, there were questions about the building and his ownership of it, according to previous reports. Police had responded to numerous calls about disturbances at the residence, Brown said at a news conference last week. CHICAGO AMBUSH: MAN MURDERED, WIFE WOUNDED WHILE CELEBRATING PUERTO RICAN DAY PARADE In November 2019, police responding to a call of a person shot at the residence found a man had been injured by gunfire. The Chicago Sun-Times reported that officers found shell casings and dice on the floor, and a witness told officers that there were at least 50 people at a party where people were drinking and playing dice when shots rang out.

Tuesday, 22 June 2021 11:29 AM A federal appeals court on Monday placed a hold on U.S. District Judge Robert Benitez's ruling that California's 30-year ban on assault weapons was unconstitutional, potentially setting up a fight in the U.S. Supreme Court over the issue. In early June, Benitez had ruled that California's ban was uncostitutional, comparing the weapons to a ""Swiss Army Knife."" Soon after the court's ruling, California Democrat Attorney General Rob Bonta announced he had filed an appeal to Benitez's decision, The Hill reported. After the decision was issued, Bonta tweeted, ""This leaves our assault weapons laws in effect while appellate proceedings continue. We won't stop defending these life saving laws."" Bonta also called Benitez's decision ""disturbing and troubling and of great concern,"" according to The Hill. California officials have argued in their appeal that five federal appeals courts had rejected constitutional challenges to ban assault weapons. According to The Los Angeles Times, a panel of 9th Circuit Judges consiting of Barry G. Silverman, Jacqueline Nguyen, and and Ryan D. Nelson decided to place a hold on Benitez's ruling. The Times also reported that California is one of seven states and the District of Columbia to ban assault weapons. This case is expected to reach the Supreme Court which has a conservative supermajority. In his ruling, Benitez wrote, ""This case is not about extraordinary weapons lying at the outer limits of Second Amendment protection. The banned 'assault weapons' are not bazookas, howitzers, or machine guns. Those aims are dangerous and solely used for military purposes. Instead, the firearms deemed 'assault weapons' are fairly ordinary, popular modern rifles. This is an average case about average guns used in average ways for average purposes."" The Firearms Policy Coalition challenged the assault weapons ban and criticized the 9th Circuit for putting Benitez's decision on hold and ""choosing government tyranny over human lives and rights,"" The Coalition said, ""Tens of millions of Californians have suffered under the state's unconstitutional and oppressive gun control scheme for far too long,"" reported the Times. California banned assault weapons in 1989 in response to a mass shooting that same year at a school in Stockton. The shooter used an AK-47 and large capacity magazines to kill five children. California's law restricts the manufacture, importation, sale, and possession of rifles, pistols, and shotguns defined as 'assault weapons' under the state’s penal code, according to the Times. Fox5 reported that in a news conference in San Francisco where Bonta announced the appeal, Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a strong condemnation of Benitez and his past of history of striking down California gun laws. He called the judge ""a wholly owned subsidiary of the gun lobby and the National Rifle Association,"" He also criticized the timing of the ruling which occurred on National Gun Violence Day.  © 2021 Newsmax.

“Yesterday at about 9:20 p.m., Mr. Clark was pulled over in the area of Grand and Adams for a vehicle code violation,” the spokesperson said Monday. “At this time, officers observed a bag with an Uzi sticking out.” 
Clark, 28, and three passengers were taken out of the vehicle, the LAPD spokesman said. Clark was arrested for allegedly possessing a concealed firearm in a vehicle, the spokesperson said. 
Clark was booked into Los Angeles County jail on Monday morning and was released at 2:30 p.m. on $35,000 bond, according to booking details from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. 	


Clark, a Los Angeles native, was drafted in the second round of the 2015 NFL draft. 
A two-time Pro Bowl player, Clark is entering his seventh season in the NFL and has spent three years with the Chiefs. Clark was on the Chief’s Super Bowl-winning team in 2020. Prior to joining the Chiefs, Clark spent four seasons with the Seattle Seahawks. 
						
The Chiefs are on a monthlong break following their mandatory minicamp, which concluded June 17, according to the team’s schedule. 
NFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy said the organization was “aware of the matter which will be reviewed under the NFL’s personal conduct policy.”

Now, at the midway point of 2021, things have only gotten worse. JAMAL: ""Are you worried about the rest of the summer?""  SALAAM: ""Well, yes, I am. I think, I think the direction in which the violence is moving in now, I'm definitely concerned."" June 15th was the deadliest day of the year in Chicago so far with 8 murders in less than 24 hours — four of which came in one shooting incident. Compared to 2019, shootings and murders are up 56% and 29%, respectively. Tony Salaam works for the violence prevention organization READI, specifically doing outreach in Englewood, the southside neighborhood where the mass shooting took place. SALAAM: ""Well during COVID, we lost about three participants. I believe, I think the last time we lost someone, it's been just four months."" This spike in violence is nationwide and has impacted cities that had made significant progress in combating gun violence. Cities like New York and Oakland, California that saw significant drops in violence over the last decade saw much of that work vanish in 2020 and 2021 as shootings have soared. New York is on pace to have an 18% rise in murders this year compared to last year --  that's following a 45% rise in 2020. In Oakland, 15 people were killed in the month of January alone. Over the weekend, 6 people were shot and 1 person was killed at a Juneteenth gathering. While criminologists have lots of theories for why violence has picked up so significantly, ranging from the pandemic to policing to a massive increase in gun sales, no one has been able to pinpoint with any certainty a cause for the spike. DREIER: ""So one of the greatest predictors of violence in the future is exposure to violence."" Fatimah Loren Dreier has worked with and studied hospital-based violence intervention programs across the country and says the pandemic's extraordinary impact on community- based violence intervention efforts is partly to blame. Oakland saw a 50% reduction in shootings over a seven year period before the pandemic. Local police largely credited their partnership with these organizations for that drop in violence. DREIER: ""These are the sorts of programming that actually transforms communities, because of the nature, the cyclical nature of violence, you can tap into that network, identify those who were at high risk, provide wraparound care, and continue to monitor them in the long term. You see incredible transformation."" Violence intervention programs rely heavily on in-person interactions and community-based relationships. Tony Salaam in Chicago says despite their best efforts they lost touch with some of their participants when the pandemic hit. SALAAM: ""Outreach workers will go out, show them how to work the smartphone, get on Zoom and use the tablets. So that increased our numbers again but there was definitely a drop off. Absolutely."" President Biden's infrastructure plan features $5 billion worth of funding for these programs nationwide over an 8-year period. The president is planning to detail his administration's crime prevention strategy Wednesday. Connect With Us Newsy © 2021 Newsy is an E.W. Scripps Company Brand"

Seven other people were injured in the shooting on the 2200 block of Lakeshore Avenue. Family and friends of the victims gathered for a vigil Tuesday night at Lake Merritt, NBC Bay Area reported. They were joined by members of the Oakland City Council. “He was hers but when he had that baby, oh my goodness if you could see him with his baby,” said Rhoades’ aunt, Jasma Turner, according to the news station. At a news conference Monday, Oakland police Chief LeRonne Armstrong said the shooting was carried out by “multiple shooters” and “directly related to group and gang violence” linked to San Francisco.

1969166954,2021-06-22 20:31:33,Gun Rights Imperiled As State Preemption Laws Face Challenges,https://dailycaller.com/2021/06/22/colorado-giffords-jared-polis-national-rifle-association/,en,False,"politics and government,law and legislation,suits and litigation,gun control,firearms",18775,Daily Caller,http://dailycaller.com,"(Photo by Michael Ciaglo/Getty Images) Firearm preemption laws across the country currently face legislative and judicial challenges as local governments seek to regulate guns, a trend which threatens Second Amendment rights, a National Rifle Association spokesman told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Preemption provides residents with a uniformed set of rules when it comes to owning, carrying, and using a firearm throughout the state,” NRA spokesman Lars Dalseide told the DCNF. Preemption laws remove the power of local governments to regulate firearm ownership, according to gun control advocacy group Giffords, which the group says prevents local officials from protecting their communities from gun violence. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis repealed the state’s preemption law Saturday, signing into law SB21-256 which allowed cities and counties to enact laws governing or prohibiting “the sale, purchase, transfer, or possession of a firearm, ammunition, or firearm component,” The law was proposed following a mass shooting in Boulder earlier this year that had prompted Democrats and activists to call for further gun restrictions. “Colorado has been and will continue to be a national leader in firearm regulation,” a spokesperson for Polis told the DCNF ahead of a number of legislative and judicial challenges to preemption laws across the country. Activists rally at Colorado capitol for increased gun control measures. (Photo by Michael Ciaglo/Getty Images) Gun rights organizations, such as the National Rifle Association (NRA), argue that preemption laws are essential in preventing localities from violating citizens’ Second Amendment rights, as well as eliminating confusion over the particular laws to which a citizen is subject as they travel throughout the state. “Dismantling that system creates a confusing patchwork of laws that place law-abiding residents in legal peril just for exercising their constitutional right to carry a firearm or to defend themselves and their families,” Dalseide said. Gun control groups have focused on preemption laws in recent years, with the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence making the issue a central piece of their Safer States Initiative. Giffords has stated that one of its key policy goals is to “repeal preemption laws in states that already have them and resist their enactment in states that do not have them.” With the passage of the new law, Colorado joins New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Hawaii as states without preemption laws, according to the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation. However, that number may soon grow as a number of legislative and judicial challenges to preemption laws are resolved. Virginia, for example, enacted legislation gutting its preemption laws last year, allowing localities to pass laws regulating firearm possession in public buildings, parks and public roads when used for certain purposes. One such regulation is currently being contested in a lawsuit, LaFave v. County of Fairfax, filed by Virginia citizens along with the NRA. (RELATED: Gun Control Howls, Gnashes Teeth When California’s Rifle Ban Struck) Similarly, the Illinois state Supreme Court will hear a case later this year over a decision by Deerfield to ban civilian use of “assault weapons” and high capacity magazines, Capitol News reports. The plaintiffs, advocacy groups Guns Save Life Inc. and the Second Amendment Foundation, argued that the ban is preempted by Illinois state law, though an appellate court ruled in favor of Deerfield this March. The National Riffle Association of America (NRA) headquarters on August 6, 2020 in Fairfax, Virginia. (Photo by OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images) Oregon successfully amended its preemption laws earlier this month, enacting a law that permits certain local authorities to regulate firearms in public buildings. Lawmakers in Maine attempted to gut preemption laws this spring, with a bill allowing municipalities to create gun-free zones near polling places failing to pass. Moreover, Pennsylvania’s Commonwealth Court took up a lawsuit challenging preemption laws in June, in which the city of Philadelphia sued for the right to enact its own gun laws. The city alleged that preemption laws infringe on residents’ rights to “life and liberty.” Florida’s preemption laws withstood a challenge this April, with a state appellate court ruling against local governments in a reversal of the lower court’s decision. However, local governments filed notices last week asking the Florida State Supreme Court to take up the case, according to CBS Miami. Gun rights advocates worry these local challenges will imperil gun owners and citizens alike. Dudley Brown, president of the Rocky Mountain Gun Owners, told The Wall Street Journal that repealing preemption laws will “open up the floodgates for woke city councils to disarm their citizens.” “Repealing preemption laws is reckless, irresponsible, and will have no impact on reducing crime because the simple fact is that criminals don’t follow the law in the first place,” Dalseide told the DCNF.

1969251597,2021-06-22 11:01:10,Democratic U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse Accused Of Belonging To ‘All-White’ Beach Club In Rhode Island,https://newsone.com/4166699/sheldon-whitehouse-beach-club-controversy/,en,False,"politics and government,finances,blacks,discrimination",24661,newsone.com,http://newsone.com,"Posted June 22, 2021 Source: Pool / Getty A Democratic U.S. Senator who is accused of belonging to an “all-white” beach club in Rhode Island is both denying the claim and defending his membership in a local racial controversy that is making national news. When confronted and questioned on Friday about his membership to Bailey’s Beach Club in Newport, Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse all but confirmed that the establishment with which his wife “is one of the largest shareholders” doesn’t have any “minority members,” as Kate Nagle, the journalist who interviewed him, said.  “I think the people who are running the place are still working on that and I’m sorry it hasn’t happened yet,” Whitehouse said in response to being asked if there was any traction to have a more racially diverse membership. Nagle doubled down as Whitehouse began to walk away from her on-the-spot interview, asking him if it’s tone-deaf for a Democratic U.S. Senator to belong to such a club as the country is in the middle of a racial reckoning spurred by injustices to and discrimination of people of color. She also asked Whitehouse if those kinds of “clubs should continue to exist.” Whitehouse’s response spoke volumes: “It’s a long tradition in Rhode Island and there are many of them and, um, I just think we need to work our way through the issues.” To be sure, Whitehouse did not denounce the exclusive club and did not refute its description as being “all-white.” Watch the interview below.  After the video went viral, one of Whitehouse’s reps moved swiftly to do some damage control, the Boston Globe reported. “The club has no such restrictive policy,” spokesperson Meaghan McCabe said in a statement on Monday. “The club has had and has members of color. The Senator has dedicated his entire career to promoting equity and protecting civil rights, as his record shows.” It might be tough for some critics to reconcile the comment from Whitehouse’s spokesperson with Whitehouse’s actual words that he willingly spoke. Especially since he changed his tune a bit when asked again about the controversy on Monday. Whitehouse suggested he misspoke on Friday and said the “tradition” he mentioned was in reference to Bailey’s Beach Club “being a family club, and they’re working on improving diversity,” he said before adding, “I think that’s pretty fair.” He used his strongest terms with the local NBC affiliate: “There is no discriminatory policy.” The Globe cited a 2003 New York Times report about Bailey’s Beach Club that addressed the demographics of its membership, writing in part, “Blacks, not really.” Among Whitehouse’s loudest critics for his club membership are Black Lives Matter leaders in Rhode Island. “I am ashamed of Senator Whitehouse and his affiliation with this racist club. Him coming out and speaking about ending systemic racism while belonging to a ‘whites only’ private club is hypocrisy as it worst,” Brother Gary Dantzler, Executive Director of Black Lives Matter Rhode Island, told GoLocal Providence, the news blog for which Nagle is an editor. “We need to put an end to this good ole boy mentality and hold our elected officials accountable. Black Lives Matter Rhode Island expects the Senator to call this what it is; Jim Crow era racism that’s been lingering around the Black community like a plague. It’s time for real change and equity. While it is not news that Whitehouse belongs to the club, Friday and Monday marked the most ardent defense of his membership. The controversy prompted Newsweek to publish an op-ed declaring Whitehouse as the most recent example of Democrats having “an elitism problem.” This is America.

But another scourge on society seems to be the apparent increasing desensitized reactions to that gun violence, as exemplified in a new viral video showing a large group of young people twerking and otherwise partying it up next to and on top of multiple emergency vehicles that were reportedly responding to a deadly shooting this past weekend in Northern California. While the full details were not immediately available, the video — purportedly showing “Juneteenth celebrations” in Oakland that left “1 dead and 5 injured.” The tweet that posted the video doesn’t provide any other details, but CBS San Francisco reported that a mass shooting near Oakland’s Lake Merritt killed at least one person and injured at least six others on Saturday night. A twerkfest broke out next to an ambulance responding to an emergency. | Source: Twitter  Whether the video from the tweet in question was from the shooting near Lake Merritt or elsewhere, the footage is disturbing as emergency medical personnel can be seen wheeling apparent victims on gurneys toward ambulances as throngs of revelers dance — twerk, to be specific — on top and on the side of them. One man is even shown standing on top of an ambulance tossing around a football and dozens of onlookers cheer on him and the people twerking. An ambulance in the video shows that it is part of a fleet belonging to Alameda County Emergency Medical Services. Oakland is in Alameda County. Watch the unfortunate video below. CNN reported that there were at least 10 mass shootings in the U.S. over this past weekend, which was largely devoted to celebrating Juneteenth after the annual commemoration of slavery officially ending officially became the 12th national holiday when President Joe Biden signed it into law last week. At least seven people were killed and at least 40 others were injured in the weekend’s mass shootings. In particular, mass shootings in Oakland have recently been on the rise, the San Jose Mercury News reported. Saturday night’s shooting near Lake Merritt was the city’s sixth mass shooting of the year, which is more than all of 2020. A man dances while tossing a football from the top of an ambulance responding to an emergency as onlookers laugh. | Source: Twitter Even more alarming, nearly halfway through this year, there have already been more than 280 mass shootings. That’s about 40% more than at this time last year and about 65% more than 2019. It is in that context that the video of people twerking as EMTs attended to people in medical distress went viral. Yet, despite the rising, alarming death toll as mass shootings become the norm and not the exception, Americans have appeared to be largely numb to the carnage. This is America.
