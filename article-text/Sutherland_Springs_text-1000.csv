http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-met-stop-bleeding-training-20171018-story.html,"Responding to a 911 call for a gunshot victim, Chicago police Officer David Watson followed a trail of blood into an apartment and found a teenager with blood streaming from a leg wound. Using training he received as a Marine, Watson took the belt from the young man’s pants and wrapped it around his thigh. The officer placed a stick under the belt to tighten it by twisting, and his partner helped stem the blood by pressing down on the wound until paramedics arrived. Doctors said that if Watson and his partner, Paul Moreno, hadn’t taken those steps after the October 2016 shooting, the teen probably would not have survived. Medical experts say anyone can employ a few basic techniques to achieve the same results when confronted with a life-and-death scenario. And a public service campaign called “Stop the Bleed” aims to do just that: teach bystanders to save someone’s life by learning basic blood-stemming techniques. Stop the Bleed is a national effort established by the White House in 2015 as one response to the Sandy Hook mass school shooting three years before. It aims to arm civilians with skills and bleeding control kits to provide crucial aid in an emergency until medical professionals can take over. And each time there is a mass shooting or other violent event — like the massacre of more than 25 people at a Texas church on Sunday and the Oct. 1 shooting in Las Vegas that has claimed nearly 60 lives — the campaign takes on greater urgency. In Chicago, more than 3,000 people have been shot this year, and the victim of a gunshot wound can bleed to death in only five minutes. Bystanders are on the scene before first responders, and experts say bleeding remains one of the leading preventable causes of death for such victims. While street crime remains a common cause of severe injury, it is lessons learned from battlefield medicine that are the basis for training to stop blood loss. The military use of tourniquets in Iraq and Afghanistan saved an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 lives, according to the Journal of Trauma. Now, experts are hoping to translate that success into a civilian setting, and they have a precedent for such a program. Thanks in large part to American Heart Association classes, more than 12 million people each year learn how to keep blood flowing through cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR. Yet few nonprofessionals train in how to stop blood loss. In the past two years, the American College of Surgeons, the primary group coordinating Stop the Bleed classes, has trained 165 people to be bleeding control instructors. They, in turn, have held more than 80 courses for more than 900 students, the group reports. So far, only a few classes are offered each month by hospitals in the Chicago area, but sponsors like the Cook County Trauma and Burn Unit are hoping to ramp that up as people become more aware. Audrey Robinson, a nurse practitioner for the county, began teaching classes on bleeding control there this summer. She first taught surgeons so they could teach other students. She then provided the training to social workers at Stroger Hospital and is planning a free class each month for the general public. While medical professionals have expertise in human anatomy, Robinson said anyone can be trained to recognize severe bleeding and try to stop it. In case of a bleeding emergency, here are the main steps to follow, as described at bleedingcontrol.org: • Get yourself and the victim to a safe place, call 911, and assess the seriousness of the situation. • If blood from a wound is spurting, soaking clothing or pooling, the injury could be life-threatening. • Caregivers should first figure out the origin of the bleeding, then cover the wound or, if it’s large, stuff it with gauze, bandages or clean cloth, such as a T-shirt. • Apply pressure to the wound as hard as you can with both hands to keep blood from flowing out until help arrives. • If that doesn’t work, and the wound is in an arm or a leg, the next step is to make a tourniquet, using virtually anything that can be wrapped around a limb, such as a piece of clothing. It should be placed above the wound, or closer to the torso, and tightened until the bleeding stops. • A short stick called a windlass can then be inserted under the tourniquet next to the knot and used to tighten the tourniquet more if necessary. It should be tight enough to be uncomfortable. If the bleeding continues, a second tourniquet can be added. These are the same kind of techniques paramedics use almost every day to save lives, Robinson said. Besides in regard to mass casualty events, these skills are also valuable for accidents that can occur at home, work or on the road. Officials say that keeping a first-aid kit with a tourniquet and blood-clotting gauze at home should be as routine as having a smoke detector. Cook County sheriff’s deputies are among dozens of big-city departments that already carry tourniquets and get bleeding control training. The Chicago Police Foundation also is working to provide first-aid kits, including tourniquets, to Chicago police officers who undergo special training.  Yet not all medical authorities have full confidence in letting civilians cut off blood flow.  The Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, in Scotland, released a position statement in July stating that tourniquets “must be used correctly or not at all,” warning of possible circulatory complications or even increased bleeding if used incorrectly.  The statement said it “could be argued that in a civilian setting,” the need to use a tourniquet is rare and that “most bleeds can be controlled with direct pressure successfully.” But it said there “remains a place for tourniquets” in cases of shootings, stabbings, industrial accidents or where a serious flesh wound occurs in a remote location.  Officials with the American College of Surgeons say they’re confident that properly trained civilians can be effective, citing real-life examples.  Dr. Kevin Chow, who has taught the Stop the Bleed course at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said someone used a ripped T-shirt, an apple and a pencil to make a tourniquet to save another person’s life. In a different case, two soccer players collided, leaving a large gash in one player’s leg. A friend packed the wound with a clean T-shirt to stop the bleeding until they could get to a hospital. Hospital workers themselves often apply direct pressure to stop sudden bleeding until they can get in an operating room. The long-term goal of the program is to hold classes at police stations, churches, community centers, offices and schools, and to make bleeding control kits as common as defibrillators in public places.  “A high school student can learn the same techniques I would use to hold pressure, pack a wound or apply a tourniquet,” Chow said. “These are skills that we are trying to get into everyone's hands so that it becomes common knowledge. … We tell people that they can make a huge difference and be the reason someone lives.”  Dr. James Doherty, trauma surgery director at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, and education director for the College of Surgeons, taught the class to two Boy Scout troops, using an aquarium pump to simulate blood flow in a fake leg Halloween prop.  Since medical prosthetic models are expensive, Doherty is working in his basement to build his own models made of pool flotation noodles with a wooden rod inserted to simulate the bone, just to make lessons more available.  “This is a lifesaving maneuver,” he tells students. “Don’t be afraid to do it. The potential benefit far outweighs any harm.”  rmccoppin@chicagotribune.com Twitter @Robert McCoppin RELATED: CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"

Multiple people are reported dead following a mass shooting at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Wilson County Commissioner Albert Gamez Jr. confirmed a single shooter walked into the church and opened fire Sunday. The identity of the shooter has not yet been provided, although police say the the man that committed the act (who was dressed “in full gear,” according to a witness who spoke with the Daily Beast) is now dead. No motive for the shooting has been given at this time. “The details are kind of sketchy, but what I know right now, what they’re telling me, like 27 deceased and over 20, 25 injured,” Gamez Jr. told CBS News. Carrie Matula works only 150 yards away from the First Baptist Church and she told MSNBC she heard “semiautomatic gunfire” before investigating what the sound was. “It’s a small Baptist church. It’s an older building. I don’t know that they would have security cameras or anything high tech like that. And I know they didn’t have security in the parking lot,” she said. “I never thought it would happen here. This is something that happens in a big city. I would never have thought this would have taken place here. It’s just too tight a community. It doesn’t make sense.” Texas Governor Greg Abbott offered his condolences on Twitter shortly after the shooting. President Donald Trump also tweeted a message following news of the tragedy, as did Sen. Ted Cruz. Our prayers are with all who were harmed by this evil act. Our thanks to law enforcement for their response.

X OUR PICKS: SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas (AP) — The Latest on a shooting at a church in Texas (all times local): 1:10 a.m. President Donald Trump says the mass shooting at a Texas church is the result of a “mental health problem at the highest level.” Speaking at an event with the Japanese prime minister in Tokyo on Monday, Trump described the gunman as a “very deranged individual.” Authorities say 26 people were killed and about 20 others were wounded Sunday after a man opened fire inside the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs. Officials identified the shooter to The Associated Press as Devin Kelley. Authorities have not yet determined a motive for the shooting, and have not broached the topic of the gunman’s mental health. ___ 11:50 p.m. A congregant who wasn’t at a Texas church when a gunman opened fire says his pregnant cousin and her in-laws were among those killed. Nick Uhlig tells The Associated Press that his cousin Crystal Holcombe and her in-laws Karla and Bryan Holcombe died in Sunday’s attack at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs. Crystal Holcombe was eight months pregnant. Uhlig says Bryan Holcombe did prison ministry, adding that he would go to the prison with a ukulele and sing for the inmates. Uhlig earlier said that he was not at church on Sunday because he was out late on Saturday. Authorities say 26 people were killed and about 20 others wounded in the mass shooting. ___ 11:30 p.m. A sheriff says there was likely “no way” for parishioners to escape once shooting started at the Texas church. Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt Jr. said Sunday night that the shooter fired several shots outside before entering the Sutherland Springs church and walking toward the front of the congregation. Tackitt says the gunman then turned around and opened fire on his way back out the front door. Tackitt says “I don’t think they could have escaped. You’ve got your pews on either side.” The sheriff did not name the shooter, but officials identified the gunman to The Associated Press as Devin Kelley. Tackitt says investigators have not yet determined a motive for the attack. ___ 10:50 p.m. A man who says he pursued the gunman in a Texas church shooting says he was acting on instinct to try to prevent the suspect from escaping. Johnnie Langendorff says in an interview with KSAT television that he was driving past the church Sunday as the shooting happened and he saw the gunman exchanging fire with a member of the community. He says the member of the community asked for help and got into Langendorff’s truck. They took off at high speed in pursuit of the gunman on a nearby highway as police were going in the opposite direction toward the church. Langendorff says the gunman eventually lost control of his vehicle and crashed. He says the member of the community walked up to the vehicle with his gun drawn and the suspect did not move. The community member stood guard over the gunman until police arrived 5 to 7 minutes later. Langendorff says: “I was strictly just acting on what’s the right thing to do.” The shooting left 26 people dead and about 20 wounded. ___ 9:45 p.m. President Donald Trump has ordered that U.S. flags be flown at half-staff to honor those killed in the mass shooting at a Texas church. Trump, who is in the midst of a lengthy tour of Asia, issued a proclamation late Sunday ordering that American flags flown at the White House, all public buildings and grounds, and military posts be flown at half-staff through sunset on Thursday. Authorities say 26 people were killed and about 20 others were wounded Sunday after a man opened fire inside First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio. Officials identified the gunman to The Associated Press as Devin Kelley. ___ 9 p.m. An Air Force official says the man identified by officials to The Associated Press as the gunman in the mass shooting at a Texas church was court-martialed in 2012 and discharged two years later. Spokeswoman Ann Stefanek says Devin P. Kelley was court-martialed on one count of assault on his spouse and another count of assault on their child. He received a bad conduct discharge, 12 months’ confinement and a reduction in rank. Stefanek also says Kelley served in Logistics Readiness at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge. Authorities say 26 people were killed and about 20 others wounded in the attack in Sutherland Springs. ___ 8:30 p.m. A teenager says the layout of the Texas church where authorities say a man killed 26 people and injured 20 others would have made it difficult for congregants to flee a shooter who came in the front door. Sixteen-year-old Hunter Green was at a vigil near the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs on Sunday evening. He described the church as having only small exits on the side and in the back. If a gunman came in the front door, Green says “they wouldn’t have had anywhere to go.” He says he attends the church with his girlfriend but they skipped the morning service after a late date night. He adds that both got frantic phone calls from people asking if they were OK. Green says “we just missed it. It should have been me.” ___ 7:50 p.m. People who live near an address listed for the Texas church shooting suspect say they heard intense gunfire from that direction in recent days. Sixteen-year-old Ryan Albers lives across the road from the listed home of suspect Devin Kelley. He says: “It’s really loud. At first I thought someone was blasting.” He says “It was someone using automatic weapon fire.” Another nearby neighbor, who did not want to be identified, said he had also heard gunfire coming from across the street but couldn’t be sure if it came from the property listed as Kelley’s address. The neighbor added that the sound of gunfire is not unusual in the area given the seclusion and the big acreage of the surrounding properties. Authorities say 26 people were killed and about 20 wounded in the shooting. ___ 7:30 p.m. A U.S. military official says the suspect identified in the mass shooting at a Texas church was a former Air Force member who was stationed in New Mexico at one time. Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek says records confirm that Devin P. Kelley served in Logistics Readiness at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge. The date of his discharge and the circumstances under which he left the service were not immediately available. The Pentagon also confirmed that Kelley was an airman “at one point,” but didn’t provide additional details. Authorities say 26 people were killed and about 20 others wounded in the attack in Sutherland Springs. ___ 7:15 p.m. President Donald Trump has promised his administration’s full support to the investigation of a Texas church shooting that left 26 dead and about 20 wounded. Speaking to U.S. and Japanese business leaders in Tokyo Monday morning during his Asian trip, Trump highlighted that this “act of evil” at a place of sacred worship. Trump says: “Our hearts are broken but in dark times — and these are dark times — such as these, Americans do what they do best.” He says Americans will pull together to help those suffering. Trump says he will continue monitoring the investigation during his 11-day tour. ___ 7:05 p.m. More than 100 people gathered after dark on a grassy street corner within sight of the church where the shooting occurred for a prayer vigil. Attendees, including Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, lit candles while some wept and others hugged Sunday night. They could see the church sign lit up and emergency lights flashing. The vigil across the street from a gas station convenience store where law enforcement officials say the shooter stopped before the attack. Mike Gonzales, who does not attend the church but lives near says: “The people of this church are wonderful people.” Gonzales added, “We’re coming together to pray for them and show the world that now, in the midst of darkness, there is light.” Authorities say 26 people were killed and about 20 wounded in the attack. ___ 7 p.m. The Pentagon has confirmed the suspect identified in the mass shooting at a Texas church previously served in the Air Force. In a brief statement, the Pentagon says Devin Kelley was an airman “at one point,” but additional details about his time in the Air Force were not immediately available. Authorities say 26 people were killed and about 20 others injured in the attack at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, 30 miles southeast of San Antonio. ___ 6:45 p.m. Two sheriff’s vans were parked outside and police officers stood at the gate of a cattle fence surrounding the address listed for the Texas church shooting suspect, preventing a group of waiting journalists from entering. Two officials who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity have identified him as Devin Kelley. Officials from the Comal County Sherriff’s Office and the Texas Rangers declined to comment Sunday evening, or to say if they had raided his home. A few minutes later, the gate opened and two Texas Rangers trucks pulled out. The home is in a wooded area on the rural, western outskirts of New Braunfels, north of San Antonio. It is off a two-lane highway. Authorities say 26 people were killed and about 20 wounded in the shooting. ___ 6:40 p.m. President Donald Trump says the deadly church shooting in Texas is an “act of evil.” Trump is in Tokyo on the first leg of a visit to Asia. He says he has spoken with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and the state has the administration’s “full support.” Trump says he will continue to follow developments closely while he is traveling through Asia. The president says the “act of evil” occurred as the victims and families were in their place of “sacred worship.” Texas authorities say 26 people were killed and about 20 others were wounded Sunday after a man open fire inside First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs southeast of San Antonio. ___ 6:15 p.m. Texas authorities are offering more details about the timeline of a deadly church shooting. Department of Public Safety regional director Freeman Martin says the alleged shooter was dressed in black, wearing tactical gear and a ballistic vest when he arrived at a neighboring gas station around 11:20 a.m. He crossed the street to the church, left his vehicle and started firing a Ruger AR assault-type rifle at the church. Then he entered the church and fired. As he left the church, the shooter met an unidentified area resident with his own rifle who pursued him. The suspect was found dead in his vehicle near the border between Wilson and Guadalupe counties. Martin says it’s unclear if he died of a self-inflected wound or was shot by the resident. Authorities haven’t announced the name of the suspect, only describing him as a white male in his 20s. Two officials who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity identified the attacker as Devin Kelley. ___ 6 p.m. A top Texas public safety officer says that 23 of the people found dead in a shooting at a Baptist church were found inside the building, two others were outside and one person was transported but died later. Freeman Martin, regional director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, says the ages of those killed ranged from 5 to 72. He told a news conference that about 20 other people were injured in the attack. The first report of the shooting was at about 11:20 a.m., or about 20 minutes after the church website says the Sunday worship was scheduled to start. ___ 5:40 p.m. Gov. Greg Abbott says 26 people were killed in the attack on a Texas church and that it was the deadliest mass shooting in the state’s history. Abbott’s remarks came during a news conference Sunday, hours after the attack on the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, a community 30 miles southeast of San Antonio. The victims ranged in age from 5 to 72 years old. Two officials who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity identified the attacker as Devin Kelley. ___ 5:20 p.m. Two officials have identified the suspect in a mass shooting at a Texas church as Devin Kelley. The officials — one a U.S. official and the other in law enforcement — spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation, which they were briefed on. The U.S. official says Kelley lived in a suburb of San Antonio and that he doesn’t appear to be linked to organized terrorist groups. The official says investigators are looking at social media posts Kelley may have made in the days before Sunday’s attack, including one that appeared to show an AR-15 semiautomatic weapon. Authorities say Kelley walked into the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs and opened fire, killing more than 20 people and wounding at least 10 others. This item has been corrected to fix the spelling of Kelley on second reference. ___ 5 p.m. A congregant who wasn’t at a Texas church the day of a deadly shooting says his cousins attended and that family members have been told at least one was killed. Thirty-four-year-old Nick Uhlig says he didn’t go to the Sutherland Springs church Sunday because he was out late Saturday. He says the cousin who was killed had three children and was pregnant with a fourth. He didn’t know specifics about how the other was doing. Uhlig says the family had just met days earlier for his cousins’ grandfather’s funeral. ___ 4:20 p.m. The wife of the pastor of the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs says the couple’s 14-year-old daughter was among those killed in a mass shooting at the church. Sherri Pomeroy, wife of Pastor Frank Pomeroy, said in a text message that she lost her daughter “and many friends” in the Sunday shooting. The text came in response to an interview request sent by The Associated Press to a phone number linked in online records to Frank Pomeroy. Sherri Pomeroy says both she and her husband were out of town and trying to get back to Sutherland Springs, outside of San Antonio. ___ 3:30 p.m. A law enforcement official says more than 20 people have been killed in a shooting at a church in a small town outside San Antonio. The official, who was briefed on the investigation, says the gunman fled the church in a vehicle after the shooting and was also killed, either by a self-inflicted wound or during a confrontation with police. The official was not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The official says between 10 to 15 people were also injured but stressed the investigation was early and the figures could change. Authorities are still trying to determine a motive. Federal law enforcement swarmed the scene to offer assistance, including ATF investigators and members of the FBI’s evidence collection team. Associated Press writer Sadie Gurman in Washington contributed to this report. ___ 2:45 p.m. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is calling a reported shooting at a church in a small town outside San Antonio an “evil act.” A sheriff says a man entered First Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, and started shooting, leaving multiple people dead and injured. Abbott tweeted Sunday: “Our prayers are with all who were harmed by this evil act.” He thanked law enforcement for their response. The Republican governor has also promised “more details” from the state’s Department of Public Safety soon. Sutherland Springs is about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southeast of San Antonio. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement that his office “stands ready to assist local law enforcement as needed.” ___ 2:35 p.m. President Donald Trump has tweeted from Japan that he is monitoring the situation in Texas following a mass shooting at a church. Trump tweeted: “May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas.” He added that the FBI is on the scene. Trump is in Japan as part of a 12-day, five-country Asian trip. ___ 2:25 p.m. A spokeswoman says the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is sending special agents from field offices in Houston and San Antonio to the site of a church shooting in South Texas. ATF spokeswoman Mary Markos did not immediately have further details. A sheriff says that a man walked into the church and started firing. Authorities say the attacker is dead. The number of fatalities or injuries hasn’t been confirmed by authorities, but a Wilson County commissioner, Albert Gamez, has told cable news outlets that he was told it was more than 20 killed and 20 wounded, though those figures aren’t confirmed. One hospital about 10 miles from the shooting says there “multiple” victims with gunshot wounds are being treated. Connally Memorial Medical Center spokeswoman Megan Posey declined to say how many patients were being treated at the hospital, but said the number was less than a dozen. The hospital is in Floresville, Texas. 2:15 p.m. A County Commissioner in Texas says he’s been told that more than 20 people were killed and more than 20 were wounded in an attack at a church, though he says those figures haven’t been confirmed.

Nick Uhlig tells The Associated Press that his cousin Crystal Holcombe and her in-laws Karla and Bryan Holcombe died in Sunday’s attack at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs. Crystal Holcombe was eight months pregnant. Uhlig says Bryan Holcombe did prison ministry, adding that he would go to the prison with a ukulele and sing for the inmates.

Authorities say 26 people were killed and about 20 others wounded in the mass shooting. ___ 11:30 p.m. A sheriff says there was likely “no way” for parishioners to escape once shooting started at the Texas church. Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt Jr. said Sunday night that the shooter fired several shots outside before entering the Sutherland Springs church and walking toward the front of the congregation. Tackitt says the gunman then turned around and opened fire on his way back out the front door. Tackitt says “I don’t think they could have escaped. You’ve got your pews on either side.” The sheriff did not name the shooter, but officials identified the gunman to The Associated Press as Devin Kelley.

RELATED: Photos from the scene of the Sutherland Springs, Texas church shooting The massacre comes just weeks after a sniper killed 58 people at an outdoor concert in Las Vegas, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The shootings have stirred a years-long national debate over whether easy access to firearms was contributing to the trend.

At the First Baptist Church, a solitary gunman killed at least 27 people (including the 14-year-old daughter of one of the church’s pastors) in the deadliest mass shooting that’s ever taken place at a U.S. house of worship. Now, CBS News reports that authorities have revealed the name of their suspect — Devin Patrick Kelley — who was reportedly discovered dead in his vehicle after a brief pursuit. The Facebook profile of Kelley has already been pulled from the social media network, but the Daily Beast and Daily Mail nabbed these screencaps. Reportedly, the gun was captioned as follows: “She’s a bad b*tch.” Outlets are currently digging up information on Kelley, a 26-year-old married man who taught Sunday school for a short period of time. He lived in the San Antonio suburb of New Braunfels, where authorities reportedly conducted a Sunday evening raid on his home. During a press conference in Stockdale, law enforcement officials revealed that an onlooker at the church disarmed the suspect before he fled. According to San Antonio ABC affiliate KSAT, Kelley was reportedly dressed in “full gear” before allegedly entering the church and beginning to fire at around noon on Sunday. Kelley served in the U.S. air force for four years before being dishonorably discharged and court martialed in 2014 following the domestic assault of his wife and child. CBS News reports that Kelley used an “AR-15 style weapon” during the course of the massacre. It should be noted that those who are dishonorably discharged from the military are unauthorized to lawfully possess firearms of any kind. UPDATE #1 – 11:00pm EST: CNN reports that a local resident may have stopped Kelley when he “grabbed his own rifle and engaged the gunman,” according to Texas Department of Public Safety Regional Director Freeman Martin. “The suspect dropped his rifle, which was a Ruger AR assault-type rifle and fled from the church.” A man who lives next to the church grabbed his own rifle and engaged the gunman who then dropped his rifle and fled https://t.co/fiIoEwoc0a pic.twitter.com/fvN56Fcy1c — CNN (@CNN) November 6, 2017 We will, of course, bring you further updates as this story develops.

Track president Eddie Gossage told USA TODAY Sports said the decision was made out of respect for the 26 people killed at a church outside San Antonio. “In light of what happened, it was the respectful thing to do,” Gossage said. The six-shooter celebration been a part of most race celebrations here since the track opened in 1997. HARVICK: Harvick takes Texas, advances to NASCAR final four JOHNSON: Championship hopes take huge hit at Texas Harvick, who earned his first career Cup Series win at Texas Sunday, had never participated in the six-shooter celebration before. The celebration has come under scrutiny before, including including when some questioned the National Rifle Association's sponsorship relationship with the track after the mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn in 2012. In the April 2013 NRA 500 at Texas, a man who was camping on the track's infield shot himself in the head. The Tarrant County (Texas) medical examiner's office ruled the death of 42-year-old man a suicide.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/9ktwgzcZULI/,"Violence erupted at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas Sunday when a gunman opened fire outside the building and then proceeded inside, killing at least 26 people and wounding at least 20 more. While the casualty count is still preliminary, these figures currently bring the toll of mass shootings in 2017 to 112 deaths, according to the Mother Jones database of massacres, which generally uses the federal definition in defining such incidents. That far surpasses any other year in the recorded history of modern mass shootings in the U.S. Sunday’s Sutherland Springs incident appears to be at least the fifth most deadly mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The Dec. 14, 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School claimed 27 lives. The deadliest shooting occurred in Las Vegas last month, when 58 people were killed at an outdoor music festival.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/Si6CQ3saTZs/,"President Donald Trump addressed the deadly mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas on Sunday, denouncing it as a “horrible act of evil.” At least 26 people died and 20 others injured when a gunman opened fire on the church during a Sunday service. The dead ranged in age from 5 to 72 years old. Speaking from Japan, where the President is on the second day of a 12-day Asia trip, Trump called for unity, appealing to Americans to “join hands” and “stand strong” in the face of adversity. Read Trump’s full statement below: Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and families of today’s murderous attack in Sutherland Springs, Texas. This horrible act of evil occurred as the victims and their families were in their place of sacred worship. We cannot put into words the pain and grief we all feel, and we cannot begin to imagine the suffering of those who lost the ones they loved. Our hearts are broken. But in dark times such as these, Americans do what we do best: we pull together. We join hands. We lock arms. And through the tears and the sadness, we stand strong. My Administration is providing its full support to the state and local authorities investigating this horrible crime. I have spoken with Governor Abbott, and we offer our thanks to the first responders who ultimately stopped the suspect and rendered immediate and lifesaving aid to the victims of this shooting. I will continue to follow developments closely. All of America is praying to God to help the wounded and the families — we will never leave their side. Write to Eli Meixler at eli.meixler@time.com."

X OUR PICKS: By NOMAAN MERCHANT and PAUL J. WEBER NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas (AP) — The man officials have identified to The Associated Press as the gunman in a mass shooting at a Texas church was discharged from the Air Force for allegedly assaulting his spouse and child, according to an Air Force spokeswoman. The spokeswoman, Ann Stefanek, said Sunday that Devin Kelley served 12 months’ confinement after a 2012 court-martial. He ultimately received a bad conduct discharge and reduction in rank. She said Kelley served in Logistics Readiness at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge in 2014. His job was responsible for moving passengers, cargo and personal property in military transportation. Authorities did not announce his name at a news conference on the shooting, saying only that the suspect was a white male in his 20s. But a U.S. official and a law enforcement official identified Kelley as the person who opened fire Sunday at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas, killing 26 people and wounding about 20 others. The U.S. official told the AP that Kelley lived in a San Antonio suburb and that he doesn’t appear to be linked to organized terrorist groups. The official said investigators are looking at social media posts Kelley may have made in the days before Sunday’s attack, including one that appeared to show an AR-15 style semi-automatic weapon. The official requested anonymity because the person did not have authorization to speak publicly.Related Articles

			Robert Durst charged with 1982 murder of wife Kathie Durst An address listed in online records as belonging to Kelley is located in New Braunfels, Texas, just outside San Antonio and about 35 miles from Sutherland Springs. Local records of an August traffic ticket issued in New Braunfels, Texas, for an expired registration and not having auto insurance give a birthdate that would make him 26 years old. At the address listed for Kelley in New Braunfels on Sunday, two sheriff’s vans were parked outside and police officers stood at the gate of a cattle fence surrounding the property. Law enforcement officials gathered at the property declined to comment on why they were there. Several messages left for his relatives went unreturned. Neighbors said that they heard intense gunfire coming from the direction of the address listed for Kelley in recent days. “It’s really loud. At first I thought someone was blasting,” said Ryan Albers, 16, who lives across the road. “It had to be coming from somewhere pretty close. It was definitely not just a shotgun or someone hunting. It was someone using automatic weapon fire.” A person matching Kelley’s name and date of birth also registered in 2014 to vote in Colorado, with an address listed in Colorado Springs, home of the U.S. Air Force Academy. The Colorado Secretary of State’s office lists his registration now as inactive. According to Texas Department of Public Safety regional director Freeman Martin, the gunman arrived at a Valero gas station near the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs at around 11:20 a.m. Sunday. He was dressed in black, wearing tactical gear and a ballistic vest. He crossed the street to the church, left his vehicle and started firing a Ruger AR assault-type rifle at the church. Then he entered the church and fired. As he left the church, the shooter met an unidentified area resident with his own rifle who pursued him. The suspect was found dead in his vehicle near the border between Wilson and Guadalupe counties. Martin said it’s unclear if he died of a self-inflected wound or was shot by the resident.

http://www.denverpost.com/2017/11/05/james-harden-houston-rockets-utah-jazz/,"Trending: HOUSTON — James Harden had just scored a career-high 56 points when he was asked if he knew he had fallen one point shy of the Houston Rockets’ record. 
Harden shrugged and replied, “We won, right?” 
						
And they did it with Harden only playing 35 minutes in a 137-110 victory over the Utah Jazz on Sunday night that ran their Western Conference-best record to 8-3. 
Harden fell just shy of Calvin Murphy’s 57 points against New Jersey in 1978, but he joined Wilt Chamberlain as the only players in NBA history to have 10 assists and shoot better than 75 percent from the field in a 50-point performance. 	


Harden had 13 assists and shot a sizzling 76 percent from the floor, hitting 19 of 25 shots after missing his last three attempts. The MVP runner-up was a perfect 7 for 7 from beyond the arc until he missed a step-back 3-pointer midway through the fourth quarter as the shot clock was about to expire. 
Even when the Jazz could deny Harden his shot, he dished it off for someone else to score. Eric Gordon scored 20 points, Trevor Ariza had 14 and Nene scored 13 off the bench. 
“That was one of the best performances I’ve ever seen,” Gordon said. “He was picking them apart and not just with scoring. What else can you do?” 
Ariza had the answer to that: nothing. 
“I don’t think there’s any defense for him, period,” Ariza said. “When he’s on, what can you do? Two people can’t guard him when he’s on like that.” 	


Harden received a standing ovation from the Toyota Center crowd, which rained down “MVP! MVP!” chants at multiple points during the game. He had 22 points in both the first and third quarters, 30 at halftime and sat for the final 7:32 of the blowout. 
Harden said he was unaware he was 8 for 8 in the first quarter and made his first 10 shots to start the game. 
“I mean, I was just shooting, I don’t really know,” Harden said. “I don’t pay too much attention to it.” 
Donovan Mitchell led Utah with 17 points in 25 minutes off the bench. Rudy Gobert had 13 points but was held to a season-low five rebounds in 25 minutes. 
The Rockets have won three straight, while the Jazz have lost back-to-back games following a three-game winning streak. 
Utah Jazz coach Quin Snyder called Harden one of the smartest players in the league. 
“We’re disappointed, obviously, in our group and our performance, particularly defensively,” Snyder said. “There wasn’t enough resilience, and there wasn’t enough toughness. There wasn’t a collective resolve that you need against a team that’s that talented and against a player that’s having the kind of night he was having.” 
Houston scored at least 119 points for a third straight game. Last season, the Rockets were 43-5 when scoring 110 points or more and 12-22 when failing to do so. Houston’s 23 3-pointers fell two shy of Cleveland’s NBA record, set last season. 
“I’m just going to hazard a guess when we shoot 59 (percent) from 3s, we’re probably not going to lose too many games,” Rockets coach Mike D’Antoni said with a grin. “That’s just a wild guess.” 
Jazz: Gobert received a technical foul late in the first half for shouting at an official following a dunk. … The Jazz shot 43.7 percent from the field, including 38.2 percent from 3-point range. 
Rockets: Clint Capela had eight points, eight rebounds and four blocks, including two on Gobert. … Houston made 59.3 percent of its shots, including 59 percent from beyond the 3-point line on 23-of-39 shooting. 
GREETING THE CHAMPS
Between the first and second quarter, the Rockets recognized the Houston Astros for their World Series win over Los Angeles, the first in franchise history. At midcourt, manager A.J. Hinch, outfielder Jake Marisnick and pitchers Lance McCullers, Mike Fiers and Dallas Keuchel held the World Series trophy to a loud ovation. Earlier in the day, several Astros players brought the trophy to the Texans’ game against the Colts. 
BILES’ MISS
As part of the Rockets’ new First Shot promotion featuring a local celebrity shooting a free throw before tipoff for charity, Olympic gold medalist gymnast Simone Biles became the first participant to miss her attempt. A made shot secures a $5,000 donation from the Rockets, while a miss equals $1,000. The 4-foot-9 gymnast from nearby Spring, Texas clanked her shot off the backboard to the right of the rim. 
MOMENT OF SILENCE
Prior to the singing of the national anthem, the Rockets observed a moment of silence for the victims of Sunday morning’s mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, near San Antonio.

“I mean, I was just shooting, I don’t really know,” Harden said. “I don’t pay too much attention to it.” 
Donovan Mitchell led Utah with 17 points in 25 minutes off the bench. Rudy Gobert had 13 points but was held to a season-low five rebounds in 25 minutes. 
The Rockets have won three straight, while the Jazz have lost back-to-back games following a three-game winning streak. 
Utah Jazz coach Quin Snyder called Harden one of the smartest players in the league. 
“We’re disappointed, obviously, in our group and our performance, particularly defensively,” Snyder said. “There wasn’t enough resilience, and there wasn’t enough toughness. There wasn’t a collective resolve that you need against a team that’s that talented and against a player that’s having the kind of night he was having.” 
Houston scored at least 119 points for a third straight game. Last season, the Rockets were 43-5 when scoring 110 points or more and 12-22 when failing to do so. Houston’s 23 3-pointers fell two shy of Cleveland’s NBA record, set last season. 
“I’m just going to hazard a guess when we shoot 59 (percent) from 3s, we’re probably not going to lose too many games,” Rockets coach Mike D’Antoni said with a grin. “That’s just a wild guess.” 
Jazz: Gobert received a technical foul late in the first half for shouting at an official following a dunk. … The Jazz shot 43.7 percent from the field, including 38.2 percent from 3-point range. 
Rockets: Clint Capela had eight points, eight rebounds and four blocks, including two on Gobert. … Houston made 59.3 percent of its shots, including 59 percent from beyond the 3-point line on 23-of-39 shooting. 
GREETING THE CHAMPS
Between the first and second quarter, the Rockets recognized the Houston Astros for their World Series win over Los Angeles, the first in franchise history. At midcourt, manager A.J. Hinch, outfielder Jake Marisnick and pitchers Lance McCullers, Mike Fiers and Dallas Keuchel held the World Series trophy to a loud ovation. Earlier in the day, several Astros players brought the trophy to the Texans’ game against the Colts. 
BILES’ MISS
As part of the Rockets’ new First Shot promotion featuring a local celebrity shooting a free throw before tipoff for charity, Olympic gold medalist gymnast Simone Biles became the first participant to miss her attempt. A made shot secures a $5,000 donation from the Rockets, while a miss equals $1,000. The 4-foot-9 gymnast from nearby Spring, Texas clanked her shot off the backboard to the right of the rim. 
MOMENT OF SILENCE
Prior to the singing of the national anthem, the Rockets observed a moment of silence for the victims of Sunday morning’s mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, near San Antonio.

Submit a News Tip Even when the Jazz could deny Harden his shot, he dished it off for someone else to score. Eric Gordon scored 20 points, Trevor Ariza had 14 and Nene scored 13 off the bench. 
“That was one of the best performances I’ve ever seen,” Gordon said. “He was picking them apart and not just with scoring. What else can you do?” 
Ariza had the answer to that: nothing. 
“I don’t think there’s any defense for him, period,” Ariza said. “When he’s on, what can you do? Two people can’t guard him when he’s on like that.”

Submit a News Tip Utah Jazz coach Quin Snyder called Harden one of the smartest players in the league. 
“We’re disappointed, obviously, in our group and our performance, particularly defensively,” Snyder said. “There wasn’t enough resilience, and there wasn’t enough toughness. There wasn’t a collective resolve that you need against a team that’s that talented and against a player that’s having the kind of night he was having.” 
Houston scored at least 119 points for a third straight game. Last season, the Rockets were 43-5 when scoring 110 points or more and 12-22 when failing to do so. Houston’s 23 3-pointers fell two shy of Cleveland’s NBA record, set last season. 
“I’m just going to hazard a guess when we shoot 59 (percent) from 3s, we’re probably not going to lose too many games,” Rockets coach Mike D’Antoni said with a grin. “That’s just a wild guess.” 
Jazz: Gobert received a technical foul late in the first half for shouting at an official following a dunk. … The Jazz shot 43.7 percent from the field, including 38.2 percent from 3-point range. 
Rockets: Clint Capela had eight points, eight rebounds and four blocks, including two on Gobert. … Houston made 59.3 percent of its shots, including 59 percent from beyond the 3-point line on 23-of-39 shooting.

http://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/gregg_popovich_limits_postgame_comments_out_of_respect_for_tragedy/s1_127_24940331,"Gregg Popovich doesn’t hesitate to tell the media what is on his mind. But on Sunday night, Pop kept his comments to a minimum after his  San Antonio Spurs’ 112-95 win over the Phoenix Suns out of respect for the church shooting nearby. Here’s video of the only comments he made to reporters after the game. Quick Popovich reaction… basketball not important after what occurred today in Texas #Spurs pic.twitter.com/8Iu7iWNJGy — Jabari Young (@JabariJYoung) November 6, 2017 Pop for America. He came out postgame, said this to reporters, and walked away. pic.twitter.com/RnHZINBL0P — Tim Reynolds (@ByTimReynolds) November 6, 2017 Popovich called basketball “meaningless” in the face of such a tragedy and said talking about the sport in light of the tragedy would be “pretty inappropriate.” A gunman opened up fire in a church Sunday in the small town of Sutherland Springs, killing 26 and injuring at least 16 others in what has gone down as the deadliest mass shooting in Texas. Sutherland Springs is just outside of San Antonio, so it’s easy to understand why Popovich and those in the organization felt particularly emotional about the shooting.

http://rssfeeds.jsonline.com/~/486734486/0/milwaukee/sports~Spursapos-Pau-Gasol-on-Sutherland-Springs-church-shooting-aposSomething-needs-to-changeapos/,"Speaking to reporters in the wake of Sunday's deadly mass shooting at a rural church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, San Antonio Spurs forward Pau Gasol said that America's gun regulations ""need to be addressed."" ""It’s anywhere — concerts, schools, churches, kids. I mean, it’s devastating. But it’s a reality that needs to be addressed,"" Gasol said before San Antonio's home game against the Phoenix Suns, per the San Antonio Express-News. ""I’m unaware of how or the powers behind the gun laws and gun organizations in this country, but you need to protect the innocent. It’s happened down the road. It could have happened to any of us. It could happen in the supermarket next time. It could happen anywhere. It’s gotten to a point that it’s really worrisome. Really worrisome.” More: Gunman opens fire at Texas church, kills 26 More:3 mass shootings in the past 17 months have been among nation's worst More: Sutherland Springs church shooting: What we know now The Spurs held a moment of silence before tipoff at AT&T Center, located about 30 miles from Sutherland Springs. Gasol, 37, tweeted his ""deepest condolences to the victims' families"" a few hours earlier. “I think anyone and everyone has to be concerned about your own well-being,” Gasol, who was born and raised in Spain, said. “Any person in this country has to be concerned. Things like this happen. Going to a concert, taking your kids to school, going to church. You name it. What can you do that you’re safe? I don’t know. Is a basketball game safe? I hope. Nothing has happened yet. I think there are measures of security that prevent that from happening. But what’s next? That’s what you have to wonder. “It’s too repetitive. It’s not something every 20 years. It seems like it happens once every week or two weeks. At what point do we say enough? I don’t know. Again, I know it’s a delicate subject but I hate for innocent people to get killed and for families to pay that price and carry that burden for the rest of their life. It’s sad. It’s really sad. It needs to be addressed. I hope that it is. I hope we see change and progress to prevent this from happening so often.” Quick Popovich reaction... basketball not important after what occurred today in Texas #Spurs pic.twitter.com/8Iu7iWNJGy Following the game, which the Spurs won, coach Gregg Popovich said winning a basketball game ""considering what's gone on today"" is ""pretty meaningless."" ""When you think about the tragedy that those families are suffering, it's just inconceivable and impossible to put your head around,"" Popovich said. ""So I think talking about basketball tonight is probably pretty inappropriate.""  "

Greg Abbott during a candlelight vigil held for the victims of a fatal shooting at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Sunday, Nov. 5, 2017, in Sutherland Springs, Texas.  The gunman who reportedly killed at least 26 people at a Texas church Sunday lived at a Colorado Springs mobile home park as recently as 2014, according to voter records. Law enforcement officials on Sunday evening identified Devin Patrick Kelley, 26, as the perpetrator in what was the worst mass shooting in Texas state history. Dressed in black gear and armed with an assault rifle, Kelley opened fire during a Baptist church service in Sutherland Springs, a small community outside of San Antonio. As of Sunday evening, 26 were confirmed dead and at least 20 others had been wounded. Preliminary reports on Sunday suggested Kelley had a troubled past. An Air Force spokesman told the Associated Press that he was discharged from the military for allegedly assaulting his spouse and child. He was sentenced to 12 months’ confinement after a 2012 court-martial, and ultimately received a bad conduct discharge and was demoted in rank. He served in Logistics Readiness in Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge in 2014, the AP reported. Sometime that year, he moved to the Fountain Creek RV Park in Colorado Springs, according to public records. Kelley registered as an unaffiliated voter in Colorado on Nov. 13, 2014, according to state voter records. But he never voted, and his registration was changed to inactive after his 2016 mail-ballot was returned. He did not have a criminal record here, according to a Colorado Bureau of Investigation background check. His next known address was New Braunfels, Texas, a suburb of San Antonio where he lived until Sunday’s shooting. Kelley was found dead after the shooting, but it wasn’t clear if the wound was self-inflected or if he was shot by a resident who confronted him. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

The violence comes just one month after the nation was rocked by the Las Vegas massacre, which left 59 dead and 527 injured after a shooter opened fire on a country music festival. The latest mass shooting targeted the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, a community of about 400 people located about 30 miles from San Antonio. The suspected shooter, identified as former airman Devin Kelley, died after a car chase. It remains unclear how he died or what his motive was. World leaders and American political figures took to social media to express sympathy for the victims and their families. Here is what they said: President Donald Trump tweeted his condolences from Tokyo Monday morning as he began the first leg of his Asia visit. He also released a statement calling the shooting a “horrible act of evil” and said he would “continue to follow developments closely” during his 12-day tour. Former President Barack Obama expressed condolences and called for a look at “what concrete steps we can take to reduce the violence and weaponry in our midst.” Echoing Obama’s call to action Minnesota Senator Al Franken urged “moral courage to address these senseless acts.” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott released a statement shortly before arriving on the scene in Sutherland Springs. He thanked law enforcement responders and called on all Texans to “pray for the Sutherland Springs community during this time of mourning and loss.” Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who was with President Trump as news of the shooting broke, sent messages of condolence through both Facebook and Twitter. “My thoughts are with those who suffered injuries in the incident. I wish to express heartfelt solidarity with the people of the United States during this difficult time,” he said. British Prime Minister Theresa May said her thoughts and prayers were with the victims of the shooting. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, said in a statement that it “is appalling that this act took place in a place of worship, where worshippers should have felt safe.” “On behalf of all Canadians, I extend my deepest condolences to the families and friends of those killed. We also hope for a speedy recovery to all those harmed today,” he added. From Mexico, President Enrique Peña Nieto offered his country’s “solidarity and condolences to all those affected.” Israeli President Reuven Rivlin also offered his prayers to the victims and families. The government of Venezuela issued a statement strongly condemning “this and any other act of violence whose purpose is to cause terror in the population.”  Write to Laignee Barron at Laignee.Barron@time.com."

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/486880686/0/phoenix/nation~Trump-aposMental-healthapos-is-the-issue-behind-the-Texas-shooting-not-guns/,"President Trump said Monday that better mental health — not gun control — is the key to the mass shooting that claimed at least 26 lives at a Texas church. ""I think mental health is the problem here,"" Trump said during a news conference in Tokyo, saying the shooter in Texas was a ""deranged"" man who should have received treatment. ""This isn't a guns situation."" Trump, who received heavy political support from the National Rifle Association and other gun owners, has been an opponent of gun control proposals that have arisen after a string of mass shootings in the United States. Trump also noted that a resident with a gun engaged the church assailant. ""Fortunately,"" the president said, ""somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction."" The president spoke at a joint news conference with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, the first stop in an Asia tour devoted to the issues of trade and North Korea's nuclear weapons. Abe seconded Trump's call that nations in the region pressure North Korea into giving up its nuclear weapons, and both leaders denounced Kim Jong Un's government for making nuclear threats toward their countries. ""We will not stand for that,"" Trump said. ""The era of strategic patience is over."" Abe, who announced Japan would soon be putting new economic sanctions on North Korea, said that ""all options are on the table"" regarding Kim's government, presumably including military ones. Noting that North Korea his fired test missiles over Japan, Abe said he is less interested in ""dialogue"" than in applying ""a maximum level of pressure"" on Kim. Trump, who will also travel to South Korea, China, Vietnam, and the Philippines over the next week, again said that other countries have unfair trade practices and closed markets, including Japan. Abe did not seem to agree, but said he would work with Trump on trade disputes. Earlier in the day, at a meeting with American and Japanese business leaders, Trump criticized the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. At one point, Trump said Japan should ""try building your cars in the United States instead of shipping them over;"" the Japanese built nearly 4 million cars on U.S. soil last year. For its part, Japan has criticized Trump for pulling United States out of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, saying the trade deal involving a dozen Pacific Rim nations would have benefited all members. Trump and Abe were more in accord over North Korea. Before the news conference, Trump and Abe met with relatives of Japanese citizens kidnapped by North Korea. ""We will work with Prime Minister Abe in trying to get them back,"" Trump said.  The prime minister stressed a close personal bond with Trump, and played up the ""unshakable"" alliance between Japan and the United States. Trump returned the favor, praising both Abe and Japan but adding that their economy was not as strong as that of the United States. ""You'll be second,"" he told the Japanese leader.  At the start of their news conference, Abe offered condolences to the United States over Sunday's mass shooting at the Texas church, saying he is in ""solidarity"" with the American people.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/06/this-isnt-a-guns-situation-says-trump-after-texas-church-shooting,"US president says mental health of perpetrator, not gun ownership, to blame for mass shooting in which 26 people died Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.15 BST Donald Trump has blamed Sunday’s deadly mass shooting at a Baptist church in Texas on the mental health of the perpetrator and claimed that gun ownership was not a factor. Asked during a press conference in Tokyo what policies he would support to tackle mass shootings in the US, the president said: “I think that mental health is a problem here. Based on preliminary reports, this was a very deranged individual with a lot of problems over a very long period of time.  “We have a lot of mental health problems in our country, as do other countries, but this isn’t a guns situation … we could go into it but it’s a little bit soon to go into it. Fortunately somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction, otherwise it wouldn’t have been as bad as it was, it would have been much worse. “This is a mental health problem at the highest level. It’s a very sad event … these are great people at a very, very sad event, but that’s the way I view it.” Speaking at the end of a two-day visit to Japan, Trump said he sent his “thoughts, prayers and deepest condolences” to the victims of the “horrific assault”, in which 26 people died and 20 others were wounded. The dead ranged in age from five to 72 years old. Flanked by the Japanese prime minister, Shinzō Abe, Trump paid tribute to the community of Sutherland Springs, a small town 30 miles (48km) south-east of San Antonio. “Beautiful area … so sad … Sutherland Springs, Texas, such a beautiful, wonderful area with incredible people. Who would ever think a thing like this could every happen? So I want to send my condolences, the condolences of our first lady. “In tragic times, Americans always pull together, we are always strongest when we are unified. To the wounded and the families of the victims all of America is praying for you, supporting you and grieving alongside you.” Law enforcement officials in Sutherland Springs did not name the gunman, though his name was reported elsewhere as Devin Patrick Kelley. The US Air Force said Kelley, 26, served from 2010 to 2014, when he left following a court martial. He received a bad conduct discharge for assaulting his wife and child. Kelley lived in the town of New Braunfels, about 35 miles from Sutherland Springs. On Sunday night police were at the property. The killing is the worst mass shooting in modern Texas history and one of the worst such gun rampages in recent years. The lone shooter was found dead after he was chased by locals and police across county lines. Trump’s defence of the retaliatory use of use of guns echoed comments made earlier by the Texas attorney general. American churches should be “arming some of the parishioners” or hiring “professional security”, Republican Ken Paxton told Fox News in an interview hours after the shootings at Sutherland Springs First Baptist Church. “It’s going to happen again.” If more churchgoers were armed “there’s always the opportunity that the gunman will be taken out before he has the opportunity to kill very many people”, Paxton said. The Texas governor, Greg Abbott, said on Sunday: “There are so many families who have lost family members, and it occurred in a church, in a place of worship. That’s where these people were mown down. We mourn their loss.” Two years ago, Abbott lamented that the state’s population were not buying enough guns. “I’m EMBARRASSED: Texas #2 in nation for new gun purchases, behind CALIFORNIA. Let’s pick up the pace Texans @NRA,” he tweeted in October 2015. The lone suspect, dressed in black tactical gear and a ballistic vest, drove up to the church during Sunday morning services and started firing inside. He kept shooting once he entered, according to law enforcement officials. Among the dead was the 14-year-old daughter of Pastor Frank Pomeroy, the family told several television stations."
http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/nov/06/gunman-targets-texas-church-20171106-1/,"SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas -- A man dressed in black tactical-style gear and armed with an assault rifle opened fire inside a church in a small South Texas community on Sunday, killing 26 people and wounding about 20 others in what the governor called the deadliest mass shooting in the state's history. The dead ranged in age from 5 to 72 years old, said Freeman Martin, the regional director of the Texas Department of Public Safety. Twenty-three were found dead in the church, two were found outside and one died after being taken to a hospital. The suspect was later found dead in his vehicle, Martin said at a news conference. Two people -- one a U.S. official and one in law enforcement -- who were briefed on the investigation identified the man as 26-year-old Devin Kelley. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the investigation. Martin said the attacker was dressed all in black, wearing tactical gear and a ballistic vest, when he arrived at a gas station across from the First Baptist Church about 11:20 a.m. He crossed the street and started firing a Ruger rifle at the church, and he continued after entering the building. As he left, he was confronted by an armed resident who chased him. A short time later, Kelley's body was found. There were several weapons inside his vehicle. Martin said it's unclear whether the attacker died from a self-inflected wound or if he was shot by the resident who confronted him. He said investigators weren't ready to discuss a possible motive for the attack. The U.S. official said Kelley lived in a San Antonio suburb and doesn't appear to be linked to organized terrorist groups. The official said investigators are looking at social media posts Kelley may have made in the days before Sunday's attack, including one that appeared to show an AR-15 semi-automatic weapon. In a brief statement Sunday night, the Pentagon confirmed that Kelley served in the Air Force ""at one point"" but didn't provide additional details. Air Force spokesman Ann Stefanek said Kelley received a bad-conduct discharge after being accused of assaulting his spouse and child, and he was sentenced to 12 months' confinement after a 2012 court-martial. Kelley served in Logistics Readiness at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge, she said. After the attack, federal law enforcement officers swarmed the small community 30 miles southeast of San Antonio to offer assistance, including members of the FBI's evidence collection team and investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Among those killed was the 14-year-old daughter of the church's pastor, Frank Pomeroy. His wife, Sherri Pomeroy, wrote in a text message to The Associated Press that she and her husband were out of town in two different states when the attack occurred. ""We lost our 14 year old daughter today and many friends,"" she wrote. ""Neither of us have made it back into town yet to personally see the devastation. I am at the charlotte airport trying to get home as soon as i can."" The wounded were taken to hospitals. Video on KSAT-TV showed first responders taking a stretcher from the church to a waiting helicopter. Eight victims were taken by medical helicopter to Brooke Army Medical Center, the military hospital said. Megan Posey, a spokesman for Connally Memorial Medical Center, which is in Floresville about 10 miles from the church, said ""multiple"" victims were being treated for gunshot wounds. She declined to give a specific number but said it was less than a dozen. RESIDENTS REACT Alena Berlanga, a Floresville resident who was monitoring the chaos on a police scanner and in Facebook community groups, said everyone knows everyone else in the sparsely populated county. Sutherland Springs has only a few hundred residents. ""This is horrific for our tiny little tight-knit town,"" said Berlanga. ""Everybody's going to be affected, and everybody knows someone who's affected,"" she said. Carrie Matula, who works at a gas station near the church, told MSNBC that she ran out to see what was happening after hearing gunshots. ""I never thought it would happen here,"" she said. ""This is something that happens in a big city. I would have never thought this would have taken place here. It's just too tight a community. It doesn't make sense."" Regina Rodriguez arrived at the church a couple of hours after the shooting and walked up to the police barricade. She hugged a person she was with. She had been at an amusement park with her children when she heard of the shooting. She said her father, 51-year-old Richard Rodriguez, attends the church every Sunday, and she hadn't been able to reach him. She said she feared the worst. Nick Uhlig, 34, is a church member who didn't go Sunday morning because he was out late Saturday night. He said his cousins were at the church and that his family was told at least one relative, a woman with three children and pregnant with another, is among the dead. He said he hadn't heard specific news about the other. ""We just gathered to bury their grandfather on Thursday,"" he said. ""This is the only church here. We have Bible study, men's Bible study, vacation Bible school."" ""Somebody went in and started shooting,"" he said, shaking his head and taking a long drag of his cigarette. Speaking in Tokyo today during his trip to Asia, President Donald Trump expressed his sorrow over what he called a ""horrific shooting"" at a ""place of sacred worship."" Trump said that ""our hearts are broken, but in dark times -- and these are dark times -- such as these, Americans do what they do best."" He said Americans will pull together to help those who are suffering, and he pledged to continue monitoring the investigation. Gov. Greg Abbott called the attack the worst mass shooting in Texas history. ""There are no words to describe the pure evil that we witnessed in Sutherland Springs today,"" Abbott said. ""Our hearts are heavy at the anguish in this small town, but in time of tragedy, we see the very best of Texas. May God comfort those who've lost a loved one, and may God heal the hurt in our communities."" Sutherland Springs is in a rural area where communities are small and tight-knit. The area is known for its annual peanut festival in Floresville, which was most recently held last month. ""We're shocked. Shocked and dismayed,"" said state Sen. Judith Zaffirini, a Democrat whose district includes Sutherland Springs. ""It's especially shocking when it's such a small, serene area. These rural areas, they are so beautiful and so loving."" The church is a white, wood-framed building with a double-door at the entrance and a Texas flag on a pole in front. A morning worship service was scheduled for 11 a.m. The first news reports of the shooting were between noon and 12:30 p.m. Hours after the shooting, the one-story rectangular church remained sealed off, with yellow tape posted along the church grounds. Reporters poured into Sutherland Springs throughout the day as the tragedy transformed the once-obscure Texas farming community into the scene of the latest mass killing. The unincorporated community has a population that numbers in the low hundreds -- the 2000 census was 362, according to the Texas State Historical Association. The church has posted videos of its Sunday services on a YouTube channel, raising the possibility that the shooting was captured on video. In the most recent service, posted Oct. 29, Frank Pomeroy parked a motorcycle in front of his lectern and used it as a metaphor in his sermon for having faith in forces that can't be seen, whether it be gravity or God. ""I don't look at the moment; I look at where I'm going and look at what's out there ahead of me,"" Pomeroy said. ""I'm choosing to trust in the centripetal forces and the things of God he's put around me.""

The star, who's gearing up to co-host the 51st Annual CMA Awards on November 8, shared the photo with her fans on social media which showed the youngster wrapping his arms around a poster of his mom. Underwood posted the adorable snap to Instagram, explaining that Isaiah spotted the photo display during a visit to a Dick's Sporting Goods store with his dad, former Nashville Predators captain Mike Fisher, which is where Carrie exclusively sells her popular Calia by Carrie Underwood athleisure range. As soon as little Isaiah saw the poster of his mom, Carrie revealed that he sweetly walked up and embraced the poster. ""The boys went to @dickssportinggoods and Isaiah just had to give Mama a hug!"" Underwood captioned the seriously cute photo of her little man, telling her followers that her husband Mike snapped the sweet moment after a trip out with their son. The (almost) family photo inspired a flurry of comments from Carrie's fans on the social media site, who responded by gushing over the ""Church Bells"" singer's sweet little man after he wrapped his arms around the 2D version of his mom on display in the sporting store.  ""Nothing more awesome than a boy's love for his momma,"" @cricketlou1969 then added in response to the adorable moment Underwood shared with her more than 6.5 million followers. And it sounds like Carrie and Mike's son is already growing up fast. Fisher shared a sweet story with his Twitter followers on November 5, telling his followers that their son picked out an impressive bedtime story while he and Underwood were tucking him in bed that night.   Mike tweeted that he asked their 2-year-old what story he'd like to be read before bed and revealed that his son's adorable response was, ""'I wanna read the Bible. Jesus loves me.'"" Fisher – who jokingly trapped his wife in a net for Halloween last week - then commented that Isaiah's request had ""made our day!"" But when she's not putting her bundle of joy to bed with a bible story, Carrie's gearing up for her 10th consecutive year co-hosting the CMA awards with fellow country superstar Brad Paisley. The twosome will be celebrating a decade of hosting together on November 8, and Brad recently confirmed that while they'll still be bringing forward their signature comedic approach to the show, things will take a more sombre turn as they pay tribute to the country music fans who lost their lives at the Route 91 Harvest festival in Las Vegas last month.  ""The theme of the show this year is very much about unity and coming together as a format,"" Brad then added. The 58th Annual CMA Awards 2017 will air live on ABC on November 8.

http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-sutherland-springs-texas-church-shooting-family-20171106-story.html,"SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, TEXAS — Houses of worship are among the few places left where families regularly gather together, sometimes extended and sometimes across many generations. The First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, is no different. And within those walls, gathered as they always are on Sunday mornings, were three generations of the Holcombe family. Bryan Holcombe was walking up to the pulpit on Sunday, preparing to lead the audience in worship, when a gunman began to spray bullets at the congregation. Holcombe, an associate pastor for the church, was killed in the gunfire, his parents, Joe and Claryce Holcombe, said in an interview with The Washington Post. Bryan Holcombe's wife of about four decades, Karla Holcombe, was also in church Sunday. She died too, said Joe Holcombe. Bryan and Karla had a son, Marc Daniel Holcombe, 36. He too was killed, Joe Holcombe said. Marc Daniel had an infant daughter, named Noah Holcombe, who, according to Joe, was a year old. She is dead too. Another son of Bryan and Karla, John Holcombe, is alive, said Joe. But his wife Crystal Holcombe is dead. Crystal Holcombe was pregnant. She and the unborn child were both killed. Crystal had five children. Three of them, Emily, Megan and Greg, died. She had been at church with her husband, John, who thankfully survived along with two of her children. That's eight members of the extended Holcombe family dead, in addition to the unborn child. All at once, Joe and Claryce Holcombe lost children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and a future great grandchild. The act of violence that wiped out generations of their loved ones took place in the space that mattered to them most: their church. The Holcombes were among the 26 people authorities say died in Sunday's mass shooting, the worst in Texas history. As the morning stretched to afternoon and evening, friends and family members in South Texas posted on Facebook, asking if anyone had heard from their loved ones. Joe and Claryce Holcombe first heard about the shooting an hour after it happened, through a phone call from a member of the church they attend, a different Baptist church in nearby Floresville, Texas. ""He said there was a big shooting and he didn't say much more than that,"" Joe Holcombe, 86, said. Then, in a conversation with the church's head pastor, they started to hear the wrenching news. ""Bryan and Karla?"" Joe Holcombe asked the church's pastor. ""They're both in heaven,"" the pastor responded. As the day went on, they would learn of the others. John Holcombe, who teaches Sunday school and runs the audio for Sunday services at First Baptist Church, was struck with shrapnel in his leg, he told Joe and Claryce Holcombe by phone later that day. His daughter remained hospitalized Sunday night, though mostly for observation, Joe Holcombe said. She was injured when another person fell on her, Claryce Holcombe said. Their grandparents described them as ""fantastic"" parents, and a ""happy family."" Crystal Holcombe home-schooled her five children and was heavily involved in the church, like the rest of the family. On Facebook, she reported proudly of her children's successes in competitions for their local 4H, and wrote about a recent bake sale in which the girls participated, benefiting families affected by Hurricane Harvey. Her husband, John, posted frequently about his lesson plans for Sunday school. For this week's lesson, he planned to focus on Exodus 16, he wrote in a Facebook post. It describes how God provided the Israelites with food as they traveled for 40 days in the desert, ""Manna from Heaven."" Bryan Holcombe was filling in Sunday for the church's lead pastor, who was out of town when the shooting happened. And according to his parents, the associate pastor has been involved in church work ever since he was young. ""We knew when he was born, that he was going to be a preacher,"" Joe Holcombe, his father, told The Post. ""His first word was God."" His first sentence? ""See the light."" On Facebook, Bryan Holcombe is shown hoisting his grandchildren on his shoulders, dressing up in costumes for church events, and playing his ukulele. He would often play the instrument and sing for prison inmates, a relative told the Associated Press. ""Grandkids, it doesn't get any better!"" Bryan Holcombe wrote on Facebook on one photo of his many grandchildren. ""I'll wake up at night and, in prayer, thank God for each of them . . . it takes a while:-)"" He and his wife Karla lived near his parents, between Floresville and Sutherland Springs. He ran a business on his parents' farm, making tarps for cattle trailers, Joe Holcombe said. Bryan and Karla Holcombe were high school sweethearts. One day, their high school was selling roses, offering to deliver them to the classrooms of admirers. So Bryan Holcombe delivered a rose to each and every one of Karla's classes that day. ""He thought she was cute, and she was,"" Joe Holcombe said. Karla Holcombe had the ""gift of hospitality,"" her mother-in-law said. She had planned on hosting the family's Thanksgiving. Joe and Claryce Holcombe, who are both retired teachers, hosted a group of nearby pastors and churchgoers at their home on Sunday as they waited for details about the deceased. They prayed together. ""It's of course going to be difficult,"" Joe Holcombe said about the days ahead. But, he said, ""we are Christians, we have read the book. We know the ending, and it's good."" ""They're in heaven,"" he added. ""And they're a lot better off than we are."" The shooting at First Baptist Church shattered scores of other families in this rural, tightknit community. Frank Pomeroy, the pastor of First Baptist Church, told ABC News that he did not attend the church service but that his teenage daughter, Annabelle Pomeroy, 14, was killed. ""She was very quiet, shy, always smiling, and helpful to all,"" Cynthia Rangel, 50, a resident of Stockdale, said of Annabelle Pomeroy. Rangel, a local emergency medical technician, said she knew three individuals who were hospitalized after the shooting and were undergoing surgery. ""This just all seems like it's not real."" As Michael Ward pulled wounded congregants out of the church, he searched for his nephew, three nieces and his sister-in-law, the San Antonio Express-News reported. ""My nephew was outside with four bullets in him,"" he said of Rylind Ward, 5. ""And Rhianna, the bullet broke her glasses, and broke 'em off, and she said she hid underneath the pew and didn't get hit,"" he said of his 9-year-old niece. Sandy Ward told MSNBC that her 5-year-old grandson was in surgery, and her 7-year-old granddaughter was killed. She waited at the hospital Sunday with her son. ""He's a wreck, of course, as you can imagine,"" Ward told MSNBC. ""I'm just in shock."" ""I'm numb,"" she added. ""My whole body's just numb."" Joe and Claryce Holcombe said they're still coming to terms with what happened. The shooter, Joe Holcombe said, is ""being rewarded right now for what he did, and for all of eternity."" But, Claryce added, ""we need to pray for his family, because they're going through a terrible time, too."" ""God will see us through,"" Joe Holcombe said. ""We'll all be together soon.""

The First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, is no different. And within those walls, gathered as they always are on Sunday mornings, were three generations of the Holcombe family.

Bryan Holcombe was walking up to the pulpit on Sunday, preparing to lead the audience in worship, when a gunman began to spray bullets at the congregation. Holcombe, an associate pastor for the church, was killed in the gunfire, his parents, Joe and Claryce Holcombe, said in an interview with The Washington Post. Bryan Holcombe’s wife of about four decades, Karla Holcombe, was also in church Sunday. She died too, said Joe Holcombe. Bryan and Karla had a son, Marc Daniel Holcombe, 36. He too was killed, Joe Holcombe said. Marc Daniel had an infant daughter, named Noah Holcombe, who, according to Joe, was a year old. She is dead too. Another son of Bryan and Karla, John Holcombe, is alive, said Joe. But his wife Crystal Holcombe is dead. Crystal Holcombe was pregnant. She and the unborn child were both killed. Crystal had five children. Three of them, Emily, Megan and Greg, died. She had been at church with her husband, John, who thankfully survived along with two of her children. That’s eight members of the extended Holcombe family dead, in addition to the unborn child. All at once, Joe and Claryce Holcombe lost children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and a future great grandchild. The act of violence that wiped out generations of their loved ones took place in the space that mattered to them most: their church. The Holcombes were among the 26 people authorities say died in Sunday’s mass shooting, the worst in Texas history. As the morning stretched to afternoon and evening, friends and family members in South Texas posted on Facebook, asking if anyone had heard from their loved ones. Joe and Claryce Holcombe first heard about the shooting an hour after it happened, through a phone call from a member of the church they attend, a different Baptist church in nearby Floresville, Texas. “He said there was a big shooting and he didn’t say much more than that,” Joe Holcombe, 86, said. Then, in a conversation with the church’s head pastor, they started to hear the wrenching news. “Bryan and Karla?” Joe Holcombe asked the church’s pastor. “They’re both in heaven,” the pastor responded. As the day went on, they would learn of the others. John Holcombe, who teaches Sunday school and runs the audio for Sunday services at First Baptist Church, was struck with shrapnel in his leg, he told Joe and Claryce Holcombe by phone later that day. His daughter remained hospitalized Sunday night, though mostly for observation, Joe Holcombe said. She was injured when another person fell on her, Claryce Holcombe said. Their grandparents described them as “fantastic” parents, and a “happy family.” Crystal Holcombe home-schooled her five children and was heavily involved in the church, like the rest of the family. On Facebook, she reported proudly of her children’s successes in competitions for their local 4H, and wrote about a recent bake sale in which the girls participated, benefiting families affected by Hurricane Harvey.  Her husband, John, posted frequently about his lesson plans for Sunday school. For this week’s lesson, he planned to focus on Exodus 16, he wrote in a Facebook post. It describes how God provided the Israelites with food as they traveled for 40 days in the desert, “Manna from Heaven.” Bryan Holcombe was filling in Sunday for the church’s lead pastor, who was out of town when the shooting happened. And according to his parents, the associate pastor has been involved in church work ever since he was young. “We knew when he was born, that he was going to be a preacher,” Joe Holcombe, his father, told The Post. “His first word was God.” His first sentence? “See the light.” On Facebook, Bryan Holcombe is shown hoisting his grandchildren on his shoulders, dressing up in costumes for church events, and playing his ukulele. He would often play the instrument and sing for prison inmates, a relative told the Associated Press. “Grandkids, it doesn’t get any better!” Bryan Holcombe wrote on Facebook on one photo of his many grandchildren. “I’ll wake up at night and, in prayer, thank God for each of them . . . it takes a while:-)” He and his wife Karla lived near his parents, between Floresville and Sutherland Springs. He ran a business on his parents’ farm, making tarps for cattle trailers, Joe Holcombe said. Bryan and Karla Holcombe were high school sweethearts. One day, their high school was selling roses, offering to deliver them to the classrooms of admirers. So Bryan Holcombe delivered a rose to each and every one of Karla’s classes that day. “He thought she was cute, and she was,” Joe Holcombe said. Karla Holcombe had the “gift of hospitality,” her mother-in-law said. She had planned on hosting the family’s Thanksgiving. Joe and Claryce Holcombe, who are both retired teachers, hosted a group of nearby pastors and churchgoers at their home on Sunday as they waited for details about the deceased. They prayed together. “It’s of course going to be difficult,” Joe Holcombe said about the days ahead. But, he said, “we are Christians, we have read the book. We know the ending, and it’s good.” “They’re in heaven,” he added. “And they’re a lot better off than we are.” The shooting at First Baptist Church shattered scores of other families in this rural, tightknit community. Frank Pomeroy, the pastor of First Baptist Church, told ABC News that he did not attend the church service but that his teenage daughter, Annabelle Pomeroy, 14, was killed. “She was very quiet, shy, always smiling, and helpful to all,” Cynthia Rangel, 50, a resident of Stockdale, said of Annabelle Pomeroy. Rangel, a local emergency medical technician, said she knew three individuals who were hospitalized after the shooting and were undergoing surgery. “This just all seems like it’s not real.” As Michael Ward pulled wounded congregants out of the church, he searched for his nephew, three nieces and his sister-in-law, the San Antonio Express-News reported. “My nephew was outside with four bullets in him,” he said of Rylind Ward, 5. “And Rhianna, the bullet broke her glasses, and broke ’em off, and she said she hid underneath the pew and didn’t get hit,” he said of his 9-year-old niece. Sandy Ward told MSNBC that her 5-year-old grandson was in surgery, and her 7-year-old granddaughter was killed. She waited at the hospital Sunday with her son. “He’s a wreck, of course, as you can imagine,” Ward told MSNBC. “I’m just in shock.” “I’m numb,” she added. “My whole body’s just numb.” Joe and Claryce Holcombe said they’re still coming to terms with what happened. The shooter, Joe Holcombe said, is “being rewarded right now for what he did, and for all of eternity.” But, Claryce added, “we need to pray for his family, because they’re going through a terrible time, too.” “God will see us through,” Joe Holcombe said. “We’ll all be together soon.”   Get Morning Report and other email newsletters"

James Harden dropped 56 points and 13 assists on Utah, one of the best defenses in the league, on Sunday. Per ESPN, the 91 points Harden created (points plus points off of assist) is the third-highest total ever, behind only Wilt's 104 in the 100-point game (dude had two assists!) and Harden's own 95 points created on New Year's Eve last season with a 53-point triple-double that included 17 assists. Harden is currently third in scoring and assists with Chris Paul out. More importantly, he has Houston on top of the Western Conference, a half-game ahead of each of Minnesota and the Warriors. Could this finally be the year Harden wins MVP after two runners-up finishes? It's something he and the Rockets care deeply about, based on their reactions to losing it last year to Russell Westbrook. We'll see how big an impact CP3 makes when he returns, but Harden's in the race right now and leads among the top players from top teams.

Here's what we know: Some key points: Of the 26 people killed, 23 died inside the church, two were killed outside the church and another victim was transported to a hospital and died, Martin said. More: Explore the data: U.S. mass killings since 2006 Sheriff Joe Tackitt of Wilson County, where Sutherland Springs is located, told the USA TODAY Network that 12 to 14 children were among the victims. When asked whether he expects the death toll to rise, Tackitt said he believes most of the people at the hospital are in stable condition. “It’s just a horrific sight,” Tackitt said of the scene inside the church. “You don’t expect to walk into a church and see something like that, especially when all the bodies were there, and seeing the children. That’s what hurts the most.”  Suspect in Sutherland Springs shooting confirmed to be Devin Patrick Kelley, 26, of New Braunfels, TX. More info to be released later today. Kelley was dressed in black and wore a mask and ballistic vest, Martin said. He began firing outside the church and then entered the building and continued spraying bullets. As he left the church, a local resident with a rifle confronted the gunman, who dropped his Ruger AR assault-type rifle and fled.  The killer was pursued by residents for about 12 miles at speeds of up to 95 mph before he crashed his vehicle. Sheriff Tackitt said Kelley died from a self-inflicted gunshot. Martin described the tragedy as possibly arising from a ""domestic situation"" involving the shooter's mother-in-law, a congregant at the church. He said the in-laws were not present at the time of the massacre, but came to the church after hearing about the shooting.  Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek told USA TODAY that Kelley served in the 49th Logistics Readiness Squadron at Holloman Air Force Base in southern New Mexico from 2010 until he was discharged. Kelley was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his spouse and their child. He received a bad-conduct discharge, was confined for 12 months and busted to the grade of E-1. He was discharged in 2014. Annabelle Renee Pomeroy, the 14-year-old daughter of the church's pastor, Frank Pomeroy, was one of the victims. She was remembered as ""a beautiful child"" by Pomeroy. He his wife were out of town when the rampage took place. Also among those killed: Eight members of one family spanning three generations — including a mother who was eight months pregnant — and a visiting pastor who was about to address the church.      President Trump tweeted from Japan: ""May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan.""

Trump also spoke with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, she said.

http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2017/11/06/devin-patrick-kelley-what-we-know-about-alleged-texas-gunman/,"Trending: By NOMAAN MERCHANT and PAUL J. WEBER, Associated Press NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas (AP) — The man officials have identified to The Associated Press as the gunman in a mass shooting at a Texas church was discharged from the Air Force for allegedly assaulting his spouse and child, according to an Air Force spokeswoman. The spokeswoman, Ann Stefanek, said Sunday that Devin Kelley served 12 months’ confinement after a 2012 court-martial. He ultimately received a bad conduct discharge and reduction in rank. She said Kelley served in Logistics Readiness at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge in 2014. His job was responsible for moving passengers, cargo and personal property in military transportation. Authorities did not announce his name at a news conference on the shooting, saying only that the suspect was a white male in his 20s. But a U.S. official and a law enforcement official identified Kelley as the person who opened fire Sunday at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas, killing 26 people and wounding about 20 others. The U.S. official told the AP that Kelley lived in a San Antonio suburb and that he doesn’t appear to be linked to organized terrorist groups. The official said investigators are looking at social media posts Kelley may have made in the days before Sunday’s attack, including one that appeared to show an AR-15 style semi-automatic weapon. The official requested anonymity because the person did not have authorization to speak publicly. Texas Department of Public Safety Regional Director Freeman Martin said Monday that the mass shooting stemmed from a domestic situation and was not racially or religiously motivated. Kelley reportedly had sent threatening text messages to his mother-in-law, who had attended the church. She was not there on Sunday. An address listed in online records as belonging to Kelley is in New Braunfels, Texas, just outside San Antonio and about 35 miles from Sutherland Springs. Local records of an August traffic ticket issued in New Braunfels for an expired registration and not having auto insurance give a birthdate that would make him 26 years old. At the address listed for Kelley in New Braunfels on Sunday, two sheriff’s vans were parked outside and police officers stood at the gate of a cattle fence surrounding the property. Law enforcement officials gathered at the property declined to comment on why they were there. Several messages left for his relatives went unreturned. Neighbors said that they heard intense gunfire coming from the direction of the address listed for Kelley in recent days. “It’s really loud. At first I thought someone was blasting,” said Ryan Albers, 16, who lives across the road. “It had to be coming from somewhere pretty close. It was definitely not just a shotgun or someone hunting. It was someone using automatic weapon fire.” A manager at a vacation resort in New Braunfels said Kelley worked there as a security guard. Claudia Varjabedian told the Associated Press that Kelley had been working at the Summit Vacation Resort for the past month and a half. She says Kelley “seemed like a nice guy” and didn’t give her any problems. She said he worked unarmed on his shift as the day security guard. The resort has an RV park, cabins and condos on the Guadalupe River. According to Texas Department of Public Safety regional director Freeman Martin, the gunman arrived at a Valero gas station near the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs at around 11:20 a.m. Sunday. He was dressed in black, wearing tactical gear and a ballistic vest. He crossed the road to the church and started firing a Ruger AR assault-type rifle outside. Then he entered the church and continued firing. As he left the church, the shooter encountered an unidentified area resident with his own rifle, and the men exchanged fire. The resident then got in the truck of a passer-by, Johnnie Langendorff, and they pursued the suspect north from Sutherland Springs until the fleeing car went off the road about 10 miles north of the church. Wilson County Sheriff Joe D. Tackitt Jr. tells CBS News that investigators believe Kelley fatally shot himself after the crash. The suspect was found dead in his vehicle. ___

A man opened fire inside of the church in the small South Texas community on Sunday, killing more than 20 people. Nick Wagner, Austin American-Statesman via AP Lisa Cavazos speaks with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott during a candlelight vigil held for the victims of a fatal shooting at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Sunday, Nov. 5, 2017, in Sutherland Springs, Texas.  Preliminary reports on Sunday suggested Kelley had a troubled past. An Air Force spokesman told the Associated Press that he was discharged from the military for allegedly assaulting his spouse and child. He was sentenced to 12 months’ confinement after a 2012 court-martial, and ultimately received a bad conduct discharge and was demoted in rank. On Aug. 1, 2014, El Paso County Sheriff’s deputies cited Kelley for misdemeanor cruelty to animals. Numerous witnesses said they saw him beat a dog with his fists. Jennifer Jones told deputies she saw a young brown and white Husky running loose near the back of her camping space. A heavyset man later identified as Kelley – with shaggy, dirty blond hair – ran up to the dog and jumped on top of it. “She stated the white male then began punching the dog with a closed fist near the head and neck area. She stated she witnessed four to five punches and then the male suspect grabbed the dog by the neck and drug him away,” an El Paso County deputy report says. Charles Harolds told deputies that Kelley was yelling at the dog to come to him and when it didn’t he tackled the dog and held it down with his knees and punched the dog. Brent Moody told deputies he saw the dog run away from Kelley. When Kelley caught up with it, he grabbed the dog and threw it to the ground. “He could hear the suspect yelling at the dog and while he was striking it, the dog was yelping and whining. The suspect then picked up the dog by the neck into the air and threw it onto the ground and then drug him away to lot 60,” Moody told the deputy. When El Paso County Sheriff’s Sgt. Ronald Mitchell convinced Kelley to open the door of his trailer home, he could tell the dog was undernourished. When he touched the dog he could feel the dog’s ribs. Kelley told the sergeant that his dog ran out of his camper and began acting aggressively to another dog. Kelley said he had to jump on the dog to control the animal. “He stated he then walked the dog back to the trailer without any other incident,” the report says. Kelley denied hitting the dog, throwing the dog to the ground or carrying it by its neck. Authorities took the Husky to the Veterinary Specialty Center. El Paso County Judge Daniel Scott Wilson sentenced Kelley to a deferred probationary sentence and ordered him to pay $368 in restitution. Wilson also ordered Kelley to pay a genetic testing surcharge of $2.50 and $78 to the victim’s assistance fund, court records say. The cruelty to animals charge was dismissed on March 31, 2016, after Kelley successfully completed his sentence, court records indicate. Before he moved to Colorado Springs, Kelley served in Logistics Readiness at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge in 2014, the AP reported. Sometime that year, he moved to the Fountain Creek RV Park in Colorado Springs, according to public records. Kelley registered as an unaffiliated voter in Colorado on Nov. 13, 2014, according to state voter records. But he never voted, and his registration was changed to inactive after his 2016 mail-ballot was returned. His next known address was New Braunfels, Texas, a suburb of San Antonio where he lived until Sunday’s shooting. Kelley was found dead after the shooting, but it wasn’t clear if the wound was self-inflected or if he was shot by a resident who confronted him. Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts"
http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/nov/06/latest-texas-church-shooting-gunman-had-self-infli/,"SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas — The gunman who killed 26 people at a small-town Texas church had a history of domestic violence and sent threatening text messages to his mother-in-law, a member of First Baptist, before the attack, authorities said Monday. A day after the deadliest mass shooting in state history, the military acknowledged that it did not submit the shooter's criminal history to the FBI, as required by the Pentagon. If his past offenses had been properly shared, they would have prevented him from buying a gun. Investigators also revealed that sheriff's deputies had responded to a domestic violence call in 2014 at Devin Patrick Kelley's home involving a girlfriend who became his second wife. Later that year, he was formally ousted from the Air Force for a 2012 assault on his ex-wife in which he choked her and struck her son hard enough to fracture his skull. In the tiny town of Sutherland Springs, population 400, grieving townspeople were reeling from their losses. The dead ranged from 18 months to 77 years old and included multiple members of some families. ""Our church was not comprised of members or parishioners. We were a very close family,"" said Sherri Pomeroy, the wife of the church pastor, who was out of town with her husband when the attack happened. ""Now most of our church family is gone."" The couple's 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle Pomeroy, was among those killed. Kelley's mother-in-law sometimes attended services there, but the sheriff said she was not at church on Sunday. The massacre appeared to stem from a domestic situation and was not racially or religiously motivated, Texas Department of Public Safety Regional Director Freeman Martin said. He did not elaborate. Based on evidence at the scene, investigators believe Kelley died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after he was chased by bystanders, one of whom was armed, and crashed his car. The 26-year-old shooter also used his cellphone to tell his father he had been shot and did not think he would survive, authorities said. While in the military, Kelley served in Logistics Readiness at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his 2014 discharge, Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said. He was discharged for the assault involving his previous wife and her child and had served a year of confinement after a court-martial. Under Pentagon rules, information about convictions of military personnel for crimes such as assault should be submitted to the FBI's Criminal Justice Investigation Services Division. Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said the service is launching a review of its handling of the case and taking a comprehensive look at its databases to ensure other cases have been reported correctly. Read Tuesday's Arkansas Democrat-Gazette for full details. 6:20 p.m. Texas law enforcement authorities say the gunman who killed 26 members of a church Sunday was shot three times, twice by a citizen. Texas Department of Public Safety Regional Director Freeman Martin said Devin Patrick Kelley was shot in his leg and torso by a citizen who pursued him after hearing gunfire. Martin said the third was ""consistent with being self-inflicted."" Authorities said they've collected hundreds of shell casings and 15 magazines that hold 30 rounds each at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, where Kelley opened fire Sunday. The dead ranged from 18 months to 77 years old and included multiple members of some families. Authorities say 10 victims remain in critical condition and four are in serious condition. 5:35 p.m. The Air Force says it failed to report the Texas church shooter's domestic violence conviction to the FBI as required by Pentagon rules. Devin Patrick Kelley was convicted of assault against his wife and stepson in an Air Force court-martial in New Mexico in 2012. The conviction should have disqualified him from buying or possessing firearms. Information about such convictions is supposed to be submitted to the FBI for inclusion in the National Criminal Information Center database. The Air Force said in a statement that the top two Air Force officials — Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson and Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein — have ordered a review of the Kelley case. Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said the Pentagon will also ensure records in other cases have been reported correctly across the Department of Defense. The church shooting left 26 people dead and 20 wounded. 5 p.m. The man some call a hero for engaging in a shootout with the Texas church gunman is a former National Rifle Association instructor. Stephen Willeford said in an interview with KHBS/KHOG television in Arkansas that he was at home in Sutherland Springs when his daughter heard gunfire at the church. Willeford said he retrieved his rifle, loaded it and ran barefoot to the church. He said: ""I kept hearing the shots, one after another, very rapid shots ... and I knew every one of those shots represented someone."" Willeford said he hid behind a pickup and exchanged fire with the gunman, adding: ""I know I hit him."" The gunman, Devin Kelley, got into his vehicle and fled. Willeford said he ran to a pickup and asked the driver, later identified as Johnnie Langendorff, to help him. They sped after the gunman. Kelley's vehicle hit a road sign and flipped into a roadside ditch. Willeford said he got out of the truck, perched his rifle on the truck's rooftop and yelled, ""get out of the truck,"" but saw no movement. Law enforcement came to the scene. They believe the gunman took his own life. 4:15 p.m. The owner of a restaurant and store across the street from the Texas church shooting says she sheltered one bloodied survivor. Terrie Smith says she saw the shooter's body ""shaking"" from the recoil of his weapon as he opened fire outside the church Fighting back tears, Smith said she and several customers fell to the ground and crawled back to the store. She says they locked themselves in and heard firing while the gunman was inside the church. Smith says that a victim ran out ""all bloody in his arms and face."" She says: ""We let him in. He said, 'Somebody went in and shot everybody. My family is in there, my family is in there.'"" The unidentified man then fell to the ground. The shooting left 26 people dead and 20 injured. 3:15 p.m. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz says that the ""bravery and courage"" of a citizen who shot back at the gunman in the Texas church attack should be celebrated. The Republican senator from Texas spoke after talking to law enforcement officials and visiting the church in Sutherland Springs where Devin Kelley killed 26 people and wounded about 20 more. When a reporter asked Cruz about gun control, he noted the recent terrorist attack with a truck in New York and said ""Evil is evil."" He then lauded the ""ordinary citizen"" who engaged the gunman. Cruz says that law enforcement officers showed him where the citizen hid behind a car and took incoming shots from the gunman. Cruz said he asked law enforcement what would have happened if the citizen had not used his own gun to confront Kelley. Cruz said they responded that the death toll would have been higher. 2:45 p.m. The gunman in a mass shooting at a Texas church had been arrested on an animal cruelty charge in Colorado in 2014. An El Paso County sheriff's office affidavit states deputies arrested Devin Patrick Kelley at a Colorado Springs RV park where he lived. One neighbor told a deputy that Kelley chased the young Husky, jumped on top of it and struck the dog with a closed fist several times. Another neighbor says Kelley grabbed the dog, threw it into the air, then onto the ground and dragged it to his camper. Kelley initially refused to leave the camper to speak with officers in the Aug. 1, 2014, incident. He denied abusing the dog. Officers arrested Kelley for misdemeanor animal cruelty and took the Husky to a veterinary center. Kelley was given a deferred probationary sentence and was ordered to pay $368 in restitution. He complied with the sentence. 2:40 p.m. Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen Pence, will travel to Texas on Wednesday to meet with those affected by Sunday's church shooting. Announcing his travel plans in a tweet, Pence said he will visit family members of those killed, those injured in the attack, and first responders in Sutherland Springs. Pence said, ""We are with you Texas."" At least 26 people were killed Sunday by a lone gunman, identified by police as Devin Kelley, and about 20 more were wounded. President Donald Trump is in the midst of a 12-day trip to Asia. 2:20 p.m. The wife of the First Baptist Church pastor says it gives her ""a sliver of encouragement"" that their 14-year-old daughter was surrounded by her church family when she died in the shooting. Sherri Pomeroy said Annabelle Pomeroy was with ""the church family that she loved fiercely and vice versa."" Pastor Frank Pomeroy and Sherri Pomeroy were out of town when the gunman opened fire Sunday at the church in Sutherland Springs, killing 26 people and wounding about 20. The gunman was later found dead in his vehicle. Speaking at a news conference Monday, Sherri Pomeroy said: ""Our church was not comprised of members or parishioners. We were a very close family."" She added: ""Now most of our church family is gone."" She said that her daughter, whom she called Belle, would have struggled to deal with losing so many people. 12:20 p.m. Authorities in Texas say law enforcement went to the home of the suspected church gunman three years ago to investigate a domestic violence complaint involving him and his then-girlfriend. Paul Anthony, a spokesman for the Comal County district attorney's office, told The Associated Press that sheriff's deputies were called just after 10 p.m. Feb. 1, 2014, to the New Braunfels home of Devin Patrick Kelley and his family. Citing a sheriff's office report, Anthony said a friend of Kelley's girlfriend told authorities she received a text message from the girlfriend that indicated ""her boyfriend was abusing her."" When sheriff's deputies arrived at the home, they were told by people in the house that there was no problem. No arrests were made. Kelley married Danielle Shields two months later. Kelley was discharged from the Air Force the same year after being punished for allegedly assaulting his spouse and child. 11:25 a.m. The special agent in charge of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives field office in Houston says three guns have been recovered from the suspect in the deadly church shootings in Texas. Fred Milanowski said during a news conference Monday that officers recovered a Ruger AR-556 rifle at the church. Milanowski said two additional handguns were recovered from the vehicle driven by Devin Patrick Kelley: a Glock 9mm and a Ruger .22-caliber. Milanowski said all three weapons were purchased by the now-deceased suspect. Freeman Martin with the Texas Department of Public Safety said Kelley did not have a license to carry a concealed handgun. He said he did have a ""noncommissioned, unarmed private security license similar to a security guard at a concert-type situation."" 11:10 a.m. Officials say that the 26 people killed in a shooting at a small south Texas church range in age from 18 months to 77 years old. Freeman Martin, a regional director of the Texas Department of Safety, said Monday that 20 were injured in the shooting Sunday morning at the church in Sutherland Springs. Martin says 10 people were still hospitalized in critical condition. Martin said those treated in hospitals ranged in age from 5 to 73. Authorities have said that Devin Patrick Kelley is suspected of killing 26 people during the shooting in Sutherland Springs. He was later found dead. 11 a.m. Authorities say the gunman who opened fire in a Texas church had sent threatening text messages to his mother-in-law, who attended the church. Texas Department of Public Safety Regional Director Freeman Martin said Monday that the mass shooting stemmed from a domestic situation and was not racially or religiously motivated. Authorities say that evidence at the scene leads them to believe that Devin Patrick Kelley died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after he crashed his car. He had been chased by armed bystanders. They say Kelley also used his cellphone to tell his father that he had been shot and didn't think he would survive. 10:10 a.m. Authorities believe the man suspected of killing 26 people and injuring about 20 others at a Texas church shot himself following a car wreck. Wilson County Sheriff Joe D. Tackitt Jr. tells CBS News that police found Devin Patrick Kelley dead inside his vehicle Sunday shortly after the shootings in Sutherland Springs. Tackitt says Kelley was being pursued by two community members and investigators believe gunfire was exchanged before Kelley's vehicle crashed. The sheriff says investigators believe Kelley shot himself after the wreck. 10 a.m. The man suspected of killing 26 people and injuring about 20 more at a Texas church had previously been charged with misdemeanor animal cruelty in east-central Colorado. Court records in El Paso County indicate Devin Patrick Kelley was cited on Aug. 1, 2014, when he lived in a mobile home park near Colorado Springs. He was given a deferred probationary sentence and was ordered to pay $368 in restitution. The charge was dismissed in March 2016 after Kelley completed his sentence. The Denver Post reports court records indicate someone was granted a protection order against Kelley on Jan. 15, 2015, also in El Paso County. 9:50 a.m. A manager at a vacation resort says the gunman who opened fire at a Texas church worked for the resort as security guard. Claudia Varjabedian is a manager at the Summit Vacation Resort in New Braunfels. She told The Associated Press on Monday that Devin Patrick Kelley had been working there the past month and a half. She says Kelley ""seemed like a nice guy"" and didn't give her any problems. She said he worked unarmed on his shift as the day security guard. The riverside resort in the Texas Hill Country is near Kelley's apparent home off a rural highway. Sheriff's deputies were still blocking the gate to his property Monday morning. 9:35 a.m. Several people remain hospitalized after a shooting at a South Texas church that killed 26 and injured more than 20 others. An official with University Health System in San Antonio said five people remained hospitalized Monday — three children and two adults. Martha Rendon says the patients range in age from 4 to 57 years old, with their conditions listed as being from serious to critical. Rendon also says one of the victims who died Sunday was a pediatric patient that had been transported to the hospital. She declined to release further details on the child. A spokeswoman for Connally Memorial Medical Center in Floresville said one person was listed in stable condition Monday. Megan Posey declined to release additional details on the patient. Officials with Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, which received eight patients on Sunday, did not immediately provide an update Monday. 8:35 a.m. Officials in Texas have confirmed the identity of the man suspected of killing 26 people at a South Texas church. The Texas Department of Public Safety on Monday morning said 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley is the suspect. DPS said that Kelley lived in New Braunfels, which is about 35 miles north of the Sutherland Springs church where the shooting occurred. A short time after the shooting Sunday, the suspect was found dead in his vehicle at the county line. On Sunday, two officials who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity had identified the gunman as Kelley. DPS says more information will be released later Monday. 8:20 a.m. A South Carolina musician with a similar name as the man identified as the gunman in a mass shooting at a Texas church says he's frustrated by hateful message he's received online. Devin Patrick said on his Facebook page late Sunday that he's saddened by the shooting but at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. But Patrick says his only connection with the tragedy is his name and asks people not to contact him about the shooting. Authorities have identified the gunman as Devin Patrick Kelley. Officials say 26 people were killed Sunday in an attack that claimed people ranging in age from 5 to 72 years old. Authorities said about 20 others were wounded. The suspect was later found dead in his vehicle. 8:10 a.m. School districts surrounding a South Texas town where a gunman killed 26 people at a church have added counselors to help comfort children, their families and staff. Sutherland Springs is a town of about 400 that does not have its own school. Nearby districts offered messages of caring and concern Monday, a day after the gunfire. Officials say the victims ranged in age from 5 to 72 years old. Superintendent Sherri Bays, of the Floresville Independent School District, wrote: ""Our hearts are breaking for the families of the deceased and injured."" District spokeswoman Kim Cathey says some Sutherland Springs children attend Floresville ISD schools. Cathey had no immediate information on whether any victims were from the district. Similar messages of prayers and support were offered by the Stockdale ISD and the La Vernia ISD. 7:45 a.m. A sheriff says the former in-laws of a man suspected of killing 26 people at a Texas church attended services there ""from time to time."" Wilson County Sheriff Joe D. Tackitt Jr. told CNN Monday morning that the former in-laws weren't in attendance Sunday when the shooting occurred. He says it wasn't clear why the gunman picked that day for the shooting. The mass shooting occurred Sunday morning at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio. About 20 others were wounded in the attack. Two officials who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity identified the gunman as Devin Kelley. An Air Force spokeswoman said records confirm Kelley received a bad conduct discharge after being court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his spouse and child. 7:05 a.m. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is suggesting there may have been a connection between the gunman who shot and killed 26 people in a South Texas community and the Baptist church where the slayings happened. Abbott tells ABC's ""Good Morning America"" he expects people will learn about any such link ""in a few days."" He said he didn't want to go further, saying ""law enforcement is looking very aggressively into this."" ""I don't think this was just a random act of violence,"" Abbott told anchor George Stephanopoulos. But when pressed to elaborate on his connection theory, the governor replied that ""it's very important that law enforcement have the ability ... to tie the loose ends of this investigation up."" He called the man, identified by a U.S. official and one in law enforcement as Devin Kelley, ""a very deranged individual."" 3:30 a.m. Authorities say a gunman armed with an assault rifle opened fire inside a small South Texas church, killing 26 people who ranged in age from 5 to 72. The mass shooting occurred Sunday morning at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio. About 20 others were wounded in the attack. Two officials who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity identified the gunman as Devin Kelley. An Air Force spokeswoman said records confirm Kelley received a bad conduct discharge after being court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his spouse and child. Wilson County Sheriff Joe D. Tackitt Jr. described the scene inside the church as ""terrible."" Investigators have not yet determined a motive for the attack. Copyright © 2021, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/11/06/the-texas-church-shooter-should-not-have-been-legally-able-to-buy-a-gun/23268276/," Devin Patrick Kelley, identified as the gunman behind the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history, had previously committed crimes that should have kept him from legally buying a gun. Kelley was discharged from the military after being court-martialed after a count of assault on his spouse and on his child. Both felony charges and domestic-violence charges should legally prohibit someone from buying a gun. Devin Patrick Kelley, the man authorities say killed 26 and injured 20 in the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history, should have been prohibited from buying a gun under US law, according to Texas Governor Greg Abbott. Kelley had been denied a license to carry a gun in Texas, Abbott told CNN. ""So how was it that he was able to get a gun? By all the facts that we seem to know, he was not supposed to have access to a gun,"" said Abbott. ""So how did this happen?"" RELATED: See photos from the scene of the attack: A former airman with the US Air Force, Kelley, received a ""bad conduct"" discharge from the military after charges of assault against his spouse and child led him to be court-martialed. Military members dishonorably discharged cannot legally purchase a gun, but Kelley's bad-conduct discharge falls just short of that mark. It's unclear if Kelley's assault charges constituted domestic violence, but such a conviction could have also legally disqualified him from gun ownership. But even if the assault charges didn't technically go down as domestic violence, assault alone can be treated as a felony, which should preclude gun ownership. And even if the charges didn't go down as felonies, the twin charges carried a maximum sentence of over a year in prison, and therefore should preclude gun ownership. The federal government's firearm transaction record, which buyers must legally fill out, asks about felony convictions. Kelley bought a Ruger AR-556 rifle, used in the attack on the church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in April of last year from an Academy Sports & Outdoors store in San Antonio, a law-enforcement official told CNN. The purchase of the gun took place two years after Kelley had been court-martialed, imprisoned, and discharged from the military. Wearing black tactical-style gear and carrying that rifle, Kelley entered the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs and opened fire on the churchgoers. ""You've got your pews on either side. He just walked down the center aisle, turned around and my understanding was shooting on his way back out,"" said Wilson County Sheriff Joe D. Tackitt Jr., whose territory includes Sutherland Springs. Tackitt added that there was likely ""no way"" for churchgoers to escape after the shooting started. The victims of the shooting range from 5 to 72 years of age. Kelley fled the scene when confronted by armed citizens, whom he then led on a high-speed chase. Authorities found Kelley dead in his car several miles from the scene. RELATED: See tributes to the victims of the attack: This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.

http://www.ibtimes.com/who-stephen-willeford-texas-man-pursued-church-shooter-own-gun-2610996,"A Texas man named Stephen Willeford was identified by authorities as one of the heroes of Sunday’s mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs. Willeford, 55, apparently confronted gunman Devin Kelley with his own rifle and “engaged the suspect,” Texas Department of Public Safety Regional Director Freeman Martin told the Daily Mail. Willeford confronted the suspect as he was leaving the First Baptist Church, where he had opened fire, killing 26 people. Willeford caused Kelley to drop his rifle, a Ruger AR assault-type gun, Martin said. It was then that another resident, Johnnie Langendorff, pulled up to the scene. “I pulled up to the intersection where the shooting happened,” Langendorff told KSAT. “I saw two men exchanging gunfire, the other being the citizen of the community.” Willeford then apparently approached Langendorff as Kelley fled the scene. “The neighbor with the rifle came to my truck and opened my door and said, ‘He just shot up the church,’ and got in,” Langendorff told “Good Morning America” Monday. “He said, ‘Chase him,’ so that’s what I did. I just chased him.” The pair pursued Kelley in Langendorff’s car down Route 539 at speeds of up to 95 miles per hour until Kelley lost control of his own vehicle and crashed into a ditch. Langendorff was on the phone with police during the chase. “The other gentlemen jumped out and has his rifle drawn on him,” Langendorff told reporters. “He didn’t move after that. We led police to him … From the time we actually stopped, it was about five to seven minutes. The police arrived and then they pushed us back and they took care of the rest. I didn’t see anything after that.” It was then that Kelley apparently took his own life, Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said. “We believe that he had a self-inflicted gunshot wound,” Tackitt told CBS News Monday.

https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/11/06/about-half-the-victims-of-texas-church-shooting-were-children/23268324/," About half of the victims killed in the worst mass shooting inside a house of worship in American history were children, including one who was only a year old, Texas officials said Monday. Twenty-six people were shot dead during the Sunday massacre at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, a small, tight-knit town about 30 miles outside of San Antonio. Of them, 12 to 14 were kids, according to Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt. The wife of the church pastor said their 14-year-old daughter was among them. RELATED: Tributes to the victims of the Texas church shooting The rampage was the largest mass shooting in Texas state history. In addition to the dead, 20 people were injured, said Freeman Martin, regional director of the Texas Department of Public Safety. Earlier, authorities had said victims were 5 to 72 years old; on Monday, Martin clarified that those were the ages of injured victims who were hospitalized, and that of the dead, the youngest was just 18 months, and the oldest was 77 years old. Related: Who Is Devin Kelley, the Texas Church Shooter? Freeman said 23 people died inside the church, two outside the church, and one at the hospital. Of the injured, six are in stable condition or have been released, four are in serious condition, and 10 are in critical condition. The identities of the victims have not yet been confirmed. According to The Washington Post, Joe and Claryce Holcombe lost eight members of their family, including children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Sherri Pomeroy, the wife of First Baptist Church pastor Frank Pomeroy, told NBC News that she and her husband were both out of town at the time of the shooting, but that their daughter, Annabelle, was killed. RELATED: Photos from the scene of the Sutherland Springs, Texas church shooting ""My husband and I were ironically out of town in two different states. We lost our 14-year-old daughter today and many friends. Neither of us have made it back into town yet to personally see the devastation,"" she said en route home from the Charlotte, North Carolina, airport. The suspect, Devin Patrick Kelley, 26, of neighboring Comal County, began firing outside the church at around 11:20 a.m. local time with an assault-type rifle, and then continued shooting inside, officials said. He died of a gunshot wound after a local resident confronted him and pursued him in his car, they added.

All rights reserved. BILLBOARD is a registered trademark of Billboard IP Holdings, LLC Lauren Mayberry of CHVRCHES performs on stage at 2016 Music Midtown at Piedmont Park on Sept. 17, 2016 in Atlanta. On Monday (Nov. 6), Chvrches frontwoman Lauren Mayberry took to Twitter to voice her concerns on the United States’ current lack of gun control, following the mass shooting at a church in Texas that occurred Sunday (Nov. 5), leaving at least 26 dead. The singer, who is originally from Scotland, filmed a video where she discusses remembering the horrific massacre that occurred two decades earlier in her childhood hometown, Dunblane. “In 1996, a gunman shot and killed 16 children and one teacher in a primary school there. I’ve been thinking a lot about that, in light of what happened in Texas yesterday,” she says in the clip. She also recalls how quickly after the mass shooting, the United Kingdom took action and changed its gun control laws, banning all handguns. Only one mass shooting has occurred in the U.K. since then. Chvrches Mayberry, who currently lives in the United States, calls out the Trump administration on their lack of action and their decision to value financial gain over the lives of the country’s citizens. “Mike Pence is among one of many republicans who take thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars from the NRA every single year, and he wants to talk about prayers and religion and being a good Christian,” she says.  “My thoughts and sadness and outrage are 100 percent with the people who lost loved ones yesterday, and in all these other horrific attacks, but prayers are not what stopped more atrocities like Dunblane from happening in the United Kingdom. Gun control did.” Watch Mayberry's video and read her full statement below. Until early in high school, I lived in a city called Dunblane in Scotland and in 1996, a gunman shot and killed 16 children and one teacher in a primary school there. I’ve been thinking a lot about that, in light of what happened in Texas yesterday. I live and work in America -- I’m not American, but I love it here. But some things are confusing to me and it’s confusing to me that some people -- some politicians -- are working to protect the second amendment on the interest of the gun lobby than to protect the people that they are supposed to be serving. I was just a kid when the attack in Dunblane happened. I didn’t go to the primary school where it occurred, but I remember it and I remember what happened afterwards. Britain changed its gun control laws. I think it’s easy to see that more than one issue can be at play at once. It is a mental health issue, and it’s somewhere on the scale from ironic to disgustingly hypocritical that Donald Trump is talking about mental health with regards to this attack when his administration has done nothing but try to restrict access to help get care for people who need it the most, but it’s also about gun control. You can’t stop everything bad from happening in the world; you can’t take away people’s impulse to do things like this but you can restrict their access to resources that would allow them to murder on a much bigger scale. Mike Pence is among one of many republicans who take thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars from the NRA every single year and he wants to talk about prayers and religion and being a good Christian. My thoughts and sadness and outrage are 100% with the people who lost loved ones yesterday and in all these other horrific attacks but prayers are not what stopped more atrocities like Dunblane from happening in the United Kingdom.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/9wxfp7bIkeY/,"Just one day after arriving in Japan for a 12-day trip across Asia, President Trump was briefed on yet another mass shooting that had happened on U.S. soil: the rampage in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in which 26 people were killed after a gunman opened fire on a church. This is the third time within five weeks that Trump had to comfort a nation in the midst of a national tragedy. The shooting occurred just days after a terrorist attack in New York City killed eight people and injured a dozen more, and a little over a month after a gunman opened fire on a country music festival in Las Vegas, killed over 58 people and injured over 500. The President’s response to the tragedy in Texas echoed his reaction to the shooting in Las Vegas, where he offered condolences to the victims and stressed the importance of national unity, rather than his response to the New York City attack, where he immediately began calling for immigration policy changes after the suspect was identified. News of the shooting began to break Sunday afternoon, at approximately 2 p.m. Eastern. At 3:06 P.M., Trump tweeted: “May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan.” At 5:54 P.M. Eastern — which was Monday morning in Japan — Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that Trump had been continuously briefed on the shooting and had spoken with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. “Our thoughts and prayers are with all of the friends and families affected. May God comfort them all in this time of tragedy,” Sanders says in a statement. Approximately three hours later, the White House issues an official statement from Trump thanking first responders, calling for national unity, and pledging assistance for the investigation. “We cannot put into words the pain and grief we all feel, and we cannot begin to imagine the suffering of those who lost the ones they loved. Our hearts are broken. But in dark times such as these, Americans do what we do best: we pull together. We join hands. We lock arms. And through the tears and the sadness, we stand strong,” Trump says in the statement. The White House also issues a presidential proclamation honoring the victims of the shooting. Trump subsequently addresses the shooting in remarks to U.S. and Japanese business leaders in Tokyo, reiterating the sentiments expressed in the White House statement. “Our hearts are broken, but in dark times — and these are dark times — such as these, Americans do what they do best: “We pull together. We join hands, we lock arms, and through the tears and through the sadness, we stand strong — oh, so strong,” he says. By this point after the New York City attack just days earlier, Trump had already said on Twitter that he had implemented policy changes, asking the Department of Homeland Security to intensify extreme vetting procedures after the suspect was identified as an immigrant from Uzbekistan. When a reporter tried to ask Trump about gun control policy after this event, according to a pool report, White House aides asked the media to leave. But Trump held a joint news conference Monday morning with Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, less than 24 hours after the attack, where a question about the shooting and possible gun control measures inevitably came up. He told reporters that mental health is the issue at hand, and that the gunman, who authorities have identified as 26-year-old Devin Kelley, was a “very deranged individual.” “We have a lot of mental health problems in our country, as do other countries. But this isn’t a guns situation. I mean, we could go into it, but it’s a little bit soon to go into it,” Trump continued. “But, fortunately, somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction, otherwise it would have been — as bad it was, it would have been much worse.” Write to Alana Abramson at Alana.Abramson@time.com."
http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/-s9MLZ-16tc/,"Bethane Middleton-Brown knows the pain the families and victims in Sunday’s mass shooting at a Texas church are feeling all too well. In June 2015, her sister, Rev. DePayne Middleton, was among the nine parishioners killed by a self-proclaimed white supremacist who had been welcomed at a Wednesday night Bible study class at Charleston’s Emanuel A.M.E. Church. In the wake of the tragedy at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas, where 26 people — including 8 members of one family and children as young as 18-months-old — were killed by a shooter during Sunday services, Middleton-Brown has offered heartfelt prayer for the victims and their families in a statement to TIME. “It is a horrific tragedy that continues to lurk its ugly face at the world, but I believe this too shall pass,” she said. “The families will feel the wrath of pain and the sinful ways of this old world and in time they will learn just as I have how to find a balance because the pain won’t go away, but you can live through it.” There have been numerous mass shootings since a gunman opened fire on the gathered group in the Emanuel church basement. In the time since, the families have grown all too familiar with the cycle — and in turn they, like the families of the Sandy Hook massacre and countless other tragedies, have become de-facto experts on grief and tragedy. Members of the media often call on them to offer thoughts and prayers and help for others who now find themselves members of an increasingly non-exclusive club they never imagined they’d be forced to join. It’s a responsibility they carry on top of the heavy burden of grief. In her prayer, Middleton prayed that the families find the same “patience, guidance and strength” she and the rest of DePayne’s family have had to find for themselves. “May they all be guided by God through the spirit of their beloveds,” she said. “I will carry their pain and burden in my heart because it’s just simply too great of a burden to bear alone. I pray for healing.” Middleton-Brown, who stepped up to take care of her sister’s children in the wake of the Emanuel A.M.E. Church massacre was not the only family member to speak out. Chris Singleton, the son of Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, expressed his grief in a series of tweets on Sunday. “The Lord blessed us with free will and at times like these I am destroyed by the things people do with it,” he said in one message. Singleton was one of the many Charleston family members who spoke out in forgiveness of his mother’s killer shortly after the shooting took place. At the time, he said, “love is always stronger than hate, If we just love the way my mom would, then the hate won’t be nearly as strong as the love is.” In a recent interview with USA Today, Singleton said he formed his own relationship with God in the wake of his mother’s death. For a while, he told the paper, he’d call his mom’s old cellphone just to hear her voice. He stopped about a year ago when a person answered — his mother’s number was taken. “Now, I have this video of my mom praying on my phone, at a funeral service of her friend’s dad,” he told USA Today. “She was ironically talking about how you get through that stuff. So I listen to that. It helps me get through tough times.’’ Malcolm Graham, a former North Carolina state senator and the brother of Cynthia Hurd, another of the Emanuel A.M.E. victims, says during a different time, before Emanuel, the bulk of the calls he received related to politics. Now, he says, whenever there’s a shooting his phone is ringing. The frequency of mass shootings in America has made healing all the more difficult, he says. A month after his sister and eight others were killed, there was another shooting at a military recruitment station in Tennessee. A few months later in October, a shooting on a community college campus in Oregon. And then in December, the terrorist-linked mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. So, too, has the familiar set of events that unfold after each shooting — the rush of coverage followed by a lull until the next tragedy. And, he says, the lack of action from lawmakers. “I think policy makers need to stop saying their thoughts and prayers are with the families. The folks in Charleston, the folks that died yesterday were in the church. These are prayed up folks. They were worshiping their God,” he says. “What they ought to do is get to work addressing these issues that affecting our country.” It’s time for lawmakers to “get their head out of the sand and acknowledge the elephant in the country,” which he says is “domestic terrorism” perpetrated by folks who have easy access to powerful weapons. “You should have the right to bear arms, you should have the right to protect your family, you should have the right to protect your property with a firearm,” he says. “But those individuals in Charleston, those individuals at the church yesterday, those individuals who were enjoying the concert in Las Vegas also had the right of liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” He’s calling on lawmakers to address what he calls “common sense” gun safety measures, including limits on the types of weapons people can buy, how many rounds the guns can shoot, background checks and resources for mental health needs. His message to the Texas families and community members, in the meantime, is to “be strong.” “Something that we learned when I was pledging a fraternity is this quote. It’s something that I had to repeat over and over to myself when Cynthia passed,” he says. “It says, ‘Be strong, we’re not hear to play, dream or drift, we have hard work to do and heavy loads to lift. Shun not the struggle for it’s God’s gift — be strong.'” “Encourage the families in Texas to be strong,” he says. ” To the faith leaders in that community, I would just encourage them to be strong and to demonstrate their faith. But also like James Chapter 2 says, ‘Faith without works is dead.’ They also have work that they have to do to help this country face some troubling issues.” Contact us at letters@time.com."

http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2017/11/06/gov-abbott-suggests-connection-between-gunman-texas-church/,"Trending: SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas (AP) — The Latest on the church shooting in Texas (all times local): 7:50 p.m. The two men who pursued the gunman after the Texas church shooting visited a vigil together and prayed with community members mourning the 26 people killed in the attack. Stephen Willeford and Johnnie Langendorff arrived at the vigil with relatives Monday night. They locked arms in a circle and bowed their heads in extended prayer. Many wept openly, including Willeford, who could be seen wiping away tears streaming down his chin. As the pastor shouted, “Jesus, this is your town,” the prayer broke up and the two men left. Willeford ran from his home with his rifle and confronted the gunman, Devin Kelley, outside the church Sunday. Authorities have said two of the bullets fired by Willeford hit Kelley in the leg and torso. The gunman fled in his vehicle. Johnnie Langendorff was driving by the church when Willeford flagged him down and they pursued the gunman in Langendorff’s truck. Kelley eventually crashed and was found dead in his vehicle. ___ 7:30 p.m. A sporting goods chain has confirmed that it sold two firearms to the man who shot up a church in a tiny South Texas community, killing 26 people. In a statement posted on the company’s social media, Katy, Texas-based Academy Sports & Outdoors confirmed that Devin Patrick Kelley bought the weapons from two different San Antonio stores, one in 2016 and one in 2017. The company also confirmed that the sales were cleared by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The company extended condolences to the victims and their families and said it was cooperating with investigators. The Air Force says it failed to report the Texas church shooter’s domestic violence conviction to the FBI as required by Pentagon rules. Information about such convictions is supposed to be submitted to the FBI for inclusion in the National Criminal Information Center database. ___ 7 p.m. An Air Force couple who retired to La Vernia, Texas, was trying out churches when they were slain in Sunday’s shooting in Sutherland Springs. Robert Marshall tells the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that his son Scott and daughter-in-law Karen were first-time visitors to the First Baptist Church, the scene of a rampage that left dead 26 congregants including children. Karen Marshall had recently returned to Texas after finishing an assignment at Maryland’s Andrews Air Force Base. Scott Marshall was retired from the Air Force and had been working as a civilian contractor and mechanic at Lackland Air Force Base, about 35 miles west of La Vernia. The couple met while they were in the service together more than 30 years ago. Another victim identified on Facebook by her family was 16-year-old Hailey Krueger. ___ 6:20 p.m. Texas law enforcement authorities say the gunman who killed 26 members of a church on Sunday was shot three times, twice by a citizen. Texas Department of Public Safety Regional Director Freeman Martin says Devin Patrick Kelley was shot in his leg and torso by a citizen who pursued him after hearing gunfire. Martin says the third was, “consistent with being self-inflicted.” Authorities say they’ve collected hundreds of shell casings and 15 magazines that hold 30 rounds each at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, where Kelley opened fire Sunday. The dead ranged from 18 months to 77 years old and included multiple members of some families. Authorities say 10 victims remain in critical condition and four are in serious condition. ___ 5:35 p.m. The Air Force says it failed to report the Texas church shooter’s domestic violence conviction to the FBI as required by Pentagon rules. Devin Patrick Kelley was convicted of assault against his wife and stepson in an Air Force court-martial in New Mexico in 2012. The conviction should have disqualified him from buying or possessing firearms. Information about such convictions is supposed to be submitted to the FBI for inclusion in the National Criminal Information Center database. The Air Force said in a statement that the top two Air Force officials — Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson and Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein — have ordered a review of the Kelley case. Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek says the Pentagon will also ensure records in other cases have been reported correctly across the Department of Defense. The church shooting left 26 people dead and 20 wounded. ___ 5 p.m. The man some call a hero for engaging in a shootout with the Texas church gunman is a former National Rifle Association instructor. Stephen Willeford says in an interview with KHBS/KHOG television in Arkansas that he was at home in Sutherland Springs when his daughter heard gunfire at the church. Willeford says he retrieved his rifle, loaded it and ran barefoot to the church. He says: “I kept hearing the shots, one after another, very rapid shots … and I knew every one of those shots represented someone.” Willeford says he hid behind a pickup truck and exchanged fire with the gunman, adding: “I know I hit him.” The gunman, Devin Kelley, got into his vehicle and fled. Willeford says he ran to a pickup truck and asked the driver, later identified as Johnnie Langendorff, to help him. They sped after the gunman. Kelley’s vehicle hit a road sign and flipped into a roadside ditch. Willeford says he got out of the truck, perched his rifle on the truck’s rooftop and yelled, “get out of the truck,” but saw no movement. Law enforcement came to the scene. They believe the gunman took his own life. ___ 4:35 p.m. The American flag mounted on the fence of Michael Ward’s home in Sutherland Springs was hanging upside down Monday. Neighbors say it had been that way since the Oct. 1 Las Vegas shooting, an apparent memorial to the 58 victims of that attack. Now the Ward family has lost several relatives, including children, in the Texas church shooting. Leslie Ward was setting up for a yard sale at the house when she heard gunfire. Her husband, Michael Ward, tells The Dallas Morning News that he ran inside the church and carried out his 5-year-old nephew, Ryland, who had four gunshot wounds. Ryland was transferred by helicopter to a San Antonio hospital. The boy’s mother and two of his sisters were among 26 people killed. On Monday, items were arranged for the yard sale, but no one was there. The flag remained upside down. ___ 4:15 p.m. The owner of a restaurant and store across the street from the Texas church shooting says she sheltered one bloodied survivor. Terrie Smith says she saw the shooter’s body “shaking” from the recoil of his weapon as he opened fire outside the church Fighting back tears, Smith said she and several customers fell to the ground and crawled back to the store. She says they locked themselves in and heard firing while the gunman was inside the church. Smith says that a victim ran out “all bloody in his arms and face.” She says: “We let him in. He said ‘somebody went in and shot everybody. My family is in there, my family is in there.'” The unidentified man then tfell to the ground. The shooting left 26 people dead and 20 injured. ___ 3:15 p.m. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz says that the “bravery and courage” of a citizen who shot back at the gunman in the Texas church attack should be celebrated. The Republican senator from Texas spoke after talking to law enforcement officials and visiting the church in Sutherland Springs where Devin Kelley killed 26 people and wounded about 20 more. When a reporter asked Cruz about gun control, he noted the recent terrorist attack with a truck in New York and said “Evil is evil.” He then lauded the “ordinary citizen” who engaged the gunman. Cruz says that law enforcement officers showed him where the citizen hid behind a car and took incoming shots from the gunman. Cruz said he asked law enforcement what would have happened if the citizen had not used his own gun to confront Kelley. Cruz said they responded that the death toll would have been higher. ___ 2:45 p.m. The gunman in a mass shooting at a Texas church had been arrested for animal cruelty in Colorado in 2014. An El Paso County Sheriff’s Office affidavit says deputies arrested Devin Patrick Kelley at a Colorado Springs RV park where he lived. One neighbor told a deputy that Kelley chased the young husky, jumped on top of it and struck the dog with a closed fist several times. Another neighbor says Kelley grabbed the dog, threw it into the air, then onto the ground and dragged it to his camper. Kelley initially refused to leave the camper to speak with officers in the Aug. 1, 2014 incident. He denied abusing the dog. Officers arrested Kelley for misdemeanor animal cruelty and took the Husky to a veterinary center. Kelley was given a deferred probationary sentence and was ordered to pay $368 in restitution. He complied with the sentence. ___ 2:40 p.m. Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen Pence, will travel to Texas on Wednesday to meet with those affected by Sunday’s church shooting. Announcing his travel plans in a tweet, Pence says he will visit family members of those killed, those injured in the attack, and first responders in Sutherland Springs. Pence says, “We are with you Texas.” At least 26 people were killed Sunday by a lone gunman, identified by police as Devin Kelley, and about 20 more were wounded. President Donald Trump is in the midst of a 12-day trip to Asia. ___ 2:20 p.m. The wife of the First Baptist Church pastor says it gives her “a sliver of encouragement” that their 14-year-old daughter was surrounded by her church family when she died in the shooting. Sherri Pomeroy says Annabelle Pomeroy was with “the church family that she loved fiercely and vice versa.” Pastor Frank Pomeroy and Sherri Pomeroy were out of town when the gunman opened fire Sunday at the church in Sutherland Springs, killing 26 people and wounding about 20. The gunman was later found dead in his vehicle. Speaking at a news conference Monday, Sherri Pomeroy said, “Our church was not comprised of members or parishioners. We were a very close family.” She added: “Now most of our church family is gone.” She said that her daughter, who she called Belle, would have struggled to deal with losing so many people. ___ 12:20 p.m. Authorities in Texas say law enforcement went to the home of the suspected church gunman three years ago to investigate a domestic violence complaint involving him and his then-girlfriend. Paul Anthony, a spokesman for the Comal County district attorney’s office, told The Associated Press that sheriff’s deputies were called just after 10 p.m. on Feb. 1, 2014, to the New Braunfels home of Devin Patrick Kelley and his family. Citing a sheriff’s office report, Anthony says a friend of Kelley’s girlfriend told authorities she received a text message from the girlfriend that indicated “her boyfriend was abusing her.” When sheriff’s deputies arrived at the home, they were told by people in the house that there was no problem. No arrests were made. Kelley married Danielle Shields two months later. Kelley was discharged from the Air Force the same year after being punished for allegedly assaulting his spouse and child. ___ 11:25 a.m. The special agent in charge of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives field office in Houston says three guns have been recovered from the suspect in the deadly church shootings in Texas. Fred Milanowski (mil-uh-NOW’-skee) said during a news conference Monday that officers recovered a Ruger AR-556 rifle at the church. Milanowski said two additional handguns were recovered from the vehicle driven by Devin Patrick Kelley — a Glock 9mm and a Ruger .22-caliber. Milanowski says all three weapons were purchased by the now-deceased suspect. Freeman Martin with the Texas Department of Public Safety said Kelley did not have a license to carry a handgun. He says he did have a “noncommissioned, unarmed private security license similar to a security guard at a concert-type situation.” ___ 11:10 a.m. Officials say that the 26 people killed in a shooting at a small South Texas church range in age from 18 months to 77 years old. Freeman Martin, a regional director of the Texas Department of Safety, said Monday that 20 were injured in the shooting Sunday morning at the church in Sutherland Springs. Martin says 10 people were still hospitalized in critical condition. Martin said those treated in hospitals ranged in age from 5 to 73. Authorities have said that Devin Patrick Kelley is suspected of killing 26 people during the shooting in Sutherland Springs. He was later found dead. ___ 11 a.m. Authorities say the gunman who opened fire in a Texas church had sent threatening text messages to his mother-in-law, who attended the church. Texas Department of Public Safety Regional Director Freeman Martin said Monday that the mass shooting stemmed from a domestic situation and was not racially or religiously motivated. Authorities say that evidence at the scene leads them to believe that Devin Patrick Kelley died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after he crashed his car. He had been chased by armed bystanders. They say Kelley also used his cellphone to tell his father that he had been shot and didn’t think he would survive. ___ 10:10 a.m. Authorities believe the man suspected of killing 26 people and injuring about 20 others at a Texas church shot himself following a car wreck. Wilson County Sheriff Joe D. Tackitt Jr. tells CBS News that police found Devin Patrick Kelley dead inside his vehicle Sunday shortly after the shootings in Sutherland Springs. Tackitt says Kelley was being pursued by two community members and investigators believe gunfire was exchanged before Kelley’s vehicle crashed. The sheriff says investigators believe Kelley shot himself after the wreck. ___ 10 a.m. The man suspected of killing 26 people and injuring about 20 more at a Texas church had previously been charged with misdemeanor animal cruelty in east-central Colorado. Court records in El Paso County indicate Devin Patrick Kelley was cited on Aug. 1, 2014, when he lived in a mobile home park near Colorado Springs. He was given a deferred probationary sentence and was ordered to pay $368 in restitution. The charge was dismissed in March 2016 after Kelley completed his sentence. The Denver Post reports court records indicate someone was granted a protection order against Kelley on Jan. 15, 2015, also in El Paso County. ___ 9:50 a.m. A manager at a vacation resort says the gunman who opened fire at a Texas church worked for the resort as security guard. Claudia Varjabedian is a manager at the Summit Vacation Resort in New Braunfels. She told The Associated Press on Monday that Devin Patrick Kelley had been working there the past month and a half. She says Kelley “seemed like a nice guy” and didn’t give her any problems. She said he worked unarmed on his shift as the day security guard. The riverside resort in the Texas Hill Country is near Kelley’s apparent home off a rural highway. Sheriff’s deputies were still blocking the gate to his property Monday morning. ___ 9:35 a.m. Several people remain hospitalized after a shooting at a South Texas church that killed 26 and injured more than 20 others. An official with University Health System in San Antonio said five people remained hospitalized Monday — three children and two adults. Martha Rendon (ren-DOHN’) says the patients range in age from 4 to 57 years old, with their conditions listed as being from serious to critical. Rendon also says one of the victims who died Sunday was a pediatric patient that had been transported to the hospital. She declined to release further details on the child. A spokeswoman for Connally Memorial Medical Center in Floresville said one person was listed in stable condition Monday. Megan Posey declined to release additional details on the patient. Officials with Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, which received eight patients on Sunday, did not immediately provide an update Monday. ___ 8:35 a.m. Officials in Texas have confirmed the identity of the man suspected of killing 26 people at a South Texas church. The Texas Department of Public Safety on Monday morning said 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley is the suspect. DPS said that Kelley lived in New Braunfels, which is about 35 miles north of the Sutherland Springs church where the shooting occurred. A short time after the shooting Sunday, the suspect was found dead in his vehicle at the county line. On Sunday, two officials who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity had identified the gunman as Kelley. DPS says more information will be released later Monday. ___ 8:20 a.m. A South Carolina musician with a similar name as the man identified as the gunman in a mass shooting at a Texas church says he’s frustrated by hateful message he’s received online. Devin Patrick said on his Facebook page late Sunday that he’s saddened by the shooting but at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. But Patrick says his only connection with the tragedy is his name and asks people not to contact him about the shooting. Authorities have identified the gunman as Devin Patrick Kelley. Officials say 26 people were killed Sunday in an attack that claimed people ranging in age from 5 to 72 years old. Authorities said about 20 others were wounded. The suspect was later found dead in his vehicle. ___ 8:10 a.m. School districts surrounding a South Texas town where a gunman killed 26 people at a church have added counselors to help comfort children, their families and staff. Sutherland Springs is a town of about 400 that does not have its own school. Nearby districts offered messages of caring and concern Monday, a day after the gunfire. Officials say the victims ranged in age from 5 to 72 years old. Superintendent Sherri Bays, of the Floresville Independent School District, wrote: “Our hearts are breaking for the families of the deceased and injured.” District spokeswoman Kim Cathey says some Sutherland Springs children attend Floresville ISD schools. Cathey had no immediate information on whether any victims were from the district. Similar messages of prayers and support were offered by the Stockdale ISD and the La Vernia ISD. ___ 7:45 a.m. A sheriff says the former in-laws of a man suspected of killing 26 people at a Texas church attended services there “from time to time.” Wilson County Sheriff Joe D. Tackitt Jr. told CNN Monday morning that the former in-laws weren’t in attendance Sunday when the shooting occurred. He says it wasn’t clear why the gunman picked that day for the shooting. The mass shooting occurred Sunday morning at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio. About 20 others were wounded in the attack. Two officials who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity identified the gunman as Devin Kelley. An Air Force spokeswoman said records confirm Kelley received a bad conduct discharge after being court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his spouse and child. ___ 7:05 a.m. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is suggesting there may have been a connection between the gunman who shot and killed 26 people in a South Texas community and the Baptist church where the slayings happened. Abbott tells ABC’s “Good Morning America” he expects people will learn about any such link “in a few days.” He said he didn’t want to go further, saying “law enforcement is looking very aggressively into this.” “I don’t think this was just a random act of violence,” Abbott told anchor George Stephanopoulos. But when pressed to elaborate on his connection theory, the governor replied that “it’s very important that law enforcement have the ability … to tie the loose ends of this investigation up.” He called the man, identified by a U.S. official and one in law enforcement as Devin Kelley, “a very deranged individual.” ___ 3:30 a.m. Authorities say a gunman armed with an assault rifle opened fire inside a small South Texas church, killing 26 people who ranged in age from 5 to 72. The mass shooting occurred Sunday morning at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio. About 20 others were wounded in the attack. Two officials who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity identified the gunman as Devin Kelley. An Air Force spokeswoman said records confirm Kelley received a bad conduct discharge after being court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his spouse and child. Wilson County Sheriff Joe D.

http://people.com/crime/texas-church-shooting-motive-domestic-threatened-mother-law/,"Twenty-six people were killed and 20 were injured in Sunday's mass shooting at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas Authorities believe it was “a domestic situation” — and not terrorism — that fueled Sunday’s mass shooting inside a small church in rural Texas, killing at least 26 people, including an 18-month-old child. During a Monday press conference, an FBI official confirmed that the shooter, 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley, had “expressed anger towards his mother-in-law,” who was a member of the congregation at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, the site of Sunday’s attack. The shooter, officials said, had sent his mother-in-law several threatening text messages, but no report was ever filed with police. Kelley is a former Air Force member who dressed in all-black tactical gear and was wearing a ballistics vest when he began firing from outside the church at around 11:30 a.m. local time, during a service. • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage? Click here to get breaking crime news, ongoing trial coverage and details of intriguing unsolved cases in the True Crime Newsletter. Sutherland Springs, with a population of just over 700, is about 35 miles southeast of San Antonio. After shooting from outside the church, the gunman then entered the church and continued to shoot. When the gunman exited the church, a local resident engaged him in gunfire, authorities said. The suspect dropped his weapon and fled, with the local resident in pursuit. A brief chase ensued into neighboring Guadalupe County, Texas, where the shooter was later found dead in his vehicle. He was likely killed by a self-inflicted gunshot wound, authorities said Monday. The shooting killed 26 — 23 inside the church, and two outside. One person died upon arriving at the hospital. A total of 20 were wounded; 10 remain in critical condition while 4 are listed as serious with 6 others in stable condition. The youngest victim was only 18-months-old, with the oldest aged 77. None of the victims’ names have been released by officials. Freeman Martin, the regional director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, said during Monday’s press conference that the gunman reached out to his father following the massacre, as he was being pursued by police. “The suspect used his cell phone to notify his father that he had been shot and didn’t think he was going to make it,” Martin said. “Subsequently, he shot himself … and the pathologist will determine the cause and manner of his death.” An Air Force spokeswoman tells PEOPLE the shooter served at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, working in logistics readiness. He was stationed there from 2010 until he was discharged in 2014, following a 2012 court-martial on accusations he assaulted his spouse and their child, the spokeswoman says. The shooter received a bad conduct discharge and 12 months’ confinement as well as a reduction in rank, the spokeswoman says. Martin confirmed that because of the court-martial, the gunman “did not have a license to carry” the rifle and two handguns investigators recovered from the crime scene. ATF Houston Special Agent in Charge Fred Milanowski said the shooter purchased two of the guns in Colorado and one in Texas. “He did have a noncommissioned unarmed private security license similar to a security guard at a concert,” Martin explained, which was granted after he passed both a criminal history and background check. Authorities are trying to determine how the gunman was able to purchase the weapons. Martin also said there is surveillance video of the shooting, which was recorded from inside the church. • PEOPLE’s special edition True Crime Stories: 35 Real Cases That Inspired the Show Law & Order is on sale now. “The crime scene investigation will go on for days,” Martin said. “The video will assist in the investigation and it was a horrific event and at this time we’re not prepared to talk about the video.” The gunman arrived at the church wearing a black mask with a white skull on it. Officials say they plan to update the media later Monday evening. "

On Sunday afternoon, as news broke of yet another horrific mass shooting in America, I found myself at the Music Center at Strathmore, awaiting the start of a recital from Joshua Bell and wondering how the American violinist’s affable, crowd-pleasing musicianship would speak to my feelings of helplessness and despair. By the end of Bell’s program, centered on three big Romantic-era sonatas, I felt little consolation or profound meaning. But in the moment, courtesy of Bell’s effusive lyricism, I experienced something perhaps even more valuable: transport through hedonic pleasure. Particularly in the recital’s first half, featuring Mendelssohn’s Violin Sonata in F from 1838 and Grieg’s Third Violin Sonata, Bell’s opulent and rhapsodic playing proved utterly disarming. Every sharply etched phrase, and every whispered aside, exuded musicality. Bell was sensitively partnered by the Italian pianist Alessio Bax, who offered limpid but never self-effacing accompaniment. After intermission, Bell and Bax took a more mellow and relaxed approach to Brahms’s First Violin Sonata in G (Op. 78), which made sense for such a serenely lyrical work. Yet this Apollonian restraint felt somewhat unnatural for Bell, and the duo’s honeyed tones could not quite keep their reading from sounding a little meandering. Bell’s entertainer’s streak resurfaced with a vengeance, though, in the three closing pieces announced from the stage: Brahms’s Hungarian Dance No. 1, with its playfulness and heart-on-sleeve emotions; the beguiling loveliness of “Meditation” from Massenet’s “Thaïs”; and the shameless pyrotechnics of Sarasate’s “Zigeunerweisen.” Bell has been wearing different hats lately: ambivalent conductor, collaborator with a celebrity chef and subject of a children’s book turned musical work. But in this recital, presented by Washington Performing Arts, the star soloist returned to surer ground, making glorious sounds from his violin in his favorite Romantic repertoire . And some days, that is enough. Some days, all one wants to do — all one can do, really — is to take a brief respite from reality and listen to some beautiful fiddle music while the world burns.

http://people.com/crime/charleston-church-shooting-victim-brother-on-texas-church-shooting/,"Malcolm Graham, who lost his sister when a gunman attacked a church in Charleston in 2015, speaks about Sunday's mass shooting at a Texas church Malcolm Graham still remembers the shock when he learned that his beloved sister had been shot and killed at a church in South Carolina two years ago, in a massacre of nine black churchgoers by a white gunman. So he says he understands the experiences of those who lost loved ones in Sunday morning’s mass shooting at a Texas church, which killed at least 26. “I know exactly what they’re going through,” Graham tells PEOPLE. “Shock, confusion, disappointment, struggling with faith, some of them may be. Dealing with the death of a family member in such a public way — this is someone dying in the worst of circumstances and it makes it that much worse.” Graham’s sister, 54-year-old Cynthia Hurd, was one of nine people killed in June 2015, during a Bible study class inside the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. While the shooters’ motives appear to differ — Charleston shooter Dylann Roof is a self-professed white supremacist while the Texas shooter was motivated in part by a domestic dispute with his wife’s family — the fact that both attacks were in a house of worship demonstrates a glaring lack of humanity, Graham says. “Even the church is not a sacred place to escape domestic terrorism,” he says. Graham says his sister thought of church as a haven: “It’s the place where she felt the most safe … and also the most welcoming. For her to be killed there, it’s heartbreaking.” Outraged anew that other families are now suffering motivates Graham, 53, to push for legislative action and “to lead a movement that we have to do something in this country.” • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

Graham, a former North Carolina state senator and city council member, says, “We really have to go to Washington and tell our leaders to get their heads out of the sand.” Possible solutions, he says, are to close loopholes allowing guns to be purchased without background checks and to limit the number of bullets that guns can fire, among other methods to shore up “weak gun laws,” he says. (It remains unclear how the Texas church shooter purchased his firearms, though authorities have said he had multiple.) RELATED VIDEO: At Least 26 Dead, Including Children, After Shooter Opens Fire on Texas Church Service Speaking about the massacre of a country concert crowd in Las Vegas last month, a few weeks before the Texas church shooting, Graham says, “You shouldn’t have the right to buy a semi-automatic weapon that converts to an automatic weapon that shoots 60 people in two minutes.” Graham says the fact that Kelley is dead allows families to avoid at least one wrenching aspect. “It spares them a trial,” he says. “Sitting there every day watching him [Roof], listening to him, discovering the evidence, hearing the coroner’s report was just heartbreaking.” Now, Graham says, it’s time for action. “It brings back to me, ‘Here we go again’ — whether as a country we are going to do something about it other than thoughts and prayers.” "

http://www.ibtimes.com/texas-church-shooter-devin-kelleys-ex-girlfriends-recall-stalking-harassment-assault-2611111,"After 26-year-old Devin Kelley was identified as the gunman in Sunday’s devastating mass shooting at a Texas church, two of Kelley’s ex-girlfriends came forward to discuss their encounters with him. Both detailed behavior including harassment and other strange incidents. “Years after dating me he would try to bribe me to hang out with him,” Katy Landry, one of Kelley’s former girlfriends, told NBC News. “He ended up assaulting me. He would stalk me by repeatedly calling me – even prank calling me, saying really weird stuff.” Landry said she met Kelley in church when she was a teenager. “He was very sick in the head,” she added. “He would tell me very sick strange things.” Another girlfriend named Brittany Adcock told NBC News she dated Kelley for two months when he was 18 and she was 13. When she ended the relationship, he continued to harass her, she said. “He somehow would always find out my number although none of my friends talked to him and he would constantly call me until I blocked his number,” she said. “Then I’d get calls from an unknown number so I’ve had to change my number quite a bit.” Adcock, now 22, detailed some of the encounters she had with Kelley after they broke up. “He would offer me money to hang out with him quite a bit,” she said. “There has been one point that I called the police because he was just calling me so much I wanted to report harassment. One time he told me I should move in with him and his wife and that he would take care of me as long as I walked around topless. Not long after that, his wife messaged me and asked why I’m talking to her husband and I told her what he was saying and sent her screenshots and she then apologized and then I was blocked from speaking to her.” Authorities were still searching for the motive behind Sunday’s shooting but noted that Kelley was involved in some kind of “domestic dispute” with his in-laws, who often attended the church. “The suspect’s mother-in-law attended the church,” Texas Department of Public Safety regional director said at a Monday press conference. “She has received threatening texts from him.” Kelley apparently killed his wife’s grandmother, Lula White, in the attack, CNN reported. The state of his marriage and name of his wife or ex-wife had not yet been released by authorities. Records showed that Kelley was first divorced in 2012 in New Mexico, but remarried in 2014, NBC reported. The current state of his second marriage was unclear. A former United States Air Force airman, Kelley was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and child. He was sentenced to 12 months confinement and was discharged due to “bad conduct” in 2014, Reuters reported. “She’s very upset,” Kelley’s ex-wife’s mother told NBC News, noting that she would not speak publicly about the situation until she was interviewed by authorities.

While authorities have not publicly identified a motive for the attack, they emphasized that the shooting did not appear to be fueled by racial or religious issues, as has been the case involving other rampages at houses of worship. Instead, they said the gunman had sent “threatening texts” to his mother-in-law as part of this ongoing dispute. “This was not racially motivated, it wasn’t over religious beliefs,” Freeman Martin of the Texas Department of Public Safety said at a news briefing. “There was a domestic situation going on within the family and the in-laws.” While the gunman’s mother-in-law had attended the church, she was not there Sunday when the shooting occurred, officials said. Investigators have scoured the gunman’s background since he opened fire Sunday morning inside the First Baptist Church outside San Antonio, searching for clues as the stories of those massacred began to emerge. There were 26 people killed in the church attack, the latest in a seemingly unending series of mass attacks in supposedly safe public spaces. The dead included eight relatives spanning three generations in a single family. While authorities had said Sunday that the victims ranged in age from 5 to 72, they said a day later that those were the people who suffered injuries and were being treated at hospitals. “Inside the church, the deceased actually ranged from 18 months to 77 years of age,” Martin said. The family that lost eight relatives said one of them was a 1-year-old girl killed in the attack. Another 20 people were wounded at the church, 10 of whom remained in critical condition Monday, Martin said. Texas officials early Monday identified the attacker as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley of New Braunfels, about 35 miles north of Sutherland Springs. They said the former Air Force member shot at the churchgoers with a Ruger assault-style rifle before coming under fire from a local man. Martin praised the efforts of “two Good Samaritans” who responded to the shooting, saying that a resident who lives near the church heard what was happening, took his own rifle and began firing at the attacker, hitting him at least once. Kelley dropped his rifle, jumped in his Ford Expedition and fled, Martin said. “Our Texas hero” flagged down another young Texan, hopped into his vehicle and they chased Kelley, Martin said. It was “act now, ask questions later,” said the truck’s driver, Johnnie Langendorff. During the chase, Kelley called his father on his cellphone to say “he had been shot and didn’t think he was going to make it,” Martin said. Kelley shot himself, though the cause and manner of his death will be determined after an autopsy, Martin said. Joe D. Tackitt Jr., the Wilson County sheriff, said Monday that though Kelley’s in-laws had attended the church, they were not there during services Sunday, and instead came to the scene after the shooting. Three guns were recovered Sunday, according to authorities: A Ruger rifle and two handguns, one a Glock and another a Ruger, inside Kelley’s vehicle. He had purchased a total of four guns during each of the last four years, officials said. Precisely how Kelley obtained his guns remained a key question for investigators. Kelley had been court-martialed in 2012 and sentenced to a year in military prison for assaulting his spouse and child, making him the latest mass attacker or suspect with domestic violence in his past. He was reduced in rank and released with a bad-conduct discharge in 2014. Kelley had sought and failed to obtain a permit allowing him to carry a concealed weapon, officials said. He had an “unarmed private security license” akin to what a security guard at a concert would have, Martin said. In televised interviews, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, R, said it appeared the church was intentionally targeted, rather than chosen at random, but said there were “more unknowns than there are knowns” a day after the attack. “By all of the facts that we seem to know, he was not supposed to have access to a gun, so how did this happen?” Abbott said in an interview Monday morning on CNN. “We are in search of answers to these questions.” Kelley had worked briefly over the summer as an unarmed night security guard at a Schlitterbahn water park in New Braunfels, the company said. He passed a Texas Department of Public Safety criminal background check before beginning work there, a spokeswoman said, though she added that Kelley was fired in July – as the season was reaching its peak – because he was “not a good fit.” He was also able to pass a background check that allowed him to work for HEB, a Texas grocery chain, in New Braunfels. Company spokeswoman Dya Campos said he worked there for two months in 2013 and quit; she was unsure of his position there. The attack on Sunday left a staggering hole in a Texas town of fewer than 700 people located about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio. “Nearly everyone [inside] had some type of injury,” Tackitt said. “I knew several people in there. It hasn’t really hit yet, but it will.” Tackitt said the inside of the church was “a horrific sight,” adding: “You don’t expect to walk into church and find mauled bodies.” Between 12 and 14 of the people killed or injured in the attack were children, he said. Wearing a crisp white button-down shirt, jeans and a beige Stetson, Tackitt spent Monday morning speaking to reporters about what happened, which he called “part of the job.” He had been at the scene Sunday, returned home just long enough to shower, check in on his family and return to the scene. Tackitt said he knew people inside the church but had not begun to mourn yet. The massacre outside San Antonio added Sutherland Springs to the growing roster of places synonymous with a mass tragedy, and it came just a month after 58 people in Las Vegas were gunned down in the country’s deadliest modern mass shooting. In recent years, gunfire has cut short scores of lives in shootings at movie theaters, concerts, churches, nightclubs, schools and offices. After the church massacre Sunday, officials in some of the places that have endured their own tragedies – including Aurora, Colorado; San Bernardino, California; Orlando; and Las Vegas – issued public statements of mourning for Sutherland Springs, the newest member of this grim fraternity. President Donald Trump appeared to try to steer the debate away from gun control after the slayings. At a news conference in Tokyo, Trump said he thought “mental health” was a possible motive, adding that it appeared the shooter was “a very deranged individual, a lot of problems for a long period of time.” He did not provide further explanation. Trump’s reaction contrasted with his unrestrained calls for a death sentence for the Uzbek immigrant accused of killing eight people in an apparently Islamic State-inspired attack in Lower Manhattan last week. Trump said the Texas incident “isn’t a guns situation,” and added: “Fortunately someone else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction” or the rampage “would have been much worse.” No one inside the church was armed at the time of the attack, the sheriff said Monday, saying he was not surprised by that fact. “People from this community would never think this could happen,” he said. Witnesses and officials said the gunman in Texas, dressed in all black and wearing a tactical vest, began firing an assault rifle as he approached the church. Texas state officials said Monday he was also wearing a black mask with a white skull face on it. He killed two people outside before entering the church and spraying bullets at the congregation during morning worship, police said. Authorities on Monday said that Kelley was inside for some time. The attack tore apart families in this small community. Joe and Claryce Holcombe lost children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren all at once, a total of eight extended family members, the couple said in a phone interview with The Post. Their son, Bryan Holcombe, 60, and his wife, Karla Holcombe, 58, were killed. Bryan was associate pastor for the church and walking to preach at the pulpit when he was shot, Joe Holcombe said. Among the dead was also their granddaughter-in-law, Crystal Holcombe, who was pregnant. She died along with her unborn child and three of her children – Emily, Megan and Greg – according to Joe Holcombe. She was at church with her husband, John Holcombe, who survived along with two of her other children. Their grandson, Marc Daniel Holcombe, and his infant daughter, who was about a year old, also died, Joe and Claryce Holcombe said. Frank Pomeroy, the pastor of First Baptist, and his wife, Sherri, spoke to reporters through tears. Their 14-year-old daughter Annabelle – known as Belle – was among those killed in her father’s church, although both parents were out of town at the time. But the couple lost much more than their daughter, they said. “We ate together, we laughed together, we cried together and we worshiped together. Now most of church family is gone,” Sherri Pomeroy said. “Our building is probably beyond repair, and the few of us that are left behind lost tragically yesterday. As senseless as this tragedy was, our sweet Belle would not have been able to deal with all the family she lost yesterday.” She added: “Please don’t forget Sutherland Springs.” Berman reported from Washington.

The Texas shooter, identified as 26-year-old Devin Kelley, a disgraced former Air Force member, was dressed in all-black tactical gear when he began firing with an assault rifle from outside of the church around 11:20 a.m. local time. The shooter was killed by a self-inflicted gunshot wound later Sunday in a neighboring county after fleeing the church. Authorities on Monday said the attack stemmed from a domestic dispute, and that the shooter had sent threatening text messages to his mother-in-law, who attended the church. Here are names, photos and tributes to those killed in the shooting. This list will be updated as more information is available. Annabelle Pomeroy’s father, Frank Pomeroy, is the pastor at First Baptist Church but he and his wife were traveling on Sunday — though his 14-year-old daughter still attended service, where she was killed in the shooting. Speaking to ABC News, Frank described Annabelle as “one very beautiful, special child” and said he was in Oklahoma during the rampage. (PEOPLE has not been able to reach the family for comment.) The teen’s mother, Sherri Pomeroy, told CBS News on Sunday that she was in North Carolina and “trying to get home as soon as I can.” According to ABC, Annabelle was her father’s youngest daughter. “We don’t want to overshadow the other lives lost yesterday,” Sherri told reporters on Monday. “We lost more than Belle yesterday, and one thing that gives me a sliver of encouragement is the fact that Belle was surrounded yesterday by her church family that she loved fiercely and vice versa.” Our building is probably beyond repair and the few of us that are left behind, lost tragically,” she continued. “As senseless as this tragedy was, our sweet Belle would not have been able to deal with losing so much family yesterday. Please don’t forget Sutherland Springs.” A grieving Charlene Uhl tells PEOPLE her 16-year-old daughter, Haley Krueger, was among the worshippers killed during Sunday’s mass shooting. (A family friend also said Haley was killed in a GoFundMe set up to support the family.) Haley regularly attended services at the church where she died and even arrived early Sunday morning to help prepare breakfast for the parishioners, her mom says. “She just loved life and loved everybody she met,” Uhl says. “She loved her church. She was always hyper and ready for anything. She wanted to go to school and be a nurse in the NICU. She loved babies. She had two nephews and adored both of them.” Haley’s death comes just two years after her father died suddenly, Uhl says. “I already miss her so much.” Joann Ward “was a very loving person,” Gary Zwicke, the uncle of her husband, Chris Ward, tells PEOPLE. Two of Joann’s children were also killed in the attack: Brooke Ward, 5, and 7-year-old Emily Garza. Joann’s 5-year-old stepson, Ryland Ward, survived but was taken to the hospital in dire condition, the family tells PEOPLE. Joann “cared about people, especially the disabled and people that needed help,” Zwicke says. “She would help disabled people in her community and would help wherever she could.” According to Zwicke, Joann’s family was devoted to their Christian faith and attended church every Sunday. As the attack unfolded, Joann was “shielding [her] babies from the shooter,” her friend Vonda Greek Smith wrote on Facebook. The girls’ older sister, 9, had her glasses shot off her head but survived, the family says. Brooke, Joann’s daughter with husband Chris, loved to accompany her mom and sublings to church. “They pretty much went every Sunday,” says Zwicke. Joanne’s middle daughter, Emily, accompanied her mom to church while stepfather Chris stayed home to sleep after working a night shift. “They were good kids,” says Zwicke. Three generations of the Holcombe family were killed in Sunday’s shooting, according to relatives and family friends. Bryan and Karla Holcombe were killed alongside their son Marc Holcombe and Marc’s daughter, Noah Holcombe, as well as their daughter-in-law Crystal Holcombe and her three young children, Greg, Emily and Megan Hill. The deaths were confirmed to PEOPLE by Bryan’s father, Joe Holcombe. Multiple online fundraisers set up to support the survivors also noted the death of eight of the Holcombe family. Joe, 86, says two of Crystal’s children survived the attack as did her husband, John Holcombe, who is one of Joe’s grandsons. Citing the strength of his faith, Joe says, “It’s not as hard on us because we know we’ll be together again and it will be for a long time this time.” Pregnant with her sixth child — and husband John’s first — Crystal was devoted to home-schooling. “She was full of spunk and wanted to raise very smart children,” says high school teacher Tambria Read. Crystal also lost her unborn child in the shooting. On Facebook on Wednesday, husband John explained that though they didn’t know the child’s sex yet they already had a name. “This includes Crystal’s pick for a girl, a boy, and the nickname [Billy Bob] the kids gave the baby,” he wrote. “Crystal was very thoughtful when coming up with these names. Carlin means small champion.” John noted that the child’s first name was an echo of the names for several other relatives, including his mother, Karla, and the mother of Crystal’s first husband, Carolyn Hill. Megan and her sister, Emily, took top spots in 4-H culinary competitions, according to Crystal’s Facebook page, and were baking cookies to raise money for Hurricane Harvey victims. Emily had a flair for archery — she won third place in a 4-H competition — and baking Snickerdoodles. “Emily was quite the little lady,” says a family member. “Real prim and proper. A very sweet child.” Greg was the oldest of Crystal’s three children killed. “Greg was a very happy boy — loved life and everything about it,” says a family member. “He loved to eat and ride go-carts. He raised goats and chickens too.” Bryan, a canvas shop owner and volunteer pastor, was married to his high school sweetheart, Karla, almost 40 years. “He was a fine kid,” says Joe, his father. “We know he’s in heaven.” Friend Tambria Read says, “Bryan always had a big smile on his face.” Bryan was set to preach on Sunday at First Baptist because pastor Frank Pomeroy was traveling. Joe says Bryan filled the role of associate pastor for the congregation, though he volunteered his time and wasn’t salaried. The assistant church secretary and Sunday school teacher, Karla “ran around all day most every day helping people that needed help,” says father-in-law Joe. Read says Karla was part of the church youth group and that she worked at the canvas company with Bryan. “Karla, like Bryan, was fun and always doing for the youth group at the church,” Read says. Marc, a mechanic who went by “Danny,” was at church with his infant daughter, Noah, when the shooting occurred. A coworker told The New York Times he was a man of faith who liked to pull up Bible verses using a phone app. The massacre’s youngest victim was beloved by her grandmother Karla, who was also killed during the shooting. Karla proudly posted Facebook photos of Noah, calling her a “cutie.” Shani Corrigan met her husband when they were high school seniors in Harrison, Michigan. They buried their son Forrest a year ago and leave two others, Preston and Benjamin, who are active-duty military. Robert Corrigan was a track star and Air Force retiree who married Shani right out of high school. “He dedicated his life to our country,” says Renee Haley, director of veterans’ services for Clare County, Michigan. Robert was in the Air Force for 29 years and worked for Well Med Medical Management after retiring in 2015. Tara McNulty worked at a bar and was the mother of two children. A GoFundMe page for funeral expenses and expenses for her children, launched by someone who worked with her, describes her as “conscientious, engaging, and always willing to do the little things.” “She was a sweet, kind and loving woman, mother and daughter and will be greatly missed by many,” the coworker wrote. “Words cannot express the sadness that this tragedy has caused.” Read says McNulty “was fun-loving and wanted her children to do well.” A widower, Richard Rodriguez found love again when he married his wife, Theresa, in 2006. “He came from a big family,” says his daughter Regina Amador. “We’ve just been sitting around table reminiscing, looking at pictures of them.” “I lost my mom when I was 18,” Amador says. “It just sucks because I have to go through this again. I’ve just been crying and crying. I’m at my family’s now — my dad came from a big family, and had tons of sisters and brothers. We’ve just been sitting around a table, reminiscing, looking at pictures of them. I can’t believe this is happening, but it’s happening.” Theresa Rodriguez’s family says she led a quiet life with Richard, her husband of 11 years. “If they weren’t at church, they’d be in the backyard, working on a garden,” says Amador. “They were amazing people.” After the shooting, Dennis Johnson’s sister-in-law denounced the slayings on Facebook as a “thoughtless crime” and mourned her family “with a very heavy, heavy heart.” Added nephew Fred Spence Jr., “I’m lost for words and still in shock.” Originally from Florida, Sara Johnson worked as a secretary at a landscaping company. “May God be with y’all,” her husband’s sister-in-law Tawna Roberts Specnce wrote on Facebook. “My heart is broken.” Karen Marshall and her husband, Robert Scott Marshall, who were together 32 years, met in the Air Force in North Carolina and had a son and two daughters. “They rode motorcycles,” says her sister-in-law Holly Hannum. “They had a love that lasted.” Robert and his wife, Karen, were “very religious,” says Hannum. “The one thing I am holding on to is that they were Christians, in the Lord’s house, worshipping Him,” she says. “They loved each other and died together. Lula White was the grandmother of the gunman’s estranged wife and was the church secretary. Her niece, Charity Sales, took to Facebook on Sunday evening to express the anguish she has been experiencing since losing her aunt. “Aunt Lula Woicinski White will be missed greatly,” Sales wrote. “I don’t think there was ever a time I saw her where she didn’t have a smile on her face and a crazy fun tactic up her sleeve.” Keith Braden, a grocer, was a regular at First Baptist alongside his family, his brother, Bruce, told the Indianapolis Star. Keith’s wife, Debbie, and their granddaughter survived the shooting. “He was a good father,” his brother told the Star. “He was strict and fair, but loving. He was a good provider and a good husband.” “My brother Keith had just fought off cancer the last couple of years,” Bruce said. “He had lost a lot of weight and hair from chemotherapy. I posted a picture on Facebook of him getting his hair and his weight back. He was hoping to have a nice number of years left to live with his family. That was taken away in an instant.” Peggy Warden was a grandmother, sister, mother and devout Texan woman. “She was a woman of faith not just in her church but in the way she lived her life every day,” her sister Leisa Kugler tells PEOPLE. “She was absolutely the most selfless person I’ve ever know.” Warden, who grew up just five miles from First Baptist Church, died shielding her eldest grandson, Zachary Poston, from the bullets, Kugler says. Poston, 18, was shot six times and survived. He is in and out of surgery in San Antonio. • Reporting by ELAINE ARADILLAS, KC BAKER, CHRIS HARRIS, DIANE HERBST, CAITLIN KEATING, SUSAN KEATING, CHRISTINE PELISEK, HARRIET SOKMENSUER and JEFF TRUESDELL "
http://people.com/crime/texas-church-shooting-rylan-ward-wounded/,"Rylan Ward was attending church with family members when the shooter began firing, killing 26 people and wounding 20 A 5-year-old boy who lost his stepmother, step-sister and half-sister in Sunday morning’s mass shooting that killed 26 and injured 20 is in critical condition, family members tell PEOPLE. Rylan Ward is receiving treatment at University Hospital in San Antonio, Texas, after he was shot five times by a gunman who opened fire at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, where his family are regular parishioners. The shooter, identified as 26-year-old Devin Kelley, a former Air Force member, was dressed in all-black tactical gear with a ballistics vest when he began firing from outside the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs around 11:30 a.m. local time, during a service. Rylan’s stepmother, Joann, and her daughters, Brooke Ward, 5, and 7-year-old Emily Garza, were killed in the attack, the state’s deadliest mass shooting in modern history. His father, Chris Ward, is “very devastated,” according to Chris Ward’s uncle, Gary Zwicke, adding, “Stuff like that doesn’t happen in Sutherland Springs.” Rylan’s uncle, Phillip Ward, tells PEOPLE Ryan had surgery Sunday night and is going back into surgery Monday afternoon. He says the family is optimistic Rylan will survive but says he may be in the hospital for months and will have to relearn how to walk after breaking bones in his leg. Zwicke started a GoFundMe page to help with the funeral expenses and Ward’s cousin Heather Bradley, launched another GoFundMe page to help with hospital bills. Rylan’s eldest sister, 9, who was also at the church during the attack, had a bullet graze off her glasses but survived the shooting, Zwicke says. She wrote that Ryland is “on a breathing tube looking to make it but [it’s] going to be a long journey,” and that he was shot once in the elbow, twice in the stomach and twice in the leg. • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

The 26 fatal victims ranged in age from 18 months to 77 years old, Texas officials announced Monday morning at a press conference. Among the dead are the pastor’s 14-year-old daughter and a 16-year-old aspiring NICU nurse. Officials have not yet released the names of the victims and won’t do so until relatives of all are notified. When the gunman exited the church, a local resident engaged him in gunfire, authorities said. The gunman dropped his weapon and fled, with the local resident in pursuit. A brief chase ensued into neighboring Guadalupe County, Texas, where the shooter was later found dead in his vehicle. It is unclear if he was killed by a self-inflicted gunshot wound or a gunshot wound he received while exchanging fire with the local resident, authorities said. Authorities said the shooting stemmed from a domestic dispute, and that the shooter had sent threatening text messages to his mother-in-law, who attended the church. There is no terrorism investigation in connection with the shooting. An Air Force spokeswoman tells PEOPLE that the shooter served at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, working in logistics readiness. He was stationed there from 2010 until he was discharged in 2014, following a 2012 court-martial on accusations he assaulted his spouse and their child, the spokeswoman says. "

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/06/devin-kelley-named-as-texas-church-shooting-suspect-was-court-martialed-by-us-air-force,"The 26-year-old, found dead in his car following attack, was discharged following ‘assault on his spouse and child’ First published on Mon 6 Nov 2017 05.34 GMT The suspected gunman believed to have killed at least 26 people at a Texas church has been named as Devin Patrick Kelley, a former member of the US air force who received a court martial for assault on his wife and child five years ago. The 26-year-old reportedly entered the wooden-framed First Baptist Church on Sunday dressed in black tactical-style gear, a ballistic vest and carrying an assault rifle. He shot victims ranging in age from five to 72 years old, including a pregnant woman and the pastor’s 14-year-old daughter.  Air force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said records showed Kelley joined Logistics Readiness at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico in 2010. She said he was court-martialled in 2012 for “assault on his spouse and child” and spent a year in a military prison and was given a reduction in rank. In 2014, Kelley received a bad conduct discharge, she added. Kelley has not been formally named as the suspect. However, two officials, including one working in law enforcement, identified him as the alleged killer on the condition of anonymity to the Associated Press. He was also named by the New York Times and multiple other US outlets citing sources. Investigators were looking at social media posts Kelley made in the days before Sunday’s attack, including one that appeared to show an AR-15 semiautomatic weapon, the rifle used in the massacre. No motive has been declared for what the state governor, Greg Abbott, called the worst mass shooting in Texas history. It is not clear if Kelley had links to any militant groups. Authorities described a white man in his 20s who pulled into a gas station across from the First Baptist Church around 11.20am on Sunday. He crossed the street and started firing the rifle at the building before entering and killing worshippers. When he left, he was confronted by an armed resident as well as another local man, Johnnie Langendorff, who said they chased him until his car veered off the road. “He just lost control,” Langendorff told a local TV station Ksat.com. “That is when I put the vehicle in park and I was still on the phone to dispatch [police]. The other gentleman jumped out and has his rifle drawn on him. He didn’t move after that.” Police arrived with seven minutes and surrounded the gunman’s vehicle, he added. Officials have said they found the suspect dead in his car surrounded by multiple weapons. US federal law bans people who have been dishonourably discharged from buying a firearm. Kelley lived roughly 35 miles north of Sutherland Springs, a small settlement of just a few hundred people where the attack occurred. Police reportedly entered a house linked to him in New Braunfels, outside San Antonio, on Sunday night hours after the shooting. Two people who lived near that address said they heard intense gunfire from that direction in recent days. Sixteen-year-old Ryan Albers, who lives across the road from the listed home of the suspect, said was gunfire was “really loud. At first, I thought someone was blasting.” He added: “It was someone using automatic weapon fire.” Kelley had grown up in New Braunfels, in his parents’ nearly $1m home, the New York Times reported. He was sued for divorce in 2012 in New Mexico, the same year he was court-martialled, and remarried in 2014."

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/DxuVFuu-ExM/,"Twenty-six people were killed Sunday when a gunman opened fire inside a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. More than 20 people were wounded, 10 of whom are still in critical condition, authorities said Monday. The mass shooting is among the deadliest in modern U.S. history. These statistics illustrate the devastation of the attack: The 26 people who were killed on Sunday ranged from 18 months to 77 years years old, law enforcement officials said Monday. Several children are among the victims and those still in critical condition. Eight members of the Holcombe family were killed in the South Texas rampage — including associate church pastor Bryan Holcombe, his wife, son, pregnant daughter-in-law and four of his grandchildren, according to ABC News. Crystal Holcombe, the pregnant daughter-in-law, died with three of her children. Her other two children and her husband survived and are in the hospital, CNN reported. Thirteen people were killed and more than 20 were wounded in a shooting on April 20, 1999 at Columbine High School in Colorado— a devastating massacre that no longer falls among the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern U.S. history. At the time, the Columbine shooting shifted the conversation about school safety and sparked heated gun control debates in Congress. Gunmen at Virginia Tech in 2007 and Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 later claimed to be influenced by the Columbine shooters. Just over a month before Devin Kelley opened fire at the small church in Sutherland Springs, a gunman killed 58 people and injured more than 500 at a Las Vegas music festival on Oct. 1. The two incidents are among the five deadliest mass shootings in modern U.S. history. Gun-related homicides increased from 9,600 in 2015 to 11,000 in 2016, according to a recent Associated Press analysis of FBI data. And the firearm death rate rose to 12 deaths per 100,000 people in 2016 — an increase from 11 deaths per 100,000 people in 2015, according to recently released data by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/453470/texas-hero-reportedly-used-his-own-ar-confront-sutherland-springs-shooter,"Follow Us National Review Did Fauci Fund Abusive Animal Experiments? State Department: Whoops, We Just Found a Lot More Americans Who Want to Leave Afghanistan A Telling Anecdote from Clarence Thomas 30 Years of Justice Clarence Thomas BREAKING: Supreme Court Sets November 1 Oral Argument on Texas Abortion Case During today’s press conference about the Texas mass shooting, the regional director of the Texas Department of Public Safety indicated that the Texas Good Samaritan, Stephen Willeford, engaged the Sutherland Springs shooter with his own AR: He armed himself with an AR assault rifle and engaged the suspect. They engaged in gunfire here at the church. We know that the suspect was shot, when he dropped his assault rifle and jumped in his Ford Expedition and fled the scene. Given what we know from other reports, this makes a great deal of sense. After all, Willeford apparently fired with a great deal of precision. Here’s an account from CNN, taken from an interview of his cousin: And what he did, according to his cousin, is exchange fire with the gunman, hitting him in the side and twice in the neck. “He saw that the guy was wearing body armor, and there was a velcro strap, from the back to the front,” detailed Leonard, speaking live on Monday. “He knew from that … that the vulnerable spot was going to be in the side. And so that’s where he shot him.” An AR is an easy-to-use, extraordinarily accurate weapon, and one can see how it would enable a surprised civilian to engage the shooter so quickly and effectively. We keep hearing that AR’s are useless for self-defense, that they’re simply “weapons of war,” useful only for mass killing. This is simply not true. Earlier this year, an Oklahoma man used an AR-15 to kill three home intruders, and multiple self-defense experts have long pegged AR-style rifles as their “home defense weapon of choice.” I have one in my own home, and I feel far more comfortable using it than even one of my handguns. While Willeford obviously didn’t prevent the massacre, he did stop the shooter and prevented him from harming anyone else. He did so with exactly the kind of weapon that the gun control lobby would like to deny to law-abiding Americans. That’s a fact worth noting. Get our conservative analysis delivered right to you.

X OUR PICKS: SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas (AP) — The Latest on the church shooting in Texas (all times local): 7:50 p.m. The two men who pursued the gunman after the Texas church shooting visited a vigil together and prayed with community members mourning the 26 people killed in the attack. Stephen Willeford and Johnnie Langendorff arrived at the vigil with relatives Monday night. They locked arms in a circle and bowed their heads in extended prayer. Many wept openly, including Willeford, who could be seen wiping away tears streaming down his chin. As the pastor shouted, “Jesus, this is your town,” the prayer broke up and the two men left. Willeford ran from his home with his rifle and confronted the gunman, Devin Kelley, outside the church Sunday. Authorities have said two of the bullets fired by Willeford hit Kelley in the leg and torso. The gunman fled in his vehicle. Johnnie Langendorff was driving by the church when Willeford flagged him down and they pursued the gunman in Langendorff’s truck. Kelley eventually crashed and was found dead in his vehicle. ___ 7:30 p.m. A sporting goods chain has confirmed that it sold two firearms to the man who shot up a church in a tiny South Texas community, killing 26 people. In a statement posted on the company’s social media, Katy, Texas-based Academy Sports & Outdoors confirmed that Devin Patrick Kelley bought the weapons from two different San Antonio stores, one in 2016 and one in 2017. The company also confirmed that the sales were cleared by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The company extended condolences to the victims and their families and said it was cooperating with investigators. The Air Force says it failed to report the Texas church shooter’s domestic violence conviction to the FBI as required by Pentagon rules. Information about such convictions is supposed to be submitted to the FBI for inclusion in the National Criminal Information Center database. ___ 7 p.m. An Air Force couple who retired to La Vernia, Texas, was trying out churches when they were slain in Sunday’s shooting in Sutherland Springs. Robert Marshall tells the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that his son Scott and daughter-in-law Karen were first-time visitors to the First Baptist Church, the scene of a rampage that left dead 26 congregants including children. Karen Marshall had recently returned to Texas after finishing an assignment at Maryland’s Andrews Air Force Base. Scott Marshall was retired from the Air Force and had been working as a civilian contractor and mechanic at Lackland Air Force Base, about 35 miles west of La Vernia. The couple met while they were in the service together more than 30 years ago. Another victim identified on Facebook by her family was 16-year-old Hailey Krueger. ___ 6:20 p.m. Texas law enforcement authorities say the gunman who killed 26 members of a church on Sunday was shot three times, twice by a citizen. Texas Department of Public Safety Regional Director Freeman Martin says Devin Patrick Kelley was shot in his leg and torso by a citizen who pursued him after hearing gunfire. Martin says the third was, “consistent with being self-inflicted.” Authorities say they’ve collected hundreds of shell casings and 15 magazines that hold 30 rounds each at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, where Kelley opened fire Sunday. The dead ranged from 18 months to 77 years old and included multiple members of some families. Authorities say 10 victims remain in critical condition and four are in serious condition. ___ 5:35 p.m. The Air Force says it failed to report the Texas church shooter’s domestic violence conviction to the FBI as required by Pentagon rules. Devin Patrick Kelley was convicted of assault against his wife and stepson in an Air Force court-martial in New Mexico in 2012. The conviction should have disqualified him from buying or possessing firearms. Information about such convictions is supposed to be submitted to the FBI for inclusion in the National Criminal Information Center database. The Air Force said in a statement that the top two Air Force officials — Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson and Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein — have ordered a review of the Kelley case. Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek says the Pentagon will also ensure records in other cases have been reported correctly across the Department of Defense. The church shooting left 26 people dead and 20 wounded. ___ 5 p.m. The man some call a hero for engaging in a shootout with the Texas church gunman is a former National Rifle Association instructor. Stephen Willeford says in an interview with KHBS/KHOG television in Arkansas that he was at home in Sutherland Springs when his daughter heard gunfire at the church. Willeford says he retrieved his rifle, loaded it and ran barefoot to the church. He says: “I kept hearing the shots, one after another, very rapid shots … and I knew every one of those shots represented someone.” Willeford says he hid behind a pickup truck and exchanged fire with the gunman, adding: “I know I hit him.” The gunman, Devin Kelley, got into his vehicle and fled. Willeford says he ran to a pickup truck and asked the driver, later identified as Johnnie Langendorff, to help him. They sped after the gunman. Kelley’s vehicle hit a road sign and flipped into a roadside ditch. Willeford says he got out of the truck, perched his rifle on the truck’s rooftop and yelled, “get out of the truck,” but saw no movement. Law enforcement came to the scene. They believe the gunman took his own life. ___ 4:35 p.m. The American flag mounted on the fence of Michael Ward’s home in Sutherland Springs was hanging upside down Monday. Neighbors say it had been that way since the Oct. 1 Las Vegas shooting, an apparent memorial to the 58 victims of that attack. Now the Ward family has lost several relatives, including children, in the Texas church shooting. Leslie Ward was setting up for a yard sale at the house when she heard gunfire. Her husband, Michael Ward, tells The Dallas Morning News that he ran inside the church and carried out his 5-year-old nephew, Ryland, who had four gunshot wounds. Ryland was transferred by helicopter to a San Antonio hospital. The boy’s mother and two of his sisters were among 26 people killed. On Monday, items were arranged for the yard sale, but no one was there. The flag remained upside down. ___ 4:15 p.m. The owner of a restaurant and store across the street from the Texas church shooting says she sheltered one bloodied survivor. Terrie Smith says she saw the shooter’s body “shaking” from the recoil of his weapon as he opened fire outside the church Fighting back tears, Smith said she and several customers fell to the ground and crawled back to the store. She says they locked themselves in and heard firing while the gunman was inside the church. Smith says that a victim ran out “all bloody in his arms and face.” She says: “We let him in. He said ‘somebody went in and shot everybody. My family is in there, my family is in there.'” The unidentified man then tfell to the ground. The shooting left 26 people dead and 20 injured. ___ 3:15 p.m. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz says that the “bravery and courage” of a citizen who shot back at the gunman in the Texas church attack should be celebrated. The Republican senator from Texas spoke after talking to law enforcement officials and visiting the church in Sutherland Springs where Devin Kelley killed 26 people and wounded about 20 more. When a reporter asked Cruz about gun control, he noted the recent terrorist attack with a truck in New York and said “Evil is evil.” He then lauded the “ordinary citizen” who engaged the gunman. Cruz says that law enforcement officers showed him where the citizen hid behind a car and took incoming shots from the gunman. Cruz said he asked law enforcement what would have happened if the citizen had not used his own gun to confront Kelley. Cruz said they responded that the death toll would have been higher. ___ 2:45 p.m. The gunman in a mass shooting at a Texas church had been arrested for animal cruelty in Colorado in 2014. An El Paso County Sheriff’s Office affidavit says deputies arrested Devin Patrick Kelley at a Colorado Springs RV park where he lived. One neighbor told a deputy that Kelley chased the young husky, jumped on top of it and struck the dog with a closed fist several times. Another neighbor says Kelley grabbed the dog, threw it into the air, then onto the ground and dragged it to his camper. Kelley initially refused to leave the camper to speak with officers in the Aug. 1, 2014 incident. He denied abusing the dog. Officers arrested Kelley for misdemeanor animal cruelty and took the Husky to a veterinary center. Kelley was given a deferred probationary sentence and was ordered to pay $368 in restitution. He complied with the sentence. ___ 2:40 p.m. Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen Pence, will travel to Texas on Wednesday to meet with those affected by Sunday’s church shooting. Announcing his travel plans in a tweet, Pence says he will visit family members of those killed, those injured in the attack, and first responders in Sutherland Springs. Pence says, “We are with you Texas.” At least 26 people were killed Sunday by a lone gunman, identified by police as Devin Kelley, and about 20 more were wounded. President Donald Trump is in the midst of a 12-day trip to Asia. ___ 2:20 p.m. The wife of the First Baptist Church pastor says it gives her “a sliver of encouragement” that their 14-year-old daughter was surrounded by her church family when she died in the shooting. Sherri Pomeroy says Annabelle Pomeroy was with “the church family that she loved fiercely and vice versa.” Pastor Frank Pomeroy and Sherri Pomeroy were out of town when the gunman opened fire Sunday at the church in Sutherland Springs, killing 26 people and wounding about 20. The gunman was later found dead in his vehicle. Speaking at a news conference Monday, Sherri Pomeroy said, “Our church was not comprised of members or parishioners. We were a very close family.” She added: “Now most of our church family is gone.” She said that her daughter, who she called Belle, would have struggled to deal with losing so many people. ___ 12:20 p.m. Authorities in Texas say law enforcement went to the home of the suspected church gunman three years ago to investigate a domestic violence complaint involving him and his then-girlfriend. Paul Anthony, a spokesman for the Comal County district attorney’s office, told The Associated Press that sheriff’s deputies were called just after 10 p.m. on Feb. 1, 2014, to the New Braunfels home of Devin Patrick Kelley and his family. Citing a sheriff’s office report, Anthony says a friend of Kelley’s girlfriend told authorities she received a text message from the girlfriend that indicated “her boyfriend was abusing her.” When sheriff’s deputies arrived at the home, they were told by people in the house that there was no problem. No arrests were made. Kelley married Danielle Shields two months later. Kelley was discharged from the Air Force the same year after being punished for allegedly assaulting his spouse and child. ___ 11:25 a.m. The special agent in charge of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives field office in Houston says three guns have been recovered from the suspect in the deadly church shootings in Texas. Fred Milanowski (mil-uh-NOW’-skee) said during a news conference Monday that officers recovered a Ruger AR-556 rifle at the church. Milanowski said two additional handguns were recovered from the vehicle driven by Devin Patrick Kelley — a Glock 9mm and a Ruger .22-caliber. Milanowski says all three weapons were purchased by the now-deceased suspect. Freeman Martin with the Texas Department of Public Safety said Kelley did not have a license to carry a handgun. He says he did have a “noncommissioned, unarmed private security license similar to a security guard at a concert-type situation.” ___ 11:10 a.m. Officials say that the 26 people killed in a shooting at a small South Texas church range in age from 18 months to 77 years old. Freeman Martin, a regional director of the Texas Department of Safety, said Monday that 20 were injured in the shooting Sunday morning at the church in Sutherland Springs. Martin says 10 people were still hospitalized in critical condition. Martin said those treated in hospitals ranged in age from 5 to 73. Authorities have said that Devin Patrick Kelley is suspected of killing 26 people during the shooting in Sutherland Springs. He was later found dead. ___ 11 a.m. Authorities say the gunman who opened fire in a Texas church had sent threatening text messages to his mother-in-law, who attended the church. Texas Department of Public Safety Regional Director Freeman Martin said Monday that the mass shooting stemmed from a domestic situation and was not racially or religiously motivated. Authorities say that evidence at the scene leads them to believe that Devin Patrick Kelley died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after he crashed his car. He had been chased by armed bystanders. They say Kelley also used his cellphone to tell his father that he had been shot and didn’t think he would survive. ___ 10:10 a.m. Authorities believe the man suspected of killing 26 people and injuring about 20 others at a Texas church shot himself following a car wreck. Wilson County Sheriff Joe D. Tackitt Jr. tells CBS News that police found Devin Patrick Kelley dead inside his vehicle Sunday shortly after the shootings in Sutherland Springs. Tackitt says Kelley was being pursued by two community members and investigators believe gunfire was exchanged before Kelley’s vehicle crashed. The sheriff says investigators believe Kelley shot himself after the wreck. ___ 10 a.m. The man suspected of killing 26 people and injuring about 20 more at a Texas church had previously been charged with misdemeanor animal cruelty in east-central Colorado. Court records in El Paso County indicate Devin Patrick Kelley was cited on Aug. 1, 2014, when he lived in a mobile home park near Colorado Springs. He was given a deferred probationary sentence and was ordered to pay $368 in restitution. The charge was dismissed in March 2016 after Kelley completed his sentence. The Denver Post reports court records indicate someone was granted a protection order against Kelley on Jan. 15, 2015, also in El Paso County. ___ 9:50 a.m. A manager at a vacation resort says the gunman who opened fire at a Texas church worked for the resort as security guard. Claudia Varjabedian is a manager at the Summit Vacation Resort in New Braunfels. She told The Associated Press on Monday that Devin Patrick Kelley had been working there the past month and a half. She says Kelley “seemed like a nice guy” and didn’t give her any problems. She said he worked unarmed on his shift as the day security guard. The riverside resort in the Texas Hill Country is near Kelley’s apparent home off a rural highway. Sheriff’s deputies were still blocking the gate to his property Monday morning. ___ 9:35 a.m. Several people remain hospitalized after a shooting at a South Texas church that killed 26 and injured more than 20 others. An official with University Health System in San Antonio said five people remained hospitalized Monday — three children and two adults. Martha Rendon (ren-DOHN’) says the patients range in age from 4 to 57 years old, with their conditions listed as being from serious to critical. Rendon also says one of the victims who died Sunday was a pediatric patient that had been transported to the hospital. She declined to release further details on the child. A spokeswoman for Connally Memorial Medical Center in Floresville said one person was listed in stable condition Monday. Megan Posey declined to release additional details on the patient. Officials with Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, which received eight patients on Sunday, did not immediately provide an update Monday. ___ 8:35 a.m. Officials in Texas have confirmed the identity of the man suspected of killing 26 people at a South Texas church. The Texas Department of Public Safety on Monday morning said 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley is the suspect. DPS said that Kelley lived in New Braunfels, which is about 35 miles north of the Sutherland Springs church where the shooting occurred. A short time after the shooting Sunday, the suspect was found dead in his vehicle at the county line. On Sunday, two officials who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity had identified the gunman as Kelley. DPS says more information will be released later Monday. ___ 8:20 a.m. A South Carolina musician with a similar name as the man identified as the gunman in a mass shooting at a Texas church says he’s frustrated by hateful message he’s received online. Devin Patrick said on his Facebook page late Sunday that he’s saddened by the shooting but at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. But Patrick says his only connection with the tragedy is his name and asks people not to contact him about the shooting. Authorities have identified the gunman as Devin Patrick Kelley. Officials say 26 people were killed Sunday in an attack that claimed people ranging in age from 5 to 72 years old. Authorities said about 20 others were wounded. The suspect was later found dead in his vehicle. ___ 8:10 a.m. School districts surrounding a South Texas town where a gunman killed 26 people at a church have added counselors to help comfort children, their families and staff. Sutherland Springs is a town of about 400 that does not have its own school. Nearby districts offered messages of caring and concern Monday, a day after the gunfire. Officials say the victims ranged in age from 5 to 72 years old. Superintendent Sherri Bays, of the Floresville Independent School District, wrote: “Our hearts are breaking for the families of the deceased and injured.” District spokeswoman Kim Cathey says some Sutherland Springs children attend Floresville ISD schools. Cathey had no immediate information on whether any victims were from the district. Similar messages of prayers and support were offered by the Stockdale ISD and the La Vernia ISD. ___ 7:45 a.m. A sheriff says the former in-laws of a man suspected of killing 26 people at a Texas church attended services there “from time to time.” Wilson County Sheriff Joe D. Tackitt Jr. told CNN Monday morning that the former in-laws weren’t in attendance Sunday when the shooting occurred. He says it wasn’t clear why the gunman picked that day for the shooting. The mass shooting occurred Sunday morning at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio. About 20 others were wounded in the attack. Two officials who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity identified the gunman as Devin Kelley. An Air Force spokeswoman said records confirm Kelley received a bad conduct discharge after being court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his spouse and child. ___ 7:05 a.m. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is suggesting there may have been a connection between the gunman who shot and killed 26 people in a South Texas community and the Baptist church where the slayings happened. Abbott tells ABC’s “Good Morning America” he expects people will learn about any such link “in a few days.” He said he didn’t want to go further, saying “law enforcement is looking very aggressively into this.” “I don’t think this was just a random act of violence,” Abbott told anchor George Stephanopoulos. But when pressed to elaborate on his connection theory, the governor replied that “it’s very important that law enforcement have the ability … to tie the loose ends of this investigation up.” He called the man, identified by a U.S. official and one in law enforcement as Devin Kelley, “a very deranged individual.” ___ 3:30 a.m. Authorities say a gunman armed with an assault rifle opened fire inside a small South Texas church, killing 26 people who ranged in age from 5 to 72. The mass shooting occurred Sunday morning at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio. About 20 others were wounded in the attack. Two officials who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity identified the gunman as Devin Kelley. An Air Force spokeswoman said records confirm Kelley received a bad conduct discharge after being court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his spouse and child. Wilson County Sheriff Joe D. Tackitt Jr. described the scene inside the church as “terrible.” Investigators have not yet determined a motive for the attack.

                    PBS NewsHour This week marks a year since President Trump won the White House. What lessons have Democrats and Republicans learned since then? Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report and Tamara Keith of NPR join John Yang to discuss how the parties have moved on, plus the politics of guns after another mass shooting, the closely watched Virginia governor’s race and Donna Brazile’s new book. John Yang: It's been a year since Donald Trump won the White House. What lessons have Democrats and Republicans learned since that divisive 2016 election? For answers, it's time for Politics Monday with Tamara Keith of NPR and Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report. Tam, Amy, welcome to you both. The big story, the headline tonight, of course, is this horrible shooting in Texas. Five weeks ago was the horrible shooting in Las Vegas. Tam, is anything going to happen? Tamara Keith: I'm pretty sure that Amy and I were here on this set a month and a week ago saying probably not. And, really, not much has changed since that shooting in Las Vegas. There was some talk, very briefly, about looking at bump stocks, which was this modification that was made to the weapon in Las Vegas. That talk has pretty much gone away. Now it's another mass shooting, and in this one, there are a lot of children, and it's tragic, it's in a place of worship, but the conversation really doesn't change. It sort of follows this cycle, and it seems to speed up, where almost immediately it's either gun control or mental health, and people go into their corners, and they are very much in their corners already. John Yang: Amy? Amy Walter: Yes. One thing I would say, too, is that while we may not be seeing any change in the way the politics of this play out, I don't think we should discount the way in which these events, which seem to be happening with really painful regulatory, are chipping away at Americans' sense of safety and security, raising anxiety. When these shootings are taking place in places that should be places of safety — they are churches, they are schools, they are cinemas, they are concerts — you know, I think it really underscores the sense of instability and anxiety that so many Americans are feeling now just about the state of the world in general, but when they look at home, the feeling that they can't quite be sure at anytime, anywhere, that they will be safe, and that the ground seems to be shifting constantly underneath them on so many issues, this issue of safety prime among them. John Yang: Instability, anxiety, shifting ground takes us to our next topic very likely, on a much sort of less threatening scale. It was a year ago this week that, Tam, you and I were in the Javits Center in New York, and the entire political world shifted, when both parties, I think it's fair to say, were confronted with an election result that neither one really anticipated. A year later, where are the Republicans and the Democrats in trying to get their footing, get their — sort of reoriented in this world? Tamara Keith: Well, it turns out that winning for the Republicans didn't paper over all of the problems. There are definitely divisions within the Republican Party, much the same divisions that we were discussing in 2016. As for the Democrats, losing didn't prompt like a miraculous overnight rethinking and vision and thinking, like, oh, now we no how to proceed. I was talking to some women who had voted for Hillary Clinton, had volunteered for her campaign in the Cleveland area, and they actually said that they weren't surprised by the election results. All three of them had predicted, they said, that she would lose before she lost. But as for what the next steps are, they are pretty frustrated with the Democratic Party. They are like, we thought by now the party would have figured this out. And there's a sense that party hasn't figured it out. John Yang: Amy, what — tomorrow, we have a big election in Virginia, the governor's race. Is that going to give us a clue about where the parties are and where they are heading? Amy Walter: Well, we will read probably read too much into the results, as we always do, of one race. But let's just look at a couple of things. The first is that the two candidates, the Democrat and the Republican, are not exactly fitting into the sort of traditional post-Trump stereotypes. The Republican candidate, Ed Gillespie is a longtime Republican, establishment Republican, moderate Republican, worked in the Bush White House. He doesn't fit the stereotype of the outsider, brash kind of candidate that Trump is. On the Democratic side, you have, in Ralph Northam, another longtime establishment candidate. He's got a Southern drawl. He comes from a part of the state that's not the sort of fast-growing, urban Northern Virginia suburbs. He doesn't act or speak like Bernie Sanders. And what both candidates are finding in this Virginia race is that there are sections of their party that want them to be more like the insurgents that they saw in 2016. Both of them are trying to thread the needle there, and we will find out in the next 24 hours or so which one was successful. We are also going to get our first real sense of whether there is a real enthusiasm gap between Democrats, who still are frustrated and furious about the results of 2016, and Republicans who, as you pointed out, John, were even surprised themselves that Donald Trump won. We saw in special elections in this last year and House races that Democrats did have something of an enthusiasm advantage. Is it going to translate into a state like Virginia, which is, unlike those special elections, it is more Democratic-leaning and it's a state that Hillary Clinton carried? Tamara Keith: Yes, Democrats are under a lot more pressure with this Virginia race than the Republicans are, because Democrats have an edge. As Amy said, Hillary Clinton won the state. So, if Democrats lose, that's going to be a really, really big story. If the Republican loses, well, you know, often that happens in Virginia, that the opposing party of the president ends up winning. And so, there's more to lose for Democrats here. John Yang: And, Tam, we had more sort of — more fallout from 2016 over the weekend with Donna Brazile's new book talking about having — sort of airing her complaints about the Hillary Clinton campaign, about the fund-raising agreement her campaign had with the Democratic National Committee. What do you make of all this? Why is Donna doing this? Tamara Keith: And then Donald Trump, President Trump, jumps in and tweets and says, look, it really was rigged against Bernie. That's what I have been saying all along, because 2016 will never end. Donna Brazile has — is trying to sell books, for one thing, and so why do the juiciest parts come out? Because she's trying to sell books. And also she has some real grievous from the way the 2016 campaign was handled and, you know, how the WikiLeaks affected her life and existence and what she thought she would be doing with her life. John Yang: Amy, is this division, this sort of fissure between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders wings that is now from 2016, is that going to animate the party through 2020, do you think? Amy Walter: Yes, I think the division that Democrats are facing is not so much between the Bernie and Hillary wing, but it is a general sense of where their strategy is, it's more tactical, and it's more fundamental to the kinds of voters that they want to see turn up and vote for Democrats. Barack Obama, when he ran for office, there was something called the Obama coalition, these younger voters, more diverse voters, who came and turned out in record numbers to support him. Since that election in 2008, those voters have turned out for nobody else other than Barack Obama. They didn't turn out in midterm elections. They didn't turn out for Hillary Clinton. So, there's a group of Democrats saying, we have got to find a way to get those voters out and animated without Barack Obama on the ballot. There's another group of Democrats, though, that say, our real challenge is that we lost white working-class voters by a bigger percentage than we should have in 2016. We need to win those voters back. They have got to figure out how to bring those two groups together under one banner and one message. John Yang: Not an easy task, it sounds like. Amy Walter, Tamara Keith, that's Politics Monday. Thanks for joining us. Tamara Keith: You're welcome. Amy Walter: You're welcome.

http://people.com/crime/how-did-texas-church-shooter-get-his-guns/,"Authorities are trying to determine how Devin Patrick Kelley, despite being convicted of assault in a military court, was able to obtain a firearm Authorities are trying to determine how 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley, despite being convicted of domestic assault in a military court, was able to obtain multiple guns before he opened fire on a rural Texas church on Sunday morning, a federal official tells PEOPLE. “A lot of questions remain unanswered,” says the official, who has direct knowledge of the investigation into the mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, that killed 26. The official is not authorized to communicate with the press and spoke on the condition of anonymity. High on investigators’ agenda, the official says, is to confirm how Kelley could buy firearms despite having been convicted while in the Air Force of assaulting his wife and child. Investigators are checking to see whether information from the 2012 court martial against Kelley, who was discharged for bad conduct in 2014, was fully transmitted to civilian databases, the federal official says. The New York Times reports that the Air Forcedid not enter Kelley’s court martial into a federal database used for background checks that could have precluded him from getting weapons. (The Air Force did not respond to an email from PEOPLE asking whether criminal convictions of their personnel are routinely shared with all pertinent civilian agencies.) In a statement, according to the Times, the Air Force said it “has launched a review of how the service handled the criminal records of former Airman Devin P. Kelley following his 2012 domestic violence conviction.” “Federal law prohibited him from buying or possessing firearms after this conviction,” the Air Force said. According to authorities, Kelley used an assault rifle in Sunday’s attack and other guns were found in his vehicle. Fifteen spent magazines were at the crime scene. • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

Kelley purchased two weapons legally from a Texas sporting goods store. “Based on information we received from law enforcement, we confirmed that the suspect purchased two firearms from two San Antonio locations, one in 2016 and one in 2017,” a representative of Academy Sports + Outdoors said in a statement to PEOPLE. “We also confirmed that both sales were approved by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS),” the company said. “We are cooperating with law enforcement as they investigate further.” “Academy Sports + Outdoors sends our deepest condolences to the families of the victims and the entire Sutherland Springs community,” the statement continued. It appears Kelley also lied while filling out his paperwork for those gun purchases. A standard federal form for such transactions asks if you have a conviction for domestic violence. If Kelley had answered correctly, he could not have been allowed to buy a gun.

Authorities said Monday they believe he was motivated, in part, by a domestic dispute and had been threatening his mother-in-law, who attended First Baptist in Sutherland Springs. Kris Brown, co-president of the Brady Campaign and Center to Prevent Gun Violence, tells PEOPLE Kelley’s example highlights the importance of “keeping people who have a propensity for violence, putting their names in the systems and making sure they don’t have access to guns.” Citing the gunman’s history of domestic violence, Brown says, “All readers should ask themselves the question whether someone like that should have easy access to guns.” • PEOPLE’s special edition True Crime Stories: 35 Real Cases That Inspired the Show Law & Order is on sale now. “As Americans we have to look at what’s happening and whether this is the kind of country we want to live in,” Brown says, “where individuals put themselves at risk of being shot going to church, going to concerts, going to school, going to the movies — routine, everyday activities. We need to demand change, and we can do it.” In its statement, the Air Force noted “the service will also conduct a comprehensive review of Air Force databases to ensure records in other cases have been reported correctly.” Speaking more broadly about the investigation, the federal official tells PEOPLE that video evidence from inside the church is “vital.” However, the official would not comment on whether this was video recorded by the church or came from parishioners’ cell phone cameras. • With reporting by JEFF TRUESDELL "

(Mark Mulligan/Houston Chronicle via AP)  Mark Mulligan  SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas — The gunman who killed 26 people at a small-town Texas church had a history of domestic violence and sent threatening text messages to his mother-in-law, a member of First Baptist, before the attack in which he fired at least 450 rounds at helpless worshippers, authorities said Monday. A day after the deadliest mass shooting in state history, the military acknowledged that it did not submit the shooter’s criminal history to the FBI, as required by the Pentagon. If his past offenses had been properly shared, they would have prevented him from buying a gun. Investigators also revealed that sheriff’s deputies had responded to a domestic violence call in 2014 at Devin Patrick Kelley’s home involving a girlfriend who became his second wife. Later that year, he was formally ousted from the Air Force for a 2012 assault on his ex-wife in which he choked her and struck her son hard enough to fracture his skull. In the tiny town of Sutherland Springs, population 400, grieving townspeople were reeling from their losses. The dead ranged from 18 months to 77 years old and included multiple members of some families. “Our church was not comprised of members or parishioners. We were a very close family,” said Sherri Pomeroy, the wife of the church pastor, who was out of town with her husband when the attack happened. “Now most of our church family is gone.” The couple’s 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle Pomeroy, was among those killed. Kelley’s mother-in-law sometimes attended services there, but the sheriff said she was not at church on Sunday. The massacre appeared to stem from a domestic situation and was not racially or religiously motivated, Texas Department of Public Safety Regional Director Freeman Martin said. He did not elaborate. Based on evidence at the scene, investigators believe Kelley died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after he was chased by bystanders, one of whom was armed, and crashed his car. The 26-year-old shooter also used his cellphone to tell his father he had been shot and did not think he would survive, authorities said. While in the military, Kelley served in logistics readiness at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his 2014 discharge, Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said. He was discharged for the assault involving his previous wife and her child and had served a year of confinement after a court-martial. Under Pentagon rules, information about convictions of military personnel for crimes such as assault should be submitted to the FBI’s Criminal Justice Investigation Services Division. Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said the service is launching a review of its handling of the case and taking a comprehensive look at its databases to ensure other cases have been reported correctly. A few months before he received the bad-conduct discharge, sheriff’s deputies went to his home to check out the domestic violence complaint involving him and his then-girlfriend. People in the house said there was no problem, and no arrests were made. Kelley married the girlfriend two months later. Also in 2014, he was charged with misdemeanor animal cruelty in Colorado after a neighbor reported him for beating a dog. Kelley initially refused to speak with officers about the incident. He denied abusing the animal but complied with an order to pay almost $370 in restitution. He was also the focus of a protective order issued in Colorado in 2015. Once the shooting started, there was probably “no way” for congregants to escape, Wilson County Sheriff Joe D. Tackitt Jr. said. The gunman, dressed in black tactical gear, fired an assault rifle as he walked down the center aisle during worship services. He turned around and continued shooting on his way out of the building, Tackitt said. About 20 other people were wounded. Ten of them were still hospitalized Monday in critical condition. Investigators collected hundreds of shell casings from the scene, along with at least 15 empty magazines that held 30 rounds each. Kelley lived in New Braunfels, about 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of the church, authorities said. Investigators were reviewing social media posts he made in the days before the attack, including one that appeared to show an AR-15 semi-automatic weapon. Less than two months ago, Kelley had started a job as an unarmed security guard at a nearby resort. He “seemed like a nice guy” and did not cause any problems, said Claudia Varjabedian, manager at the Summit Vacation Resort in New Braunfels. On Sunday, the attacker pulled into a gas station across from the church, about 30 miles (48.28 kilometers) southeast of San Antonio. He crossed the street and started firing the rifle at the church, then continued firing after entering the white wood-frame building, Martin said. As he left, the shooter was confronted by an armed resident who had grabbed his own rifle and exchanged fire with Kelley. The armed man who confronted Kelley had help from another local resident, Johnnie Langendorff, who said he was driving past the church as the shooting happened. The armed man asked to get in Langendorff’s truck, and the pair followed as the gunman drove away. “He jumped in my truck and said, ‘He just shot up the church. We need to go get him.’ And I said ‘Let’s go,’” Langendorff said. The pursuit reached speeds up to 90 (144 kph) mph. The gunman eventually lost control of his vehicle and crashed. The armed man walked up to the vehicle with his gun drawn, and the attacker did not move. Police arrived about five minutes later, Langendorff said. The assailant was dead in his vehicle. He had three gunshot wounds — two from where the armed man hit him in the leg and the torso and the third self-inflicted wound to the head, authorities said. “There was no thinking about it. There was just doing. That was the key to all this. Act now. Ask questions later,” Langendorff said. Church member Nick Uhlig, 34, who was not at Sunday’s service, told the AP that his pregnant cousin and her in-laws were among those killed. He later told the Houston Chronicle that three of his cousin’s children were also slain. Three weapons were recovered. A Ruger AR-556 rifle was found at the church, and two handguns were found in the gunman’s vehicle, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The church has posted videos of its Sunday services on a YouTube channel, and authorities said they were reviewing footage recorded inside the church. In a video of its Oct. 8 service, a congregant pointed to the Oct. 1 Las Vegas shooting a week earlier as evidence of the “wicked nature” of man. That shooting left 58 dead and more than 500 injured. The previous deadliest mass shooting in Texas had been a 1991 attack in Killeen, when a mentally disturbed man crashed his pickup truck through a restaurant window at lunchtime and started shooting people, killing 23 and injuring more than 20 others. ___ Weber reported from New Braunfels.

Sunday morning was all routine until then. Langendorff – a lanky Texan with a fuzzy chin beard and the long horns of a bull’s skull tattooed across his neck – had finished breakfast. Then he drove his truck on the dusty back streets toward his girlfriend’s house nearby. When he approached the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, he noticed something odd. As he passed the churchgoers’ vehicles parked around the white wood front of the building, he saw that one vehicle’s engine was running. It was a pearl-colored SUV, a Ford Explorer, he said. The driver’s door was open. A man clad all in black was walking toward the vehicle with a pistol. He was trading shots with another man holding a rifle. “I never got a look at him,” Langendorff explained to reporters later, his mouth working a toothpick, when asked about the black-clad shooter. “I never really saw him. I saw the gunfire.” The man in black hauled off in his SUV. The second man with the rifle – a neighbor identified Monday by Arkansas-based 40/29 News as Stephen Willeford – approached Langendorff. The two men were strangers. Willeford said his daughter heard gunshots at the nearby First Baptist Church and told him she’d seen a man in all-black attire, according to 40/29 News. A former NRA instructor who had many friends who attended the church, Willeford immediately sprung into action. “Every time I heard a shot, I knew that that probably represented a life. I was scared to death,” he told the news station. “I was scared for me. I was scared for every one of them. I was scared for my own family, who live less than a block away.” Willeford raced across the street to the church and confronted Kelley before Langendorff joined him. Langendorff said Willeford “briefed me quickly on what had just happened and said he had to get him.” “So that’s what I did.” As the two men shot off in pursuit in Langendorff’s truck, 26 First Baptist worshipers were dead or dying on the sanctuary’s maroon carpet. Dozens more were wounded. Sunday’s burst of violence would later be recognized as the fifth worst shooting in modern U.S. history, arriving just a month after 58 concertgoers were slain in Las Vegas. The Texas victims’ ages ranged from 5 to 72, according to authorities, though one family said a 1-year-old died. The shooter, who authorities identified as Devin Patrick Kelley, first opened fire on the outside of the church just after 11 a.m. with a Ruger assault rifle. Kelley, clad in black tactical gear, then sprayed the building’s inside with bullets. He hastily fled the scene after engaging in a gun battle with Willeford. Langendorff wove his truck at high speed through traffic while trying to catch the fleeing SUV. The speedometer crossed 95 mph while the driver narrated everything to law enforcement. “I was on the phone with dispatch the entire time,” he said. “I gave them the direction we were going, on what road and everything, and that the vehicle was in sight and that I was getting closer and closer to him.” Kelley’s vehicle, however, veered off the roadway and into a ditch about 11 miles north of the church. Langendorff pulled his own truck within 25 yards. “The gentleman that was with me got out, rested his rifle on my hood and kept it aimed at him, telling him to get out, get out. There was no movement, there was none of that. I just know his brake lights were going on and off, so he might have been unconscious from the crash or something like that, I’m not sure,” he said. Police were on the scene within five to seven minutes, Langendorff said Sunday night. Freeman Martin, a regional director for the Texas Department of Public Safety, told The Post that authorities had yet to determine whether Kelley was killed by a self-inflicted gunshot wound or hit in the gunfire at the church. Multiple weapons were found in Kelley’s vehicle. On Sunday night, Langendorff explained that his reaction – jumping into a car chase – was a simple calculation. “He just hurt so many people, he affected so many people’s lives, why wouldn’t you want to take him down?” “I’m no hero. I am not. I think, my God – my Lord – protected me and gave me the skills to do what needed to be done,” he said. “I just wish I could’ve gotten there faster.” Travis Andrews contributed to this report.

X OUR PICKS: By EMILY SCHMALL and WILL WEISSERT SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas (AP) — As usual, John Holcombe posted his Sunday school lesson online a day ahead. It was about an Old Testament miracle. Holcombe was expecting a small miracle of his own. His wife, a widow and mother of five, was pregnant with their first child. But the following morning, his family would bear an unspeakable burden: nearly a third of the fatalities in Texas’ worst mass shooting. The massacre inside their church in the tiny Texas town of Sutherland Springs spared Holcombe’s life, but not the lives of his wife, three of her children, his parents, a brother and a toddler niece. They were among 26 people fatally shot during the shooting rampage Sunday that also killed several members of at least one other extended family, a couple visiting for the first time, the pastor’s teenage daughter and other church goers. Investigators said the victims ranged in age from 18 months old to 77 years old. Hundreds of shell casings and 15 magazines that hold 30 rounds were found at the church, authorities said. Holcombe and his 36-year-old wife, Crystal, had recently married, said Julius Kepper, who lives about two blocks from the church. “She was starting her life all over again,” he told The Associated Press. “That’s a crying shame.” Holcombe suffered shrapnel wounds and Crystal’s youngest child, Evelyn, was grazed by bullets but both were discharged from the hospital on Monday, Crystal’s aunt, Michele Hill, told the AP. Crystal’s eldest child, Phillip, had stayed home from church that day, Hill said. She added that Crystal was due in early April. “They had actually just found out. They didn’t think it was possible so this was just a miracle baby,” Hill said. Michael Ward rushed to the church after he was abruptly awoken by his wife, Leslie, when she heard a peal of gunfire from that direction as she set up a yard sale. Ward told The Dallas Morning News he found and carried out his 5-year-old nephew, Ryland, who had four gunshot wounds. The boy was flown to University Hospital in nearby San Antonio, but the child’s mother and two of his sisters were killed. On Monday, the yard sale was still set up, with clothes laid out or hung on plastic racks, along with kitchen items. No one was there. Another victim was the pastor’s 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle Pomeroy. Her parents were both out of town during the shootings, which also wounded about 20 people. Another young victim was 16-year-old Hailey Krueger, the church and family members confirmed on social media. Investigators said the gunman, Devin Patrick Kelley, had recently sent threatening texts to his mother-in-law, a member of the church, and the shooting appears to have been driven by domestic tensions. Kelley was formally ousted from the Air Force for a 2012 assault on his ex-wife. He was found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound Sunday after he was chased by two community members and crashed his vehicle. Kelley’s mother-in-law wasn’t at the church Sunday. But his wife’s grandmother, 71-year-old Lula Woicinski White, was attending the service and died in the shooting, according to family members. Her stated occupation on Facebook: doing whatever was needed at the church. Karen and Scott Marshall had recently retired to Texas from Pennsylvania and were visiting the church for the first time when they were killed, Scott’s father, Robert Marshall, told the Pittsburg Tribune-Review. He said Karen Marshall had returned to Texas after finishing an assignment at Maryland’s Andrews Air Force Base, while her husband, an Air Force retiree, had been working as a civilian contractor and mechanic at Lackland Air Force Base, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of Sutherland Springs. Crystal Holcombe was an industrious mother who studied karate, loved to bake and raised goats. Images she posted last month showed her 11-year-old daughter Emily placing third in a county archery competition, while others showed her children standing behind cookies and cakes they’d made for a bake sale. Emily was among the children killed Sunday. Wilson County sheriff’s deputies were posted outside the Holcombes’ home, which is across a dusty two-lane road from grazing cattle. It’s a short drive from First Baptist Church. It’s also close to the Wards’ home, where an American flag has been mounted on the fence upside down since the shootings in Las Vegas on Oct. 1, an apparent memorial to the 58 victims of that attack, according to neighbors. ___ Schmall reported from Fort Worth, Texas.

http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-met-church-security-concerns-20171106-story.html,"The Rev. Kurt Hartrich doesn’t know what more he can do to keep his parishioners safe. They already must cross two thresholds and pass muster with security guards before they can enter the worship space at St. Peter’s in the Loop Catholic Church to pray. Still, some parishioners frown on the idea of a security guard clearing them for worship, even if it’s for their own protection. “People say ‘You’re a church. Why do you have these security people?’ ” said Hartrich, a Franciscan friar who oversees five Masses every weekday at the downtown church. “We certainly want everybody to feel welcome. … At the same time, if the security guards really feel it’s a possible security risk, they would take care of that.” Alarmed by the mass shooting at a small Southern Baptist church in South Texas, Chicago-area congregations of all sizes are trying to find a balance between acting out their mission of providing an open, welcoming environment to those who visit and keeping both newcomers and regulars safe. The same issue has long dogged synagogues, where threats of violence are not uncommon and membership has been in decline. Some churches have already decided to lock their doors more often to prevent vandalism and burglary, and limit access to the homeless. More recently, mosques have faced increasing security concerns. Some church leaders won’t openly discuss safety precautions, for fear of scaring away potential members or giving away security secrets. Others are training ushers and greeters to look for danger signs as soon as cars pull up and park, in hopes of deterring danger before it enters the building. In just the past year, hundreds of congregations have joined a coalition called Secure Church Chicago, a regional working group of Protestant, Catholic and Jewish clergy and volunteers who want to take a proactive, professional and pastoral approach to church safety. “We don’t ever want to create a sense of fear in our congregations,” said Mark Lundgren of Oak Brook, a former FBI agent and co-founder of the working group. “Our goal is to create worry-free worship, where someone can literally kneel down, bow their heads, close their eyes and not have to worry about looking over their shoulder.” The Rev. Myron McCoy, pastor of First United Methodist Church at Chicago Temple, said that during a regularly scheduled staff meeting on Monday his staff reflected on the Texas shooting in addition to how they handled a troubling visitor to their own congregation the same day. “It is extremely tricky, especially for us being downtown where you can encounter the full range of personalities, including our membership and still wanting to make our members feel safe and take the necessary precautions to make sure they feel safe,” McCoy said. At Rogers Park Presbyterian Church, elders had already installed cameras and stepped up security after a rash of burglaries and purse snatchers. But Sunday’s shooting prompted them to shut three of the four traditional entrances to the church and limit entry to the main doors at the top of a flight of steps. Cameras and ushers will be trained on each person climbing those steps, said Elder Franklin Rhodes. Jay Tcath, senior vice president of public affairs for the Jewish United Fund/Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Chicago, said after renewed threats of anti-Semitism surfaced this past year, 61 Jewish facilities invested about $2.4 million to upgrade security. As threats against mosques, churches and other nonprofits have risen in recent years, the federation has offered plenty of advice. Tcath said there are no shortcuts — houses of worship should consider installing cameras, hiring security and inviting law enforcement to audit their safety measures. But not all congregations and nonprofits are receptive. Some African-American churches and mosques distrust law enforcement, Tcath said. Others simply don’t like the visible reminders that sacred spaces can be targets. “The more they look like an armed fortress, the more off-putting it is to potential visitors, clients and would-be members,” Tcath said. But the truth is, no space is safe anymore, he said. “Whatever taboos may have existed in American society for decades and decades are also being broken down. There’s no universally accepted sacred spaces anymore, including churches,” he said. But Lundgren said that’s the balance the nearly 400 members of Secure Chicago are trying to find. Its tactics combine the best takeaways from military intelligence, counterterrorism and law enforcement with hospitality and compassion. Unlike other public venues such as courthouses, schools and sports stadiums, which have installed metal detectors, implemented bag searches and brought in bomb-tracking dogs and police troops to deter acts of violence, houses of worship have less flexibility when it comes to welcoming and protecting the faithful. A police officer in every pew doesn’t exactly inspire a pure focus on God. “A church almost needs to look like a soft target in order to be what it wants to be,” Lundgren said. If churches don’t adapt to the times, he added, the church’s mission will suffer. “Husbands and wives are going to be sitting across the dinner table on Saturday night asking the question ‘Should we take our kids to church tomorrow?’ ” he said. “That threatens the ministry model of every church in America.” mbrachear@chicagotribune.com @TribSeeker Related CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"
https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/11/06/hoaxes-and-false-information-proliferated-after-texas-church-shooting/23268798/," No, the man who killed 26 people at a Texas church on Sunday was not identified as Sam Hyde. Nor was he an ex-marine and Muslim convert, Samir Al-Hajeed. And nope, he wasn't a member of the militant ""anti-fascist"" group, Antifa, looking to kick off a civil war by targeting white conservatives. Related: Texas Church Shooter May Have Been Targeting His Mother-in-Law But these and other hoaxes and falsehoods proliferated in the aftermath of Sunday’s mass shooting, burrowing in on social media outlets and dubious news sites. Even on CNN, Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-Texas, twice on Sunday misidentified the shooter as Sam Hyde, saying that he’d received that name from officials who’d talked to his staff members. Hyde is actually a member of a Rhode Island sketch comedy group, Million Dollar Extreme, and a promoter of false theories embraced by the alt-right, including Pizzagate, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which interviewed Hyde in December. Hyde is also a favorite meme, and various images of him — his driver’s license photo, him holding a rifle — have appeared after previous violent attacks, including shootings in Orlando, Kalamazoo, Michigan, and after a van rampage in London. Another version of the Sam Hyde meme uses the same rifle image with a different identity — a U.S. marine and Muslim convert, Samir Al-Hajeed. That picture and others — along with the name Sam Hyde — were circulated after the shootings in Las Vegas and Texas. Gonzalez didn’t know any of this when he talked to CNN. In a statement, Gonzalez’s press secretary, Aryn Fields, said he doesn’t follow memes, “internet sensations, or twitter trends, and was unaware that this name is a viral internet hoax that has been connected to mass shootings in the past.” Gonzalez was given Hyde’s name not by staff, but by media, she said. While awaiting a television interview, Field said, “a producer informed the congressman that reports indicated that the shooter was a man named Sam Hyde.” Gonzalez then passed that name along during an interview that occurred immediately afterwards. “Given how fast the events transpired Sunday, Congressman Gonzalez took this report as reliable information,” the statement said. “It is something that he deeply regrets. Congressman Gonzalez is always briefed by staff and expert officials before making statements to the media regarding sensitive information.” This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.

http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-met-mary-shepard-texas-dahleen-glanton-20171106-story.html,"After the ghastly church shooting in Texas, I am reminded of Mary Shepard. Shepard was the lead plaintiff in the National Rifle Association’s lawsuit that forced the Illinois General Assembly to pass a law four years ago allowing residents to carry concealed firearms in the state. She is a fighter and a fierce supporter of Second Amendment rights. And though we disagree on many aspects of what that should entail, she is a woman for whom I have a great deal of respect. A few years ago, the then-74-year-old grandmother invited me to her home in rural southern Illinois to talk about the gruesome 2009 attack she suffered in the basement of the Anna First Baptist Church, where she worked as the treasurer. The assailant, who entered through an unlocked door, beat Shepard and another woman, 76-year-old church custodian Leona Mount, mercilessly. Shepard's skull was fractured in four places. Her nose and both cheekbones also were broken. After robbing the church of $300, the man fled, leaving the two elderly women on the floor unconscious and near death. Shepard was well-trained in the use of firearms. Had she been allowed to carry a handgun with her to church, she told me, she could have at least had a chance to defend herself. Her case — Mary E. Shepard and the Illinois State Rifle Association v. Lisa M. Madigan — convinced a federal appeals court to strike down the last state statute in the country that kept law-abiding citizens from carrying handguns in public. Perhaps a handgun would have given the 5-foot-2-inch Shepard an edge over her 6-foot-3, 245-pound attacker. No one can know for sure. But Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton thinks more gun-toting congregants could put an end to mass shootings like the one that occurred Sunday at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. “We’ve had shootings at churches for forever,” Paxton said on “Fox News Sunday.” “This is going to happen again. And so … we need people in terms of professional security or in terms of arming the parishioners or the congregation so that they can respond when something like this happens again.” Everyone knows that the issue of firearms is both complex and contentious. There is no “one-size-fits-all” answer to how to stop mass shootings from occurring in churches or anywhere else. But it is unlikely a parishioner armed with a handgun would have been able to subdue a determined killer like Devin Kelley. Dressed in all black, wearing bulletproof tactical gear, carrying a military-style rifle and equipped with dozens of rounds of ammunition, Kelley entered the Texas church prepared for a massacre. When he was done, 26 people, about half of them children, were dead. This is how the Texas attorney general responded: “All I can say is in Texas at least we have the opportunity to have conceal carry,"" he said. ""And so ... there's always the opportunity that gunman will be taken out before he has the opportunity to kill very many people."" The attorney general is delusional if he thinks an armed church member or even a security guard could have frightened Kelley into submission. A handgun would have been as powerless in Sutherland Springs as it would have been against Dylann Roof’s .45-caliber semi-automatic pistol and the arsenal of magazines and hollow-point bullets he used to kill nine people during Bible study at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C., two years ago. It was easy for gun lovers to write off Roof’s racially motivated attack as the act of a mentally deranged 21-year-old. Still, lawmakers never did anything to keep people like Roof from having access to firearms. In fact, in February, President Donald Trump made it easier for some 75,000 mentally ill people to get guns. He rescinded a rule put in place under President Barack Obama requiring the Social Security Administration to report certain mentally ill recipients to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which screens gun applicants. On Sunday, Trump said the Texas shooting was caused by “a mental health problem” not a problem with gun laws. ""This isn't a guns situation,"" Trump said. ""This is a mental health problem at the highest level. It's a very, very sad event."" It’s unclear whether Kelley actually suffered from mental illness. But we do know that he had a documented history of domestic violence. While federal law prohibits anyone convicted of domestic violence from obtaining a firearm, Kelley’s 2012 court-martial and discharge from the Air Force were never reported to the federal background check database, the Air Force acknowledged Monday. That, coupled with Texas’ lax gun laws allowing people to legally purchase assault weapons, was a deadly combination. Paxton’s misguided solution is to advocate for more guns, rather than figuring out how to keep firearms out of the hands of people who should not have them. “You can’t necessarily keep guns out of the hands of people who are going to violate the law,” Paxton said. “If someone is willing to kill someone, they’re also going to be willing to violate a gun law.” With that attitude, we’d might as well just give up trying. There is certainly was nothing wrong with citizens like Mary Shepard standing up for the right to carry a weapon in church. The problem is with people like Paxton, who believe that carrying a weapon in church can put an end to mass shootings. dglanton@chicagotribune.com Twitter @dahleeng RELATED CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"

http://theconversation.com/mass-shootings-in-america-4-essential-reads-86992,"Managing Editor, The Conversation US The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations View the full list Editor’s note: The following is a roundup of stories from The Conversation’s archive. Once again, Americans are asking themselves the same familiar, heartsick questions: How can gun violence be prevented? What policy or program could help save innocent lives? What is an approach that would be tolerable to people on both sides of the political spectrum? “Unfortunately, the research we need to answer these questions doesn’t exist – and part of the problem is that the federal government largely doesn’t support it,” explains Lacey Wallace, a criminal justice researcher at Penn State University. Why not? In 1996, Congress passed the Dickey Amendment, which mandated that “none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control.” From 1996 to 2013, CDC funding for gun research dropped by 96 percent. It’s an urgent problem, Wallace writes. In 2015, for example, roughly 85,000 people were injured by firearms, including nearly 10,000 children. Boston University’s Sandro Galea and Ziming Xuan focused on those children in a 2016 interview with The Conversation. One in four American children reports having easy access to a gun in the home, the researchers pointed out. “Parents sometimes do not fully understand child and youth development, impulsiveness or curiosity,” Xuan wrote. “A recent study shows that what parents report about their children’s access to guns often contradicts children’s reports,” he continued. “The kids reveal that they know the location of guns in the house and have handled the gun, while parents reported they did not. For injury prevention, it is far more effective and long-lasting to change the environment by changing modifiable policies and norms than to try to change the way children behave.” A mass shooting often brings out partisan politics. Those who want to regulate guns face off with those who want to protect the Second Amendment, and the political debate never seems to progress. “A new dialogue is desperately needed among policymakers and the public,” writes Timothy M. Smith, a professor of International Business at the University of Minnesota. “It could begin by shifting our focus away from the regulation of guns toward understanding (and mitigating) the social costs of firearm fatalities.” From a purely economic perspective, Smith writes, the social costs of gun deaths likely exceeded US$300 billion in 2013. This is a staggering number, more than what the federal government spent on Medicaid in the same year. And that’s not including the more than 80,000 nonfatal firearm injuries each year. Smith’s argument is not that you can put a price on human life, but that a government policy that discourages people from owning the most lethal types of guns – handguns – could protect society as a whole. Michael Siegel, a professor of community health services, and Molly Pahn of Boston University recently created a new database that offers insights into the effectiveness of existing laws across all 50 states for the past 27 years. “This database is intended to help researchers evaluate the effectiveness of different state-level approaches to reducing gun violence,” Siegel and Pahn write. “By examining the relationship between changes in these laws over time and changes in firearm mortality, researchers may be able to identify which policies are effective and which are not.” Global Challenges Podcast Series 2

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/uproxx/features/~3/brYDb9gu6Xs/,"In the wake of the horrific mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, people have been examining the reasons that these tragedies keeps happening. Americans are afraid, and the fact that they can’t even go to everyday places like shopping malls, movie theaters, and churches without fear of being gunned down is weighing on the minds of many. While this has led to many bad conclusions, this one from Fox News‘ Ainsley Earhardt might be the very worst. While interviewing Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R), Earhardt seemed to imply that getting shot in your place of worship isn’t the worst thing, saying: “We’ve been reporting this shouldn’t happen in a church. But I was downstairs talking with some people that work here that we all talk about our faith and we share the same beliefs. We were saying there’s no other place we would want to go other than church. Because I’m there asking for forgiveness. I feel very close to Christ when I’m there. So, I’m trying to look at some positives here and know that those people are with the Lord now and experiencing eternity and no more suffering, no more sadness anymore.” Abbott seemed to agree, urging viewers that it was a “necessity for us to come together under one God to purge evil and to rely upon the love that God provides.” Whatever your religion or creed, implying that people being massacred in the midst of worship is anything less than a tragedy seems deeply misguided. It also takes the freedom of religion that many hold dear in America and covers it in a shroud of fear, which most would agree is far more dangerous than discussing legislation following a mass shooting. UPDATE: A Fox News spokesperson passed along the following statement from Ainsley Earhardt. “As any Christian would understand, I feel church is sacred. For me, it is the place I worship, where I learn about God and feel closest to Him each week. I meant no disrespect, as I have continuously said, the Texas families are in my thoughts and prayers. And, anyone who truly knows my heart, knows that about me. But, I do believe there can be positives in death. Christians believe death is when they enter into the afterlife – a place without pain, suffering and away from the evil that takes place on earth like we saw this past weekend. I know one day I will take my last breath and if I am in His “house” when that happens, I pray my family can find a bit of solace and peace knowing that is where I saw Jesus for the first time. I pray for those families and the parents, children and loved ones who will be changed forever. I hope they cling to God during such a difficult time.” (H/T Raw Story)"
"http://berkshireeagle.com/stories/our-opinion-mass-shootings-cantever-become-mundane,523846"," Another day, another mass shooting in the United States. This time, 26 people killed and at least 20 others wounded while worshiping Sunday at a Texas church. Devin Patrick Kelley, dressed in all-black tactical gear, stepped into First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs and proceeded to spray the congregation with gunfire. The youngest killed was a 17-month-old girl. The oldest was a 77. Nearly half those killed were children. Kelley would later be found dead, reportedly from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. And yes, he was armed with military-style weaponry. Just as Stephen Paddock was when he rained bullets down onto concertgoers in Las Vegas on October 1, killing 58 people and injuring 546. Just as Omar Mateen was when he killed 49 people and wounded 58 others at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, on June 12, 2016. Just as Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik were when they killed 14 people and injured 22 others in San Bernardino, California on December 2, 2015. Just like Adam Lanza was when he fatally shot 20 children and six adults on December 14, 2012, in Newtown, Connecticut. These weapons are not designed for hunting or for protection but to kill many people quickly. That they have done once again. It's not reassuring to hear that Kelley should not have had access to firearms, according to Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a long-time foe of gun control measures. Kelley allegedly bought an assault rifle used in the killing in April of last year, two years after he had been court-martialed by the Air Force. He served a year in prison and received a bad conduct discharge in 2014 for assault on his spouse and assault on their child, according to news reports. President Trump's response was to proclaim that the shooting wasn't ""a guns situation"" but a ""mental health problem at the highest level."" Kelley may or may not have been mentally ill, but the U.S. is unique among civilized nations in the ease in which demented, angry or embittered people (usually white men) can readily get guns or assault weapons. However, if people with documented mental illness can be prevented permanently from acquiring guns that would constitute progress. On Friday, Massachusetts enacted a ban on so-called bump stocks, which enabled the shooter in Las Vegas to turn his semi-automatic firearm into a veritable machine gun. We were the first state to do so. Talk about doing so at a federal level proved to be just that — talk. It is plain that this country needs to ban not just bump stocks but military-style weapons and large-capacity gun clips. As long as the GOP remains the party in power, this is unlikely to happen, even though the majority of Americans support it according to polls. Guns, however, can be far more strongly regulated than they are now in America. This would not be counter to Supreme Court rulings on guns or the Second Amendment, which begins with the words ""A well-regulated..."" Until measures are taken at the federal level, the easy availability of terrifyingly effective weaponry to people who should not have access to them will continue. So will the murder of innocent people — including, as was the case in a small church in a small Texas town — children.  Get up-to-the-minute news sent straight to your device."
http://www.startribune.com/nation/455725823.html,"FORT WORTH, Texas – The man who opened fire on a rural church outside of San Antonio on Sunday, killing 26 worshipers and wounding 20 more, did not have a license to carry a gun in Texas, authorities said Monday. The gunman, Devin Patrick Kelley, 26, of New Braunfels, Texas, had purchased four guns over the past four years, two in Texas and two in Colorado. Authorities are trying to determine how Kelley, who was court-martialed by the military after abusing his wife and child, got his hands on the weapons. He received a bad-conduct discharge from the Air Force in 2014. The military on Monday acknowledged that it did not submit the shooter's criminal history to the FBI, as required by the Pentagon. If his offenses had been properly shared, they would have prevented him from buying a gun. In an interview on CBS News, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott described Kelley as ""someone who was a powder keg seemingly waiting to go off."" ""Under current law, he should have been prevented from making this purchase,"" Abbott said. ""How that got through the cracks, I don't have that information."" Kelley walked into the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs and opened fire in what is the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history. Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman Tom Vinger said Kelley did not have a license to carry in Texas. DPS officials giving updates on the case Monday morning said Kelley bought four guns — one a year from 2014 to 2017. Three weapons were recovered after Sunday's shooting. Two handguns — a Ruger .22 and a Glock 9mm — were found in Kelley's car. And a Ruger AR-556 rifle was found at the church, Texas Department of Public Safety Regional Director Freeman Martin said. There are several reasons people might be rejected from buying a gun, including if they are a fugitive, committed to a mental institution, unlawfully in the country — or if they have ""been discharged from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions,"" according to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. But Kelley wasn't dishonorably discharged from the Air Force. A bad-conduct discharge is not as severe as a dishonorable discharge. © 2021 StarTribune. All rights reserved."

http://people.com/human-interest/stephen-willeford-johnny-langendorff-who-stopped-shooter-embrace/,"Stephen Willeford and Johnny Langendorff seemed to be two of just a few people in the tiny town of Sutherland Springs, Texas, who did not know each other. Now less than 48 hours since they first met, they are forever bonded by both tragedy and their own heroic actions. The two men have both been hailed for their roles in pursuing Devin Patrick Kelley, the gunman responsible for Sunday’s mass shooting inside First Baptist Church, which killed at least 26 people. On Monday night, the men embraced as the town came together to hold a candlelight vigil for those lost in Sunday’s massacre. Willeford, 55, lived near the church and after his daughter alerted him to the shooting, he grabbed his rifle and ran to the building barefoot. “Every time I heard a shot, I knew that that probably represented a life. I was scared to death,” Willeford said of the shooter, in his first interview to the Arkansas-based news outlet KHOG, following the tragedy. “I was scared for me,” he said. “I was scared for every one of them. I was scared for my own family, who live less than a block away.” • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

Nonetheless, Willeford sprung into action. “He saw me and I saw him. I was standing behind a pickup truck for cover. I know I hit him. He got into his vehicle, and he fired another couple rounds through his side window. When the window dropped, I fired another round at him again,” Willeford said of the gunman. As the shooter pulled away in his car, Willeford stopped a nearby pickup truck to ask the driver, Langendorff, for help. The pair proceeded to follow the gunman and called 911 during their chase.

I went to direct traffic just in case there was crossfire. After that, police showed up.” The brief pursuit concluded in neighboring Guadalupe County, Texas, where the shooter was later found dead in his vehicle. Two of the bullets fired by Willeford hit Kelley in the leg and torso before Kelley shot himself in the head, authorities said during a Monday news briefing. "

BILLBOARD is a registered trademark of Billboard IP Holdings, LLC Kelsea Ballerini attends the 55th annual ASCAP Country Music awards at the Ryman Auditorium on Nov. 6, 2017 in Nashville. Singer songwriters Rodney Crowell and Kelsea Ballerini and hit country songwriter Ashley Gorley were honored at the ASCAP Country Music Awards in Nashville, Tennessee on Monday. Crowell, who announced earlier this year he was cancelling all his 2017 tour dates due to a health issue, was given the Founder’s Award and honored with performances by Keith Urban and Vince Gill. The multiple Grammy Award-winner, who turned 67 this year, announced on Twitter last month that he had been diagnosed with dysautonomia, a disorder of the automatic nervous system. Rodney Crowell Crowell said he was very grateful to be a songwriter for so long. “It’s a gift that we get to do the work that we do to call ourselves artists,” Crowell said. Gill, who performed “Oklahoma Borderline” and “Till I Gain Control Again,” told the crowd of songwriters about the time that he and Crowell dressed up as women for a music video they did together. “He looked like Bette Davis on crack cocaine,” Gill joked. “I looked like my granny.” Ballerini, whose second album Unapologetically came out last week, was given the Vanguard Award and performed her song “In Between.” She is also nominated for female vocalist of the year on Wednesday’s Country Music Association Awards. “Songwriting is my favorite part of what I do,” Ballerini said. The mass shooting at a country music festival in Las Vegas last month weighed heavy on the minds of the artists and songwriters Monday night as the Nashville musical community gears up for the CMA Awards. ASCAP President Paul Williams held a moment of silence for the 58 victims killed in Las Vegas. “There is no greater challenge for music than diminishing the hatred at the heart of these acts,” Williams said. “But I believe that music and those that make it are up to the task.” Gorley, who has written hits for Blake Shelton and Thomas Rhett and many more, thanked the first responders who were on the scene of the Vegas shooting and this Sunday’s shooting at a church in Texas. “All those responders and people who really, really deserve to be celebrated and may not get celebrated the way we do tonight, I just want to celebrate those tonight together,” Gorley said. Matthew Ramsey, lead singer of the country band Old Dominion, was named country songwriter-artist of the year and the song “Somewhere On a Beach,” which was performed by Dierks Bentley, was named country song of the year.

""We must come to the firm determination that there is a fundamental problem in our society,"" said Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, in a statement. ""A Culture of Life cannot tolerate, and must prevent, senseless gun violence in all its forms. May the Lord, who Himself is Peace, send us His Spirit of charity and nonviolence to nurture His peace among us all."" The gunman, identified as Devin Kelley, had received a bad-conduct discharge from the Air Force for allegedly assaulting his wife and child. He opened fire during an 11 a.m. church service and was found dead of a gunshot wound after fleeing the scene. Bishop Christopher Coyne of Burlington, Vermont, invited prayers for victims and their families in his statement, but added that we need ""prayers for ourselves that we may as a country somehow find a way to have a meaningful dialogue about what is to be done to stop these mass shootings, with an openness to hear each other and to seriously consider new policies and laws to protect people from this horror."" Speaking at an event at the University of Chicago, Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago also focused on policy changes, saying high-powered weapons, like the one used in the Texas shooting, should be illegal. “We don’t need military weapons in our society,” he told local media after an event at the University of Chicago Nov. 6. “We’re not supposed to be at war with one another. Let’s make sure that we don’t have weapons that declare war on each other,” he said. Bishop Richard Stika of Knoxville, Tennessee, called upon good people to stand up to ""the forces of evil."" He named ""the abundance of guns in our society,"" the portrayal of violence in mass media ""as something glamorous and inconsequential"" and ""the breakdown in civil discourse"" as major concerns. Bishop David Zubik of Pittsburg also described a culture of violence, ""where massacres are becoming commonplace,"" that needs to change. ""Too many of our movies glorify violence, too many television shows use violence as entertainment, and an increasing number of people use guns as the go-to option for expressing anger,"" he said. ""We need to reclaim a culture of life and a civilization of love, in which people actually solve problems by helping others."" ""There will always be wounded souls who seek to lash out in anger,"" Zubik added. ""We need to do everything possible to make it unthinkable and difficult to express that anger with a gun."" Archbishop Gustavo Garcia-Sillar of San Antonio wrote in a statement, ""We are committed to work in unity with all our brothers and sisters to build peace in our communities; to connect in a more direct and substantial way."" Garcia-Sillar also condemned all violence in a series of tweets Nov. 5. ""We have to let our leaders know that war, violence, arms do not help. Stop killings. Stop violence. We pray and work for peace. Care!"" he wrote, adding a few hours later, ""Governor, NO War, NO violence, NO guns. Enough is enough!!!!"" Non-Catholic leaders also weighed in on the attack, Religion News Service reported, some of them like Garcia-Sillar naming the availability of guns as a major cause of the shooting. The Rev. Katharine Henderson, president of Auburn Seminary in New York, wrote, ""God is setting before America a choice between life and death — we must choose the way of life that means a breaking of the death grip the National Rifle Association (NRA) has on our politics. The way of life is to grieve for those who have died and commit ourselves to a more peaceful future without this plague of gun violence.” The Rev. Robert Schenck, president of the Dietrich Bonhoeffer Institute in Washington, D.C., said the nation needs to ask our professionals ""how to deny murderous people the means for committing atrocities like this. … The question we must answer is why and how people bent on death and destruction can carry out their dastardly deeds so easily?” Advertisement Advertisement ""We are ALL complicit and have blood on our hands because we have the answers to avoid senseless killings happening to us, Americans,"" wrote Phyllis Hill, Southeast regional director of the ""LiveFree"" campaign of faith-based organization People Improving Communities through Organizing. ""How long must we send our sincere condolences, thoughts and prayers? How long before we manifest our sincerity with a change in policies and leadership?"" she asked. Meanwhile, U.S. political leaders were divided in their responses, with some condemning current gun laws while others simply offered ""thoughts and prayers."" President Donald Trump said in a statement, ""We cannot put into words the pain and grief we all feel and we cannot begin to imagine the suffering of those who lost the ones they love."" In a press conference, he attributed the shooting to mental health issues and said it was not a ""gun situation."" Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Connecticut) disagreed. ""As my colleagues go to sleep tonight, they need to think about whether the political support of the gun industry is worth the blood that flows endlessly onto the floors of American churches, elementary schools, movie theaters, and city streets,"" he said. Former Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona, who was shot in a 2011 assassination attempt, said mass shootings were ""not normal."" ""I am praying that our lawmakers find the courage to face our nation's gun violence problem,"" she said in a tweet. Enter your email address to receive free newsletters from NCR.

https://www.ncronline.org/news/people/26-killed-church-attack-texas-deadliest-mass-shooting,"Jump to navigation Free Newsletters Advertisement Advertisement Sutherland Springs, Texas — A man dressed in black tactical-style gear and armed with an assault rifle opened fire inside a church in a small South Texas community on Sunday, killing 26 people and wounding about 20 in what the governor called the deadliest mass shooting in the state's history. The dead ranged in age from 5 to 72 years old. Authorities didn't identify the attacker during a news conference Sunday night, but two other officials — one a U.S. official and one in law enforcement — identified him as Devin Kelley. They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the investigation. The U.S. official said Kelley lived in a San Antonio suburb and didn't appear to be linked to organized terrorist groups. Investigators were looking at social media posts Kelley made in the days before Sunday's attack, including one that appeared to show an AR-15 semiautomatic weapon. An Air Force spokeswoman said Sunday night that Devin P. Kelley received a bad-conduct discharge from the Air Force for allegedly assaulting his spouse and child, and was sentenced to 12 months' confinement after a 2012 court-martial. Kelley served in Logistics Readiness at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge, spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said. At the news conference, the attacker was described only as a white man in his 20s who was wearing black tactical gear and a ballistic vest when he pulled into a gas station across from the First Baptist Church around 11:20 a.m. The gunman crossed the street and started firing a Ruger AR rifle at the church, said Freeman Martin, a regional director of the Texas Department of Safety, then continued firing after entering the white wood-frame building, where an 11 a.m. service was scheduled. As he left, the shooter was confronted by an armed resident who ""grabbed his rifle and engaged that suspect,"" Martin said. A short time later, the suspect was found dead in his vehicle at the county line. Several weapons were found inside the vehicle and Martin said it was unclear if the attacker died of a self-inflicted wound or if he was shot by the resident who confronted him. He said investigators weren't ready to discuss a possible motive. Martin said 23 of the dead were found in the church, two were found outside and one died after being taken to a hospital. Addressing the news conference, Gov. Greg Abbott called the attack the worst mass shooting in Texas history. ""There are no words to describe the pure evil that we witnessed in Sutherland Springs today,"" Abbott said. ""Our hearts are heavy at the anguish in this small town, but in time of tragedy, we see the very best of Texas. May God comfort those who've lost a loved one, and may God heal the hurt in our communities."" Among those killed was the church pastor's 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle Pomeroy. Pastor Frank Pomeroy, and his wife, Sherri, were both out of town in two different states when the attack occurred, Sherri Pomeroy wrote in a text message to the AP. ""We lost our 14-year-old daughter today and many friends,"" she wrote. ""Neither of us has made it back into town yet to personally see the devastation. I am at the charlotte airport trying to get home as soon as i can."" Federal law enforcement swarmed the small rural community of a few hundred residents 30 miles southeast of San Antonio after the attack, including ATF investigators and members of the FBI's evidence collection team. At least 16 wounded were taken to hospitals, hospital officials said, including eight taken by medical helicopter to the Brooke Army Medical Center. Another eight victims were taken to Connally Memorial Medical Center, located in Floresville about 10 miles from the church, including four who were later transferred to University Hospital in San Antonio for higher-level care, said spokeswoman Megan Posey. Hunter Green, 16, normally attends the church with his girlfriend but they skipped Sunday after a late date night. Attending a candlelight vigil hours later, he described the building as having only small exits on the side and in the back that would have made it very difficult to flee a shooter entering the front door. ""They wouldn't have had anywhere to go,"" Green said. Alena Berlanga, a Floresville resident who was monitoring the chaos on a police scanner and in Facebook community groups, said everyone knows everyone else in the sparsely populated county. ""This is horrific for our tiny little tight-knit town,"" Berlanga said. ""Everybody's going to be affected and everybody knows someone who's affected."" Regina Rodriguez, who arrived at the church a couple of hours after the shooting, walked up to the police barricade and hugged a person she was with. She said her father, 51-year-old Richard Rodriguez, attends the church every Sunday, and she hadn't been able to reach him. She said she feared the worst. Church member Nick Uhlig, 34, wasn't at Sunday's service, but he said his cousins were at the church and that his family was told at least one of them, a woman with three children and pregnant with another, was among the dead. ""We just gathered to bury their grandfather on Thursday,"" he said, shaking his head. ""This is the only church here. We have Bible study, men's Bible study, vacation Bible school. Somebody went in and started shooting."" President Donald Trump, who was in Japan, called the shooting an ""act of evil"" and said he was monitoring the situation. ""We're shocked. Shocked and dismayed,"" said state Sen. Judith Zaffirini, a Laredo Democrat whose district includes Sutherland Springs, a rural community known for its peanut festival, which was held last month. ""It's especially shocking when it's such a small, serene area. These rural areas, they are so beautiful and so loving."" Later Sunday, two sheriff's vans were parked outside the gate of a cattle fence surrounding the address listed for Kelley on the rural, western outskirts of New Braunfels, north of San Antonio, preventing a group of waiting journalists from entering. Officials from the Comal County Sherriff's Office and the Texas Rangers declined to comment or say if they had raided his home. Ryan Albers, 16, who lives across the road said he heard intensifying gunfire coming from that direction in recent days. ""It had to be coming from somewhere pretty close,"" Albers said. ""It was definitely not just a shotgun or someone hunting. It was someone using automatic weapon fire."" The church has posted videos of its Sunday services on a YouTube channel, raising the possibility that the shooting was captured on video. In a video of its Oct. 8 service, a congregant who spoke and read Scripture pointed to the Oct. 1 Las Vegas shooting a week earlier as evidence of the ""wicked nature"" of man. That shooting left 58 dead and more than 500 injured. Advertisement Advertisement Until Sunday, the deadliest mass shooting in Texas had been a 1991 attack in Killeen, when a mentally disturbed man crashed his pickup truck through a restaurant window at lunchtime and started shooting people, killing 23 and injuring more than 20 others. The University of Texas was the site of one of the most infamous mass shootings in American history, when U.S. Marine sniper Charles Whitman climbed the Austin campus' clock tower in 1966 and began firing on stunned people below, killing 13 and wounding nearly three dozen others. He had killed his wife and mother before heading to the tower, one victim died a week later and medical examiners eventually attributed a 17th death to Whitman in 2001.

https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/07/country-music-awards-las-vegas-shooting-press-suppression,"Before this year’s ceremony, the CMA threatened to remove journalists asking about the Las Vegas shooting. Despite a reversal, it raises questions about the industry’s close connections with the NRA Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.15 BST In the years since the Dixie Chicks were exiled to the Island Of Misfit Toys for denouncing George Bush, the country music industry has fostered a fear-driven culture, in which artists have shied away from making statements that might be perceived as controversial. Indicative of this mindset is an utterly tone-deaf policy issued by the Country Music Association (CMA) roughly a week in advance of the 51st annual CMA Awards ceremony. Claiming that they wanted to focus on celebrating the year in country music, the CMA decreed that any journalists who broached topics of last month’s Las Vegas shooting, gun control, or any other politically unsavory subject when interviewing artists on the event’s red carpet would risk having their press credentials revoked and being removed from the grounds by security.  When the policy was announced, writers in the country music community expressed their outrage on social media, but the CMA remained silent for more than 24 hours. It only reversed its policy after a handful of artists – including the female vocalist of the year nominee Maren Morris and the CMA Awards’ long-standing co-host, Brad Paisley, in addition to acts like Margo Price, Will Hoge, Gretchen Peters, and Ryan Adams, who typically are not offered a seat at the CMAs’ table – denounced it. The apology statement was, predictably, half-hearted, insisting that the intent of the restriction on the press’ questions had been misinterpreted. Country music has always been about the truth. Out of respect for the Las Vegas victims, let’s keep it that way. By that point, the CMAs had lost control of the conversation and had no way to feign any type of moral high ground. Outside of CMT’s Artists of the Year special, which focuses on only a small group of acts, the CMA Awards ceremony will be the first high-profile event for the country music community since the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history occurred during the Route 91 Harvest festival, a country music concert series in Las Vegas. The CMA Awards broadcast presented the most prominent opportunity for the country music industry, as represented by its most prestigious and most visible guild, to offer a forum for healing or, at the very least, some type of collective acknowledgment of the devastation wrought by the attack. Instead, the CMA initially opted to issue a statement that journalists would be punished for bringing up the attack at all. That decision raises the question of what the CMA was so worried about. In the aftermath of the Route 91 Harvest festival shooting, the number of artists who have made definitive statements has been relatively small. Morris recorded a studio version of her song Dear Hate, long a fan-favorite at her live shows, and donated the proceeds to charity. Eric Church gave a moving performance of a new song, Why Not Me, a thoughtful and well-written tribute to the victims of the shooting, during his gig at the Grand Ole Opry a week afterward. Jason Aldean, the artist who was on stage when Stephen Paddock opened fire on the festival’s crowd, opened Saturday Night Live’s 7 October episode with a cover of Tom Petty’s I Won’t Back Down, paying homage concurrently to both the late Petty and the shooting victims. Beyond that, the acts who have made the most forceful and potentially controversial statements regarding country music’s ties to America’s gun culture were never going to be featured prominently on the CMA broadcast in the first place. Price, Rosanne Cash, and Caleb Keeter, the guitarist for the Josh Abbott Band who shared a post about how the shooting had caused him to change his views on gun control, aren’t among the nominees or presenters for the show. While a few artists – including the A-listers Thomas Rhett and Florida Georgia Line – have distanced themselves from the National Rifle Association’s “NRA Country” promotional push, the 2017 CMA Award nominees Luke Combs and Jon Pardi both remain affiliated with NRA Country. Outside of NRA Country, which began in 2010, gun culture has been inextricable from country music from its inception and continues to figure prominently in many acts’ material. Miranda Lambert sang about getting “the first buck of the season” in her hit Famous In a Small Town, Chris Stapleton’s murder ballad If It Hadn’t Been for Love has been covered by no less an artist than Adele, and Luke Bryan recently scored a No 1 single with Huntin’, Fishin’, and Lovin’ Every Day. Lambert, Stapleton, and Bryan are all in the running for awards again this year. The likelihood that a current top-tier country music star would give a soundbite on the topic of gun control at the CMA Awards is so infinitesimal that it’s curious that the CMA felt the need to issue its policy on acceptable questions at all. What was missing from the CMA policy, however, was a direct statement about whether journalists could ask questions about the disgraced Nashville publicist Kirt Webster, who shuttered his powerful PR firm last week amid a staggering constellation of allegations of harassment, bullying, and sexual assault. Webster is a longtime member of the CMA, and his PR firm represented a huge talent roster that included current stars like Big & Rich, William Michael Morgan, and Justin Moore alongside genre legends including Dolly Parton and Charley Pride. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences moved quickly to expel Harvey Weinstein from its ranks following the litany of sexual assault claims that have been made public. To date, the CMA has said nothing about the allegations that have been levied against one of its most influential members, and that silence is troubling. That the CMA attempted to steer journalists away from controversial topics on the same day that the allegations against Webster surfaced seems like a concerted effort to control a narrative. Ultimately, the CMA has raised more questions than it ever could have hoped to avoid by making and then retracting its ill-conceived and poorly timed media policy."

https://www.aol.com/article/entertainment/2017/11/07/fox-news-host-church-is-the-best-place-to-get-shot/23268819/," “Fox & Friends” co-host Ainsley Earhardt stretched too far trying to find a silver lining in reporting on the mass shooting at a Texas church that left 26 people dead. Earhardt suggested that church was the best place for a tragedy like this to happen specifically because the people there were already close to God anyway. “We’ve been reporting this shouldn’t happen in a church. But I was downstairs talking with some people that work here that we all talk about our faith and we share the same beliefs,” Earhardt said during an interview with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. “We were saying there’s no other place we would want to go other than church. Because I’m there asking for forgiveness. I feel very close to Christ when I’m there.” SEE ALSO: Woman loses job for giving Trump the ‘F–k you’ See photos of Ainsley Earhardt: “So, I’m trying to look at some positives here and know that those people are with the Lord now and experiencing eternity and no more suffering, no more sadness anymore,” Earhardt continued. This is especially tasteless when reports say half of those dead in the shooting were children, and the Texas shooting is the deadliest church shooting in American history. While there’s nothing wrong with turning to faith in a time of crisis, Earhardt has unnecessarily created a controversy here by suggesting that anyplace is good for tragedy, let alone a church, which should be a sanctuary.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/07/trump-texas-church-shooting-tougher-gun-laws-would-not-have-prevented,"First published on Tue 7 Nov 2017 12.41 GMT Donald Trump has claimed tougher gun laws would not have prevented Sunday’s mass shooting at a south Texas church, arguing that more restrictions might have led to more casualties.  Speaking at a news conference in South Korea on Tuesday where he was asked about “extreme vetting” for gun purchases, the president said: “If you did what you’re suggesting, there would have been no difference three days ago and you might not have had that very brave person who happens to have a gun or a rifle in his trunk.” As he did following last month’s Las Vegas massacre of 58 people, Trump pushed back against the question, calling it a “situation that probably shouldn’t be discussed too much” and noted that he was “in the heart of South Korea”. Trump added that if “Good Samaritan” Stephen Willeford had not had a gun, “instead of having 26 dead, you would have had hundreds more dead”. Authorities say Devin Kelley fired at least 450 rounds of ammunition at worshippers in Sunday’s attack at the First Baptist church in Sutherland Springs. The dead ranged in age from 18 months to 77 years old. Air force investigators did not enter the record of Kelley’s conviction for brutal domestic abuse into the national background check system that gun sellers use to check whether potential purchasers are allowed to buy a gun, at least according to “initial information”, an air force spokeswoman, Ann Stefanek, said in a statement on Monday evening. Republican senator John McCain said the Senate armed services committee would investigate “this failure”. “It’s critical that each of the military services take the steps necessary to ensure that similar mistakes have not occurred and will not occur in the future,” the Arizona senator said. Trump’s more muted response to gun violence contrasts with his swift call for legislative and military action following the 31 October truck attack in New York City. Within hours of a rental truck ramming through a crowded bicycle path and into a school bus, Trump called for Congress to “immediately” repeal the diversity visa lottery program that suspect Sayfullo Saipov, an Uzbekistan citizen, used to enter the country in 2010, and argued for more “extreme vetting” of newcomers to the US. After the Las Vegas shooting, Trump and aides said it was inappropriate to consider a policy response while people were still grieving. Despite days later suggesting openness to outlawing the bump stock device that allowed Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock to fire at near-automatic rates, the Trump administration has shown no signs of urgency and no legislation has been passed. Trump, who supported gun control before reversing his position to enter the Republican presidential primary, courted the NRA’s endorsement in 2016, and earlier this year became the first president in three decades to speak at the gun group’s annual convention.

In the aftermath of the massacre of 26 people in a small-town Texas church, you might have seen that the killer used a gun called an AR-15. It’s a popular weapon—relatively easy to use, endlessly customizable, military in appearance. How popular? It’s the same gun that a killer used in the massacre of 58 people at a Las Vegas concert last month, and by the killer who murdered 49 people in a nightclub in Orlando, and the one at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. And the movie theater in Aurora, Colorado. And the party in San Bernardino, California. Oh, but wait: It’s also the gun, apparently, that someone in Texas used to shoot back at the killer at First Baptist Church, accurately enough to pinpoint places his tactical vest didn’t protect. “We keep hearing that AR’s are useless for self-defense, that they’re simply ‘weapons of war,’ useful only for mass killing. This is simply not true,” writes David French at The National Review. He didn’t save lives inside the church, French goes on to say, but this straight-from-the-gun-advocate-storybook good guy with a gun “did stop the shooter and prevented him from harming anyone else. He did so with exactly the kind of weapon that the gun control lobby would like to deny to law-abiding Americans.” Well, OK. Good question then. Is it possible that the AR-15 isn’t just an overpowered long gun beloved by the National Rifle Association but a necessary component of civilian defense in the absence of armed authorities? Somebody should figure this out, right? Except you can’t. The government doesn’t keep track of how many AR-15s are out there or who owns them. Only through painstaking excavation of crime reports could anyone even begin to figure out which crimes involved AR-15s or when AR-15s stopped crimes—much less where those ARs came from, how they were stored, or how they were modified. That data is either off-limits or simply doesn’t exist. “If we had easy access to the kind of data we have on motor vehicle crashes for firearm violence, we would be able to answer much more clearly a whole host of questions about gun policy—about which state laws are working, which storage practices work, which guns are riskier than others, what ammunition sizes and magazines matter. I could go on and on,” says Jon Vernick, codirector of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. “We’re already in a world where science is questioned, in particular the role of science in policymaking. No one who’s realistic thinks science is sufficient for good policymaking. But it’s clearly necessary.” You see that lack—or rather don’t see it, I guess—with guns. It comes up with every mass shooting and more rarely when people talk about the epidemic of suicides and accidental gun deaths in the United States. But that data void is growing like the ozone hole in the 1980s, an encroaching Big Nothing. Washington Post politics reporter Philip Bump has been updating a list of things President Trump has undone in office, and an eye-popping number are numbers: oil and gas company payments to foreign governments, corporate salaries organized by race and gender, employer records of workplace injuries, government contractor labor law violations, health effects of mountaintop-removal mining, safety issues at chemical plants, visitors to the White House. Did you want to know any of those things? You cannot. No one who’s realistic thinks science is sufficient for good policymaking. But it’s clearly necessary. Jon Vernick, Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research Would you like detailed information about arrests, homicides, and gang murders in 2016? Well, the FBI isn’t giving it to you anymore. How about melting Arctic ice? Nope; Congress is dismantling a satellite that was supposed to update the aging monitor network. Climate change? Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, doesn’t think human beings cause it and, more importantly, doesn’t really think you can measure anything to find out. The weather? Forget it; the National Weather Service is coming apart at the seams. How many people live in the United States, data critical to determining political representation and funding priorities? Yeah, no—the 2020 Census is shaping up to be an epic disaster. It’s hard to imagine a good argument for knowing less—about anything, really, but especially about difficult problems with profound policy implications. The government is supposed to base policy on the best data possible, along with political concerns, budget concerns, social priorities ... the usual warp and weft of running a country. Yet the Trump administration is running in the other direction. Any data that has even the faintest whiff of potential contradiction goes right out the window. Of course, these folks aren't the first people in power to succumb to a fear of data. They do, however, seem to have found a profound expertise in the practice of eliminating it. Dataphobia chills them to the bone, I suspect because they hope to undermine not only some truths but all truth. David Roberts at Vox has written about what he calls an epistemic crisis in America, the idea that certain rulers and rich people hope to take away the basic idea of knowledge. If nobody can know anything, why bother to try to regulate anything? It’s government-by-ignorance—a shrugocracy. Assaults on data have come before. “It’s the same reason an oil company doesn’t want research on climate change or a tobacco company doesn’t want research on the relationship between tobacco and cancer,” Vernick says. “Maybe they argue those researchers have an agenda and that’ll allow them to cook the books, but that’s an absurd argument. The worst thing you can do is cook the books. That is the way to guarantee the science is not used as part of policymaking.” Throw in the way the automotive industry resisted safety regulations and the sugar industry in the 1960s shifted blame for health problems onto fats instead of sweets, ensorcelling nutrition research for half a century, and you have a pretty good accounting of the ways business interests have twisted, biased, and otherwise hammered science into behaving like a corporate drone instead of a defender of truth. When it comes to guns, the data dearth goes back decades. In the mid-1990s, the National Rifle Association persuaded congress to prohibit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from funding firearm violence research. That chilled the entire federal science funding structure. The agency that regulates firearms now doesn’t even share with researchers all its data on what guns are traced to what crimes. “While there were interests that were committed to obfuscating the situation or making it more difficult to conduct the work, the magnitude of the effect probably is unique to firearm violence,” says Garen Wintemute, director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at UC Davis. “There’s no doubt in my mind that there are hundreds of thousands of dead people who would now be alive had the work been allowed to proceed.” Now, though, even more stands at risk. This isn't just about undermining data anymore. It's about abandoning its collection. “I’ve called it an undercurrent, and I’m not even sure it’s an undercurrent anymore. There’s clearly an assault on science that worries me quite a bit. It’s climate denialism when we’ve suffered three catastrophic hurricanes, one that put my city underwater. In my state of Texas, more than 50,000 kids are not getting vaccinated for totally phony reasons,” says Peter Hotez, Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. “It’s starting to affect our quality of life, and important policy decisions that are being made that need to be made correctly.” I might disagree with Hotez, though—because he’s not going far enough. The attack is on the idea of science, on the notion that science is a good way to know stuff. You observe the world around you, formulate an idea for why the world might be that way, develop a test that isolates that one factor and tests it, and then operate on the data you collect to figure out if it bears out your original idea. And then you pummel that idea with all the ways it might be wrong. If it survives, hey, awesome, you misunderstand the universe slightly less egregiously than you did before all that work. The night is a little less dark. Abdicating on the collection of data cuts that method off at the knees. It plants ignorance where there might have been knowledge, and worse makes science look weak through induced failure—as if, like some propagandists say of the press, it’s irredeemably biased by leftist researchers and can’t be trusted. Not only does the night stay dark, but people stop believing in daylight, and anyone who suggests it's real must have a daylight-based agenda. That’s the epistemological crisis. Since the Enlightenment people have relied on science to be, in some senses, the referee to help make difficult calls. That was especially true in America—one of the preeminent scientists of his time, Benjamin Franklin, was literally in the room for the creation of both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. And now that's changing. Undermine that science, and things don’t just seem unknown but unknowable. Science in Danger Sarah Zhang Joanna Pearlstein Maryn McKenna According to the information warfare expert Molly McKew, the Russian government is practicing something called the Gerasimov Doctrine, threading chaotic, contradictory, often false, always divisive information throughout the global media—mainstream, alt, social, whatever. The point isn’t to make any one person believe any one thing. It’s to make all the people believe none of the things. As Roberts wrote in Vox, policymaking becomes nothing more than a contest of raw power— “tribal epistemology,” as he calls it. Here, then, is the real danger. As a practice, science (and, I’ll add out of a perhaps naive romanticism, journalism) are supposed to be the arenas to which a non-practitioner can turn for knowledge and clarity. Confronted with its own crisis—in the reproducibility of its findings—the institutions of science turned in part to data hygiene, making complete datasets public, as is the practice at the journal Hotez edits. If the president and his corporate allies choke the life out of data, the shrugocracy turns into a shrugpocalypse. “From the point of view of people attempting to obstruct the acquisition of knowledge, making the substrate from which knowledge is acquired unavailable, hard to get, or of lower quality yields many benefits,” Wintemute says. “There are adverse effects to the rest of us, but benefits to the people who are doing the obstruction.” That might be most vexing to the scientists themselves, the ones best trained in acquiring knowledge in the field and with the most faith in their methods and justifications. “I see patients in the emergency department, and because I took an oath—and for much deeper reasons—I believe strongly in using my life to help relieve suffering,” Wintemute says. “I will make use of whatever tools are available or whatever tools I can fashion on my own, but that is the work I will continue to do. It’s frustrating. I could do more with better tools. But that fact is no argument against doing what I can with what I have.” Knowledge will always be power, and no one ever gives up power willingly.

http://ew.com/tv/2017/11/07/stephen-colbert-texas-church-shooting/,"'Vote for someone who will do something' about gun control, he said To those who feel “hopeless” and “powerless” in the wake of the church shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, Stephen Colbert wants to remind you that “there is one power you mustn’t ever forget — and that is you can vote.” “You can go vote in 2018,” he said in an address on The Late Show Monday night. “Vote for someone who will do something [about gun control] because this is an active evil and the only thing necessary for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing.” A gunman walked into the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs on Sunday and killed 26 parishioners, marking the deadliest mass shooting in the history of Texas. This comes just over a month after the mass shooting in Las Vegas, and Colbert says “nothing gets done” about these tragedies. “No one does anything and that seems insane, and it can make you feel hopeless,” he said. “Now, I don’t know what to do, but I know hopelessness is not the answer. You cannot give up in the face of evil. Nothing gets done about what happened in Las Vegas, they can’t even pass a restriction on gun stocks — those bump stocks that turn a semi-automatic weapon into almost a full automatic weapon. That died, nobody’s talking about that. Nothing gets done to control the guns that kill 10,000 people a year around America — not just in these mass killings — and doing nothing, as I have said before, is unacceptable.” “Five thousand years ago,” he added, “if your village had a tiger coming into it every day and was eating people, you wouldn’t do nothing. You would move the village, or build a fence, or you would kill the tiger. You wouldn’t say, ‘I guess someone’s going to get eaten every day because the price of liberty is tigers.'” Colbert then seemed to attack gun lobbyists and the N.R.A. with veiled remarks: “This hopelessness, this powerlessness you feel when nothing gets done is something, as I’ve said, that we can’t give into ‘cause I actually think there are some people out there — some truly evil people out there — who want you to feel powerless just for a buck because if you feel powerless enough, you know what might make you feel more powerful? Going to buy a gun. It’s a vicious cycle. Violence happens, nothing gets done to get rid of the guns, and people buy more guns to protect themselves, and now there’s just more guns out on the street.” Watch Colbert’s full remarks in the clip above."
https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/11/07/lapse-in-background-check-database-allowed-texas-shooter-to-buy-weapons/23269246/," SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas, Nov 7 (Reuters) - The man who committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history was able to buy guns legally from a sporting goods store because a prior domestic violence conviction was never entered into an FBI database used in background checks, officials said. Devin Kelley, the gunman in Sunday's massacre at a church in rural southeastern Texas, was found guilty by court-martial of assaulting his first wife and a stepson while assigned to a U.S. Air Force logistics readiness unit in 2012, the Pentagon disclosed on Monday. The Air Force also acknowledged that it had failed to transmit information about Kelley's conviction to the National Criminal Information Center (NCIC) system, a U.S. government data bank used by licensed firearms dealers to check prospective gun buyers for criminal backgrounds. RELATED: What we know about the Texas church shooting suspect Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman Freeman Martin put the number of victims killed in the attack at 26, including the unborn child of a pregnant woman who died. The dead otherwise ranged in age from 18 months to 77 years. Twenty others were wounded, 10 of whom remained in critical condition late on Monday, officials said. Two handguns were found in Kelley's getaway vehicle, where he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head after a failed attempt to flee from the scene of Sunday's shootings, Martin told a news conference on Monday night. The Air Force opened an inquiry into how it handled the former airman's criminal record, and the U.S. Defense Department has requested a review by its inspector general to ensure that other cases ""have been reported correctly,"" Pentagon officials said. Firearms experts said the case involving Kelley, 26, who spent a year in military detention before his bad-conduct discharge from the Air Force in 2014, had exposed a previously unnoticed weak link in the system of background checks. It is illegal under federal law to sell a gun to someone who has been convicted of a crime involving domestic violence against a spouse or child. A sporting goods retail outlet said Kelley passed background checks when he bought a gun in 2016 and a second firearm this year. Neither the NCIC nor two related databases contained any information that would have barred Kelley from legally buying any of three weapons police recovered from their investigation of the slayings, said Christopher Combs, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation office in San Antonio. 'TEXAS HERO' Police said Kelley stormed into the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, dressed in black and wearing a human-skull mask, and opened fire on worshippers with a Ruger AR-556 semi-automatic rifle. Kelley was shot twice - in the leg and torso - by another man, Stephen Willeford, who lived nearby and confronted Kelley with his own rifle as the gunman emerged from the church. Kelley managed to flee in a sport utility vehicle as Willeford waved down a passing motorist, Johnnie Langendorff. The two then gave chase in Langendorff's pickup truck until Kelley's vehicle crashed in a ditch. RELATED: Victims of the Texas church shooting Martin later hailed Willeford as ""our Texas hero,"" crediting him with preventing further carnage in Sunday's rampage, which ranks as the deadliest mass shooting by a lone gunman in the state and one of the five most lethal in modern U.S. history. Authorities also said Kelley had been involved in a domestic dispute of some kind with the parents of his second wife, whom he married in 2014, and had sent threatening text messages to his mother-in-law before the shooting. Although his in-laws were known to occasionally attend services at the church Kelley attacked, Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said family members were not present on Sunday. The attack stunned Sutherland Springs, a community of about 400 people. One family, the Holcombes, lost eight members from three generations in the attack, including Bryan Holcombe, an assistant pastor who was leading the service, a relative said. The first shots came through the windows of the church, according to an account related to CNN by the son of one of the survivors, 73-year-old Farida Brown, who was shot in both legs. The assailant then stalked inside and sprayed the pews with gunfire, walking up and down the aisles targeting people even as they ran for cover or lay on the floor. Farida Brown was in the last pew, beside a woman who was shot multiple times, her son, David Brown, said. ""She was pretty certain she was next, and her life was about to end. Then somebody with a gun showed up at the front of the church, caught the shooter's attention. He left and that was the end of the ordeal,"" David Brown told CNN. Martin said investigators found hundreds of spent shell casings inside the church after the shooting, as well as 15 empty 30-round ammunition magazines.

https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/11/07/trump-says-gun-control-laws-would-have-led-to-hundreds-more-dead-in-texas-shooting/23269257/," President Donald Trump still doesn't support gun control measures after a gunman killed 26 at a small church in Texas, and even suggested it may exacerbate the problem. Trump, who praised an armed civilian that shot the gunman, rebuffed suggestions from a reporter that ""extreme vetting"" for prospective gun owners could help. He said: ""If you did what you're suggesting, there would have been no difference three days ago,"" referring to the shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Trump then shifted to talking about Stephen Willeford, who lived near the church and came out of his home armed after hearing the shooting to confront the gunman. RELATED: Photos from the scene of the Texas shooting ""I can only say this. If [Willeford] didn't have a gun, instead of 26 dead, you would have had hundreds more dead. So that's the way I feel about it, not going to help,"" said Trump. On Monday, Trump blamed the shooting on ""mental health,"" calling the gunman a ""deranged individual"" and dismissing the shooting as a ""guns issue."" ""This is a mental health issue at the highest level and it's very very sad,"" said Trump. ""That's the way I view it."" The US has more mass shootings than any other developed country and looser gun control laws than other nations with similar demographics. The gunman, Devin Patrick Kelley, should not have been able to buy a gun due to a felony on his record during his time with the US air force, but the existing gun control laws in place failed to work as the Pentagon had not released Kelley's record to background checking agencies. Kelley reportedly owned four guns purchased after his conviction for assaulting his wife and child. In the attack, Kelley killed the grandmother of his wife as he opened fire in the church.

http://people.com/crime/texas-church-shooting-witness-8-year-old-survivor/,"Kathleen Curnow tells PEOPLE she tended to an 8-year-old girl who survived the Sunday morning mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas Soon after Kathleen Curnow called 911 on Sunday morning to report the sound of gunfire at the church across from her house in Sutherland Springs, Texas, her husband crossed the street to investigate amid the gathering first responders. “I kept waiting for people to come out but no one was coming out. My husband went to the doors of the church. He’s a strong man, but he said, ‘What I saw I was not prepared for,’ ” she tells PEOPLE. And then from inside the First Baptist Church — the site of what would become the deadliest mass shooting in modern Texas history — came an 8-year-old girl, escorted out by authorities, Curnow says. “She [the girl] hid and they brought her to me and they said immediately after, ‘We don’t know, can you just hold her for a minute?’ ” Curnow, 43, recalled on CNN. She tells PEOPLE the child was “covered in blood and human flesh,” with “a bruise on her forehead.” Curnow tended to her as the details of the rampage became more apparent. “We kept her on the porch because she was nodding her head and I didn’t want to take her inside and not be able to get her out,” Curnow says. She continues: The girl “lost everybody but her stepfather. He came out and he was very stunned and dazed. He saw her and there was a sigh of relief. Her aunt was one of the ones coming late to church. We were able to get them together. I told them to stay as long as they want. “After that, there were not a lot of people walking out. I was very thankful to learn that many of the people actually escaped from the side or the back. They got to safety at a convenience store close by. If they had stayed, I guarantee they wouldn’t have made it.” As authorities later detailed, a gunman in all-black tactical gear and armed with an assault rifle began shooting on First Baptist from outside, around 11:20 a.m. Sunday during a worship service, before walking into the church and continuing to fire. At least 26 people were killed and 20 more injured. • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

The shooter, identified as 26-year-old disgraced former Air Force member Devin Kelley, fled the scene after exchanging gunfire with a local resident outside the church. He died from a self-inflicted gunshot in a neighboring county. Children were among the victims, who ranged in ages from 18 months to 77 years old, according to authorities. It was not immediately clear how the girl that Curnow cared for was connected to other victims, though at least one family, the Holcombes, lost eight relatives in the attack. Joann Ward and two of her daughters were also killed. “The devastation for these families, many of these families that I’ve known all my life, it’s unbelievable,” Curnow says. She noted that while she worked in San Antonio, Texas, about 35 miles away, she had purposefully chosen to live in the more rural Sutherland Springs. “If this is going to happen here, it makes no difference where I live,” she says. • PEOPLE’s special edition True Crime Stories: 35 Real Cases That Inspired the Show Law & Order is on sale now. On Sunday morning, as Curnow was with the young girl on her porch before her stepfather also re-emerged, she says she offered her aid and comfort. “We were in the shade, I got her apple juice, I was trying to clean her up,” Curnow says. “I asked her, ‘Sweetie what’s your name? Where do you go to school? Do you have brothers and sisters? Do you live close to here? Do you remember any phone numbers?’ “I told her, ‘You’re very, very brave.’ “ "

http://rssfeeds.jsonline.com/~/487489732/0/milwaukee/home~Why-AR-style-rifles-are-common-among-mass-shootings/,"Corrections and Clarifications: A previous version of this story erroneously included a mass shooting in Oregon in which the gunman did not use an AR-15. AR-15 style rifles have been the weapon of choice in many recent mass shootings, including the Texas church shooting Sunday, the Las Vegas concert last month, the Orlando nightclub last year and Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. The manufacture of rifles more than doubled in the past decade, to nearly 3.7 million rifles manufactured in 2015, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Much of the growth coincided with the Obama administration, when industry experts said gun owners were worried the government would restrict weapon sales. Amid that growth, the AR-15 style weapon became popular for its ease of use and versatility. The National Rifle Association has called the AR-15 the ""most popular rifle in America"" and estimates Americans own more than 8 million of them. The NRA said ""the AR-15 has soared in popularity"" because it's ""customizable, adaptable, reliable and accurate."" It is also versatile and can be used for ""sport shooting, hunting and self-defense situations,"" the NRA said, adding the ability to ""personalize"" so many of the rifle's components ""is one of the things that makes it so unique."" The site TacticalGear.com offered a favorable comparison of the U.S. AR-15 to the Russian-made AK-47. The AR-15 has a higher base price, shoots farther effectively, fires more rounds per minute, is lighter and its service life is longer if properly maintained, the site said. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence said the AR-15, a civilian model of the military’s M-16, also cited the weapon’s versatility in evaluating its popularity. “They’re accurate and they can basically shoot as quickly as you can pull the trigger,” according to a campaign statement. “Along those lines, they’re very customizable — most average people can figure out how to install accessories like forward trigger grips that let you hold the gun at waist height and spray bullets while stabilizing the gun, laser sights, and you can add high-capacity magazines.” Dean Hazen, owner of The Gun Experts in Mahomet, Ill., and a master firearms instructor, said the reason mass shooters are turning to the AR-15 is due to a ""copy-cat"" mentality more than any feature of the rifle. ""It’s really just a perception thing,"" Hazen said. ""There are rifles that are more powerful and more dangerous than that, but they're not being used."" For example, Hazen says the AK-47 — and its semiautomatic variants — is a ""far more wicked gun than an AR-15."" The AK-47 variants can hold just as many rounds as the AR-15, are more reliable and use larger 7.62 mm rounds as opposed to the standard AR-15's .223 rounds. Some killers might be drawn to the AR-15 because they are the ""weapon of choice"" for the military and police. But ironically, the police ""choose it because it is under-powered, Hazen said, ""making it less likely to penetrate interior walls and hit an unintended target."" The Army is considering moving to a higher-caliber rifle partly because that would make the weapon more deadly. Hazen said the AR-15 has ""gotten a bad rap."" He believes mass shooters generally don't know much about guns and choose the AR-15 because of the reputation it has gotten from being used in other mass shootings. ""Thank God they don't know any better because if they did they would use much more effective weapons,"" Hazen said.

State Department: Whoops, We Just Found a Lot More Americans Who Want to Leave Afghanistan A Telling Anecdote from Clarence Thomas 30 Years of Justice Clarence Thomas BREAKING: Supreme Court Sets November 1 Oral Argument on Texas Abortion Case Some colleagues sent me the New York Times article “What Explains U.S. Mass Shootings? International Comparisons Suggest an Answer” today. My jaw just about hit the floor when I saw the chart that appears at the top of the piece, above everything else except the title and byline: Uh, notice a problem there, guys? You can’t compare across countries without adjusting for population. A country with more people, all else equal, will have both more guns and more mass shootings, driving a false correlation between the two.
They get to the adjusted data about halfway through the piece. It’s true that the U.S. and Yemen are the countries with the most guns and the most shooters — and that is something that could, plausibly, suggest that easy access to guns increases mass shootings. But also worth noting is that there’s no pattern visible for the entire rest of the data set. Gun ownership varies from basically nonexistent to above 30 guns per 100 people, yet these variations don’t obviously correspond to variations in mass shootings.

 
There are a few other issues with the piece worth pointing out, in no particular order:
‐ Their mass-shooting numbers and much of their analysis — including a claim that gun ownership correlates with mass shootings even after the U.S. is excluded and overall homicide rates are taken into account — come from the researcher Adam Lankford, who has refused to share information about his analysis with media outlets likely to criticize him.

As I’ve noted numerous times before, there is no simple, consistent correlation between gun ownership and murder or homicide rates in general, either among developed countries or among U.S. states. More sophisticated studies face a variety of serious methodological obstacles — I don’t find any of them that compelling — and have reached varying conclusions. The research on mass shootings in particular is in an even more primitive state. ‐ They claim that the U.S. has more lethal crime than other developed countries but not more crime in general, and argue that guns are the difference. Even if we take the initial claim at face value, in blaming guns we encounter the problem that, as Steven Pinker once put it, “If you subtract out all the gun homicides in the United States and you just look at the homicides committed with, say ropes, candlesticks, and daggers, we still kill people at a higher rate.” I went through various reasons for our high rate of lethal violence here. I wouldn’t purport to know for a fact that gun ownership doesn’t lead to higher homicide or mass-shooting rates, but the effects are far more complicated and subtle than gun controllers want us to believe.

http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2017/11/07/nov-8-letters-assault-rifles-are-weapons-of-war-not-hunting-tools/,"Trending: And again a mass shooting by someone with an assault rifle.  How many times must we relive this kind of tragedy?  How many people must become victims while we debate Second Amendment rights?   Assault rifles are weapons of war, not hunting tools.  Yes, cars, knives, bombs can also be used as weapons of mass destruction, but can’t we at least focus on the use of  automatic weapons and try to eliminate them from civilian life? And how about increasing mental health services for those in need? We have the knowledge and means to accomplish these goals.  Now let’s have the courage to do so. Kathleen Moe
San Jose  Regarding the unfortunate Texas shooting, Americans can get automatic weapons too easily. We need legislation against these types of guns. We can choose to oppose legislators who will not support gun-control. Japan virtually has no gun deaths yearly. Australia made strict gun laws immediately after a mass shooting incident years ago. Why can’t we as a country do the same? Celeste McGettigan
San Jose The Bay Area is deeply divided on almost every issue, from gun control and abortion to taxation.  It appears that the one thing that we all agree on is that PG&E should not be allowed to charge ratepayers for the Wine Country fires if the utility is responsible for causing the fires. Are you listening PUC? Pam Ashford 
Los Gatos The California Apartment Association’s letter (Letters, Nov. 5) was misleading. New affordable housing will not be ready soon, yet escalating rents are driving families out of area now. San Jose’s rent control (RC) ordinance of 1979 (limited to pre-1980 construction) needed to be updated. Between 2009 and 2015, inflation-adjusted rent for RC apartments increased by 32 percent, yet adjusted-median incomes for renters have decreased by 2.8 percent. The city was right to reduce the cap on rent increases from 8 percent to 5 percent in May, although a 5 percent increase is still high when income buys less and less. Most rent-controlled apartments here are owned by large, profitable corporations. Small landlords (I am one) own only 1 in 8 rent-controlled units. Annual operating costs run about 33 percent of gross rents in RC units (American Community Survey). Proposing to make tenants pay utilities directly to landlords would hide utility costs from users and discourage incentives for conservation plus legalize a practice currently illegal.

San Jose There is a scene in the first Batman movie where the Joker (Jack Nicholson) and his henchmen parade thru town literally throwing millions of dollars into the streets as the citizens claw over one another to scoop up the cash. The heroine Vicky Vale (played by Kim Basinger) snaps photos of the groveling masses, as her journalist partner declares that the ensuing headline will read, “Gotham’s Greed!” I thought of this as my wife and I walked with our 4 year-old grand-daughter to our favorite Los Gatos patisserie and were stunned by the masses waiting in a very long line at the Los Gatos Apple outlet to snag their coveted iPhone X’s. Walking back later we spied one grinning young man cradling his 4 iPhones, assuming that at least three of them were then already listed on eBay. In our own greater Bay Area literally thousands of women, children, and families go to bed each night hungry and homeless, yet there is disposable wealth to devour literally millions of $1,000 smart phones, something is truly wrong with this picture.

 San Jose State University Robert Mueller’s zeal in probing for any possible unsavory connection between US and Russian citizens sharply contrasts with the Department of Justice’s lack of zeal in prosecuting prominent individuals in the financial community in connection with the 2008 financial meltdown.  Jesse Eisinger, a Pulitizer Prize winning writer, suggests that after the difficulty it encountered in successfully convicting prominent Enron executives in a previous financial meltdown case officials in the Justice Department didn’t have the stomach to prosecute prominent financiers in 2008.  Perhaps the Department of Justice should be re-named the Department. of Selective Justice. K. R. Kummerer
Saratoga Enough is enough.  After more than two years of vigorous debate over San Jose’s decades old rent control law and the enactment of many new laws, the city is proposing even more burdensome regulations that cost residents millions of dollars.  And, these regulations only impact about one-third of the city’s rental housing units. In the past 18 months, San Jose lowered the allowable rent increase from 8 percent to 5 percent. Now it’s proposed to be lowered further. Strict rent controls fail to consider increases in wages, maintenance costs, utilities, and city taxes/fees. Tenant advocates have portrayed property owners as villains, but most of San Jose’s rent controlled housing is owned locally.  The proposed laws will have a far greater impact on San Jose residents — not the big corporations. The ink is barely dry on the laws that just passed.   Let’s see what’s working before spending millions more on even tougher laws that will not solve the housing shortage. John Schaefer
San Jose What is it about Donald Trump that is the greatest threat to our peace and prosperity? It’s not his poisonous personality, his immaturity, his vindictiveness, his propensity to lie.  It’s his world view.  Building a wall between us and the rest of the world as a strategy to make America great again is obvious folly, as is his agenda to denigrate and punish immigrants. His aversion to truth is dangerous, as in his inability to acknowledge global warming.  But the most frightening behavior stems from his success as a bully.  We can expect him to threaten war — and in particular nuclear war — against North Korea, in response to threats and insults from one impoverished  adversary.  Trump with his finger on the nuclear trigger is the ultimate nightmare.

https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/11/07/the-fbi-has-the-texas-church-shooters-phone-but-cant-get-in/23269775/," The FBI has the Texas church gunman's phone, but it can't unlock it. The development recalls the FBI's dispute with Apple after the San Bernardino shooting in 2015. Investigators are hoping the phone could contain clues to help explain the gunman's motive. FBI agents have gotten hold of the cell phone belonging to the gunman who killed 26 people in a Texas church on Sunday. But there's one problem — it can't get in. ""They're in the process of looking at the phone,"" Christopher Combs, the special agent leading the investigation into the shooting, told reporters on Tuesday. ""Unfortunately at this time, we are unable to get into that phone."" Investigators are hoping the phone contains clues that could help explain Devin Kelley's motive for entering First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, with an assault rifle and opening fire on parishioners. The attack ended when an armed resident fired back at Kelley and pursued him when he drove away. Kelley was soon found dead in his vehicle in what officials have said was likely a suicide. RELATED: A look at the high-profile shootings of 2017 The FBI's inability to gain access into Kelley's phone recalled the agency's dispute with Apple in the aftermath of the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. In that case, Apple repeatedly denied the FBI's request to unlock the iPhone of one of the two perpetrators of the shooting, which left 14 people dead. The FBI eventually unlocked the phone with the help of a third party. ""With the advance of the technology and the phones and the encryptions, law enforcement … is increasingly not able to get into these phones,"" Combs said. On Tuesday, Combs declined to specify what type of phone the Texas church gunman had. ""I don't want to tell every bad guy out there what phone to buy, to harass our efforts on trying to find justice here,"" Combs said. ""I can assure you that we're working very hard to get into the phone, and that will continue until we find an answer."" Kelley's motivation for the attack is still unclear, although officials have ruled out racial or religious animus. Officials instead pointed to a possible ""domestic situation"" with his mother-in-law, who previously attended the First Baptist Church, but was not present during the attack.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Bryan Llenas shares latest details known about the tragic event Celebrities have taken to social media to speak out in favor of gun control following a deadly mass shooting at a Texas church. At least 26 people were killed Sunday when a gunman opened fire at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, located roughly 30 miles southeast of San Antonio. The shooter, identified as Devin Patrick Kelley, was found dead in his vehicle and believed to have suffered a ""self-inflicted"" gun shot wound. Famous faces have since been utilizing their social media accounts to share messages online. While most offer their condolences, others have used the incident to call for more gun control in the United States. In the wake of the shooting, the National Rifle Association also has been slammed by ""Veep"" actor Timothy Simons and ""Nurse Jackie"" actor Lenny Jacobson. ""The @NRA is a terrorist group who control congress with $$$. Nothing will change until that stops,"" ""Nurse Jackie"" actor Lenny Jacobson tweeted Sunday. "".@nra you are a terrorist organization. you aid, abet, and protect terrorists,"" Simons tweeted. Comedian Chelsea Handler was also among the first to react to the incident, blaming Republicans by saying: “Innocent people go to church on Sunday to honor their God, and while doing so, get shot in killed. What country? America. Why? Republicans.” Britney Spears offered thoughts and prayers for the community saying, “My heart breaks over the news coming out of Texas. My prayers are with the Sutherland Springs community.” Apple CEO Tim Cook shared those sentiments saying, “Shocked and sorrowed by the heartbreaking news from Texas. Prayers for all those touched by violence today: victims, survivors, worshippers.” “Texas... we love you. This is truly awful. Sending my deepest condolences to everyone affected. Something must be done,” Victoria Justice wrote. “Local official says 27 people were shot and killed, dozens injured.  Heart with Sutherland Springs, Texas at this terrible time,” Mia Farrow said. Piers Morgan shared the numbers saying, “The population of Sutherland Springs is 643. At least 50 of them just got shot. That's one in 12 of the entire community. #SanAntonio."" Comedian Bob Saget got serious about the incident saying, “My heart hurts for the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. This has to stop.” “Just nothing. No words. Numb. Again. May everyone affected in Texas rest in and find peace,” wrote singer Josh Groban. “No words. My heart is broken for Sutherland Springs, TX and for 2017 America. Please let’s all come together,” wrote comedian Sarah Silverman. Others focused their thoughts less on the victims and community and more on calling for gun control. Writer and director Adam McKay wrote, “Mass carnage in Sutherland Springs. We can do better than this. The idea of zero new gun safety laws isn’t just idiotic it’s murderous.” “Prayers for #SanAntonio and all the families who are suffering the loss of loved ones. I’ll pray also for #GunControl,” said Lady Gaga. Debra Messing called on congress directly saying, “CONGRESS- the Horror of #SutherlandSprings is on YOU. BAN #gunstocks NOW. Las Vegas was basically Yesterday! Shameful, complicit,no excuses.” ""Where's the next mass shooting gonna be? Any guesses? Should we try to do anything we can to prevent it? No? Ok cool. Good luck out there!"" comedian Billy Eichner wrote. Reality television star Kim Kardashian posted a screenshot of a tweet from motivational speaker Michael Skolnik. ""One shoe bomber tried to blow up a plane and now we take off our shoes,"" Skolknik wrote. ""1520 mass shootings since Sandy Hook and Congress has done NOTHING."" Actress Reese Witherspoon tweeted on Sunday that she was ""heartbroken"" by the shooting. Additionally, author Stephen King also tweeted about the attack, asking ""how many more have to die before we enact sane gun control laws?""

http://people.com/country/cmas-2017-brad-paisley-awards-pay-respects-las-vegas-shooting/,"""It's very important to use this show as a vehicle to uplift our community,"" says the awards' cohost The country music community will honor the victims of the mass shooting in Las Vegas at the 51st CMAs. Brad Paisley — who will cohost the awards with Carrie Underwood Wednesday — opened up to PEOPLE exclusively about plans for the telecast, which will pay tribute to those harmed at the Route 91 Harvest Festival. In October, a gunman killed 58 people and injured 527 at the country music festival, making it the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. “It’s very important to use this show as a vehicle to uplift our community and our industry,” says Paisley, 45. “No one wants an entire show that’s negative or dark; that wouldn’t be doing a service, honestly, to what happened.” Paisley adds: “The best thing we can do is acknowledge it, pay our respects, and then perform this music and use this music for what it’s best at, which is unifying and giving us joy and finding the light here. I think that’s really what we want to do.” “This year’s show is dedicated to all those lost and all those still healing. We love you and we will never forget you,” Paisley said as they opened the show. Now in their tenth year of hosting country music’s biggest night, Paisley and Underwood, 34, will continue to use comedy in their monologue and throughout the show. “Humor is an important aspect,” says Paisley. “It may be more important than ever that we make some people laugh this year.” The Country Music Association faced backlash last week when the organization released its media guidelines for the 2017 awards, which prohibited press from focusing on questions about “the Las Vegas tragedy, gun rights, political affiliations or topics of the like.” CMA later retracted the restrictions after Nashville stars — including Paisley, Maren Morris and Cam — spoke out against them. Miranda Lambert, Little Big Town and Keith Urban scored the most nominations for the awards show, where Reba McEntire and Kelsea Ballerini, Niall Horan, Garth Brooks, Thomas Rhett and many more will perform. The 51st CMA Awards will be held at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville on Nov. 8 at 8 p.m. ET. The show will air live on ABC. "
https://www.salon.com/2017/11/06/an-nba-coach-has-a-smarter-reaction-texas-church-shooting-than-any-republican/,"NBA head coach Gregg Popovich has been a welcoming voice in the Trump era. The future Hall of Famer has criticized the president for his rhetoric on issues of race and inequality, but on Sunday he was not in a talkative mood. Hours before his team, the San Antonio Spurs, faced off against the Phoenix Suns, a mass shooting at a church occurred about 30 miles from the arena. The Spurs held a moment of silence before the game for the victims of the First Baptist Church shooting. After the game, a 112-96 victory for the Spurs, Popovich addressed the shooting in front of a pool of reporters. ""We won a basketball game, but considering what's gone on today it's pretty meaningless,"" Popovich said. ""When you think about the tragedy that those families are suffering, it's just inconceivable and impossible to put your head around. So I think talking about basketball tonight is pretty inappropriate. So you guys have a good night."" Quick Popovich reaction... basketball not important after what occurred today in Texas #Spurs pic.twitter.com/8Iu7iWNJGy — Jabari Young (@JabariJYoung) November 6, 2017  It was a proper response from a well-respected leader in west Texas. It also juxtaposed with the tone-deaf reactions from some Texas politicians. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, for example, said on TV that mass shootings can be prevented in the future by people taking advantage of the state's concealed-carry law. ""All I can say is, you know, in Texas at least we have the opportunity to have concealed-carry. And, so, if it's a place where somebody has the ability to carry, there's always the opportunity that gunman will be taken out before he has the opportunity to kill very many people,"" Paxton said, forgetting that 27 people died despite the same circumstances he had just described. Popovich has become the voice of reason in Texas. The five-time NBA champion has articulated the frustrations and despair Americans have felt since the 2016 election. In January, Popovich praised the Women's March, telling reporters that Trump needs to be put on notice. ""The march today was great. The message is important,"" Popovich said. ""Somebody said on TV, 'What's their message?' Well, their message is obvious: that our president comes in with the lowest approval rating of anybody whoever came into the office, and there is a majority of people out there, since Hillary won the popular vote, that don't buy his act."" In an interview last week with former Obama communications director Dan Pfeiffer, NBA head coach Steve Kerr said that he would vote for Popovich if he ran for U.S. president. With Sunday night's win against the Phoenix Suns, Popovich passed Phil Jackson for sixth place on the NBA’s all-time coaching wins list with 1,156 wins.  Copyright © 2021 Salon.com, LLC.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/11/06/who-is-devin-patrick-kelley-gunman-who-officials-say-killed-churchgoers-in-sutherland-springs/,"This article is more than 1 year old NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas — The gunman suspected of opening fire at this town’s First Baptist Church Sunday was a former U.S. Air Force airman who had a string of legal troubles beginning in at least 2012, when he was court-martialed and sentenced to a year in military prison for assaulting his wife and child. Devin Patrick Kelley, 26, killed more than two dozen people before fleeing the scene and apparently taking his own life, authorities said. Police said Monday morning that the shooting followed a “domestic situation” and that at least one of his relatives attended the church he targeted. While authorities offered no specific motive, the details help fill in the patchwork profile emerging of Kelley in the aftermath of the country’s most recent deadly mass shooting. Kelley enlisted in 2010 and served as a logistical readiness airman at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek told The Washington Post. Court records in nearby Alamogordo, N.M., show that in October 2012, Tessa K. Kelley filed for divorce against Devin P. Kelley. The case appears to have concluded in a matter of days, with a settlement recorded the same day as the initial filing. There are no children listed in the proceedings. Following his prison sentence, Kelley was reduced in rank and released from the military with a bad conduct discharge in 2014. Investigators hunt for motive in Texas church shooting as the grieving spans generations Earlier that year, he was charged with a misdemeanor count of mistreatment, neglect or cruelty to animals in El Paso County, Colo., where he lived at one point, records show. On Aug. 1, 2014, sheriff’s deputies responded to a call of a man who was punching a dog, police records show. Four witnesses told deputies that they saw a man matching Kelley’s description yelling at and chasing a white and brown Husky. “The suspect then started beating on the dog with both fists, punching it in the head and chest,” a deputy wrote in the incident report. “He could hear the suspect yelling at the dog and while he was striking it, the dog was yelping and whining. The suspect then picked up the dog by the neck into the air and threw it onto the ground and then drug him away to lot 60.” Kelley was charged with animal cruelty and the dog was transferred to the Humane Society for a full medical evaluation. Records indicate that Kelley lived for some period on a property valued at about $800,000 owned by his parents in New Braunfels, Tex., a rural suburb of San Antonio about 35 miles north of Sutherland Springs. The secluded home sits on 28 acres of wooded farmland, separated from the nearest main road by a long private driveway. Neighbors told local media that Kelley lived in a barn in back of the 3,700-square-foot home with his current wife and 2-year-old son. They said the family had lived there for more than a decade. Dave Ivey, who identified himself as Kelley’s uncle, apologized to the shooting victims in an interview with NBC News. “I never in a million years could have believed Devin could be capable of this kind of thing,” Ivey said. “My family will suffer because of his coward actions.” Cars lined the highway outside the house at 2825 FM 2722 on Monday morning. A Comal County sheriff’s truck blocked the property’s gate, which was adorned with a “Beware of dog,” sign. Doug, who lives across the street and declined to give his last name, said he didn’t get to know the family at all, in the 11 years he lived on the road. “The only time I see them is when they’re going out and they don’t even look my way,” he said. He said he didn’t recognize the shooter. He said he regularly heard gunshots coming from the property across the street but thought little of it. The noise used to shake his two small dogs, Scholtz and Gretchen, he said. Mark Moravitz, who lives across the street from the Kelley family, also said he frequently heard gunfire coming from the property, often around 10 or 11 p.m. “We hear a lot of gunfire a lot,” he told KSAT, “but we’re out in the country.” Reached by phone Sunday night, several other neighbors told The Washington Post that they didn’t know the Kelley family but noted that several ranches in the area allow hunting. The sound of gunshots isn’t unusual, they said. The other deadly church shooting in America on Sunday Moravitz told local media that the Kelley family traveled frequently, so he would house sit for them. He described Kelley as a “regular guy” and said it was “shocking” to hear about the shooting. “You never think your neighbor is capable of something like that,” he said. “If he did that, that kind of worries you, thinking we’ve been living next door to the guy.” Other neighbors told KENS 5 that they would sometimes see couches, bicycles, lawn mowers and other household items along the street in front of the property, placed there as if they were free for the taking. Officials described the shooter’s weapon as a Ruger AR-556, an assault-style rifle similar to those used by the military. CNN, citing a law enforcement individual, reported that Kelley purchased the weapon in April 2016 from an Academy Sports & Outdoors store in San Antonio. A Facebook page bearing Kelley’s name showed a photo of a Ruger assault-style rifle. The page was taken down at some point on Sunday. The Los Angeles Times reported that in recent months Kelley had started adding strangers from the Sutherland Springs area as Facebook friends and picking fights with them. Johnathan Castillo told the Times that he accepted Kelley’s friend request a couple months ago, but deleted it soon after. Castillo said of Kelley: “It’s like he went looking for it, you know what I mean?” Attempts to reach members of Kelley’s immediate family were unsuccessful late Sunday night. During the evening, Texas Rangers and a K-9 vehicle were staked out in front of the family’s house, according to local media. Deputies were reportedly guarding the entrance to the home. Hawkins and Tate reported from Washington. Joel Achenbach in New Braunfels and Sandhya Somashekhar, Wesley Lowery, Alex Horton and Travis Andrews in Washington contributed to this story.

Hundreds gathered Monday night in a tiny Texas town to pray and embrace family and friends after a gunman opened fire on worshipers in church. By
      
        Claudia Koerner Reporting From Sutherland Springs, Texas Reporting From Sutherland Springs, Texas Posted on November 7, 2017, at 12:02 a.m. ET SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas — A day after a gunman turned a Sunday service into a bloodbath, this small Texas town went back to church. Around 200 people, ducking past police tape, gathered Monday night at a field blocks away from the First Baptist Church for what was billed as a memorial for the 26 people killed and 20 others wounded in the worst mass shooting in Texas history. But really, it was a return to Sunday’s worship as a band led the crowd in praise music, area pastors offered up prayers, and friends and family embraced. From children to the elderly, those gathered raised their hands as they sang, “I exalt thee, oh Lord."" For reporters and media at the scene, Cornerstone Church’s Mike Gonzales, one of the organizers of the event, had a message: “You report — you report that God is alive in this place.” Among those joining in prayer was Sutherland Springs resident Helen Biesenbach, who has attended First Baptist for nearly 30 years. “It makes me feel so proud that people that believe in God come together, [it’s] a supportive community that are firm believers in God,” she said. “It’s an awesome feeling seeing people coming together, people wanting to help, people wanting to rebuild the church.” Seeing the lives of so many dedicated members of the church lost, and other longtime friends in the hospital has left her numb. “This church family was my everything,” she said. Biesenbach had stayed home from Sunday’s services; she was babysitting her 2-year-old grandson for the weekend, and he came down with a fever. “I believe God has a message for me,"" she said. ""Maybe he thinks I needed to be here for my grandbaby.” Biesenbach said she fears for the future children like her grandson will face if the country continues in the direction it’s going. The world would be better if more people kept God in their life, she said, and raised their children to know right from wrong. With First Baptist shuttered for now, that’s a little bit harder to do. “I know the First Baptist church was an outlet for these kids,” she said. “They needed a place to come and share their feelings with friends and be a part of something.” Seeking solace in community is what brought Mark Escovedo to the event. Now a hog farmer, he worked for many years as a locksmith and in the course of that work met Bryan Holcombe, who was leading First Baptist’s service on Sunday and also ran an upholstery shop. “Any time you could go in and chat with the man, he was salt of the earth, [he] would make you laugh,” Escovedo said. “If you were having a bad day, he’d joke around until you felt good leaving. It was good for the soul.” Holcombe was killed along with seven members of his family — a magnitude of grief that Escovedo is still struggling to comprehend. “What do you say to people who have lost half their family?” Escovedo said. “You cry all day at home, then you want to cry with somebody else, I guess.” The attack on the church has also left Escovedo feeling deeply that mass violence can happen anywhere in America. More talk needs to be focused on preventing the next tragedy, he said. “We’re country people and we don’t like to give up our guns,” he said. “But we’re going to have to realize, it’s time to change. Everything’s changing.” Violence is an unfortunate but inevitable part of the world, Noemi Munoz said. Munoz, whose children have classmates who attend First Baptist, led a prayer on Monday calling for those in the community to find strength in God and each other. “We all wish there’d be peace, but it’s kind of impossible,” she said. “If we all put our little grain of salt, we can at least make a difference in our community and make our community safer.” She said she felt called to do Christ’s work on Monday, offering what support she could to Sutherland Springs residents. She said she hoped her words brought hope. “There’s hope for tomorrow, and even in these hard times they can see that they’re not alone.” buzzfeed.com  Claudia Koerner is an editor and reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in Los Angeles.

http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/religion/~3/fo2jQzF2uDg/ct-texas-church-shooting-20171105-story.html,"SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, TEXAS — A man dressed in black tactical-style gear and armed with an assault rifle opened fire inside a church in a small South Texas community on Sunday, killing 26 people and wounding about 20 others in what the governor called the deadliest mass shooting in the state's history. The dead ranged in age from 5 to 72 years old. Authorities didn't identify the attacker during a news conference Sunday night, but two other officials — one a U.S. official and one in law enforcement — identified him as Devin Kelley. They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the investigation. The U.S. official said Kelley lived in a San Antonio suburb and didn't appear to be linked to organized terrorist groups. Investigators were looking at social media posts Kelley made in the days before Sunday's attack, including one that appeared to show an AR-15 semiautomatic weapon. Kelley received a bad-conduct discharge from the Air Force for allegedly assaulting his spouse and child, and was sentenced to 12 months' confinement after a 2012 court-martial. Kelley served in Logistics Readiness at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge, Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said. At the news conference, the attacker was described only as a white man in his 20s who was wearing black tactical gear and a ballistic vest when he pulled into a gas station across from the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio, around 11:20 a.m. The gunman crossed the street and started firing a Ruger AR rifle at the church, said Freeman Martin, a regional director of the Texas Department of Safety, then continued firing after entering the white wood-frame building, where an 11 a.m. service was scheduled. Wilson County Sheriff Joe D. Tackitt Jr., whose territory includes Sutherland Springs, said there was likely ""no way"" for the church congregation to escape once the shooting started. ""You've got your pews on either side. He just walked down the center aisle, turned around and my understanding was shooting on his way back out,"" said Tackitt, who said the shooter also carried a handgun but that he didn't know if it was fired. Tackitt described the scene inside the church as ""terrible."" ""It's unbelievable to see children, men and women, laying there. Defenseless people,"" Tackitt said. ""I guess it was seeing the children that were killed. It's one thing to see an adult, but to see a 5-year-old ..."" As he left, the shooter was confronted by an armed resident who ""grabbed his rifle and engaged that suspect,"" Martin said. A short time later, the suspect was found dead in his vehicle at the county line. Several weapons were found inside the vehicle and Martin said it was unclear if the attacker died of a self-inflicted wound or if he was shot by the resident who confronted him. He said investigators weren't ready to discuss a possible motive. Martin said 23 of the dead were found in the church, two were found outside and one died after being taken to a hospital. The man who confronted Kelley had help from another local resident, Johnnie Langendorff, who told KSAT TV that he was driving past the church as the shooting happened. He didn't identify the armed resident but said the man exchanged gunfire with the gunman, then asked to get in Langendorff's truck and the pair pursued as the gunman drove away. Langendorff says the gunman eventually lost control of his vehicle and crashed. He says the other man walked up to the vehicle with his gun drawn and the suspect did not move. He stayed there for at least five minutes, until police arrived. ""I was strictly just acting on what's the right thing to do,"" Langendorff said. Gov. Greg Abbott called the attack the worst mass shooting in Texas history. ""There are no words to describe the pure evil that we witnessed,"" Abbott said. ""Our hearts are heavy at the anguish in this small town, but in time of tragedy, we see the very best of Texas. May God comfort those who've lost a loved one, and may God heal the hurt in our communities."" Among those killed was the church pastor's 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle Pomeroy. Pastor Frank Pomeroy, and his wife, Sherri, were both out of town when the attack occurred, Sherri Pomeroy wrote in a text message. ""We lost our 14-year-old daughter today and many friends,"" she wrote. ""Neither of us has made it back into town yet to personally see the devastation. I am at the charlotte airport trying to get home as soon as i can."" Federal agents swarmed the small rural community of a few hundred residents, including ATF investigators and the FBI's evidence collection team. Alena Berlanga, a resident of nearby Floresville, known for its annual peanut festival, said everyone knows everyone else in the sparsely populated county. ""Everybody's going to be affected and everybody knows someone who's affected,"" Berlanga said. Church member Nick Uhlig, 34, wasn't at Sunday's service, said his cousin, who was 8 months pregnant, and her in-laws were among those killed. ""We just gathered to bury their grandfather on Thursday,"" he said, shaking his head. President Donald Trump, who was in Japan, called the shooting an ""act of evil"" and said he was monitoring the situation. Later Sunday, two sheriff's vans were parked outside the gate of a cattle fence surrounding the address listed for Kelley on the rural, western outskirts of New Braunfels, north of San Antonio. Ryan Albers, 16, who lives across the road, said he heard intensifying gunfire coming from that direction in recent days. ""It was definitely not just a shotgun or someone hunting,"" Albers said. ""It was someone using automatic weapon fire."" The church has posted videos of its Sunday services on a YouTube channel, raising the possibility that the shooting was captured on video. In a video of its Oct. 8 service, a congregant who spoke and read Scripture pointed to the Oct. 1 Las Vegas shooting a week earlier as evidence of the ""wicked nature"" of man. That shooting left 58 dead and more than 500 injured. Until Sunday, the deadliest mass shooting in Texas had been a 1991 attack in Killeen, when a mentally disturbed man crashed his pickup truck through a restaurant window at lunchtime and started shooting people, killing 23 and injuring more than 20 others. The University of Texas was the site of one of the most infamous mass shootings in modern American history, when U.S. Marine sniper Charles Whitman climbed the Austin campus' clock tower in 1966 and began firing on stunned people below, killing 13 and wounding nearly three dozen others. He had killed his wife and mother before heading to the tower, one victim died a week later and medical examiners eventually attributed a 17th death to Whitman in 2001.

“Sam Hyde,” this phantom is called, described variously on online message boards as a Nazi, a Klansman or a homicidal video gamer – but always as a killer. In Sunday’s version of the rumor, Sam Hyde was said to have killed 26 people inside a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas – just as he had been blamed a month earlier for the mass shooting in Las Vegas, and in San Bernardino, California; Minneapolis; and Kalamazoo, Michigan, before that. No such Sam Hyde exists, but fooling people into blaming him for the latest mass atrocity has become a sort of game in certain corners of the internet. A “meme,” as they say. And yet at 4:13 p.m. Sunday, it was not some obscure tweeter who blamed a phantom for what happened in Sutherland Springs. It was a congressman from Texas, and he named Sam Hyde as the shooter live on CNN. That same evening, as news of the shooting spread across the country, some people got to talking about what exactly happened inside First Baptist Church. Their conversation took a dark turn as they speculated that the massacre was a “false flag” – not the act of a lone gunman, as authorities said, but a conspiracy to manipulate the public toward some nefarious end. This sort of fantasy is also something of a tradition. Conspiratorial threads about false flags have festered on the internet after many recent U.S. massacres. But this particular conversation didn’t take place online. It was overheard outside a hospital in San Antonio, among families of the victims from the church, just yards away from where survivors recovered from their wounds. Sam Hyde and false flags. What we have for years referred to as internet hoaxes – online byproducts of actual atrocities – have manifested in the real world since Sunday’s mass shooting. Fantasies once consigned to the fringes of 4chan, Twitter and Reddit now seem to creep up to within a few miles of the crime scene. “False flag” About an hour’s drive from the carnage in Sutherland Springs, five women gathered after sundown outside an emergency room where victims of the morning shooting were still being brought in. The women knew some of the victims, they said. Several sounded upset because authorities wouldn’t let them see any bodies. One wondered aloud if a victim who had been declared dead by officials that day actually still lived. “We have to get to the bottom of this,” one woman said. “False flag,” said another, and then another, and another. That same night, the term was replicating across 4chan’s /pol/ message board – a sort of online cauldron in which many of the internet’s rumors, memes and hoaxes are formed. The powers that be must have concocted the church shooting to distract from the one in Las Vegas, one writer claimed. Another wrote that the CIA now plans a false flag operation “every first Sunday of the month.” Likewise, some saw a false flag operation after October’s mass shooting in Las Vegas. Before that, a congressman suggested a left-wing plot was behind the violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The women outside University Hospital in San Antonio on Sunday evening didn’t explain who, exactly, they suspected had arranged the massacre of people they knew 40 miles away. They spoke vaguely of some “operation.” When a reporter for The Washington Post approached the women, she was pushed and shoved away. One woman grabbed the reporter’s phone and accused her of recording what they’d said. “She is part of it,” a woman said, before police arrived and evicted the reporter from the hospital. Sam Hyde Unlike the CIA’s monthly “false flag” operation, a man named Sam Hyde really exists. Well, there are many real Sam Hydes, of course. But one in particular can help explain how Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-Texas, ended up erroneously naming Sam Hyde as the perpetrator of the worst mass shooting to befall his state. The real Sam Hyde is man whom Forbes described last year as a “second-rate internet comedian” in a story about why 4chan users and various other internet pranksters kept trying to frame him for atrocities across the United States. “It’s crazy, haha, yeah, crazy, haha!” the real Hyde wrote to the magazine. Forbes noted that his antics – including a fake TEDx talk and a fake pony-dating simulator – had been popular on 4chan message boards before its users reinvented the comedian as an immortal gunman, sometime in 2015. In any event, it became a meme to claim “Sam Hyde is the shooter” after every atrocity. So, of course, the name was resurrected Sunday – not that Gonzalez knew anything about it when news stations invited him to speak about the tragedy in Sutherland Springs. “Congressman Gonzalez does not follow memes, internet sensations, or twitter trends and was unaware that this name is a viral internet hoax that has been connected to mass shootings in the past,” his press secretary, Aryn Fields, wrote in a statement to The Washington Post. The congressman was waiting to be interviewed on an unnamed TV station Sunday afternoon, Fields wrote. “While on hold, a producer informed the congressman that reports indicated that the shooter was a man named Sam Hyde.” This would have been no more than a few hours after the church shooting, before authorities released the real suspect’s name as Devin Patrick Kelley – a 26-year-old man who lived nearby and whose mother-in-law attended the church. After being interviewed on the TV station, Fields wrote, Gonzalez immediately phoned in to CNN. What happened next has since spread across the internet. “Do you know anything about the attacker?” asked the anchor. “It was reported to me he’s actually not from this community,” Gonzalez said. “Apparently his name was released as Sam Hyde. That was the name I was given.” This caused a brief flurry, as it appeared to be the first confirmation of the killer’s name. But among those for whom the Sam Hyde meme had long ago turned stale, the prevailing reaction was disbelief that a congressman had fallen for it. “Given how fast the events transpired Sunday, Congressman Gonzalez took this report as reliable information,” the press secretary wrote Monday. “It is something that he deeply regrets.” Sam Hyde and false flags are hardly the only hoaxes to follow the mass murders in Sutherland Springs, in which more than two dozen very real people, including an 18-month-old child and three generations of a single family, were killed. They are everywhere. Fake images suggesting the shooter was a member of an anti-fascist movement made their way to a news site controlled by the Russian government. On Facebook, a man found the personal page of a woman who was reported to have died at the church and posted to it: “Are you real or a simulation by intelligence agencies?” And so it was with Las Vegas, and so many tragedies before that – delusions and deceptions advance from the edges of the internet into the core of our grief. Whitney Phillips is a researcher at Mercer University who studies online hoaxes, the trolls who invent them, the news outlets that advance them and the people they affect. Watching them take life on Sunday, she wrote to The Post, has nearly brought her to despair. “Every single mass shooting in the 10 years I’ve studied these behaviors, it unfolds in exactly the same way, again and again, like clockwork,” Phillips said. “The Sam Hyde joke worked this time around because reporters reported on it last time around, and the time before that, and the time before that. And even efforts to debunk the hoax keep the game alive, and there is absolutely nothing anyone can do to not benefit these manipulations other than not reporting on what they do.” The Washington Post’s Terri Rupar contributed to this report.

Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said Monday. | Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo By SEUNG MIN KIM and HEATHER CAYGLE 11/06/2017 07:02 PM EST Updated 11/06/2017 10:42 PM EST Momentum for gun control saw a brief sign of life after the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history last month, with Republicans joining Democrats in weighing restrictions to bump stocks. But the GOP-controlled Congress hasn’t pushed forward any bills, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has yet to curb the gun accessory that authorities say was used to kill nearly 60 concertgoers in Las Vegas. And after the latest mass shooting at a rural Texas church on Sunday, proposals to restrict firearms appeared no likelier to advance on Capitol Hill. Senior Republicans said Monday that it wasn’t clear what lawmakers could do in response to the latest tragedy, when more than two dozen people, including several children, were gunned down during a Sunday service in Sutherland Springs, Texas. “Do you pass more laws when the laws that are on the books were likely violated? And would that have made a difference?” Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said Monday. “I think those are all going to be questions we need to ask ourselves, but I think right now, the fog of this event is not yet lifted and we need to know the answers before we know how to act.” Cornyn was among more than a half-dozen Senate Republicans who wrote to ATF last month, asking the agency to review a decision under the Obama administration that allowed bump stocks — which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like fully automatic firearms — to be sold. The Texas senator said Monday that the Republicans had yet to hear back from ATF. But separately, ATF officials privately briefed staff members on the Senate and House judiciary committees and stressed that the bureau doesn’t believe it has the legal authority to regulate bump stocks.

During the Oct. 12 and 13 briefings, bureau officials explained why they lack the powers to regulate the devices. And while the agency did not request legislative action, officials made clear that was the only way bump stocks could be federally controlled or banned, according to several meeting attendees or others briefed on the matter. An ATF spokeswoman declined to comment. In an interview Monday, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said he plans to hold a hearing soon with ATF officials on bump stocks. An aide said preparations for a hearing are underway, but did not offer a date. When “somebody invents something that makes a regular rifle automatic, then, you know, that’s a legitimate question to ask,” Grassley said. He also said the ATF will explain during the hearing why the Obama administration allowed the devices to be sold “when they’re anti-gun to begin with.” But Grassley declined to endorse legislation that would ban bump stocks outright. “I’m going to wait until after the hearing before I answer that,” Grassley said in the interview. The House has also yet to act on bump stocks despite lawmakers introducing several bills after the Las Vegas shooting that would strictly regulate the firearms accessory or ban it outright. Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said last month that regulatory action by ATF was “the smartest, quickest fix.” His office did not return a request for comment Monday asking whether the speaker’s position had changed given ATF’s belief it doesn’t have the authority to regulate bump stocks. The ATF will brief members of the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday on the “technical aspects of the device and its use,” a meeting sources said they expected to be similar to the staff briefing in October. But Democrats on the committee say privately they aren’t hopeful GOP leaders will do much more beyond that, despite sending a letter last week — before the Texas church massacre — to Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) urging him to hold hearings on gun violence. “Although these concerns are broader than the ‘bump stock’ issue that has come to light because of the Las Vegas shooting, clearly these devices pose a danger to our citizens, and our laws regarding these devices must be formally examined,” Judiciary Democrats wrote in the Nov. 1 letter.  By ANDREW RESTUCCIA Goodlatte said Monday that the use of bump stocks in Las Vegas is “extremely concerning” and he was committed to examining regulations over the device “to see if they need improving.” As for the latest mass shooting, top Republicans called for more clarity in how the gunman, Devin Patrick Kelley, obtained the guns he used to kill at least 26 people on Sunday before they’d engage in substantive discussions about any legislation. Kelley, who served in the U.S. Air Force, was denied a license to carry a firearm. But the Air Force said in a statement that it did not submit the criminal background of Kelley, who was court-martialed for assaulting his wife and stepson, to the National Criminal Information Center database. He would have been barred by federal law from owning or buying firearms because of the conviction. The Department of Defense requested on Monday evening that the department's inspector general investigate the handling of Kelley's criminal records. The inspector general will also look at whether Kelley's conviction was properly entered into the national database used for background checks. Law And Order By EVAN HUGHES ""The Senate Armed Services Committee will conduct rigorous oversight of the Department's investigation into the circumstances that led to this failure,"" Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said late Monday night. ""It's critical that each of the military services take the steps necessary to ensure that similar mistakes have not occurred and will not occur in the future."" A spokesman for Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said the senator and his aides are talking with other offices to see if there could be improvements in sharing data under the National Instant Criminal Background Check System after the Texas shooting. But other Republicans held off on similar moves. “You know, it’s hard to envision a foolproof way to prevent individual outrages by evil people,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Monday in Louisville. “I mean, last week in New York, you had a person who figured out he could kill people by driving his automobile up on the sidewalk.

At least 26 people were killed and 20 wounded in Texas after a gunman dressed in tactical gear opened fire at a church outside San Antonio on Sunday, investigators confirmed. Multiple sources speaking to Fox News identified the gunman as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley. The mass shooting unfolded around 11:30 a.m. at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, which is about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio. Investigators said at a news conference Sunday evening that the victims ranged in age from 5 to 72 years old. One official said about 20 people were hospitalized with injuries ranging from minor to ""very severe."" Emergency personnel respond to a fatal shooting at a Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, Sunday, Nov. 5, 2017.
      (KSAT via AP) Sunday's massacre is the deadliest church shooting in modern U.S. history. It is also, according to Gov. Greg Abbott, the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history. A possible motive was unclear. Kelley lived in a suburb of San Antonio and didn't appear to be linked to organized terrorist groups, a U.S. official told The Associated Press. The official said investigators were looking at social media posts Kelley may have made in the days before Sunday's attack, including one that appeared to show a semiautomatic weapon. A spokesperson with the U.S. Air Force confirmed to Fox News that Kelley served in the military branch at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until a bad conduct discharge in 2014. fox He was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and child, and when he was discharged received 12 months of confinement and a reduction in military rank. ""It is horrible,"" Wilson County Commissioner Larry Wiley told Fox News of the massacre. ""It appears someone walked in and started shooting."" Around 11:20 a.m., Kelley arrived at a Valero gas station across from the First Baptist Church dressed in black tactical gear and a ballistic vest. He crossed the street and started firing a Ruger AR rifle at the church, officials said. He entered the building and kept shooting. He was confronted by an armed nearby resident who chased after him. Kelley was later found dead, roughly five miles away in Guadalupe County, according to Wiley. It's unclear whether Kelley was killed by police or the armed resident, or from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. ""We have accepted a multiple number of patients from the shooting,"" Megan Posey, a spokeswoman for Connally Memorial Medical Center in Floresville, 15 miles from the church, told Fox News. Law enforcement officials stand next to a covered body at the scene of a fatal shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on Sunday, Nov. 5, 2017.
      (Nick Wagner/Austin American-Statesman via AP) Some victims were transported to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, KSAT reported. Officials said 23 people were found deceased in First Baptist Church, while two were found dead outside. One person who was transported to a hospital later died. One of those killed was 14-year-old Annabelle Pomeroy, the church pastor's daughter. The FBI is investigating the shooting, in addition to multiple other agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The San Antonio Express-News reported police were checking the gunman's home for explosives following the shooting. The church's layout would've made it difficult for churchgoers to flee a shooter who came through the front door, according to a congregant attending a vigil at the church Sunday night. The church was described as having only small exits on the side and in the back, according to Hunter Green. He said if a gunman came through the front door, people ""wouldn't have had anywhere to go."" Neighbors of Kelley's told The Associated Press they heard gunfire coming from his direction in recent days. ""It's really loud,"" 16-year-old Ryan Albers said. ""It was someone using automatic weapon fire."" Another neighbor, who argued hearing gunfire in the area is not uncommon, said they had heard gunfire coming from across the street, but couldn't be sure if it was from Kelley's property. Attorney General Paxton told Fox News that ""people never think"" a shooting like this can ""happen in their communities."" ""In a small town ... I can imagine that these people are devastated. And everyone in the community is going to ... have some type of close relationship"" to those either killed or injured at the First Baptist Church. He added it's ""hard to justify why anyone would do this."" At least 26 people are dead in the Sutherland Springs, Texas church massacre. Here is a look back at the deadliest church shootings in U.S. history. ""This is horrific for our tiny little tight-knit town,"" Alena Berlanga, who lives 10 minutes outside of Sutherland Springs told The Associated Press. ""Everybody's going to be affected and everybody knows someone who's affected."" President Trump, speaking from Tokyo during his trip to Asia, called the shooting an ""act of evil,"" and added: ""Through the tears and through the sadness, we stand strong."" Earlier, he tweeted: ""May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan."" Gov. Abbott said in a statement that ""While the details of this horrific act are still under investigation, Cecilia and I want to send our sincerest thoughts and prayers to all those who have been affected by this evil act.""

Sutherland Springs has a population of about 400 residents. Sunday's shooting comes just over a month after 58 people were killed and hundreds injured on Oct. 1 after a gunman opened fire on a country music festival in Las Vegas.

http://www.ibtimes.com/watch-democratic-congressman-walks-out-during-moment-silence-texas-church-shooting-2611700,"Congressman Ted Lieu of California walked out in protest during a moment of silence Monday evening for the victims of Sunday’s mass shooting at a church in Texas. The moment of silence was occurring on the House floor when Lieu exited. Lieu streamed himself live on Facebook as he walked out and discussed his reasons for doing so.  “I am heartbroken about the children and adults that were killed in the worst mass shooting in Texas history this Sunday,"" Lieu said. ""My colleagues right now are doing a moment of silence in the House of Representatives chambers. I respect their right to do that, and I myself have participated in many of them, but I can’t do this again. I’ve been to too many moments of silence."" At least 26 people were killed at the church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, Sunday after a gunman opened fire. Lieu said since he has been a congressman, three of the worst mass shootings in United States history have occurred. “I will not be silent,” he said. “What we need, is we need action, we need to pass gun safety legislation now.” Lieu called for universal background checks, a ban on assault rifles and a ban on bump stocks.  Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin called Lieu out for the exit on Twitter, telling him he should ""be ashamed of himself."" ""Feel free to call me names because I'm cool like that,"" Lieu fired back. ""But I will keep fighting for gun safety. Unlike you I don't quit.""  "

As of yesterday, Columbine is no longer one of the 10 worst mass shootings in US history. 3 of the top 5 are all in the last year & a half.

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/486880686/0/usatoday-newstopstories~Trump-aposMental-healthapos-is-the-issue-behind-the-Texas-shooting-not-guns/,"President Trump said Monday that better mental health — not gun control — is the key to the mass shooting that claimed at least 26 lives at a Texas church. ""I think mental health is the problem here,"" Trump said during a news conference in Tokyo, saying the shooter in Texas was a ""deranged"" man who should have received treatment. ""This isn't a guns situation."" Trump, who received heavy political support from the National Rifle Association and other gun owners, has been an opponent of gun control proposals that have arisen after a string of mass shootings in the United States. Trump also noted that a resident with a gun engaged the church assailant. ""Fortunately,"" the president said, ""somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction."" The president spoke at a joint news conference with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, the first stop in an Asia tour devoted to the issues of trade and North Korea's nuclear weapons. Abe seconded Trump's call that nations in the region pressure North Korea into giving up its nuclear weapons, and both leaders denounced Kim Jong Un's government for making nuclear threats toward their countries. ""We will not stand for that,"" Trump said. ""The era of strategic patience is over."" Abe, who announced Japan would soon be putting new economic sanctions on North Korea, said that ""all options are on the table"" regarding Kim's government, presumably including military ones. Noting that North Korea his fired test missiles over Japan, Abe said he is less interested in ""dialogue"" than in applying ""a maximum level of pressure"" on Kim. Trump, who will also travel to South Korea, China, Vietnam, and the Philippines over the next week, again said that other countries have unfair trade practices and closed markets, including Japan. Abe did not seem to agree, but said he would work with Trump on trade disputes. Earlier in the day, at a meeting with American and Japanese business leaders, Trump criticized the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. At one point, Trump said Japan should ""try building your cars in the United States instead of shipping them over;"" the Japanese built nearly 4 million cars on U.S. soil last year. For its part, Japan has criticized Trump for pulling United States out of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, saying the trade deal involving a dozen Pacific Rim nations would have benefited all members. Trump and Abe were more in accord over North Korea. Before the news conference, Trump and Abe met with relatives of Japanese citizens kidnapped by North Korea. ""We will work with Prime Minister Abe in trying to get them back,"" Trump said.  The prime minister stressed a close personal bond with Trump, and played up the ""unshakable"" alliance between Japan and the United States. Trump returned the favor, praising both Abe and Japan but adding that their economy was not as strong as that of the United States. ""You'll be second,"" he told the Japanese leader.  At the start of their news conference, Abe offered condolences to the United States over Sunday's mass shooting at the Texas church, saying he is in ""solidarity"" with the American people.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/gwaNfTepSIc/,"Devin Patrick Kelley, the man officials have identified as the suspect in a mass shooting at a Texas church that left at least 26 people dead on Sunday, used a Ruger AR-556 rifle during his rampage. Freeman Martin, the regional director of Texas Department of Public Safety, said during a news conference that the Kelley arrived at a Valero gas station near the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas, at 11.20 a.m. on Sunday. Kelley, who was wearing tactical gear and a ballistic vest, then got out of his vehicle, crossed the street to the church, and began his assault. As Kelley left the church, a local resident grabbed his own weapon and engaged him. “The suspect dropped his rifle, which was a Ruger AR assault-type rifle, and fled from the church,” Martin said on Sunday. Kelley was later found dead in his vehicle with what may have been a self-inflicted gunshot wound, officials said during a Monday news conference. Here’s more about the gun Devin Kelley is suspected of using in the Texas church shooting. Kelley bought the Ruger AR-556 rifle in April of 2016 from Academy Sports & Outdoors in San Antonio, CNN reports, citing a law enforcement official. The AR-556 is a semi-automatic weapon with a suggested retail price of $799, though it appears to be available at lower prices from several retailers. It’s similar to the AR-15, a weapon based on the military M-16 rifle. It’s known for being highly customizable. Unlike the M-16, the AR-556 does not have burst or automatic fire modes. But modifications like a bump stock can allow AR-15-style rifles to fire at rates closer to those of automatic weapons. (Such modifications were reportedly used by the shooter in Las Vegas in October.) Aside from the AR-556, Kelley had two handguns in his vehicle, according to Fred Milanowski, special agent in charge of the Houston Division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Those guns were a Glock 9mm and Ruger 22. All three firearms were purchased by the suspect, Milanowski said during Monday morning’s news conference. Kelley, a former member of the U.S. Air Force, was court-martialed in 2012 after assaulting his spouse and child, the Los Angeles Times reports. Kelley served a year in confinement, had his rank reduced and received a bad conduct discharge. Members of the military who are dishonorably discharged are legally barred from purchasing a gun. But it isn’t clear if the same restriction applies to those who receive a bad conduct discharge. Milanowski said authorities were still gathering information to determine the exact nature of Kelley’s discharge. Until that task is complete, “we will not have a determination on if this individual was prohibited from possessing or purchasing firearms,” Milanowski said. Contact us at letters@time.com."

http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/texas/article/Central-Texans-gather-via-morning-radio-to-12336619.php,"SUTHERLAND SPRINGS -- The Monday morning radio waves became a community meeting ground of sorts for residents still coming to grips with Texas' deadliest modern mass shooting. San Antonio-based radio station 99.5 KISS Rocks is one of only a few stations that reaches the small town, where 26 people were killed after a gunman entered the First Baptist Church late Sunday morning. The station's headline program, the Billy Madison Show, opened its phone lines to its listeners during its 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. programming and received a flood of calls from people in the Sutherland Springs area. ""The show is known for comedy, it's known for making people laugh, it's known for distraction, but it's also very topical,"" said Keith Hastings, director of branding and programming for KISS. ""It's not unlike late night television and a lot of the talk shows. So, when you have something like this that hits so hard on so many levels and especially with the local community, it's irresponsible to try to go on as if nothing happened or as if a problem didn't exist, and really our job as broadcasters is to allow our listeners a voice."" Multiple callers said they were from the Sutherland Springs area, and, for a radio station that reaches people almost 100 miles in any direction of the San Antonio broadcasting station, Hastings said he couldn't be sure why so many different listeners from the affected area felt comfortable discussing their experiences. ""My best theory would be that we heard from people that are fans of the show and interact with the show on any given day or week or month, and for them to hear that we were doing what we were doing, there was probably a comfort level to that,"" Hastings said. ""I think in this day and age too, as globalized as the world is, I think some people feel like they still don't have a voice, and if we can offer them that opportunity to grieve, to vent, to express themselves, I think people gravitate to that."" The show featured hot takes and speculation surrounding the details of the Sunday shooting.

https://www.ncronline.org/news/people/nations-leaders-urged-engage-real-debate-curbing-gun-violence,"Jump to navigation Free Newsletters Advertisement Advertisement Washington — The nation's leaders ""must engage in a real debate about needed measures to save lives and make our communities safer,"" said the chairman of the U.S. bishops' domestic policy committee. Such debate is essential because ""violence in our society will not be solved by a single piece of legislation, and many factors contribute to what we see going on all around us,"" said Bishop Frank Dewane of Venice, Florida, chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' Committee on Domestic Justice and Human Development. His Nov. 7 statement was issued in response to ""recent and horrific attacks"" in the country, referring to the mass shooting Nov. 5 at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas, that left 26 people dead and 20 others wounded, and the Oct. 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas during an outdoor concert that left 58 people dead and hundreds of others injured. ""For many years, the Catholic bishops of the United States have been urging our leaders to explore and adopt reasonable policies to help curb gun violence,"" Dewane said. The Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs gun massacres ""remind us of how much damage can be caused when weapons — particularly weapons designed to inflict extreme levels of bloodshed — too easily find their way into the hands of those who would wish to use them to harm others,"" he said. Dewane said the USCCB continues to urge a total ban on assault weapons, ""which we supported when the ban passed in 1994 and when Congress failed to renew it in 2004."" Other efforts the bishops support include measures that control the sale and use of firearms, such as universal background checks for all gun purchases; limitations on civilian access to high-capacity weapons and ammunition magazines; and a federal law to criminalize gun trafficking.

https://www.ncronline.org/news/people/churches-look-tighten-security-even-arm-congregants-after-texas-shooting,"Jump to navigation Free Newsletters Advertisement Advertisement In 2007, the unthinkable happened at New Life Church in Colorado Springs. A gunman opened fire outside the church, just as its midday service had dismissed. His bullets hit several members of the same family as they left, wounding David Works and killing his two teenage daughters, Rachel and Stephanie. More than 600 people were on the church campus when Matthew Murray — a 24-year-old man armed with an assault rifle, two pistols and enough ammunition to kill 100 people — made his way inside the building, church pastor Brady Boyd remembered. ""I know there's a great theological debate about what Jesus would do,"" he told RNS. ""I just know firsthand for me, on the day the shooting happened on our campus, we lost two very good, sweet, young teenage girls, and that was awful and horrific, but we could have very well lost 100 people that day."" Boyd believes that didn't happen because Murray ran into Jeanne Assam, a former police officer and member of the church security team who was legally carrying a pistol. Assam returned fire, ending the attack that had started 12 hours earlier, when the gunman had shot and killed several others at a nearby mission center. The memories of that day came flooding back for Boyd when he learned of the mass shooting Sunday (Nov. 5) that left 26 people dead and tens more wounded at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, described as the deadliest attack on a church in modern American history. Boyd said he had just moderated a discussion with Kay Warren of Saddleback Church about mental health during this weekend’s services. He was showing Warren the church’s memorial — a space for healing and reflection that includes a park bench and two spruce trees — when someone approached with the news from Texas. ""We stopped and mourned and were so sad yesterday to hear the news. It was devastating to us. It brings back a lot of painful memories for us,"" he said. Reflecting the attack on his church 10 years ago in a blog post on Monday morning, the pastor wrote, ""The sad reality is that every church should have a strategy to protect its members when they gather."" Across the country, many churches and other places of worship are considering security measures as mass shootings have become a tragically familiar narrative in the United States. In the last five years alone, gunmen have taken lives not only at churches such as New Life, First Baptist and Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., but also a mosque, Jewish center and Sikh temple. On Sunday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton suggested on Fox News that churchgoers carry concealed weapons. He was echoed by Rev. Robert Jeffress of First Baptist Church of Dallas, also on Fox News, who insisted that if a gunman opened fire at his church, “they may get one shot off or two shots off, but that’s it, and that’s the last thing they’ll ever do in this life.” That’s because as many as half his church members carry concealed weapons into church with them on a given Sunday, Jeffress estimated. ""This is the world we’re living in. We need to do everything we can to keep our parishioners safe,"" he said. Also in the Lone Star State, Rev. Jack Graham, pastor of Prestonwood Baptist Church in Plano, Texas, tweeted that his church was planning security training for church leaders. In Texas, a licensed gun owner can take a gun to church unless the church has said otherwise, according to the National Rifle Association’s Institute for Legislative Action. But gun laws vary from state to state, as does guidance on guns in churches from denomination to denomination and church to church. And few Americans were in favor of guns in churches in a 2012 PRRI survey: More than three-quarters of respondents (76 percent) said concealed weapons should not be allowed in houses of worship. The Council on American-Islamic Relations has compiled resources about mosque safety and the Sikh Coalition recently launched a security initiative. In the past few years, the Anti-Defamation League, founded to combat anti-Semitism and other bigotries, has been sharing what it has learned with other religious and community groups, according to Elise Jarvis, the ADL’s associate director, law enforcement outreach and communal security. ""Unfortunately, the reality of the Jewish community is we are targets, "" Jarvis said. ""It’s something we’ve been dealing with for decades."" Jarvis suggested places of worship build relationships with law enforcement so their first call to police isn’t a 911 call, and officers understand the community. She also suggested they pay close attention to who attends their services and other events, something that can be as simple as greeting people at the door, and having plans in place for different emergencies. Advertisement Advertisement Boyd, the pastor at New Life, said he knows not all are comfortable with the idea of guns in church. Most crimes can be deterred by a uniformed police presence — hiring an off-duty police officer or recruiting a volunteer officer who attends the church, he said. Quickly after the shooting on its campus, Boyd said, New Life made the decision to talk openly about what had happened, something he encourages for other churches facing tragedy, like in Sutherland Springs. The church brought in counselors to talk with church members. Even a decade later, he says he talks about it from the pulpit. It's going to take a long time for members of First Baptist Church to feel ""normal"" again, he said. But, he added, ""our faith tells us when the enemy means us harm, our God can turn it for good, and so we've seen that happen at New Life.""

http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/breakingnews/~3/sJzSyEnOucU/ct-met-church-security-concerns-20171106-story.html,"The Rev. Kurt Hartrich doesn’t know what more he can do to keep his parishioners safe. They already must cross two thresholds and pass muster with security guards before they can enter the worship space at St. Peter’s in the Loop Catholic Church to pray. Still, some parishioners frown on the idea of a security guard clearing them for worship, even if it’s for their own protection. “People say ‘You’re a church. Why do you have these security people?’ ” said Hartrich, a Franciscan friar who oversees five Masses every weekday at the downtown church. “We certainly want everybody to feel welcome. … At the same time, if the security guards really feel it’s a possible security risk, they would take care of that.” Alarmed by the mass shooting at a small Southern Baptist church in South Texas, Chicago-area congregations of all sizes are trying to find a balance between acting out their mission of providing an open, welcoming environment to those who visit and keeping both newcomers and regulars safe. The same issue has long dogged synagogues, where threats of violence are not uncommon and membership has been in decline. Some churches have already decided to lock their doors more often to prevent vandalism and burglary, and limit access to the homeless. More recently, mosques have faced increasing security concerns. Some church leaders won’t openly discuss safety precautions, for fear of scaring away potential members or giving away security secrets. Others are training ushers and greeters to look for danger signs as soon as cars pull up and park, in hopes of deterring danger before it enters the building. In just the past year, hundreds of congregations have joined a coalition called Secure Church Chicago, a regional working group of Protestant, Catholic and Jewish clergy and volunteers who want to take a proactive, professional and pastoral approach to church safety. “We don’t ever want to create a sense of fear in our congregations,” said Mark Lundgren of Oak Brook, a former FBI agent and co-founder of the working group. “Our goal is to create worry-free worship, where someone can literally kneel down, bow their heads, close their eyes and not have to worry about looking over their shoulder.” The Rev. Myron McCoy, pastor of First United Methodist Church at Chicago Temple, said that during a regularly scheduled staff meeting on Monday his staff reflected on the Texas shooting in addition to how they handled a troubling visitor to their own congregation the same day. “It is extremely tricky, especially for us being downtown where you can encounter the full range of personalities, including our membership and still wanting to make our members feel safe and take the necessary precautions to make sure they feel safe,” McCoy said. At Rogers Park Presbyterian Church, elders had already installed cameras and stepped up security after a rash of burglaries and purse snatchers. But Sunday’s shooting prompted them to shut three of the four traditional entrances to the church and limit entry to the main doors at the top of a flight of steps. Cameras and ushers will be trained on each person climbing those steps, said Elder Franklin Rhodes. Jay Tcath, senior vice president of public affairs for the Jewish United Fund/Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Chicago, said after renewed threats of anti-Semitism surfaced this past year, 61 Jewish facilities invested about $2.4 million to upgrade security. As threats against mosques, churches and other nonprofits have risen in recent years, the federation has offered plenty of advice. Tcath said there are no shortcuts — houses of worship should consider installing cameras, hiring security and inviting law enforcement to audit their safety measures. But not all congregations and nonprofits are receptive. Some African-American churches and mosques distrust law enforcement, Tcath said. Others simply don’t like the visible reminders that sacred spaces can be targets. “The more they look like an armed fortress, the more off-putting it is to potential visitors, clients and would-be members,” Tcath said. But the truth is, no space is safe anymore, he said. “Whatever taboos may have existed in American society for decades and decades are also being broken down. There’s no universally accepted sacred spaces anymore, including churches,” he said. But Lundgren said that’s the balance the nearly 400 members of Secure Chicago are trying to find. Its tactics combine the best takeaways from military intelligence, counterterrorism and law enforcement with hospitality and compassion. Unlike other public venues such as courthouses, schools and sports stadiums, which have installed metal detectors, implemented bag searches and brought in bomb-tracking dogs and police troops to deter acts of violence, houses of worship have less flexibility when it comes to welcoming and protecting the faithful. A police officer in every pew doesn’t exactly inspire a pure focus on God. “A church almost needs to look like a soft target in order to be what it wants to be,” Lundgren said. If churches don’t adapt to the times, he added, the church’s mission will suffer. “Husbands and wives are going to be sitting across the dinner table on Saturday night asking the question ‘Should we take our kids to church tomorrow?’ ” he said. “That threatens the ministry model of every church in America.” mbrachear@chicagotribune.com @TribSeeker Related CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"

http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/hottopics/~3/xmJOC0-K6Dk/ct-met-schmich-mass-shooting-precautions-20171107-story.html,"I was reading a story Tuesday on how to protect yourself during a mass shooting when I had a vision of the civil defense drills of my childhood. The atomic bomb was the great bogeyman for American schoolchildren of my era, the ones raised during the Cold War of the 1950s and ’60s, and we learned to protect ourselves by training in a tactic called duck and cover. Every now and then, an alarm would sound in the classroom and we kids would scramble under our desks, squeeze into human balls facing the floor, clasp our hands behind our heads and wait for the imaginary A-bomb. We’d stay in this tortured yet somehow thrilling position until we got the all-clear and then scramble back out, laughing. Obviously, the threat wasn’t funny, at least not to adults who believed it to be imminent, but the idea that crouching under a little wooden desk was a survival strategy seemed silly to me at the age of 7. It still does. Now here we are, half a century or so later, with a new collective threat, this one closer to home than that atomic bomb ever proved to be: the gunman who walks into a school, a concert or, as happened Sunday in Texas, a church, and starts firing. And here we are with a new version of the old question: What can we do to protect ourselves? The piece I read Tuesday, which had the urgency of those old duck-and-cover drills, was written for The Washington Post by Ed Hinman, a director at an international security firm. It suggested ways to stay safe during the shooting: “If escaping a building isn’t a viable option during an attack, consider moving into rooms where you’re able to barricade yourself and others from the attacker. If the attacker breaches that room, be ready to use an improvised weapon — fire extinguisher, scissors, pen, etc. — to incapacitate him with speed, surprise and violence of action.” It also proposed ways to be ready for the awful moment: “At theaters and concerts, consider choosing seats on the aisle and close to exits. At restaurants, sit with your back to the wall and face the entrance. Before you relax, identify your escape routes and exit points, including turnstiles, doors, scalable fences and accessible windows.” As I read the piece, I felt conflicted. On the one hand, it never hurts to be prepared for danger. That’s why we eyeball the airplane exits before takeoff and pay vague attention when reminded that our seat cushions can be used as flotation devices. We don’t expect the plane to crash, and aren’t convinced that a seat cushion will save us if it does, but you never know. At the same time, while reading the story I chafed at the idea that we should all approach life as if we were Secret Service agents, constantly on the lookout for impending mayhem. Sit on the aisle? I do that whenever I can because I’m slightly claustrophobic. But there aren’t enough aisle seats to go around. Sit facing the room in a restaurant?

http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-met-schmich-mass-shooting-precautions-20171107-story.html,"I was reading a story Tuesday on how to protect yourself during a mass shooting when I had a vision of the civil defense drills of my childhood. The atomic bomb was the great bogeyman for American schoolchildren of my era, the ones raised during the Cold War of the 1950s and ’60s, and we learned to protect ourselves by training in a tactic called duck and cover. Every now and then, an alarm would sound in the classroom and we kids would scramble under our desks, squeeze into human balls facing the floor, clasp our hands behind our heads and wait for the imaginary A-bomb. We’d stay in this tortured yet somehow thrilling position until we got the all-clear and then scramble back out, laughing. Obviously, the threat wasn’t funny, at least not to adults who believed it to be imminent, but the idea that crouching under a little wooden desk was a survival strategy seemed silly to me at the age of 7. It still does. Now here we are, half a century or so later, with a new collective threat, this one closer to home than that atomic bomb ever proved to be: the gunman who walks into a school, a concert or, as happened Sunday in Texas, a church, and starts firing. And here we are with a new version of the old question: What can we do to protect ourselves? The piece I read Tuesday, which had the urgency of those old duck-and-cover drills, was written for The Washington Post by Ed Hinman, a director at an international security firm. It suggested ways to stay safe during the shooting: “If escaping a building isn’t a viable option during an attack, consider moving into rooms where you’re able to barricade yourself and others from the attacker. If the attacker breaches that room, be ready to use an improvised weapon — fire extinguisher, scissors, pen, etc. — to incapacitate him with speed, surprise and violence of action.” It also proposed ways to be ready for the awful moment: “At theaters and concerts, consider choosing seats on the aisle and close to exits. At restaurants, sit with your back to the wall and face the entrance. Before you relax, identify your escape routes and exit points, including turnstiles, doors, scalable fences and accessible windows.” As I read the piece, I felt conflicted. On the one hand, it never hurts to be prepared for danger. That’s why we eyeball the airplane exits before takeoff and pay vague attention when reminded that our seat cushions can be used as flotation devices. We don’t expect the plane to crash, and aren’t convinced that a seat cushion will save us if it does, but you never know. At the same time, while reading the story I chafed at the idea that we should all approach life as if we were Secret Service agents, constantly on the lookout for impending mayhem. Sit on the aisle? I do that whenever I can because I’m slightly claustrophobic. But there aren’t enough aisle seats to go around. Sit facing the room in a restaurant? I prefer that too because it makes me feel less hemmed in. But somebody has to face the wall, and it doesn’t seem helpful to make those diners feel they’ll be the targets when the shooter comes. Sensible precaution vs. debilitating paranoia. It’s a juggling act.

https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/11/07/florida-school-offers-parents-bulletproof-panels-for-student-backpacks/23270114/," Parents at one Miami-area school are being offered the chance to purchase bulletproof panels for their children's backpacks to guard against a school shooting. Florida Christian School, a K-12 nondenominational private school, distributes an order form for the $120 ballistic panel on its website. The insert, which reportedly weighs less than a book, can be slipped into a backpack as a security tool, the school's head of security told The Miami Herald. ""It's just a tool,"" said George Gulla. ""I'd rather be prepared for the worst than be stuck after saying, 'Wow, I wish we would've done that.'"" Gulla reportedly has employed a number of other security measures at the school, including sound-enabled surveillance cameras and uniformed security guards. He's also held active-shooter drills in which students are told to hold their backpacks close to their chests as a protective layer. The less-than-a-pound soft armor plates can turn backpacks into potentially lifesaving bullet-blockers, but they're not required, Gulla said. The plates are reportedly able to stop bullets from a handgun like a .44 Magnum or a .357 SIG, but not rifle bullets that would require heavier armor. The panels are produced by Applied Fiber Concepts – an area body armor company founded by Alex Cejas, a parent at the school. Last year, Cejas attended one of Gulla's active-shooter drills, which led to his company offering to make custom plates for students. ""While books and stuff in your backpack may stop a bullet, they're not designed to,"" Cejas told the Herald. ""I wouldn't bet my life on it."" An ongoing, nationwide debate on gun control in the U.S. has continually resurfaced over the years in conjunction with mass shootings, some of which have occurred on educational campuses. In 2012, a shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, left 20 children and six staff members dead. Most recently, the public debate on guns has flared in the wake of mass killings at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, last weekend and at a Las Vegas outdoor music festival last month. High-powered weapons were used in each. Such incidents have helped create a market for things like the bulletproof backpack panels and other protective items.

Among those, 12 to 14 were children, and an additional 20 people were hospitalized with injuries. Texas church shooting: What we know now After the shooting, former president Obama responded with condolences for the victims, while endorsing the need to take measures to prevent similar attacks from happening. ""We grieve with all the families in Sutherland Springs harmed by this act of hatred, and we’ll stand with the survivors as they recover,"" said Obama on Twitter. ""May God also grant all of us the wisdom to ask what concrete steps we can take to reduce the violence and weaponry in our midst.""

Track president Eddie Gossage told USA TODAY Sports said the decision was made out of respect for the 26 people killed at a church outside San Antonio. “In light of what happened, it was the respectful thing to do,” Gossage said.

http://www.twincities.com/2017/11/07/texas-massacre-is-seized-on-by-both-sides-in-gun-debate/,"GET BREAKING NEWS IN YOUR BROWSER. CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: Gun-rights supporters have seized on the Texas church massacre as proof of the well-worn saying that the best answer to a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. Gun-control advocates, meanwhile, say the tragedy shows once more that it is too easy to get a weapon in the U.S. To no one’s surprise, many Americans on opposite sides of the gun debate are using the latest mass shooting to reaffirm their opinions about firearms, drawing very different lessons from the rampage. The bloodbath is proving to have elements both sides of the gun debate can use: More than two dozen were killed, from babies to the elderly. The slaughter took place in a house of worship. The killer had a history of domestic violence that legally should have prevented him from buying his guns. And a National Rifle Association member pulled out his own rifle and wounded the killer, helping to end the danger. “Both sides are following the respective scripts that we have seen many times before,” said Robert Spitzer, chairman of political science at the State University of New York at Cortland and an expert on firearms and Second Amendment issues. On Sunday, Devin Patrick Kelley, 26, traveled to a Baptist church in Sutherland Springs and opened fire with a Ruger AR rifle with a 30-round magazine, going from aisle to aisle as he shot parishioners. He killed himself after being shot and chased down by a church neighbor. Authorities said 26 victims died, including the unborn baby of one of the slain women. Kelley was able to buy the rifle and three other weapons even though the former Air Force man was convicted at a court-martial of choking his wife and cracking her son’s skull and was given a bad-conduct discharge in 2014. It turned out the Air Force did not submit his criminal history to the FBI database that is used to conduct background checks for gun shops. President Donald Trump, a longtime supporter of the gun lobby and the first president since Ronald Reagan to address the NRA, said the attack was the work of a mentally ill man. He said that rather than use the shooting as justification to restrict access to firearms, it should be seen as a shining example of the benefits of gun ownership. If the neighbor who confronted the gunman hadn’t had a rifle, Trump said, “instead of having 26 dead, you would have had hundreds more dead.” That thought resonated with gun owners around the country. “There’s an old saying: ‘The best answer for a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,'” said Tiffany Teasdale-Causer, owner of Lynnwood Gun and Ammunition in Lynnwood, Washington. Former Special Forces Col. Jim Patterson in San Antonio said “an armed society is a polite society.” “I get the emotional argument — let’s ban all guns — but you’re imposing a law on people who disobey the law to begin with,” he said. “We are free men and women and we control our destiny. When seconds count, the police are minutes away. What do you do in those minutes? Do you hide under a table or do you retain your right to protect yourself?” But Stephanie Ervin of Civic Ventures, an advocacy group in Seattle, said having more guns in public settings such as stadiums is “a recipe for tragedy” and increases the risk of something bad happening. The problem of mass shootings won’t be solved “by grandmas bringing guns to church in their handbags,” she said. “It will be resolved by introducing and passing more laws that keep people from accessing firearms in a moment of crisis.” Since Trump’s election, gun-rights advocates are feeling emboldened for the first time in nearly a decade, while gun-control activists fear the unraveling of restrictions on firearms. At the top of the gun-rights agenda is winning passage in Congress of “national reciprocity,” which would allow concealed-carry gun permits issued in one state to be valid in all others. The gun lobby also wants an easing of restrictions on silencers. With each mass shooting, gun-control advocates have seized on the events to point to what they see as failings or loopholes in the law. When a gunman in Las Vegas slaughtered 58 people last month in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, there was talk of outlawing “bump stocks,” the device he used to enable his semiautomatic rifles to fire like fully automatic weapons. For Sandy Phillips, each mass shooting brings back memories of when her daughter was killed in the 2012 movie theater attack in Aurora, Colorado, that left 12 people dead. Phillips, a gun owner who lives in Texas, bristles at the good-guy-with-a-gun argument. In the Texas rampage, “they didn’t even succeed in killing him. He killed himself,” Phillips said. “The bottom line is people are killing people with guns and they’re killing them in large numbers because we have easy access to guns.”  Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts As you comment, please be respectful of other commenters and other viewpoints.

RECAP: Harvick takes Texas, advances to championship final four ANALYSIS: After Harvick win, Keselowski eyes last finals slot TMS: Drops pistol celebration after mass shooting at Texas church JOHNSON: Title hopes take huge hit at Texas Truex, the series points leader who finished second, also locked up a slot in the final four after accumulating a huge points lead throughout the playoffs. Kyle Busch, who won last weekend in Martinsville, will join them. That leaves one slot open come next weekend’s race in Phoenix. That victory at Texas certainly bodes well for Harvick to claim his second career Cup title at Homestead, a track — while different from Texas in many respects — that is also 1½ miles. Harvick won at Homestead in 2014, the same year he won his title. PHOTOS: KEVIN HARVICK THROUGH THE YEARS “For us, Homestead has been great,” Harvick said. “We've won some races there.  We've been ultra-competitive there. It's a very unique racetrack that is nothing like this one, that is nothing like any racetrack we go to, with the shape of the corners, the multiple variable banking. The two ends of the racetrack are very different.” Harvick started the race third on the grid, won the first stage and finished second to Truex in the second, an indicator that his Stewart-Haas Racing Ford was more than capable on a day where temperatures were around 90 degrees. Harvick worked past Truex in the closing laps as his Toyota got loose exiting the corner and held on to win by 1.58 seconds. “Once he got in front of us, he was just gone,” Truex said. “Nothing I could do. Just one of those deals where he was quicker. Got me in a bad spot, took advantage, and he was gone.” "

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mental-illness-stigma-remarks_us_5a007397e4b04cdbeb34e778?utm_hp_ref=emotional-intelligence,"Senior Wellness Editor, HuffPost Research shows that people living with mental health issues are more likely to be victims of a violent crime as opposed to the ones committing them. Yet a formulaic response tends to follow tragedies like mass shootings: Mental illness is bad and it’s what caused this to happen. But experts say a blanket statements about mental health in these cases does a disservice. Drawing a simplistic connection between mental illness and violence sends the wrong message about psychological disorders and stigmatizes millions of people who live with mental health conditions. “It’s important not to link these kinds of heinous crimes with mental illness unless one knows for sure what was a cause and effect,” Michelle Riba, the associate director at the University of Michigan’s Comprehensive Depression Center, told HuffPost. “Most people with mental illness are wonderful citizens and have an illness that’s treatable.” A 2016 Johns Hopkins University study found that more than a third of all news stories about mental health conditions were linked with violence toward other people. This figure doesn’t accurately reflect the actual rates of violence where mental illness is involved. Assigning blanketed blame to mental illness can have long-term consequences, Riba said. It further alienates people with mental health issues and makes them feel like their experience isn’t understood. That could ultimately lead them to not reach out for help: Research shows negative attitudes surrounding mental illness often prevent people from seeking treatment. Regardless of whether mental health issues are at play during tragedies, the way they are discussed publicly is a huge problem ― especially for those who live with these disorders. We chatted with Riba and gathered other advice on what to do to help mitigate the effects of mental health stigma. If you’re living with a mental health issue, here’s how to take care of yourself today (and moving forward): This could be a family member, friend or significant other. Leaning on people who love and support you is vital during times of distress, Riba said. “Ask people to have a conversation about how you’re feeling,” she said. “Getting some input from people you trust and value is helpful.” Riba said that staying informed and plugging into uplifting resources can be critical when you’re feeling alienated. However, it’s also important to take breaks. Research shows negative news can have a damaging effect on mental health. It’s OK to unplug from the noise for a little while. Working out ― even if it’s just going for a long walk ― can do wonders for your mental well-being. Research shows physical activity can boost your mood, and taking a stroll in nature has been shown to reduce symptoms of depression. Not in the mood to exercise? Try one of these other expert-backed self-care activities. If you’re already in therapy, Riba recommends reaching out to your therapist if the rhetoric is starting to bother you. If you’re not currently seeking treatment, consider contacting a professional if your well-being is at stake. “Make an appointment to talk about this,” Riba said. “It’s important to straighten out these kinds of feelings and issues with a clinician.” Mental health is just as important as physical health. Take a moment to remind yourself that having a mental illness doesn’t make you a bad person, nor does it define you, Riba said. “Mental illness is like any other health condition,” she stressed. “It’s treatable and people with the conditions have quality lives.” This piece has been updated.

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mass-shootings-deadliest_us_5a001e6ce4b04cdbeb34608f?utm_hp_ref=emotional-intelligence,"Senior Editor, HuffPost Orlando, Las Vegas, Sutherland Springs: three of the worst mass shootings in modern U.S. history all happened in the past 17 months. As Denver journalist Kyle Clark grimly observed on Monday, the 1999 Columbine High School massacre that once shocked the world when two gunmen killed 12 students and 1 teacher, has been pushed off the list of the top 10 deadliest mass shootings in recent U.S. history. The Columbine school shooting shocked America. As of today, it is no longer one of the 10 deadliest shootings in modern US history. Now, three shootings in the past 17 months are on the list, and, as CNN pointed out, two of the five deadliest mass shootings in modern U.S. history occurred in the last 35 days. In June 2016, 29-year-old Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded 58 when he opened fire in Orlando’s Pulse Nightclub during Pride month. At the time, the attack was considered the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. One year and four months later, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock opened fire on 22,000 people at a country music festival in Las Vegas, killing 58 and injuring hundreds more. The massacre remains as the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Following the Las Vegas shooting, the New York Times published an interactive feature showing that in the 477 days that had passed since the Pulse nightclub shooting, there had been 521 mass shootings, and no action from Congress on tougher gun laws. On Sunday, just one month later, a lone gunman killed at least 26 churchgoers and injured 20 others at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. It was the deadliest mass shooting in the state’s history. The victims range in age from 5 to 72. According to Mass Shooting Tracker, there have been 377 mass shootings in 2017.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/11/06/texas-shooting-death-sweeps-across-3-generations-of-a-single-family-gathered-at-church/,"This article is more than 1 year old Houses of worship are among the few regular gathering places left for families, sometimes extended ones and sometimes across many generations. The First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., is no different. And within those walls on Sunday morning, together as always, were three generations of the Holcombe family. Bryan Holcombe was walking up to the pulpit, preparing to lead the congregation in worship, when a gunman identified by officials as Devin Kelley began to spray bullets at the worshipers. Holcombe, an associate pastor for the church, was killed in the gunfire, his parents, Joe and Claryce Holcombe, said in an interview with The Washington Post. Karla Holcombe, Bryan Holcombe’s wife of about four decades, was killed, too, Joe Holcombe said. Bryan and Karla Holcombe’s son Marc Daniel Holcombe, 36, also was killed, Joe Holcombe said. Marc Daniel had an infant daughter, Noah Holcombe, who, was a year old, Joe Holcombe said. She is dead, too. Another son of Bryan and Karla, John Holcombe, survived, but his wife, Crystal Holcombe, who was pregnant, did not. Crystal had five children. Three of them, Emily, Megan and Greg, died. The two others survived. That’s eight members of the extended Holcombe family dead, in addition to the unborn baby. All at once, Joe and Claryce Holcombe lost children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and a future great-grandchild. The act of violence that claimed lives from generations of their loved ones took place in the space that mattered to them most: their church. The Holcombes were among the 26 people authorities say were killed in Sunday’s mass shooting, described by Gov. Greg Abbott (R) as the worst in Texas history. As the morning stretched to afternoon and evening, friends and family members in South Texas posted on Facebook, asking whether anyone had heard from their loved ones. Joe and Claryce Holcombe first heard about the shooting an hour after it happened, from a phone call from a member of the church they attend, a different Baptist church in nearby Floresville, Tex. “He said there was a big shooting and he didn’t say much more than that,” said Joe Holcombe, 86. Then in a conversation with the church’s head pastor, they started to hear the wrenching news. “Bryan and Karla?” Joe Holcombe asked. “They’re both in heaven,” the pastor responded. As the day went on, they would learn of the others. John Holcombe, who teaches Sunday school and runs the audio for Sunday services at First Baptist Church, was struck by shrapnel in his leg, he told his parents by phone later that day. His daughter remained hospitalized Sunday night, mostly for observation, Joe Holcombe said. She was injured when someone fell on her, Claryce Holcombe said. Their grandparents described the couple as “fantastic” parents, and a “happy family.” Crystal Holcombe home-schooled her five children and was heavily involved in the church, like the rest of the family. On Facebook, she reported proudly of the children’s successes in competitions for their local 4-H club, and wrote about a recent bake sale in which the girls participated, benefiting families affected by Hurricane Harvey. Rojean Staggs, 66, of Floresville, said she had rented an apartment to Crystal and described her as a sweet and natural mother to a large brood. “Crystal was a breath of fresh air. She loved children,” Staggs said. “She had a full house and just seemed to take to it beautifully.” Staggs said Crystal had lost her first husband to cancer and been married to her second husband, John, for just a few years. John Holcombe posts frequently about his lesson plans for Sunday school. For this week, he planned to focus on Exodus 16, he wrote in a Facebook post. It describes how God provided the Israelites with bread from heaven as they traveled for 40 years in the desert. Bryan Holcombe was filling in Sunday for the church’s lead pastor, who was out of town. And according to his parents, the associate pastor has been involved in church work since he was young. “We knew when he was born that he was going to be a preacher,” Joe Holcombe told The Post. “His first word was ‘God.’ ” His first sentence? “See the light.” On his Facebook page, Bryan Holcombe is shown hoisting his grandchildren on his shoulders, dressing up in costumes for church events and playing his ukulele. He would often play the instrument and sing for prison inmates, a relative told the Associated Press. “Grandkids, it doesn’t get any better!” Bryan Holcombe wrote on Facebook on one photo of his many grandchildren. “I’ll wake up at night and, in prayer, thank God for each of them . . . it takes a while:-).” He and Karla lived near his parents, between Floresville and Sutherland Springs. He ran a business on his parents’ farm, making tarps for cattle trailers, Joe Holcombe said. Bryan and Karla Holcombe were high school sweethearts. One day, their high school was selling roses, offering to deliver them to the classrooms. So Bryan Holcombe delivered a rose to each of Karla’s classes that day. “He thought she was cute, and she was,” Joe Holcombe said. Karla Holcombe had the “gift of hospitality,” her mother-in-law said. She had planned to host the family’s Thanksgiving gathering. Joe and Claryce Holcombe, who are retired teachers, hosted a group of nearby pastors and churchgoers at their home on Sunday as they waited for details about the deceased. They prayed together. “It’s of course going to be difficult,” Joe Holcombe said. But, he said, “we are Christians; we have read the book. We know the ending, and it’s good.” “They’re in heaven,” he added. “And they’re a lot better off than we are.” The shooting at First Baptist Church shattered scores of other families in this rural, tight-knit community. Frank Pomeroy, the pastor of First Baptist Church, told ABC News that he did not attend the church service but that his teenage daughter, Annabelle Pomeroy, 14, was killed. “She was very quiet, shy, always smiling, and helpful to all,” Cynthia Rangel, 50, a resident of Stockdale, Tex., said of Annabelle Pomeroy. Rangel, a local emergency medical technician, said she knew three people who were hospitalized after the shooting and were undergoing surgery. “This just all seems like it’s not real.” As Michael Ward pulled wounded congregants out of the church, he searched for his sister-in-law, three nieces and a nephew, the San Antonio Express-News reported. “My nephew was outside with four bullets in him,” he said of Ryland Ward, 5. “And Rhianna, the bullet broke her glasses, and broke ’em off, and she said she hid underneath the pew and didn’t get hit,” he said of his 9-year-old niece. Sandy Ward told MSNBC that her 5-year-old grandson was in surgery and that her 7-year-old granddaughter was killed. She waited at the hospital Sunday with her son. “He’s a wreck, of course, as you can imagine,” Ward told MSNBC. “I’m just in shock.” “I’m numb,” she added. “My whole body’s just numb.” Joe and Claryce Holcombe said they’re still coming to terms with what happened. The shooter, Joe Holcombe said, is “being rewarded right now for what he did, and for all of eternity.” But, Claryce added, “we need to pray for his family, because they’re going through a terrible time, too.” “God will see us through,” Joe Holcombe said. “We’ll all be together soon.” Eva Ruth Moravec in Sutherland Springs, Tex., contributed to this report.

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-church-shooting-domestic-violence_us_5a0095f7e4b04cdbeb351cd0?section=us_us-news,"Senior Reporter, HuffPost The gunman accused of committing the deadliest mass shooting in modern Texas history sent threatening texts to his mother-in-law before targeting the church where she sometimes worshiped, authorities said on Monday. Devin Kelley, 26, opened fire on the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs on Sunday, killing 26 people and wounded 20 others. His wife’s grandmother was among the victims. He was later found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. “It’s a senseless crime, but we can tell you that there was a domestic situation going on within this family,” said Freeman Martin, the regional director of the Texas Department of Public Safety. “He had expressed anger toward his mother-in-law.” As information has emerged about Kelley’s background, he appears to share a common trait with many American mass shooters: a history of domestic violence. In 2012, Kelley, who served at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, was court-martialed for assault on his spouse and assault on a child. “He assaulted his stepson severely enough that he fractured his skull, and he also assaulted his wife,” Don Christensen, a former chief prosecutor for the Air Force, told the New York Times. “He pled to intentionally doing it.” That year, his then-wife filed for divorce, according to court records. He was sentenced to 12 months behind bars, and received a bad conduct discharge. In 2014 he was remarried, according to the Times. His conviction should have barred him from legally purchasing firearms, according to military law experts who spoke with HuffPost. Under the Lautenberg amendment, individuals who are convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor are prohibited from owning or buying guns. It is unclear how Kelley was able to legally buy a firearm given his domestic violence record. While the military’s penal system doesn’t use the term “misdemeanor” or “felony,” convictions involving domestic violence typically trigger the gun ban, explained Rachel VanLandingham, a professor at Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles. “This case is tragic because it sure seems like this is the poster child for whom the Lautenberg amendment was supposed to be written,” she said. Academy Sports + Outdoors, a sporting and hunting goods store in Texas, confirmed to HuffPost that Kelley purchased two firearms from them ― one in 2016 and one in 2017. Both sales were approved by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which raises questions about why his domestic violence conviction did not trigger a gun prohibition. The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the U.S., most mass shootings involve domestic violence, according to research from Everytown for Gun Safety, which defines a mass shooting as a single incident in which four or more people are fatally shot, not including the perpetrator. Between 2009 and 2016, in 54 percent of mass shootings the perpetrator shot a current or former intimate partner or family member. Everytown also found that in nearly half of these cases, the perpetrator exhibited warning signs before the killing, such as recent acts of violence, threats or violation of a protective order. This story has been updated to include information about Kelly’s gun purchase and comments from a former Air Force prosecutor.

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ken-paxton-texas-guns-church_us_5a002bc3e4b0baea2632f48a?section=us_us-news,"Reporter, HuffPost Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) views the deadliest mass shooting in his state’s history as evidence that more church parishioners should carry guns for self-protection. “This is going to happen again,” Paxton told Fox News on Sunday, since “you can’t necessarily keep guns out of the hands of people who are going to violate the law.” Devin Patrick Kelley allegedly opened fire during a church service in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on Sunday morning, killing at least 26 people and wounding 20 others. He fled the scene and was found dead from a gunshot wound in neighboring Guadalupe County, Wilson County authorities said. To support his argument, Paxton pulled out the National Rifle Association’s favorite talking point: “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.” “All I can say is in Texas, at least we have the opportunity to have conceal carry,” Paxton said. “There’s always the opportunity that the gunman will be taken out before he has the opportunity to kill very many people.” Fox News anchor Eric Shawn pushed back, arguing that a firearm and the church are “two potentially diametrically opposed concepts.” Paxton disagreed and called for more armed security guards in church or “at least arming some of the parishioners so they can respond to something like this.” A new law that went into effect in September allows Texas churches to arm members of its congregations by hiring security companies or off-duty police officers.

Of the 26 people who lost their lives at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, 12 to 14 of them were children, Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said Monday morning. The tragedy in the small community near San Antonio marks the worst mass shooting in the history of Texas, with deceased victims as young as 18 months and as old as 77 years. At least 26 people ― around half the church’s membership, according to one estimate ― were killed when a lone gunman opened fire on worshippers a little before noon on Sunday, officials said. Several families are grappling with multiple deaths and injuries ― the Holcombe family, for instance, lost eight people from three generations. The Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio received eight patients. The Connally Memorial Medical Center in Floresville, Texas, said it admitted eight patients with gunshot wounds on Sunday, but four of them had to be transferred to University Hospital in San Antonio for a higher level of care. In total, University Hospital received nine patients: four children, one of whom died, and five adults, two of whom have also since died, surgeon Brian Eastridge said on Monday afternoon. The deceased child was 8 years old and suffered multiple gunshot wounds. The remaining patients are in serious to critical condition. Here’s what we know so far about those killed: Richard Rodriguez and his wife, Therese, were killed, their daughter Regina Rodriguez told ABC News.

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-shooting-once-again-proves-trumps-double-standard-on-mass-shootings_us_5a007dbbe4b04cdbeb34f9aa?section=us_religion,"Religion Reporter, HuffPost The massacre that took place at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs on Sunday was the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history. The suspect, 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley, reportedly used a military-style assault rifle during the attack, killing at least 26 people and injuring at least 20 others. Despite the violent nature of the crime, and Kelley’s background with domestic abuse, there were no immediate calls from President Donald Trump to create a national “extreme vetting program” that would force Americans convicted of domestic violence to relinquish their guns. Instead, Trump responded to the shooting by claiming that, “This isn’t a guns situation. This is a mental health problem at the highest level.” The president’s response illustrates a stark double standard that emerges over and over and over again after violent attacks on American soil: When violence is propagated by white men with guns, the attackers are called “lone wolves” and critics are warned not to “politicize” the attack by making claims about the need for better gun control laws. Research has shown that men who commit acts of mass violence often have a history of violence towards women, including those in their own families. Across the United States, women are killed by their intimate partners every day. Law enforcement officials in Texas said that the Sutherland Springs shooting may have been motivated by a “domestic situation” in Kelley’s family. Nevertheless, domestic abusers don’t have to worry about being banned en masse from the U.S., or having their faith communities targeted. And no one is asking pastors of churches Kelley has attended in the past what went wrong, or demanding that national Christian ― or atheist ― organizations condemn the violence. But when the attacker has some sort of connection to Islam, even if their actions directly contradict the faith’s tenets, the president is quick to look for ways to make the issue about all Muslims. Commenters on social media were quick to spot the disparity. Don't worry everybody. It was a white man who slaughtered half of the church in Texas. That means everything is just fine.No terrorism One shoe bomber tried to blow up a plane and now we take off our shoes.1520 mass shootings since Sandy Hook and Congress has done NOTHING. •307 mass shootings in 2017 is a mental health problem •1 truck attack & let’s blame 1.6B Muslims & Islam & ban all immigrants https://t.co/3A65DCF0ly Heinous attacks carried out in the name of Islam are patently unjustifiable. But it is also problematic when these acts of violence result in unjust policies and practices that unfairly target American Muslims as a whole. The effects of these discriminatory attitudes towards Muslims are significant ― hate crimes against American Muslims have risen dramatically in recent years, and communities have protested against unwarranted targeted surveillance by police. Studies have shown that white American men are a bigger threat to the country’s safety than immigrants to the U.S. According to The Nation Institute, between 2008 and 2016 there were almost twice as many plots and attacks by far-right extremists (many of whom are white men) than by people who claimed “Islamist” ideologies. And since 1975, there have been no fatal terror attacks carried out on American soil by people born in the Muslim-majority countries the president has targeted in his executive order on immigration. Hind Makki, an interfaith educator and Muslim activist, told HuffPost that this double standard means that an act of violence committed by someone claiming to be Muslim is automatically viewed as a systemic problem that needs to be addressed by sweeping changes in policy ― but crimes committed by non-Muslims are viewed as isolated incidents.“Nobody in our community can have mental health issues, or be a criminal without having a political or religious ideology connected to it. Nobody in our community can be blackmailed into doing anything so long as the person is Muslim or tangentially related to Islam,” she said. “Whatever crime was committed was committed in the name of Islam. It’s always seen as politically or ideologically motivated and therefore is terrorism.” Meanwhile, the list of churches and other worship spaces that have been the site of mass shootings is growing. And beyond these mass attacks, gun violence is still a significant cause of death in the U.S. America far outpaces other countries with comparable socioeconomic success in terms of the number of people who lose their lives to guns. Refusing to see gun violence as a systemic problem is dangerous ― especially when there is much that could be done. Religion Reporter, HuffPost"

          / CBS/AP The suspect who opened fire inside a South Texas church has been identified as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley, officials say. On Sunday, authorities initially identified the suspect as a young white male. They said he was dressed in all black and tactical gear when he opened fire with an assault rifle at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, about 35 miles southeast of San Antonio. The shooting left at least 26 people dead and 20 others injured in what Texas Gov. Greg Abbott described as the worst mass shooting in his state's history. As the gunman left the church, an unidentified area resident confronted him with his own rifle and shot the suspect, officials said. Kelley fled in his vehicle, and the resident flagged down a driver and they pursued him. The driver described chasing down the suspect until he crashed his car. When police arrived, the shooter was found dead, apparently from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt told CBS News correspondent Jeff Glor in an interview Monday morning. Officials said Monday Kelley called his father before killing himself and told him he had been shot and didn't think he was going to make it. Officials Monday wouldn't describe a motive but said there had been a ""domestic situation"" between the shooter and his mother-in-law before the massacre in which the suspect had sent the woman threatening texts. ""We know that he expressed anger towards his mother-in-law who was in this church,"" Texas Department of Public Safety regional director Freeman Martin said. Martin wouldn't detail the texts but said the shooting wasn't related to race or religion. Officials have previously said Kelley had no apparent links to terrorist groups. Kelley has a residence in New Braunfels, Texas, which is about a 35-mile drive from where the attack took place in Sutherland Springs. CBS affiliate KENS-TV reports he graduated in 2009 from New Braunfels High School. Public records cited by the San Antonio Express-News show Kelley, then 20, married in 2011 and was divorced the next year. In 2014, Kelley, then 23, married again, the paper reports. The sheriff confirmed that Kelley's former in-laws and ex-wife attended the First Baptist Church from time to time, although they were not present during the attack. A law enforcement source told CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton that Kelley did some work as a bible teacher, but it's not known what church he worked at or whether he worked at the Sutherland Springs church. Investigators will look at his social media posts made in the days prior to Sunday's attack -- including one that appeared to display an AR-15 semiautomatic weapon. Officials say Kelley did not have a license to carry firearms. He purchased four weapons in total, in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 --two were bought in Colorado, and two in Texas, ATF officials said. Three weapons were recovered  at the scene -- a Ruger AR-556 rifle found at the church, and two handguns, a Glock 9mm and a Ruger 22, found in his car, according to Fred Milanowski, special agent in charge of the ATF Houston. A law enforcement source tells CBS News Justice and Homeland Security correspondent Jeff Pegues that Kelley purchased the Ruger AR-556 from an Academy Sports and Outdoors location in San Antonio in April 2016, and one of the handguns, the Glock 9mm, at Specialty Sports in Colorado Springs in December 2014. Academy Sports confirmed in a statement to CBS News that Kelley also purchased another firearm from the store in 2017. ""We also confirmed that both sales were approved by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). We are cooperating with law enforcement as they investigate further,"" the store said. CBS News' David Martin confirms that the U.S. Air Force failed to submit the shooter's criminal history to FBI, as required by Pentagon rules. That history should have barred him from purchasing guns. The Air Force said it has launched a review of how the service handled Kelley's criminal records. Martin said Kelley was seen before the shooting at a Valero gas station across the street from the church, and was ""obviously suspicious to others"" because he was wearing a black mask with a skull on it.  He was wearing all black and a ballistic vest with a plate on the front, Martin said. Kelley is a former U.S. Air Force member who served from 2010 to 2014. Records confirm Kelley previously served in logistics readiness at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico until his discharge in 2014, Air Force spokesperson Ann Stefanek said in a statement. Kelley, who received several service awards during his time with the Air Force, was responsible for moving passengers, cargo and personal property in military transportation. Kelley was court-martialed in 2012 for two counts of assault on his then-wife and assault on her child, Stefanek said. Col. Don Christensen, a retired Air Force chief prosecutor who office prosecuted Kelley, told CBS News there were multiple instances in 2011 and 2012 in which Kelley assaulted his then-wife and her son, who was his stepson. Kelley physically assaulted the boy, pushed him down, shook him and fractured his skull, causing a severe hematoma, Christensen said. Kelley pleaded guilty to ""diverse occasions"" of assaulting son and wife, Christensen said.  He received a bad conduct discharge, and reduction in rank and confinement for 12 months. His wife, Tessa Kelley, filed for divorce the same year as the court-martial. In paperwork associated with the divorce, Tessa Kelley said she was working at Taco Bell for $7.50 an hour while Devin Kelley was in detention. The divorce was finalized in October 2012. The Air Force tells CBS News Kelley's case was a general court martial, the most serious level of military trial proceedings. It is reserved for more serious criminal allegations, those substantially similar to felonies in civilian jurisdictions. While personnel tried under general court martial can be subject to dishonorable discharge, Kelley received the less severe bad conduct discharge. Federal law prohibits those who have been dishonorably discharged from buying a firearm, but the law does not include a blanket prohibition on those who have received a bad conduct discharge. However, certain types of bad conduct discharges can stem from cases that would bar defendants from purchasing firearms. Texas and federal laws prohibit those with domestic violence convictions from owning firearm. The military is supposed to report to the FBI, for the purposes of prohibiting firearm purchases, convictions on domestic violence charges, as well as convictions that carry maximum potential sentences of more than a year in confinement. It is unclear if the FBI was notified about Kelley's case, which fit both conditions. The San Antonio Express-News reports Kelley had previously worked as a security guard at Schlitterbahn, a New Braunfels water park and resort, a job that required him to pass a criminal background check. A spokeswoman for the park told the paper Kelley spent five and a half weeks working as a nighttime security guard there beginning in June. He was reportedly terminated from his position. The spokeswoman, Winter Prosapio, said Kelley was unarmed during his brief employment and his duties included checking gate locks at night. Prosapio did not say why he was terminated. Kelley had a security guard license issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety, reports the Express-News. Martin confirmed Kelley had a ""non-commissioned, unarmed, private security license similar to a security guard at a concert type situation."" Martin said Kelley had ""no disqualifiers"" to enter into the National Crime Information Center Database that would preclude him from receiving a private security license.  He said private security background checks include fingerprints and criminal history checks with Texas Crime Info Center and national databases, and Kelley was cleared. Kelley later worked at Summit Vacation and RV Resort in New Braunfels. Manager Claudia Varjabedian told CBS News national correspondent Omar Villafranca that Kelley showed up for work as an overnight security guard Saturday, but left early, leaving behind a note that said he wasn't feeling well and had a headache. Varjabedian said Kelley did not show up for work on Sunday. She said she intended to fire him. She said she didn't get to know Kelley well, but said she never received any complaints about him. ""No signs of anything, quite polite young man, and that was about it,"" Varjabedian told Villafranca. Law enforcement went to Kelley's New Bruanfels home three years ago to investigate a domestic violence complaint involving him and his then-girlfriend. Paul Anthony, a spokesman for the Comal County district attorney's office, told The Associated Press that sheriff's deputies were called just after 10 p.m. on Feb. 1, 2014. Citing a sheriff's office report, Anthony says a friend of Kelley's girlfriend told authorities she received a text message from the girlfriend that indicated ""her boyfriend was abusing her."" When sheriff's deputies arrived at the home, they were told by people in the house that there was no problem. No arrests were made. Kelley married the girlfriend, Danielle Shields, two months later. Kelley moved to Colorado later in 2014, registering to vote with an address traced to the Colorado Springs area, home to the U.S. Air Force Academy and other Air Force installations Court records in El Paso County indicate Kelley was cited on Aug. 1, 2014 at the mobile home where he lived. The Denver Post reports the citation was for misdemeanor animal cruelty. An El Paso County deputy report obtained by the paper says a woman saw Kelley punch a dog four to five times near its head and neck, and then grab the dog by the neck and drag it away. Another witness said he saw Kelley pick the dog up into the air and throw it to the ground. A sheriff's sergeant who responded to Kelley's mobile home said he found the dog undernourished. Authorities reportedly took the animal to the veterinary specialty center. Kelley reportedly said he jumped on the dog to keep it from acting aggressively toward another animal but denied hitting the dog, throwing it to the ground or carrying it by its neck. He was given a deferred probationary sentence and was ordered to pay $368 in restitution. The cruelty to animals charge was dismissed in March 2016 after Kelley completed his sentence. The Denver Post reports court records indicate someone was granted a protection order against Kelley on Jan. 15, 2015, also in El Paso County. Former classmates at New Bruanfels High School described Kelley to KENS-TV as disturbed, judgmental, unfriendly, and unstable. They said his most recent social media posts were dark and indicated he was going through relationship problems and possibly a break-up. At the address listed for Kelley in New Braunfels on Sunday, two sheriff's vans were parked outside and police officers stood at the gate of a cattle fence surrounding the property. Law enforcement officials gathered at the property declined to comment on why they were there. Several messages left for his relatives went unreturned. Neighbors said that they heard intense gunfire coming from the direction of the address listed for Kelley in recent days. ""It's really loud. At first I thought someone was blasting,"" said Ryan Albers, 16, who lives across the road. ""It had to be coming from somewhere pretty close. It was definitely not just a shotgun or someone hunting. It was someone using automatic weapon fire."" Kelley also ran a billing software company called Dilloware Inc. at his Comal County residence, according to the San Antonio Express-News.  Local records show Kelley was ticketed in August in New Braunfels for an expired registration and not having auto insurance.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/newsy-allvideos/~3/61jAU8Nclm4/,"Hours after a mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, some criticized President Donald Trump for what they saw as inconsistent responses to acts of violence. While Trump's tweet Sunday focused on the people of Sutherland Springs, his social media response to the recent terror attack in New York City took a hard line against the suspect, calling him ""deranged."" Twitter / @realDonaldTrump The tone of his tweets may vary, but Trump calling the NYC suspect ""sick and deranged"" falls in line with an argument he's been making for years. He has regularly argued attackers act violently because of mental health issues. Trump added to his Sutherland Springs response on Monday, saying: ""I think that mental health is your problem here. This was a very, based on preliminary reports, very deranged individual."" Related StoryShould Mental Health Be The Focus After Mass Shootings? That echoes his response to the Las Vegas shooting last month — the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history — where he described the gunman as ""a sick, demented man."" Trump has been pointing to mental health after mass shootings since at least 2015, when he was a presidential candidate. In response to the Umpqua Community College shooting in Oregon two years ago, Trump said: ""This isn't guns. This is about, really, mental illness. And I feel very strongly about it.""

http://www.ibtimes.com/piers-morgan-slams-texas-attorney-general-brainless-moron-after-church-shooting-2611018,"Television host Piers Morgan slammed both President Donald Trump and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton after their comments following Sunday's mass shooting. Morgan called  Paxton a ""brainless moron"" on ""Good Morning Britain"" Monday morning in response to the attorney general's appearance on Fox News. ""This is going to happen again,"" Paxton said on Fox News Sunday. ""You can’t necessarily keep guns out of the hands of people who are going to violate the law."" Paxton later called for more security at churches or for congregations to start carrying weapons as a result of the massacre. Morgan, who is pro-gun control, mocked the attorney general's ""solution"" and further advocated for tighter gun control laws in the United States. ""That's so obviously the answer, isn't it? You brainless morons,"" Morgan said Monday in response to Paxton's comments. ""Sorry, but that's what you are Texas Attorney General: a brainless moron."" Trump was also criticized by Morgan after regarding the Texas massacre as a ""mental health problem."" ""This isn't a guns situation,"" Trump said Monday. ""This is a mental health problem at the highest level."" ""How can it not be a gun situation Mr. Trump?"" Morgan said. ""If he doesn't have a gun he can't kill people with a gun. This is not rocket science."" Morgan is also a columnist for the Daily Mail and posted a message Monday for Americans to ""wake the f--- up and do something about gun control before yet more of your children are blown to smithereens."" This debate on gun control comes a day after Texas church gunman Devin Kelley walked into First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs and opened fire, killing at least 26 and wounding another 20. The attack in the small town, roughly 30 miles from San Antonio, came just over a month after the mass shooting at Route 91 Country Music Festival in Las Vegas.

http://people.com/country/cmas-2017-carrie-underwood-brad-paisley-politics-make-fun/,"""It may be more important than ever that we make some people laugh this year,"" says cohost Brad Paisley Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley are hosting the 51st CMA Awards for the tenth year, and they have plenty of material prepared — politics included. “We just want to make fun of things that are funny,” Underwood, 34, tells PEOPLE exclusively. “We’ve always tried to keep that in our minds, but this year more than ever.” The star — nominated for female vocalist of the year — wants viewers to know that whatever jabs she and Paisley deliver during the show are made in good fun. “I hope that people don’t take clips and things out of context — that’s the most frustrating part, I think,” Underwood says of the hosting gig. “We have this eight-minute-long monologue, and we really do try to be in the middle,” she adds. “But people will pick out individual jokes and be like, ‘Can you believe they ripped on so-and-so?’ or ‘They did this on this person?’ But we do it to everybody! We try to be equal and make fun of funny things.” Paisley, 45, says he’s come to expect backlash and knows some jokes will be taken out of context, but that doesn’t mean any topic is off limits. “There’s no news happening,” the cohost quips. “What could we possibly make fun of right now?” Still, he says he and his cohost can breathe a tiny sigh of relief. Last year, they emceed the show just days before the election and toed the line with their monologue, in which they lightheartedly lampooned infamous moments from Clinton-Trump race, from Trump’s “nasty woman” dig to Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” comment. “That’s a difficult time; we’ve done that twice, and tensions are running high at a point like that, so that’s a dance that’s difficult to do, and I don’t miss that,” Paisley adds. “It’s a little easier in off years, in that sense.” All jokes aside, Paisley confirmed the awards will pay tribute to members the country music community lost this year following the mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest Festival. In October, a gunman killed 58 people and injured 527 at the country music festival, making it the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. “It’s very important to use this show as a vehicle to uplift our community and our industry,” Paisley told PEOPLE exclusively. “The best thing we can do is acknowledge it, pay our respects, and then perform this music and use this music for what it’s best at, which is unifying and giving us joy and finding the light here. … Humor is an important aspect. It may be more important than ever that we make some people laugh this year.” Miranda Lambert, Little Big Town and Keith Urban scored the most nominations for the 2017 awards show, where Reba McEntire and Kelsea Ballerini, Maren Morris and Niall Horan, Thomas Rhett and many more are set to perform. The 51st CMA Awards will be held at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville on Nov. 8 at 8 p.m. ET. The show will air live on ABC. "

Once the shooting started Sunday at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, a town of about 400 people, there was likely ""no way"" for congregants to escape, said Wilson County Sheriff Joe D. Tackitt Jr. Officials said about 20 others were wounded. ""He just walked down the center aisle, turned around and my understanding was shooting on his way back out,"" said Tackitt, who said the gunman also carried a handgun but that he didn't know if it was fired. Tackitt described the scene as ""terrible."" ""It's unbelievable to see children, men and women, laying there. Defenseless people,"" he said. Tackitt told CNN on Monday morning that the gunman's former in-laws attended services at the church ""from time to time"" but weren't in attendance Sunday. Texas officials confirmed the suspect as Devin Patrick Kelley, 26. They said he lived in New Braunfels, which is about 35 miles north of the Sutherland Springs church. Sutherland Springs A U.S. official told The Associated Press that Kelley didn't appear to be linked to organized terrorist groups. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person wasn't authorized to discuss the investigation. Investigators were looking at social media posts Kelley made in the days before the attack, including one that appeared to show an AR-15 semi-automatic weapon. Kelley received a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force for assaulting his spouse and child, and was sentenced to 12 months' confinement after a 2012 court-martial. Kelley served in Logistics Readiness at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his 2014 discharge, Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said. At the news conference, the attacker was described only as a white man in his 20s who was wearing black tactical gear and a ballistic vest when he pulled into a gas station across from the church, about 30 miles (48.28 kilometers) southeast of San Antonio, around 11:20 a.m. The gunman crossed the street and started firing the rifle at the church, said Freeman Martin, a regional director of the Texas Department of Safety, then continued firing after entering the white wood-frame building, where an 11 a.m. service was scheduled. As he left, the shooter was confronted by an armed resident who ""grabbed his rifle and engaged that suspect,"" Martin said. A short time later, the suspect was found dead in his vehicle at the county line. Federal agents, including ATF investigators and the FBI's evidence collection team, swarmed the small rural community of just hundreds of residents. Several weapons were found inside the vehicle and Martin said it was unclear if the attacker died of a self-inflicted wound or if he was shot by the resident who confronted him. He said investigators weren't ready to discuss a possible motive. Martin said 23 of the dead were found in the church, two were found outside and one died after being taken to a hospital. The man who confronted Kelley had help from another local resident, Johnnie Langendorff, who told KSAT TV that he was driving past the church as the shooting happened. He didn't identify the armed resident but said the man exchanged gunfire with the gunman, then asked to get in Langendorff's truck and the pair followed as the gunman drove away. Langendorff said the gunman eventually lost control of his vehicle and crashed. He said the other man walked up to the vehicle with his gun drawn and the suspect did not move. He stayed there for at least five minutes, until police arrived. ""I was strictly just acting on what's the right thing to do,"" Langendorff said. Among those killed was the church pastor's 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle Pomeroy. Pastor Frank Pomeroy and his wife, Sherri, were both out of town when the attack occurred, Sherri Pomeroy wrote in a text message. ""We lost our 14-year-old daughter today and many friends,"" she wrote. ""Neither of us has made it back into town yet to personally see the devastation. I am at the charlotte airport trying to get home as soon as i can."" Church member Nick Uhlig, 34, who wasn't at Sunday's service, told the AP that his cousin, who was 8 months pregnant, and her in-laws were among those killed. He later told the Houston Chronicle that three of his cousin's children also were slain. President Donald Trump, who was in Japan, called the shooting an ""act of evil,"" later calling the gunman ""a very deranged individual."" Sunday evening, two sheriff's vans were parked outside the gate of a cattle fence surrounding the address listed for Kelley on the rural, western outskirts of New Braunfels, north of San Antonio. Ryan Albers, 16, who lives across the road, said he heard intensifying gunfire coming from that direction in recent days. ""It was definitely not just a shotgun or someone hunting,"" Albers said. ""It was someone using automatic weapon fire."" The church has posted videos of its Sunday services on a YouTube channel, raising the possibility that the shooting was captured on video. In a video of its Oct. 8 service, a congregant who spoke and read Scripture pointed to the Oct. 1 Las Vegas shooting a week earlier as evidence of the ""wicked nature"" of man. That shooting left 58 dead and more than 500 injured. Gov. Greg Abbott called Sunday's attack the worst mass shooting in Texas history. It came on the eighth anniversary of a shooting at the Texas' Fort Hood, where 13 people were killed and 31 others wounded by a former U.S. Army major. The previous deadliest mass shooting in Texas had been a 1991 attack in Killeen, when a mentally disturbed man crashed his pickup truck through a restaurant window at lunchtime and started shooting people, killing 23 and injuring more than 20 others. The University of Texas was the site of one of the most infamous mass shootings in modern American history, when U.S. Marine sniper Charles Whitman climbed the Austin campus' clock tower in 1966 and began firing on stunned people below, killing 13 and wounding nearly three dozen others. He had killed his wife and mother before heading to the tower, one victim died a week later and medical examiners eventually attributed a 17th death to Whitman in 2001. ___ Associated Press writers Sadie Gurman and Eric Tucker in Washington, Nomaan Merchant in Houston, Will Weissert in Austin, Diana Heidgerd in Dallas, Michael Balsamo in Los Angeles and Paul J.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/TutngQCEbPw/,"It’s been five weeks since the mass shooting in Las Vegas, the worst in U.S. history, and little has changed. A brief conversation about banning bump stocks — the devices used by Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock that allow semiautomatic rifles to essentially function as automatics — fell out of the headlines and nothing was done. Now, in the wake of another grisly shooting, which left 26 dead in a Texas church on Sunday, those in the Republican-controlled Congress who support stricter gun control — Democrats, namely — are bitterly cynical about the prospect of change. “It just strikes me that we see tragedy after tragedy and no action because of the power of the [National Rifle Association],” Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin told TIME while waiting for the Senate subway on Tuesday. “It’s just heartbreaking.” It is very nearly certain that no comprehensive gun control legislation will surface in Congress in the aftermath of Sunday’s shooting. When measures are proposed in the wake of mass shootings, they tend to be partial and patchwork: efforts that target one marginal component of firearm safety that relates specifically to the tragedy that just transpired. After Las Vegas, it was bump stocks. Now, after the massacre at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Republican lawmakers are saying they would be open to repairs to the federal background check system, noting that the shooter, 26-year-old former Air Force member Devin Patrick Kelley, might not have been able to buy a gun had the Air Force properly noted his domestic violence conviction in the national background check database. (One convicted of domestic violence cannot lawfully possess a firearm.) “I believe that there’s an opportunity here to work together on a bipartisan basis to come up with a way to address this solution to a very real problem,” Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas told reporters on Tuesday. Cornyn has introduced a bill that would “incentivize” federal agencies to upload criminal conviction records into the background database. “There’s enormous problems with the background check system. That’s one of the areas of consensus on a very contentious topic.” But recent history suggests that doing so will not prove a particularly high legislative priority. After the Las Vegas shooting, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who has long been a vocal supporter of gun control, introduced a bill that would ban the sale and use of bump stocks. That was a month ago. Though several Republicans have criticized bump stocks, even writing to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to inquire why they were legal, they have not pressed the matter. Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Iowa Republican who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, told Politico on Monday that he would soon convene a hearing on the matter of bump stocks, but that it had not been finalized. Senate Republican leadership could not offer any more specifics on Tuesday. “I think that hearing will occur,” Cornyn said. He also declined to say whether he would support Feinstein’s bill, saying the current moment was “premature.” On Tuesday, NPR reported the Texas-based gun accessory vendor Slide Fire would resume its sale of bump stocks on its online store after indefinitely suspending them after last month’s shooting.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/uproxx/features/~3/drDbiXUiui8/,"Barely a month after Australian stand-up comedian Jim Jefferies addressed the horrendous Las Vegas mass shooting on his Comedy Central program, the outspoken gun control advocate turned his attention to Sutherland Springs, Texas. “It’s hard to know what to say after another incident like this,” he began with a serious tone. “We were shocked and saddened after Las Vegas. We are devastated by this Texas shooting.” However, as the short Jim Jefferies Show segment progressed, it became quickly apparent that the host wasn’t about to let the tragedy — and President Trump’s response — slide by. “We tape this show about six hours before it airs,” Jefferies continued, “so I would like to extend my thoughts and prayers to the victims of whatever mass shooting just happened this afternoon.” As the studio audience became aware of the bit’s punchline, the room responded with a decidedly mixed chorus of reactions. A series of gasps echoed throughout, while a few resounding laughs cut through the groans — and through it all, Jefferies maintained an utterly serious look. For despite the joke’s intentional shock, it paled in comparison to a clip of Trump poo-pooing the thought of discussing gun control following Sunday’s tragedy. “Once again, Republican leaders are saying it’s too early to talk about gun control,” Jefferies said before cutting to comments Trump made at a joint press conference with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. “This isn’t a guns situation. I mean, we could go into it but it’s a little bit soon to go into it,” he told reporters. “This is a mental health problem at the highest level.” Needless to say, the comedian agreed. “He’s right! It’s a mental health issue, because if you think sending thoughts and prayers without trying to pass any meaningful gun control is going to change anything, then you’re f*cking mental.” (Via Comedy Central)"

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/488693682/0/phoenix/nation~Texas-church-shooter-showed-promise-in-military-intel-records-show/,"SAN ANGELO, TEXAS — In March 2010, Devin P. Kelley arrived at Goodfellow Air Force Base to begin his technical training, military records show. The man who massacred 26 people at a small church in Sutherland Springs on Sunday at one time showed promise as a potential intelligence analyst and began tech school with the 317th Training Squadron, military records show. When he arrived at Goodfellow for training, his job specialty code was listed as 1N411 on military documents, which, according to the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory, is the coding for a fusion analyst student. “Fusion Analysts determine the value and implications of intelligence we receive from target network communications,” states the Air Force’s website. “Through research and assessment, these specialists gauge the impact of the information and distribute their findings to high-level decision-makers so we can take timely action to ensure the safety of Airmen and our country.” Google shared conspiracy theories that sought to tie Texas shooter to antifa movement Texas shooter allowed to buy weapons after Air Force failed to flag him Neighbor ran to aid Texas shooting victims after shooter Devin Kelley fled To become a fusion analyst airmen must successfully complete a polygraph test, background investigation and be eligible to receive top secret clearance, the site notes. Technical training takes 110 days. During that time, however, Kelley’s career track was changed. When he arrived at his first duty station in April 2011 at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, he was classified as an apprentice in traffic management, tasked with the logistics of moving military personnel and property. It’s unclear why his job duties were changed while at Goodfellow. ""There is no record of why he changed,"" said Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek. There are no disciplinary actions from during his time at Goodfellow AFB documented in the personnel records maintained after Kelley was discharged, Stefanek said. Kelley was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his spouse and their child while stationed at Holloman. He received a bad conduct discharge, was confined for 12 months and busted to the grade of E-1. He was discharged in 2014. "

http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-michigan-concealed-carry-schools-bars-20171108-story.html,"LANSING, MICH. — Licensed gun owners with extra training could legally carry inside schools, churches, bars and other pistol-free zones under hotly contested legislation that was approved Wednesday by the Republican-led Michigan Senate, days after the Texas church massacre. The bills were sent to the GOP-led House for consideration next. They face an uncertain future because Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, vetoed a similar plan in 2012 following the mass shooting of elementary schoolchildren in Connecticut. Snyder is not commenting on the new legislation until or if it wins final legislative passage. In Michigan, it is illegal for the nearly 618,000 people with concealed weapons permits to carry in designated gun-free zones: schools, day cares, stadiums, large concert halls, taverns, places of worship, hospitals, many college dorms or classrooms, and casinos. The legislation would legalize the right to carry in those places if a license holder gets eight more hours of training, though privately owned businesses such as bars could stay pistol-free. People licensed to carry would be banned from openly carrying or intentionally displaying a pistol — a provision that addresses a ""loophole"" that has allowed armed open-carry activists to enter the gun-free zones and has sparked lawsuits. The current law already gives the leaders of churches, synagogues, mosques and other places of worship permission to allow concealed weapons. Twenty-five Republicans voted for the main bill. All 11 Democrats and one Republican opposed it. The sponsor, GOP Senate Majority Leader Arlan Meekhof of West Olive, said the recent mass shootings in Texas and Las Vegas highlight the need to act. ""I believe citizens have the right to be free and safe and secure and to defend themselves and their loved ones,"" he said. ""Responsible, well-trained, licensed gun owners may be one of those deterrents to those individuals who seek out gun-free zones as opportunities to commit heinous crimes."" Opponents, including gun-control advocates and the education lobby, criticized allowing anyone other than a law enforcement or security officer to bring pistols inside schools, day care centers and other public spaces. They called it the ""pistols in preschools"" legislation, warned of accidental shootings and chaos for police responding to active shooters, and said it could boost liability insurance costs. Critics also questioned allowing alcohol and guns to mix and said the bills would do nothing to stop bad actors from obtaining guns in the first place. ""Real life is not an action movie. The reality is you're much more likely to have an accident in a preschool, in a day care center, in a school"" if the legislation becomes law, Senate Democratic Leader Jim Ananich, a former teacher from Flint, said during the debate. More than three-dozen volunteer members of the group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America watched the afternoon debate from the Senate gallery. The National Rifle Association supports the bills. A Republican spokeswoman said school districts would be authorized to prevent their teachers and other employees from bringing a gun into a school building under an existing law, though a Democratic spokeswoman said the matter should be clarified. The legislation also would make property owned by public airport authorities pistol-free zones unless a gun owner has the additional training. Another bill that passed along party lines Wednesday would let 18- to 20-year-olds obtain a provisional concealed pistol permit. The current minimum age is 21. The state Senate also voted to include school districts, libraries and community colleges in a state ban on local gun regulations and to loosen gun restrictions for foster parents. It was the latest salvo from a GOP-led Legislature that at times has been at odds with the governor on guns. In June, the state House approved legislation that would make it voluntary to have a concealed pistol license. When Snyder vetoed the proposed elimination of gun-free zones in 2012, he primarily expressed concern that the bill would not have let public entities such as schools, day care facilities and hospitals choose to remain gun-free.

http://observer.com/2017/11/feinstein-and-senate-democrats-introduce-gun-ban-bill-following-texas-shooting/,"Senate Democrats introduced a gun control bill on Wednesday following mass shootings in Las Vegas, Tennessee and Texas. Sponsored by California Senator Dianne Feinstein, Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal, and roughly two dozen other Democratic senators, the bill aims to ban the sale of over 200 types of semi-automatic weapons and magazines holding more than ten rounds of ammunition.
Similar to a 2013 measure Feinstein introduced in the wake of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, the proposal also bans devices that increase firing speed (such as the bump stock used in the Las Vegas shooting last month). It requires both a background check to all gun sales and “a safe storage requirement for grandfathered firearms” while expanding the number of banned firearms from 157 to 205.
“We’re introducing an updated Assault Weapons Ban for one reason: so that after every mass shooting with a military-style assault weapon, the American people will know that a tool to reduce these massacres is sitting in the Senate, ready for debate and a vote,” Feinstein said in a statement.
Since NRA-friendly Republicans control the Senate, Feinstein’s bill is unlikely to make it to the floor. But recent debates over bump stocks and background checks have created some wiggle room for bipartisan legislation that addresses the uptick in shootings. Republican Senator John Cornyn said on Tuesday he plans to introduce legislation strengthening background checks, a notable step for someone given an A+ rating by the NRA.
“I plan to introduce legislation … to ensure that all federal departments and agencies, including the Department of Defense, upload the required conviction records into the national database,” the senator said, adding that the current background system in place “must change.”
Politicians have fiercely debated gun control since Columbine. As each shooting claims more victims than the last, Americans become further desensitized to gun violence. During a time when nationalism promotes a retreat from the world stage, U.S. citizens isolate into Hobbesian environments fueled by paranoia. Though possessing a firearm was once an expression of patriotism, the ownership of semi-automatic rifles only masks deeper insecurities rooted in the fall of Rome.

http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-texas-shooting-children-deaths-20171108-story.html,"LA VERNIA, TEXAS — By the time Paul Brunner rolled up in his ambulance to the worst mass shooting in Texas history, the First Baptist Church was a chaotic triage scene. Parents cried and kids screamed, and nearly all the victims appeared to have been hit more than once. Two of the first four patients the burly volunteer medic loaded into ambulances were children. ""Our inclination is to protect children. The thing is, that wasn't his inclination,"" Brunner said, referring to the gunman. ""He wasn't separating going, 'I'm not going to hurt the kids. I'm going to go after whatever adults wronged me.'"" When gunfire tore through the church in tiny Sutherland Springs, killing more than two dozen people, the bullets claimed eight children and teenagers who were sitting through Sunday services with their families. It was the largest number of children killed in a mass shooting since 20 died at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. Like that massacre in Newtown, Conn., the fact that the assailant slaughtered defenseless children compounded the anguish. Nearby schools quickly added grief counselors. The shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, had a turbulent and violent past that included a court-martial while serving in the Air Force on charges that he assaulted his then-wife and hit her child hard enough to fracture the boy's skull. Kelley, who had a rifle and left behind at least 15 empty magazines holding 30 rounds each, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after he was chased by bystanders and crashed his car. Investigators have said the shooting appeared to stem from a domestic dispute involving Kelley and his mother-in-law, who sometimes attended services at the church but was not present on Sunday. One couple who survived the attack, Rosanne Solis and Joaquin Ramirez, said Kelley went aisle by aisle through the pews and shot crying children at point-blank range. Authorities put the death count at 26, including the unborn baby of one of the slain women and the 14-year-old daughter of the church's pastor. ""There were just so many babies in there. It was a church. It was families,"" said Torie McCallum, the former sister-in-law of Crystal Holcombe, the pregnant woman. ""Watching them take person after person after person out was so heartbreaking."" McCallum is also a volunteer medic in nearby Floresville who spent 12 hours at the scene Sunday. She identified Crystal and her three dead children — 11-year-old Emily, 13-year-old Greg and 9-year-old Megan. Another of Crystal's children, 7-year-old Evelyn, ran out of the church to a neighbor's house. She suffered a head contusion, which McCallum thinks may have been caused by her head hitting a pew. The kids were smart and liked church. Their father died six years earlier, but McCallum was relieved when John Holcombe entered the picture and helped raise them as his own. They called him Dad and thrived in the 4-H Club. Emily liked archery while Greg, Evelyn and Megan did karate. Crystal homeschooled the children, and the girls sang in church, where the family got a kick out of how their different voices harmonized. McCallum said the kids were excited for a new sibling and decided that the baby's name, whether a boy or girl, should be Billy Bob Wigglebottom — which they found hilarious. The official list of those killed released by Texas authorities Wednesday included Carlin Brite ""Billy Bob"" Holcombe. By Wednesday, an online fundraiser had collected more $72,000 for the family. ""To see seasoned FBI agents and seasoned paramedics and seasoned law enforcement officers, when you see their eyes red, I feel so awful for all of the people who responded to that scene. Because they should never have to see anything like that, especially with so many children,"" McCallum said. One of the wounded children, 5-year-old Ryland Ward, was hit multiple times and opened his eyes at the hospital Tuesday for the first time since the shooting, said Leslie Ward, the boy's aunt. ""Seeing the children that were killed. It's one thing to see an adult, but to see a 5-year-old, that's tough,"" Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said. Alison Gould, 17, returned Wednesday to the church where she had waited hours on Sunday for word about her best friend, 16-year-old Haley Krueger. She got the news she feared later that night. ""I am trying my best to cope. I want to see her really bad, and it's kind of hard because I know that I can't,"" Gould said. ""Me and her mom keep thinking that maybe she's in the hospital, and they just identified her wrong. We're trying really hard."" Brunner, chief of the ambulance service in nearby La Vernia, had been at lunch with his own family when he heard about the shooting. ""You had parents screaming about their kids. They got stuff in front of them that they never imagined they would see in their life,"" Brunner said. ""Not really a war zone, because at least people in a war know they're in the middle of a war. This is just hard to describe."" CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"

https://newrepublic.com/article/145703/right-obsessed-sutherland-springs-shooters-atheism,"Devin Kelley, who on Sunday killed 26 people in a mass shooting at a small church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, may be an atheist. For some of the most influential media outlets on the right, his rumored atheism is a more salient data point than the fact that he had shown a demonstrated pattern of violence, including allegedly abusing animals, attacking his wife, and cracking his baby stepson’s skull. “Texas church shooter was a militant atheist,” said The New York Post.  “Report: Texas church shooter was atheist, thought Christians ‘stupid,’” said Breitbart. “Killer ‘Preached Atheism,” a Drudge headline blared. Kelley’s atheism has been presented as a possible motive even in mainstream outlets like The New York Times. For conservatives unwilling to blame the widespread availability of deadly weapons for this latest massacre, atheism may seem like a convenient scapegoat. But it goes deeper than that. In The Washington Post, Russell Moore of the Southern Baptist Convention avoided the subject of Kelley’s atheism but linked the shooting—sans any firm evidence—to the persecution of the global Christian church. “The goal the gunman sought, to terrorize worshipers, has been attempted constantly over the centuries around the world by cold, rational governments and terrorist groups—all thinking that they could, by the trauma of violence, snuff out churches, or at least intimidate those churches into hiding from one another,” he wrote. Never mind that authorities have suggested Kelley targeted his mother-in-law, who had attended the church, as part of an ongoing domestic dispute, which in turn links Kelley to other mass murderers of recent vintage, many of whom share a predilection for domestic violence. Moore seems to believe the shooter targeted Christianity itself, a doubly strange position when you consider that white Evangelicals are strong gun supporters. We are seeing how far right-wing Christian conservatives will go to protect gun culture: The nation’s god-fearing do not only sacrifice the children of Sandy Hook, but themselves, too. In 2012, the same year Adam Lanza murdered 20 kindergarteners along with six of their adult caretakers, 58 percent of white Evangelicals reported owning guns and only 35 percent supported stricter gun control laws. This, despite the fact that churches have been targeted by gunmen with some frequency. Kelley’s mass murder is the deadliest of its kind, but it is hardly the first. Emanuel Samson shot eight people, killing one, at Burnette Chapel in Tennessee in September; Woodrow Karey murdered his pastor in Louisiana in 2013; and Jim Adkisson opened fire on the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church in 2008. In 2015, Dylann Roof shot and killed nine Christians at a historically black church in Charleston, South Carolina. Mass shooters have murdered pious Christians in other, less sacred contexts, all while conservative Christians and their representatives in Congress look at their feet and shrug. The shooters have, in some cases, been Christians themselves: The Daily Beast says Colorado Walmart shooter Scott Ostrem “lived alone in an apartment with a stack of Bibles and virtually no furniture.” Pick any slain abortion provider, and chances are good that his killer professes Christianity. The right’s response is a logical gymnastics; these acts are just evil, no shooter is truly Christian. It is not a coincidence that this rhetoric both protects Christianity and the gun. The aftermath of the Sutherland Springs shooting has shown a renewed devotion to this idea of implacable evil, in response to liberal complaints that politicians must do more than offer their thoughts and prayers. In National Review on Monday, David French defended prayer as the most “rational” and “effective” response to mass murder. “The sad and terrifying fact is that no one has a reliable answer for evil men who want to commit mass murder,” he insisted. The Federalist ran a story with the headline, “When The Saints of First Baptist Church Were Murdered, God Was Answering Their Prayers.” And Erick Erickson wrote, “There will be more church shootings. There will be more persecution of Christians. There will be more evil, often masked under the guise of progressive enlightenment.” This is more than a sick kind of fatalism. It is the supplanting of one religion with another, which demands its own martyrs. “The gun is not a mere tool, a bit of technology, a political issue, a point of debate. It is an object of reverence,” Garry Wills wrote for The New York Review of Books in 2012. “Devotion to it precludes interruption with the sacrifices it entails.” For Wills, the gun is child-devouring Moloch. It is almost as if, in stepping inside that house of worship, Devin Kelley conquered it for that god. And now its acolytes will spread a false gospel: Arm the teachers, arm the pastors, arm the toddlers. Sarah Jones is a staff writer at New York magazine."

The targets of the mass murderers were in Las Vegas at a country and western music festival. In Texas, the victims were members of a conservative, evangelical, semi-rural Baptist church in an almost exclusively white, unincorporated town. The voter demographics in Nevada and Texas are rapidly changing ― more blacks, Hispanics and younger voters, who in time could shift both states to the blue column. But for now, the two states still track GOP and conservative, especially in small towns and areas such as Sutherland Springs. In interviews with many of the performers and participants at the country and western event in Las Vegas after the shooting, almost all said that they had been staunch opponents of tougher gun control laws, and many were gun owners. In Texas, the man who gave chase to the shooter ― and reportedly had a shootout with him ― is now being hailed as a hero. More than a few jumped in to parrot the gun control opponent’s mantra, “If only more people there had guns, then the shooter would have been stopped cold.” So, if many of the victims of mass shootings are white, conservative, anti-gun control, and likely Trump backers, then here’s the logical question ― no, two questions ― that must be asked. Shouldn’t this spark an epiphany about loose, rampant and virtually unchecked access to guns by anyone, anywhere, anytime? The other is: Should this give some pause to Trump and the GOP to stop cavalierly branding and dismissing these shooters as kooks, cranks and chronic malcontents? The brutal reality in trying to answer both questions is that the people being mass murdered now are the very people who Trump and the GOP routinely court every election and depend on to maintain their iron grip on state legislatures, governorships and the House. Aren’t they the voter demographic that Trump furiously courted during the 2016 presidential election and that he banked on to put him in the Oval Office? And, by and large, they did. Trump and the GOP haven’t ― and won’t ― connect the dots on the shootings and the victims to themselves, because they don’t see the shooters as one of them. They are nut cases or, to be more pseudo-scientific, they have “mental issues.” They are grotesque, monstrous aberrations who are so far out of the pale of normal society they can be neatly categorized and swiftly marginalized. This is a major reason these shooters are never banded as domestic terrorists, a label that’s almost exclusively reserved for, and quickly slapped on, Muslims who commit a terror act in the U.S. If so, it would put them back in the ranks of those who are red-blooded, born in America, patriotic Americans. A rigid separation must be made between the mass murderers and their victims to salve the conscience of Trump and the GOP that they are not one of us. The other problem is race. The majority of the victims in Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs were white, as were their killers. This simply doesn’t fit the ingrained stereotype of who commits murder and mayhem in America, including serial murders and mass terror slaughter. The perps are almost universally viewed, endlessly played up in the media and mass warehoused in jails and prisons as young blacks, Hispanics, and now Muslims. To admit that mass murderers can be white and made in America would require Trump and the GOP to turn the mirror on themselves and frankly admit that people who share their values, views and even politics are also capable of committing atrocious acts of terror. It would require a sea change by NRA that has held Congress virtually hostage with its money, power and massive membership to torpedo even the most innocuous and tepid gun control legislation. The organization would have to admit the dire peril that unchecked gun access poses to many of its own constituents. For now, this is all fantasy land hope. It’s just easier for Trump and the GOP to point a damning finger at Muslims, blacks and Hispanics as the only real terror threat in America. This doesn’t require any need to justify why they aren’t doing more than just offering prayers and thoughts to the victims and cursing the shooters as nut cases to back even the most minimal gun control restrictions. And to warn that mass murderers aren’t only in ISIS land but can be the neighbor next door. This gross failure to do this, though, will be no consolation to the victims of the almost inevitable next mass shooting ― no matter how many of them are Trump backers.

The singer, 34, took the stage at Nashville’s Bridgestone Arena to sing a somber rendition of the traditional hymn “Softly and Tenderly,” paying tribute to family members the country music community lost in 2017, including Troy Gentry, Glen Campbell and Don Williams. Then, toward the end of the performance, the faces of the 58 victims who were killed in the mass shooting at the Las Vegas Route 91 Harvest Festival flashed across the screen in the venue as Underwood became emotional and tearfully wrapped the song. In addition to performing, Underwood was nominated for female vocalist of the years and, for the tenth year, cohosted the show with Brad Paisley. Underwood and Paisley, 45, honored the Las Vegas victims earlier in the show. “This has been a year marked by tragedy, impacting countless lives, including so many in our country music family. So tonight, we’re going to do what families do: come together, pray together, cry together, and sing together, too,” Underwood said during their monologue. Paisley added: “The way we see it, the best way to honor our fans is to play our music — loud and proud. Our music lifts people up and that’s what we’re here to do tonight. So this year’s show is dedicated to all of those we’ve lost and to all of those who are still healing. We love you and we will never forget you.” The 51st CMAs broadcast live from Nashville Wednesday on ABC. "

Kimmel, the late-night comic, announced the first of three Kmart specials Tuesday night on his ABC talk show. It's one of many integrations that the show has done with various brands. The online-only deals kicked off with a 49-inch Polaroid TV that will be on sale for $350 instead of the usual $550. And Kmart loyalty program members will also get back points worth $200 after they make the purchase.  The show will announce two more specials on Nov. 14 and Nov. 21 that will also offer loyalty points along with a discount. Bluelight Specials became a staple of Kmart stores in their heyday. Starting in 1965, a voice over a store's public-address system would announce a deep discount on an item and shoppers would be directed to the bargain by a flashing blue light, like the one atop police cars.

Shoppers could hop online as soon as the show ended and grab the sale through midnight Saturday. The tie-in with the popular late night show is a unique way to woo shoppers at a time when retailers are battling for attention and dollars during the months that are the most critical and lucrative for the retail industry. Stores are offering discounts, free shipping, and in-store experiences ranging from parties to product demonstrations to get a share of the up to $1.05 trillion in sales consultancy Deloitte is forecasting for this holiday season."

http://theconversation.com/fbi-tries-to-crack-another-smartphone-5-essential-reads-87141,"Politics + Society Editor, The Conversation US The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations View the full list Editor’s note: The following is a roundup of archival stories. Federal investigators following up on the mass shooting at a Texas church on Nov. 5 have seized the alleged shooter’s smartphone – reportedly an iPhone – but are reporting they are unable to unlock it, to decode its encryption and read any data or messages stored on it. The situation adds fuel to an ongoing dispute over whether, when and how police should be allowed to defeat encryption systems on suspects’ technological devices. Here are highlights of The Conversation’s coverage of that debate. The FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice have in recent years – especially since the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California – been increasing calls for what they term “exceptional access,” a way around encryption that police could use to gather information on crimes both future and past. Technology and privacy scholar Susan Landau, at Tufts University, argues that limits and challenges to investigative power are strengths of democracy, not weaknesses: “[L]aw enforcement has always had to deal with blocks to obtaining evidence; the exclusionary rule, for example, means that evidence collected in violation of a citizen’s constitutional protections is often inadmissible in court.” Further, she notes that almost any person or organization, including community groups, could be a potential target for hackers – and therefore should use strong encryption in their communications and data storage: “This broad threat to fundamental parts of American society poses a serious danger to national security as well as individual privacy. Increasingly, a number of former senior law enforcement and national security officials have come out strongly in support of end-to-end encryption and strong device protection (much like the kind Apple has been developing), which can protect against hacking and other data theft incidents.” The idea of weakening encryption for everyone just so police can have an easier time is increasingly recognized as unworkable, writes Ben Buchanan, a fellow at Harvard’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. Instead, “The future of law enforcement and intelligence gathering efforts involving digital information is an emerging field that I and others who are exploring it sometimes call ""lawful hacking.” Rather than employing a skeleton key that grants immediate access to encrypted information, government agents will have to find other technical ways – often involving malicious code – and other legal frameworks.“ Indeed he observes, when the FBI failed to force Apple to unlock the San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone, ""the FBI found another way. The bureau hired an outside firm that was able to exploit a vulnerability in the iPhone’s software and gain access. It wasn’t the first time the bureau had done such a thing.” When the San Bernardino suspect’s iPhone was targeted by investigators, Android researchers William Enck and Adwait Nadkarni at North Carolina State University tried to crack a smartphone themselves. They found that one key to encryption’s effectiveness is proper setup: “Overall, devices running the most recent versions of iOS and Android are comparably protected against offline attacks, when configured correctly by both the phone manufacturer and the end user. Older versions may be more vulnerable; one system could be cracked in less than 10 seconds. Additionally, configuration and software flaws by phone manufacturers may also compromise security of both Android and iOS devices.” What are investigators hoping to find, anyway? It’s nearly a given that they aren’t looking for emails the suspect may have sent or received. As Georgia State University constitutional scholar Clark Cunningham explains, the government already believes it is allowed to read all of a person’s email, without the email owner ever knowing: “[The] law allows the government to use a warrant to get electronic communications from the company providing the service – rather than the true owner of the email account, the person who uses it. ""And the government then usually asks that the warrant be ""sealed,” which means it won’t appear in public court records and will be hidden from you. Even worse, the law lets the government get what is called a “gag order,” a court ruling preventing the company from telling you it got a warrant for your email.“ With this new case, federal officials risk weakening public support for giving investigators special access to circumvent or evade encryption. After the controversy over the San Bernardino shooter’s phone, public demand for privacy and encryption climbed, wrote Carnegie Mellon professor Rahul Telang: ""Repeated stories on data breaches and privacy invasion, particularly from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, appears to have heightened users’ attention to security and privacy. Those two attributes have become important enough that companies are finding it profitable to advertise and promote them. ""Apple, in particular, has highlighted the security of its products recently and reportedly is doubling down and plans to make it even harder for anyone to crack an iPhone.” It seems unlikely this debate will ever truly go away: Police will continue to want easy access to all information that might help them prevent or solve crimes, and regular people will continue to want to protect their private information and communications from prying eyes, whether that’s criminals, hackers or, indeed, the government itself.

Thank you for your cooperation. In the aftermath of another horrific mass shooting, I have finally been convinced: Now is not the time to talk about gun control. Likewise, now is not the time to talk about terrorism in New York, arrests in Saudi Arabia, Larry David’s holocaust joke, or yesterday’s NFL’s upsets. Just as many Democrats favor a three-day waiting period to purchase a gun, I favor a three-day waiting period to talk about anything in the news. Since there are mass shootings every day, this has many benefits. For example, not only do we never have to talk about gun control, we never have to talk about not talking about gun control. What a relief! (I hate that conversation.) The problem with talking about something after it just happened is that in our eagerness to talk about the just-happened-thing, we discuss it. If there’s one thing that we can all agree on, it’s that we don’t need any more discussion, especially in the aftermath of something that has happened. Do you discuss a meal after you’ve eaten it? Of course not. You give yourself time to thoroughly digest and eliminate it. And even then, you wait for the stench of defecation to clear before starting a possibly contentious debate about your subpar avocado toast appetizer. It is like that with mass shootings and gun control, except that the stench never clears. Consequently, we adapt to the toxically foul odor so effectively, we become completely unaware of it until our next bout of collective diarrhea. And even then, who wants to talk about or hear about diarrhea? I don’t know about you, but when a diarrhea commercial comes on, I immediately turn it off and don’t talk about it. My point is that we can’t allow ourselves to go off half-cocked talking about things that just happened, not without politicizing them and thereby making things worse than if we hadn’t talked about them. Honestly, I fear that I am making things worse, much worse, by talking about not talking about them. So, in the interests of fostering a meaningful national dialogue, I would like to shift the conversation to not talking about not talking about not talking about things. You’re welcome. Experts agree, the main issue is mental health. If only we were mentally healthy, that would make a world of difference, believe me. I would say more about this, but sorry, now is not the time to talk about mental health. The question we must ask ourselves is: What is this the time to talk about? To properly answer this pressing question, I would have to check the news from three days ago in order to identify the stories reported that are not relevant today. Those irrelevant stories are without question ripe for exhaustive analysis and spirited debate. But sadly, in our rush to judgment, we prefer to focus on relevant things that just happened. In closing, I would like to say nothing at all. Joe Raiola is Senior Editor of MAD Magazine and Producer of the Annual John Lennon Tribute in NYC.

During a press conference in South Korea, NBC’s Ali Vitali asked Trump if he would consider “extreme vetting” for anyone wanting to buy a gun. After describing gun control as “a situation that probably shouldn’t be discussed right now,” Trump said stronger background checks would have made “no difference” in the attack, which left 26 people dead, including several children. Trump also invoked Stephen Willeford, the Sutherland Springs resident who confronted shooter Devin Kelley. With more background checks, the president said, “you might not have had that very brave person who happened to have a gun or a rifle in his truck go out and shoot him and hit him and neutralize him. I can only say this: If he didn’t have a gun, instead of having 26 dead, you would have had hundreds more dead.” Willeford told 40/29 News that he ran from his home to the church when his daughter told him about the shooting. Willeford confronted Kelley and shot him twice. When Kelley fled the area in his SUV, Willeford flagged down a passing motorist and chased him. Authorities later found Kelley dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his vehicle, which he had crashed into a ditch. It’s unclear if background checks would have affected Willeford, a former NRA instructor. However, the current background check system missed Kelley, who was kicked out of the Air Force following a domestic violence conviction and therefore should not have been able to purchase a gun legally. On Monday, the Air Force admitted that it failed to enter Kelley’s conviction into a federal database. As a result, he was able to pass multiple background checks to buy weapons, including the one he used on Sunday.

That was then and this is now, and now is a 26-year-old who lived about 35 miles from the church where he killed 26 members of the Baptist congregation and wounded at least 20 more. Reports are still sketchy, but the shooter may have been connected in some way to the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs insofar as his in-laws evidently attended services at that church from time to time. Within minutes after the initial somewhat garbled reports, the media was referring to this event in a manner which only confused things more. By calling it a “mass” shooting, the incident was then immediately added to the more than 300 shootings which, according to our friends at the Gun Violence Archive (GVA), have already produced more than 2,000 killed and injured this year. The GVA defines a mass shooting as any use of a gun to produce four or more injured victims dead or alive; the FBI says a mass shooting only occurs when four or more persons, including the shooter, end up dead. Take your pick. Most mass shootings grow out of domestic disputes – the pissed-off ex-husband shows up uninvited to a family birthday for his wife. He’s told to leave, some words are exchanged, you know what happens next. In September, again in Texas, a 27-year-old girl who had recently filed for divorce was shot and killed by her ex-spouse along with seven other friends who were sitting in her living room watching (what else in Texas?) the NFL. What happened yesterday in Sutherland Springs, however, wasn’t just another mass shooting with a larger count of wounded and dead. It was a peculiarly American phenomenon I call a “rampage” shooting, which seem to keep happening on a fairly regular basis over the last five years. In fact, going back to the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012, there have been eight of these rampage killing events adding up to 200 dead. Because most mass shootings occur within a domestic context, the shooter usually knows everyone who gets shot. Rampage shootings, on the other hand, take place at a location well known to the shooter, but what’s important is not the identity of the victims, but whether there are enough people crowded into one space to make it easy for the human toll to quickly mount. The shooter sometimes fires hundreds of rounds, which takes just a few minutes if he’s armed with an AR. The event is planned well in advance – weeks, months, years – and often the shooter ends the rampage by trying to escape. You can get a better sense of this profile by reading Louis Klaveras’ Rampage Nation or my book on Sandy Hook. Rampage shootings aren’t going to stop when everyone is armed with a concealed gun. In a small town in south Texas, I don’t believe that the only other person with a gun was standing outside the church. And don’t think I’m being at all critical of anyone in the congregation who might have been armed and didn’t yank out a piece in self-defense. When gun shots from a high-powered rifle go off without warning, everyone except highly-trained law enforcement will hit the floor. Trump was absolutely correct when he said that the shooter was a “very deranged individual.” This is exactly what he said after the Las Vegas rampage – he’s got the script down pat. But let’s not put the cart before the horse Donald – anyone who uses a gun for any purpose, including taking a pot-shot at Bambi, is just exercising his God-given, 2nd-Amendment “rights.” And we’re not about to rewrite the Constitution just because someone walked into a gun shop, bought a gun and literally annihilated the life of an entire town. It’s not the gun, remember? Never the gun. Mike the Gun Guy Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how."

When the newspaper prints their names, they should also print the names of the member of Congress who voted against gun control or whom are controlled by the NRA. Along with the names of the fallen, the papers should list the names of gun lobbyists and NRA executives. Whenever a member of Congress says it’s not the time to talk about gun control, the news should publish their contributions from the gun lobby.

The father of Texas church gunman Devin Kelley has broken his silence in the wake of the massacre, saying his family is in mourning, according to a report. “We are grieving, our family is grieving,” Michael Kelley told ABC News on Wednesday at his home in New Braunfels, about 35 miles north of Sutherland Springs, where his son slaughtered 26 people and wounded 20 others at First Baptist Church. After committing the atrocity, the 26-year-old exchanged gunfire with Stephen Willeford, who struck him in the leg and torso with his rifle before jumping into a vehicle driven by Johnnie Langendorff to chase the gunman. Kelley finally hit a stop sign and veered off the road about 10 miles away – killing himself with a gunshot to the head. His father declined to discuss the worst mass shooting in Texas shooting any further. “I don’t want our lives, our grandchildren’s lives, destroyed by this media circus,” he said. Share Selection"

https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/11/09/texas-church-shooters-father-breaks-silence-we-are-grieving/23271899/," The father of Texas church shooter Devin Kelley broke his silence on Wednesday to say his family was in mourning. Michael Kelley, who lives just 35 miles away from Sutherland Springs, where his son killed 25 people and an unborn child at the First Baptist Church, told ABC, ""We are grieving, our family is grieving."" The 26-year-old shot himself in the head after he sustained two gunshot wounds from Stephen Willeford, who grabbed his rifle when he heard shots ring out inside the church. The gunman’s father declined to comment any further on Wednesday, saying, “I don’t want our lives, our grandchildren’s lives, destroyed by this media circus.” What we know about the Texas shooting suspect: Three days after the worst mass shooting in Texas history, authorities are reviewing video footage from inside the church. The church regularly recorded its services, and there was “no one to turn [the camera] off” when Kelley opened fire, according to a law enforcement official who has seen the video. Authorities have also obtained Kelley’s locked iPhone, although investigators have not yet been able to access the contents. In a statement Wednesday evening, Apple said it’s offered the FBI technical advice after learning the bureau was trying to access the phone. The company said the FBI had not requested its assistance. Depending on the model of iPhone and what security features it had, FBI agents might have had a short window to use alternative methods to access its data. For instance, if the iPhone used Apple’s Touch ID fingerprint sensing system, agents could have tried placing the dead gunman’s finger on the phone to unlock it. But that would only have worked within 48 hours of the last time the phone was locked. Meanwhile, more details emerged about the gunman’s past. School records showed that Kelley was a disciplinary problem in high school, and his grades slipped with each passing year at New Braunfels High School. A former friend said Kelley asked her for sexual favors and prevented his first wife from communicating with her friends. Kelsey Huckaby told Austin television station KTBC that Kelley was “kind of controlling of his girlfriends” in high school. RELATED: Some of the victims of the Texas shooting Huckaby said she lost contact with Kelley until he responded to a Facebook post she made in April asking for a place to stay for her and her boyfriend. She said Kelley offered to let them stay in a trailer on his property if she performed weekly “sexual favors” for him. Vice President Mike Pence arrived in Texas on Wednesday, visiting wounded victims at a San Antonio hospital and later meeting families of the dead in Floresville, not far from Sutherland Springs.

https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/nov/09/late-night-tv-hosts-elections-democrats-shooting-texas,"Comics, including Trevor Noah and Samantha Bee, discussed Tuesday’s state elections, where Democrats performed strongly, and the mass shooting in Texas Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.16 BST Late-night hosts on Wednesday discussed the mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, and Tuesday’s state elections, where Democrats performed well in races for governorships and state legislatures. “One year ago today, Donald Trump was elected president,” Stephen Colbert began. “Yesterday, Democrats commemorated this anniversary by kicking Trump’s ass by using his arch-enemy, the popular vote.”  “Let’s start in Helena, Montana, where Wilmot Collins became the first black mayor in Montana’s history,” Colbert continued. “And in New Jersey, Democrat Phil Murphy was elected governor. A sad day for Chris Christie. So, a day for Chris Christie.” “Democrats have their swagger back,” the host said. “Virginia also elected its first transgender state lawmaker, Danica Roem. And in a moment of sweet irony, the man she beat was Bob Marshall, the Republican who introduced Virginia’s bathroom bill. “So soon there will be one bathroom Bob Marshall can’t use,” Colbert quipped. “The one in his office.” Colbert showed Trump’s tweet about Virginia’s Republican contender for governor, Ed Gillespie. Trump said Gillespie, who lost to Democrat Ralph Northam, “did not embrace me or what I stand for” – despite the fact that Gillespie’s campaign aired advertisements about immigrant violence, preserving Confederate monuments, and the NFL anthem protests. “Mr Trump, all of these elections were about you,” Colbert responded. “Significant numbers of voters in each state said Trump was a reason for their vote, with far more voting to oppose you than support you. That’s the problem with making everything about you, sir. It means everything, even losing, is about you. That’s the downside of narcissism.” Samantha Bee of TBS discussed the Republican reaction to the massacre in Sutherland Springs, where 26 people were killed. “And after the week we’ve had, there is nothing more important to me than gun control,” Bee said. “I would love to not talk about gun massacres, but we can’t ignore them. That’s Congress’s job. These savvy politicians have a few different moves to dodge the issue of gun violence.” Bee showed a clip of Trump officials and Republican politicians who said “now is not the time to talk about gun control” – including Kellyanne Conway, who called the conversation “disrespectful to the dead”. “Kellyanne should know, as someone who’s been dead inside for decades,” Bee responded. “How is it not the time? Ninety-three Americans a day die from gun violence. It’s like if a scary clown was killing 93 people per day and Congress was like, it’s not the right time to talk about the clown.” Bee then referred to the “timeless classic” of “thoughts and prayers” offered by politicians in the wake of gun violence. “I’m sorry, but unless you’re praying to the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl and these mass shootings are human sacrifices, your thoughts and prayers are not working. Thoughts and prayers are not a substitute for action, and pretty much all American voters want action on this. “The Republican party has completely bought into the myth that the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. “But that is not fair to ask of our nation’s many good guys. Good guys should be helping people move couches and lending you their Netflix password. They shouldn’t have to risk their lives in a church parking lot to protect the world from a monster.” Finally, Comedy Central’s Trevor Noah addressed the Tuesday elections, seeing them as a wave of karma. Noting Trump’s quick move to dissociate himself from Gillespie, Noah said: “Goddamn, Trump does not play games with how fast he will abandon you. I bet when the US economy crashes, Trump’s gonna be like, ‘What a loser economy, I’ve never even heard of America.’” “As much as Trump wants people to believe Gillespie lost because he didn’t embrace Trump’s worldview, the truth is, Gillespie did everything but grab someone by the pussy. “When you look at the bigger picture, you know who really won big in last night’s elections?” the host asked. “Karma, the spiritual principle that the universe will reward good actions and punish bad ones.” “Incumbents were defeated by the very thing they were being dicks about,” Noah went on, noting that in New Jersey, John Carman was defeated by Ashley Bennett after Carman mocked the Women’s March in January by asking if the protesters would be home in time to cook dinner. And in Montana, a Liberian refugee defeated a candidate who opposed having refugees in his city. “Carman, meet karma,” Noah concluded. “He was worried about women having time to make dinner, and now karma has given him all the time he needs to make his own dinner.”"
http://www.mlive.com/auto/index.ssf/2017/11/self-driving_bus_crash.html,"AAA and Keolis launch nation's first public self-driving shuttle in downtown Las Vegas. (AAA) While an autonomous bus was involved in a crash with a delivery truck on its first day of service in Las Vegas, the city says the shuttle ""did what it was supposed to do"" during the incident. In a news release, the city reports that if the delivery truck had the same sensors as the bus, ""the accident would have been avoided."" The self-driving bus is part of an AAA and Keolis partnership that launched in downtown Las Vegas on Wednesday, Nov. 8. The self-driving buses were built in Saline, Michigan by French firm NAVYA, which is an affiliate member of the Mobility Transformation Center. It runs its operations at the University of Michigan's North Campus Research Center. ""The autonomous shuttle was testing today when it was grazed by a delivery truck downtown,"" the city reports. ""The shuttle did what it was supposed to do, in that it's sensors registered the truck and the shuttle stopped to avoid the accident. Unfortunately the delivery truck did not stop and grazed the front fender of the shuttle."" Las Vegas said that the program's 12-month pilot program will continue as planned. This public support is what AAA says helped Las Vegas book the pilot program as it was selected due to its ""progressive regulations on autonomous vehicles, heavy investment in innovation, the high volume of visitors and a sunny, dry climate that's favorable for testing new driving technology."" AAA reports in a news release that the self-driving bus pilot program is the first of its kind in that it is specifically for the public to use. The auto club said it and Keolis will study how the bus acts in the city's busy Innovation District while surveying riders on their experience. The shuttle itself come with LiDAR technology, GPS, cameras and can seat eight passengers. ""From the horseless carriage to the driverless car, AAA has built its legacy on making travel safer, easier and more enjoyable,"" Tim Condon, president of AAA Northern California, Nevada and Utah, said in the release. ""AAA believes autonomous technology has the potential to save lives and improve traffic safety. ""We believe our Las Vegas pilot will allow the public to experience this exciting technology for themselves and allow their voices to be heard as AAA studies how autonomous transportation can be safely deployed for public use."" Some of the safety features highlighted include the ability to immediately stop if a pedestrian steps in front of the bus and the sensors to stop if a vehicle is about to hit it. The all-electric, autonomous shuttle covers a 0.6-mile loop and is on the city's infrastructure as it communicates with traffic signals and traffic congestion. AAA will donate $1 per passenger to the Las Vegas Victims' Fund after the Oct. 1 mass shooting. Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.

We lost our regular columnist, but we never stop trying to deliver you content. Daniil Miromanov will make his NHL debut in Whitecloud’s place. The Vegas Golden Knights will be without defenseman Zach Whitecloud, who is considered week-to-week with an upper-body injury. The Vegas Golden Knights are struggling right now. There have absolutely been bright spots through the first four games of the season, but there is no way to avoid the truth. Vegas suffered yet another injury; Zach Whitecloud left the game and did not return. The Vegas Golden Knights came up short in a 5-3 loss to the Edmonton Oilers Friday night at T-Mobile Arena.

On Wednesday night, the St. Louis Blues were on the road taking on the Mark Stone-less and Max Pacioretty-less Vegas Golden Knights. Early on, it appeared this one may get out of hand fast as the Blues came out flying. In this edition of Vegas Golden Knights News & Rumors, the team will be without Max Pacioretty for a good chunk of time after being injured in a game versus the Los Angeles Kings. Following the second game of the season for the Vegas Golden Knights, news came of an injury to forward Max Pacioretty. This came after the team had already lost captain Mark Stone in the second period of the tilt against the Los Angeles Kings. (Photo Credit: SinBin.vegas Photographer Brandon Andreasen) Since their arrival, Max Pacioretty and Mark Stone have been Vegas’ two statistical heavyweights. The Vegas Golden Knights have not had the best start to the 2021-22 NHL season. Vegas has been struck by the injury bug quite early in the season. This led to the Golden Knights seeing themselves play without key pieces to the lineup. Since their inaugural season in 2017-18, the Vegas Golden Knights have taken the NHL by storm. Given the fact they were an expansion team, most expected them to struggle in the early going. (Photo Credit: SinBin.vegas Photographer Brandon Andreasen) It was exactly 1,944 days since Las Vegas was awarded an NHL franchise. They’ve been named the Vegas Golden Knights for 1,824 of them. At least one-third of the Golden Knights’ top line will miss time. Thursday’s 6-2 loss against the Los Angeles Kings proved to be quite costly for the Vegas Golden Knights. (Photo Credit: SinBin.vegas Photographer Brandon Andreasen) Even before their trip to Los Angeles on Thursday night, the Golden Knights were fighting through a rash of injuries. (Photo Credit: SinBin.vegas Photographer Brandon Andreasen) The Golden Knights came into this season touting “the deepest forward group in team history.” Due to a rash of injuries, that depth will be put to the test quickly this year and may ultimately determine the fate of the Golden Knights’ fifth season. Thursday’s game against the Kings was a costly one for the Golden Knights. So long Arizona, hello Seattle. The Pacific Division is back, though it looks a bit different this season. The Seattle Kraken have officially arrived, and the Arizona Coyotes have shifted over to the Central Division. (Photo Credit: SinBin.vegas Photographer Brandon Andreasen) The Jack Eichel to Vegas rumors may have quieted down since training camp but new television partner ESPN continues to stoke the fire. A cool video from a show that took place prior to the start of Tuesday’s Las Vegas Golden Knights-Seattle Kraken game is going viral. The Kraken on Tuesday night played their first NHL game in franchise history. Justin Bieber can sing with the best of them, but the National Hockey League is employing his speaking voice. The undisputed favourite of the Pacific Division, the Knights do provide a certain foreboding irony. Despite their incredible string of success the air of invincibility has lifted and doubts begin to fester. Janmark missed practice Monday due to COVID protocols as Tuesday's season-opener looms. Robin Lehner made waves this past week when he took to Twitter and started blasting certain NHL organizations for distributing Ambient and medications to players without the proper diagnosis and medical prescriptions. Vegas first faces Philadelphia during the upcoming season on Dec. 10. The NHL’s commissioner was on Jeff Marek’s show on Sportsnet and weighed in on Robin Lehner’s tweets over the weekend. “We take his comments seriously It has been a weird couple of days for the NHL thanks to Vegas Golden Knights netminder Robin Lehner. This two-year deal will still leave Patrick a restricted free agent in 2023, but does mean he will be arbitration-eligible.

http://people.com/country/tim-mcgraw-faith-hill-support-gun-control-call-out-nra/,"The Nashville power couple ""want a safe country"" Tim McGraw and Faith Hill are calling for gun control. In a revealing new Billboard cover story, the Nashville power couple were moved to discuss the topic following the shooting at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas in October. “Look, I’m a bird hunter — I love to wing-shoot,” McGraw, 50, told the music magazine. “However, there is some common sense that’s necessary when it comes to gun control. They want to make it about the Second Amendment every time it’s brought up. It’s not about the Second Amendment.” McGraw and Hill, also 50, had several friends at the festival in Las Vegas, where a gunman — armed with military-grade weapons — opened fire on the crowd during Jason Aldean’s headlining set, killing 58 and injuring 527, making it the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. RELATED VIDEO: Carrie Underwood Tearfully Honors Late Country Stars & Vegas Victims With CMA In Memoriam “In reference to the tragedy in Las Vegas, we knew a lot of people there,” added Hill, who is on the road with her husband for their Soul2Soul Tour. “The doctors that [treated] the wounded, they saw wounds like you’d see in war. That’s not right. Military weapons should not be in the hands of civilians. It’s everyone’s responsibility, including the government and the National Rifle Association, to tell the truth. We all want a safe country.” RELATED — PEOPLE’s Call to Action: Contact Congress to Ask What Is Being Done to Stop the Epidemic of Gun Violence At the Country Music Association Awards Wednesday night, the couple — who are parents to daughters Gracie, 20, Maggie, 19, and Audrey, 15 — joined a slew of country A-listers to honor the Las Vegas victims, performing the Hootie and Blowfish classic “Hold My Hand.” Later in the evening, the show’s cohost Carrie Underwood further paid tribute, delivering a heart-wrenching rendition of “Softly and Tenderly” during the awards’ in memoriam. Underwood’s cohost, Brad Paisley, kicked off the show acknowledging the tragedy: “The way we see it, the best way to honor our fans is to play our music — loud and proud. Our music lifts people up and that’s what we’re here to do tonight. So this year’s show is dedicated to all of those we’ve lost and to all of those who are still healing. We love you and we will never forget you.” "
http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/489241556/0/news-opinion~Will-concealed-carry-stop-next-Sutherland-Springs-slaughter-in-guntoting-Texas/,"Like many Americans, I opened my Monday morning paper to find front page coverage of yet another mass shooting. Alongside the headline about the 25 parishioners and one unborn child killed by an armed intruder wearing black body armor and a Grim Reaper mask during a church service in Sutherland Springs, Tex., was a graphic depicting a timeline of the 10 deadliest shooting rampages in modern U.S. history. It was emphasized that half had occurred during the past five years. The graphic was silent on another noteworthy pattern. Beginning with the 1966 tower shooting at the University of Texas through Sunday’s bloodshed, three had taken place in the Lonestar State, where guns are as much a part of the local culture as barbeque and Friday night high school football. More: No, the Las Vegas attack wasn't a 'new normal' More: O.J. gets an early release, but the real guilty party is the fawning media It is not just among the list of very largest massacres that Texas is overrepresented. According to the USA TODAY database of mass murders since 2006, 8 of the 50 shooting rampages with at least six victims killed happened in Texas, more than in any other state. This share of incidents is nearly twice the Lone Star state's share of the U.S. population. Of course, the percentage of the nation’s gun owners living in Texas may be very different. In Texas, gun toting — both concealed and open carry — is commonplace. Except for such venues as schools, courtrooms and airports, as well as locations bearing prohibiting signage (e.g., the “no smoking” and “no smoking guns” alerts posted at certain government buildings), duly licensed Texans are free to exercise their Second Amendment rights broadly. Of course, Texas law wasn’t always so permissive when it comes to gun carrying. Rules were more restrictive in 1991 when the second Texas entry in the Top 10 timeline took place. Suzanna Gratia Hupp helplessly watched her parents die along with 21 others when a 35-year-old assailant drove his pickup truck through the plate glass window at the Luby’s Cafeteria in Killeen, and started firing with a pair of semiautomatic pistols. Hupp reached for her purse to get her gun, but quickly realized she didn’t have it with her as state law prohibited carrying guns concealed inside pocketbooks or clothing. Believing that she could have stopped the slaughter had guns been allowed in restaurants and other public places, this survivor became an outspoken and forceful advocate for gun rights. Hupp was later elected to the Texas legislature where she successfully pushed for expanded concealed carry provisions. Part of the impetus for concealed carry in public places was the 1999 shooting at a Fort Worth church in which an intruder killed seven worshipers. Unfortunately, the right to carry a loaded weapon in church did nothing to prevent Sunday’s tragedy. Of course, the heroism of a local resident who shot and chased Devin Kelley, the 26-year-old perpetrator, has been praised, and rightly so. Yet that act of bravery occurred after the assailant had fled the church and after the scores of victims had been killed or injured. More: On gun control, there's nothing and everything left to say: Jill Lawrence POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media What would have happened had someone inside the church have had the weaponry and wherewithal to fire back at Kelley is an open question. Whereas Kelley was prepared, including wearing a bullet resistant vest, the congregation was caught by surprise. Would someone have been able to intervene without adding to the bloodshed in some wild shootout? There are countless instances in which armed citizens have successfully defended themselves or others when confronted by an attacker wielding a gun. However, there are also cases, including dozens of mass shootings, in which a person licensed to carry a concealed weapon has used that firearm in an offensive, rather than defensive, manner. Personally, I wouldn’t feel more secure when eating at a restaurant or praying in a house of worship knowing that those around me were armed. Most gun owners are indeed trustworthy, but can we trust their aim and judgement in a setting far different than a practice shooting range? Plus, it can be difficult to distinguish the good guys with guns from the bad guy with a gun, especially if the assailant isn’t wearing some telltale mask.

Then, very often during earnings season, there is a nasty surprise for shareholders, as a company disappoints with sales, earnings or its outlook. So what is going on with industry? It might seem logical after a mass shooting to expect politicians on the federal or state level to begin negotiations on legislation to curb firearms sales in some way. Or one may also expect this if a gun-control advocate is elected. Either circumstance would be expected to lead to a short-term spike in sales of weapons and ammunition, which might make shareholders of the right companies a lot of money. But introducing a bill, negotiating it, passing it and having it signed by a president or governor is no easy task. Buying a stock on the expectation that legislation will lead the federal government or state governments to curb weapons sales is a very risky business. The pop of a gun-maker’s stock following a mass killing or election can be very short lived. Also read: Gun-maker stocks rally after mass shooting in Las Vegas. On Thursday, shares of Vista Outdoor Inc. 
        VSTO,
        +0.16%
       were down as much as 33%, after the company missed analysts’ consensus sales estimate for its fiscal second quarter and lowered its full-year outlook. The stock has now plunged 41% over the past three months, while the S&P 500 index 
        SPX,
        -0.11%
       has gained 3.8%. This makes for a particularly ugly 12-month chart: What’s going on here? We decided to take a broad look at publicly traded U.S. manufacturers of small firearms and related companies that make different types of weapons that consumers can buy, or that make accessories for firearms that are available to consumers. We prepared the list with help from FactSet and excluded major aerospace/defense government contractors and excluded stocks priced below a dollar and companies for which at least a year’s worth of financial data wasn’t available from FactSet. So the list is relatively short. Here are the companies, sorted by market capitalization as of the market close on Nov. 8: You can click on the tickers for more information about each company, including news, charts, price ratios and financial reports. Some of the longer-term returns are quite impressive, but you can see from this year’s returns, not to mention Thursday’s brutal action for Vista Outdoor, how volatile these stocks can be. Here’s the same group again, in the same order, showing changes in sales gross profit margins, for their most recently reported quarters: A company’s gross margin is its sales, less the cost of goods sold, divided by sales. It is a measure of the profitability of a company’s core business. It excludes overhead. For Vista Outdoor, you can see that not only were sales down significantly, the gross margin was declined. This could indicate a high level of discounting, which wasn’t enough to keep sales from dropping. So even though mass shootings continue to feed controversy over whether or not the U.S. needs a greater level of gun control, it is clear that for most of these companies, the recent sales trend hasn’t been very good. Maybe a lack of demand is the problem, believe it or not as Paul Brandus discussed last year. Yes, some investors have made a lot of money holding certain gun-maker stocks over the long term. But if you wish to jump in now, you had better do plenty of research and be ready to ride out volatility. Does bitcoin's value affect the dollar? Can it be used as a bartering tool? Does it provide the same function as the dollar, gold and, centuries ago, salt? Philip van Doorn writes the Deep Dive investing column for MarketWatch. Follow him on Twitter @PhilipvanDoorn.

http://www.denverpost.com/2017/11/09/sutherland-springs-shooting-church-demolition/,"Trending: SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas — The Texas church where more than two dozen people were killed by a gunman during Sunday services will be demolished, the pastor said. Pastor Frank Pomeroy told leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention earlier this week that it would be too painful to continue using First Baptist Church as a place of worship. Pomeroy discussed the state of the building with the denomination’s top executives, who traveled to the rural community in a show of support, a national Southern Baptist spokesman said. The pastor described the church as “too stark of a reminder” of the massacre, spokesman Sing Oldham said. No final decisions can be made without consulting congregants, but Pomeroy discussed turning the site into a memorial for the dead and putting up a new building on property the church owns, Oldham said. Charlene Uhl, mother of 16-year-old Haley Krueger, who died in the attack, agreed that the church should come down. There should still be a church “but not here,” she said Thursday as she visited a row of white crosses commemorating the victims in front of the building. She said her daughter attended worship services and a weekly Thursday night youth group meeting held by another victim, Karla Holcombe.

http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/nov/09/texas-church-was-attacked-will-be-demolished-pasto/,"SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas — The Texas church where more than two dozen people were killed by a gunman during Sunday services will be demolished, the pastor said. Pastor Frank Pomeroy told leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention earlier this week that it would be too painful to continue using First Baptist Church as a place of worship. Pomeroy discussed the state of the building with the denomination's top executives, who traveled to the rural community in a show of support, a national Southern Baptist spokesman said. The pastor described the church as ""too stark of a reminder"" of the massacre, spokesman Sing Oldham said. No final decisions can be made without consulting congregants, but Pomeroy discussed turning the site into a memorial for the dead and putting up a new building on property the church owns, Oldham said. Charlene Uhl, mother of 16-year-old Haley Krueger, who died in the attack, agreed that the church should come down. There should still be a church ""but not here,"" she said Thursday as she visited a row of white crosses commemorating the victims in front of the building. She said her daughter attended worship services and a weekly Thursday night youth group meeting held by another victim, Karla Holcombe. Jeannie Brown, visiting from Indiana, stopped at the site with her daughter, who used to live in Sutherland Springs but left decades ago for San Antonio.

[+] Exchange (L) and the exchange rate for the yen against the US dollar (R) in Tokyo on September 12, 2017. Tokyo stocks opened higher September 12 following a market rally on Wall Street on receding worries about North Korea and Hurricane Irma. KAZUHIRO NOGI/AFP/Getty Images North Korea’s foreign minister recently accused Trump of having “lit the wick of war” and said that North Korea is ready to “settle the final score with a hail of fire.” Under Kim Jong Un, North Korea has dramatically accelerated its nuclear weapon and missile testing program. Despite these rising tensions, the MSCI Korea Index has gained over 30 percent this year, double the return of the global MSCI All Country World Index. In the face of such contradictions, how should long-term investors manage political risks? Headlines alone do not usually lead to sustained market declines. The past few weeks have seen no shortage of both natural and manufactured disasters, from devastating hurricanes to the largest mass shooting in U.S. history. Yet the global stock market, as represented by the MSCI All Country World Index, continued to rise. Even after the 9/11 attacks of 2001, the global market actually went up by 1.4 percent over the following month. Staying in cash or investing in gold because of fear and “caution” can lead investors to miss out on the potential for significant returns. Global stock markets are mostly driven by underlying economic growth. When global economic growth is strong, jobs are plentiful, consumers have more discretionary income to spend on goods and services, and company revenue and earnings growth increases. Higher earnings and the prospect of future earnings growth support company valuations.  It is important to follow fundamentals closely and avoid investing based on the latest headlines. Sophisticated investors, such as family offices, focus first on ensuring that they have the right strategic risk targets for their portfolios. This should be based on the investor’s situation and needs and not on the current market outlook. A portfolio with more bonds will suffer much less of a drawdown during market crashes. A portfolio with 80 percent in bonds and 20 percent in stocks was only down 8 percent at the most severe point during the 2007 – 2009 crisis, but a portfolio that was 100 percent invested in stocks sustained losses of over 50 percent during the same time period. But over the long term, the returns of a highly defensive portfolio will be significantly lower than a more aggressive equity-focused one. Family office investors know there are always reasons to not invest. Risks that are evident in media headlines are often not the cause of market declines. Traditionally only truly unforeseeable disasters such as the March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan or the April 20, 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill can have a significant market impact. Long-term investors are best served by using the baseline risk level of their portfolios as defense against political shocks and other short-term market disruptions. Tactically reducing risk each time headlines are negative will lead to a sub-optimal, almost permanently under-risked portfolio.

All rights reserved. BILLBOARD is a registered trademark of Billboard IP Holdings, LLC Everytown for Gun Safety held its fifth annual Brooklyn Bridge March for Gun Sense on June 3. After the Oct. 1 mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas, gun-violence-prevention advocacy organization Everytown for Gun Safety redoubled its efforts with the music community to protect concertgoers. A couple of weeks later, it unveiled a video featuring such artists as Sheryl Crow, Jack Antonoff, Moby and TV on the Radio’s Tunde Adebimpe for a campaign to drive 1 million calls to Congress to reject legislation that would roll back gun-silencer safety laws. Now, says Crow, who works with the nonprofit group, it’s time for more of her fellow musicians to step up. “Where artists are concerned, the silence is deafening,” says the Nashville-based singer. “I’ve been very disappointed to see that.” “People want to know they can be safe whether it’s dancing with their friends at a club or dancing at a music festival,” adds ETFGS spokesperson Valerie Jean-Charles. “These should not be places where people should worry about the threat of gun violence.” At the 2017 Billboard Touring Conference and Awards at the Montage in Beverly Hills on Nov. 14, Billboard will present Everytown with its Humanitarian Award, while honoring the family of a victim killed at the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Fla., in 2016. Everytown research director Sarah Tofte will lead a concert-safety discussion with panelists including Warped Tour founder Kevin Lyman. Founded in 2014, Everytown has amassed over 4 million members, approaching the National Rifle Association’s 5 million, and has worked to make concerts safer primarily through political advocacy, collecting signatures to change a gun-sales regulation (at Bonnaroo in 2016) and partnering with Billboard to pen an open letter to Congress urging gun control after the Pulse shooting. Crow aligned herself with ETFGS because of its wide reach, including Moms Demand Action chapters in all 50 states. “This [violence] is happening in every town, Sandy Hook, the church in Charleston, S.C., It’s happening in our communities,” she says. “This organization is profound in being able to educate and motivate people to be involved.” With more musicians coming on board, Jean-Charles believes that ETFGS can even eventually enlist country artists to join its 140 artist-strong Everytown Creative Council, despite the genre’s close alignment with the NRA. “I think we’ll be able to crack that [genre] one day just as we were able to show we can go toe-to-toe with the NRA,” she says. “Americans are tired of having another mass shooting in their vocabulary and this movement is going to grow more diverse as we go on.” Crow, who lives in Nashville, stresses that artists making music in all formats need to put aside any concerns about alienating fans. “For artists not to stand up and give voice to this really important topic at this moment in our evolution is showing a sign of weakness and also the belief that music is commerce and music is deeper than commerce,” she says. “You are not threatening your fan base by saying we need to have some kind of regulation that looks at gun safety. If artists aren’t doing that, they’re drinking the Kool-Aid that they’re going to lose fans [by speaking out.]” This article originally appeared in the Nov. 18 issue of Billboard.

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-mass-shooting-prayer_us_5a014f1fe4b07eb51181be67?utm_hp_ref=paul-ryan,"Overnight Editor, HuffPost Religion Reporter, HuffPost House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is defending his call for prayers after a gunman killed 26 people in a Texas church on Sunday. Ryan and other politicians have been criticized for offering thoughts and prayers instead of legislative action to reduce gun violence. But on Monday night, Ryan told Fox News host Laura Ingraham: “It’s disappointing, it’s sad, and this is what you’ll get from the far secular left. People who do not have faith don’t understand faith, I guess I’d have to say. And it is the right thing to do is to pray in moments like this, because you know what? Prayer works. And I know you believe that, and I believe that and when you hear the secular left doing this thing, it’s no wonder you have so much polarization and disunity in this country when people think like that.” Sending “thoughts and prayers” on social media has become a way for both religious and secular people to grieve after national tragedies. For religious people in particular, prayer is an important form of worship and a way to ask God for guidance and intervention. Especially after great personal sorrow, faith helps people to cling to hope. The Rev. Frank Pomeroy, pastor of First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, lost his 14-year-old daughter and at least 25 other church members in Sunday’s mass shooting. He told reporters on Monday that he has decided to “lean into the Lord.” “I don’t understand, but I know my God does,” Pomeroy said. But it is one thing for Pomeroy to lean into his faith after the shooting at his church, and something completely different for Ryan to offer prayers without action ― especially after reportedly receiving more than $170,000 in contributions from gun rights groups in 2016. In a statement, Bishops United Against Gun Violence, a group representing more than 70 Episcopal bishops, said that Christians are called to pray after the tragic shooting in Texas, but that prayer should also be accompanied by deep introspection about “whether we are complicit in the evils we deplore.” “In the wake of the heartbreaking shooting at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, we find ourselves both calling people to prayer, and wishing that the word did not come so readily to the lips of elected leaders who are quick to speak, but take no action on behalf of public safety,” the bishops said. “Each of us has a role to play in our repentance. Elected representatives bear the responsibility of passing legislation that protects our citizenry. If our representatives are not up to this responsibility, we must replace them. In the meantime, however, we ask that in honor of our many murdered dead, elected leaders who behave as though successive episode of mass slaughter are simply the price our nation pays for freedom stop the reflexive and corrosive repetition of the phrase ‘thoughts and prayers.’” “One does not offer prayers in lieu of demonstrating political courage, but rather in preparation.” See Ryan and Ingraham’s full discussion in the clip above.

She said her daughter attended worship services and a weekly Thursday night youth group meeting held by another victim, Karla Holcombe. Jeannie Brown, visiting from Indiana, stopped at the site with her daughter, who used to live in Sutherland Springs but left decades ago for San Antonio. Asked whether the church should be destroyed, Brown said: ""Yes. Who would want to go back in there? But then if it is destroyed, does that mean he (the gunman) won?"" Other sites of mass shootings have been torn down, including Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, where a gunman killed 20 children and six adults in December 2012. A new school was built elsewhere. A one-room Amish schoolhouse near Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was torn down in 2006, 10 days after an assailant took children hostage and shot and killed five girls ages 6 to 13. The previous site of the school is now a pasture. A nearly identical schoolhouse with a security fence was erected nearby and named New Hope School. The father of the gunman broke the family's silence and said his relatives are grieving. Michael Kelley spoke to ABC News on Wednesday from his home in New Braunfels, about 35 miles (55 kilometers) north of Sutherland Springs. He said he does not want the ""media circus"" surrounding the attack by Devin Patrick Kelley to destroy ""our lives, our grandchildren's lives."" A motive remains unclear, but the younger Kelley appears to have targeted the church because it was attended by his wife's family. He died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after being shot and chased by two residents when he was leaving the church, authorities said. The gunman shot and killed 25 people at the church. Authorities have put the official toll at 26, because one of the victims was pregnant. All the victims died at the scene, except for one child who died at a hospital. Eleven people remained hospitalized Thursday with wounds they suffered in the attack. Associated Press Religion Writer Rachel Zoll in New York contributed to this report.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/L_QosA0hWW0/,"The motive of the shooter who took 26 lives, injured 20 more and devastated a community by spraying semi-automatic gunfire into a small church sanctuary seemed baffling. We were told by experts that we may never learn what fueled his murderous contempt for people he didn’t know — even babies, pregnant moms and grandparent-types. I wasn’t so mystified. After 35 years as an evangelical minister, I suspected it might be a grudge against somebody in the church — the pastor, an usher he perceived as disrespectful or, more likely, a relative sitting in the pews. Now we know it was the latter, specifically a mother-in-law he had threatened just hours before he committed his unspeakable act. My hunch proved to be more a keen sense of the obvious, because early in my pastoral work I had seen what domestic violence looks like. I was a youth pastor in a small suburban church when a woman came to the building in great distress. The senior pastor wasn’t in, so she searched me out. She had a black eye and scrapes on her face. Sobbing and trembling, she told me her husband did it and that he had threatened to kill her while waving his gun in her face. I called the police, and they arrested her assailant, but the disturbing encounter never left me. I would see the phenomenon and hear of it again and again, in the many churches I would later travel through as an itinerant preacher. Those experiences taught me just how much a church becomes an extension of the families that make up its congregation, along with the worst dysfunctions those families harbor. In a household where there is domestic violence, the presence of a firearm makes it far more likely a victim will die. A gun also means there will often be more than one death, as other family members, friends or simply house guests, are taken out in a furious barrage of bullets. In fact, more than half of mass shootings — in which there are four or more gunshot victims, not counting the perpetrator — occur as an act of domestic violence. In Sutherland Springs, the perfect storm of all these factors traveled outside the home of a man prosecuted and convicted of assaulting his first wife and their child, and into a small congregation that one member described as “a close-knit family.” First Baptist Church, an intimate and loving collection of souls, became the unwitting extension of a toxic family drama that included a history of domestic violence against the perpetrator’s wife and step-child serious enough to merit a criminal conviction and imprisonment. When that first marriage ended in divorce and he married again, a grievance against his second wife’s mother triggered what Texas Governor Greg Abbott indicated was the worst mass shooting in that state’s history. The abuser, whose second wife had worked at the church and whose in-laws worshiped there, dressed in protective battle gear, carried three guns — all semi-automatic and one a military-grade rifle with an extended magazine — and consummated his rage in a grotesque and grandiose fusillade that took the life of his wife’s grandmother among all his other victims. The shooting stunned the church world I inhabit. Some of my conservative evangelical colleagues called for arming whole congregations as a way to ward off would-be attackers. But there’s a grave danger in doing so. Churches are, indeed, families — some large, some small. In fact, Baptists and other evangelicals often refer to their congregations as a “family of God.” As with all families, there is good and bad to church-family life. Just as in any home, relationships in God’s house often experience tension, stress, grudges, offenses and even, in the rare instance, physical confrontation. Introduce a bunch of guns into God’s house — perhaps carried mostly by well-meaning and responsible volunteers, but a few possibly carried by troubled souls nursing angry resentment or undergoing emotional distress or suffering mental illness, and the same noxious, deadly outcomes can threaten the wider “family of God.” According to church shooting researcher Dallas Drake, half of all attackers are known to the church, and 23% of all incidences involved intimate partners; 17% of all perpetrators felt rejected by the congregation, and 12% were mentally ill. There is a better and far less risky way to protect God’s house — and every house — from deadly violence: stop known domestic abusers from ever getting their hands on the guns that make their fury so fatal. Responsible reporting of criminal histories; sharing of local, state and federal databases; streamlining the administrative process for background checks; closing gun sale loopholes; and rewarding gun dealers who refuse to sell to suspicious and banned buyers would go a long way in preventing catastrophes like the one in Texas that so sickened every reasonable American. A final and somber lesson that can be learned from this sorrowful moment for First Baptist and the people of Sutherland Springs is that domestic violence and mass shootings are not just tragic and criminal, they are supremely immoral. Murder inside a church sanctuary is as tragic and criminal as it is anywhere else, but the sacred setting affords us a different perspective on such wanton homicide. Just a few weeks before the deadly visitation to First Baptist, a lay leader at the pulpit referred to another mass shooting, in Las Vegas, as “wicked.” While the criminal justice system deals with the legal aspects of domestic violence and mass shootings, and elected officials deal with their political aspects, churches deal with the moral, ethical and spiritual dimensions of such tragedies. Pastors and their congregations have something unique to offer to the urgent and very necessary national discussion we must have on domestic violence and mass shootings: In the end, it’s not simply doing what is legal or politically expedient that matters, but doing what is good and right.

Comedian and filmmaker Louis C.K. allegedly masturbated — or tried to — in front of five women, The New York Times reported. Four woman identified by name and a fifth who spoke anonymously recount similar stories about C.K. dating back more than a decade. Republican Senate nominee Roy Moore of Alabama also faced allegations that he groped, kissed or pursued four women when they were teenagers, The Washington Post reported. One woman, Leigh Corfman, said she was 14 in 1979 when Moore, then 32 and an assistant district attorney, undressed her, groped her and had her touch him. Senate Republicans called on Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations were true. Moore's campaign dismissed the women's claims as ""fake news"" and ""garbage."" Some teenagers are anonymously posting horrible things about themselves online. Then they publicly respond to those “cyberbullies.” About 6% of those age 12 through 17 have bullied themselves digitally, according to research by Sameer Hinduja, a professor of criminology at Florida Atlantic University and co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center. The issue was brought to researchers' attention by the suicide of Hannah Smith, 14, from Leicestershire, England, who hanged herself after months of apparent online harassment stemming from messages originating from her computer. Researchers are concerned digital self-harm could be a gateway for future suicide attempts at time teen suicide rates are climbing. TripAdvisor CEO Steve Kaufer told the world the company apologized to a woman for deleting her post detailing her rape at a Mexican resort. One problem: It didn’t. While the company’s PR folks tried to save face, nobody at the company actually called Kristie Love, whose post alleged she’d been raped by a security guard. Kaufer did eventually call her, but it was too little, too late. At least two other women reported being assaulted at the same resort after Love’s warning had been removed. And it’s not just Love, more than a dozen have said their horrific traveling experiences have been blocked by TripAdvisor. More and more LGBTQ characters grace our TV screens, even as women and people of color saw a dip in representation.

The skinny on the Kardashian diet Have you noticed how high-key people are following the ketogenic diet?The high-fat, low-carb diet has recently caught the interest of such celebrities as Kourtney Kardashian, Megan Fox and Mick Jagger. People on keto are eating lots of different kinds of fat (think: butter, mayonnaise and whipped cream). It’s low carb, but high fat. So, “your body will break down the fat as the primary fuel source,"" said Eric Kossoff, director of the Child Neurology Residency Program at Johns Hopkins. It’s probably not a good idea to go on the diet unless there are medical reasons to do so (like epilepsy), experts say. Devin Kelley’s history of domestic violence proved to be a precursor to Sunday’s mass shooting at a Texas church, now set to be demolished. Domestic violence is often a trait shared by U.S. mass shooters, who experts say exert violence behind closed doors before taking it into public spaces.

			November 9, 2017 5:49 pm ET School went on as scheduled this week at Floresville (Texas) High, but there are too many reminders of tragedy for everything to be business as usual, even when Floresville’s football team plays for the district title on Friday. Floresville is located 15 minutes from the Sutherland Springs Baptist Church, where 26 people were killed and 20 wounded by a gunman during church services Sunday in the deadliest Texas mass shooting ever. One of those killed was Tara McNulty, the mother of Floresville sophomore track athlete and cross country runner Hailey McNulty. Hailey and her brother James were wounded in the attack. A GoFundMe account set up for funeral and medical expenses for the McNulty family had raised $16,740 by Thursday afternoon. Several Floresville bus routes were re-routed around the site of the shooting. On Monday, grief counselors were brought into the school.

https://www.stripes.com/news/us/floodgates-open-for-trump-s-pentagon-nominees-1.497190,"WASHINGTON – Even as Sen. John McCain began his battle against brain cancer in July, the Arizona Republican and powerful chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee was quietly waging another kind of war. That month, President Donald Trump’s Pentagon nominees going before McCain’s committee came to a screeching halt, triggering a more than 3-month drought for the effort. The committee didn’t hear from another slate of new candidates for top military posts until this month. McCain would later reveal he was battling the Pentagon and the administration for more transparency on a slew of military issues, and was holding the line on nominees facing potential conflicts of interest because of defense industry backgrounds. “The reason these nominations have not been acted on as rapidly as possible is because failures of communication between this committee and the Pentagon, which is a shame, since I have known them for many, many years,” McCain told a new group of Pentagon nominees during a Nov. 2 hearing – the first such meeting since July. But “we intend to move your nominations through as soon as possible. We need you to get to work.” In early October, McCain said he was holding Pentagon nominations hostage as a result of a disconnect between Congress and Pentagon administration officials. McCain railed that the officials, including longtime friend and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, were not forthcoming on several major concerns, including two deadly Navy ship collisions this summer, a change in war strategy in Afghanistan under loosened rules of engagement and the ambush last month in Niger that killed four American soldiers. By late October, the committee saw a turn of events with several public and closed hearings on the Navy ship collisions, war strategy and Niger. A threat of a McCain subpoena on the Niger ambush triggered a personal Capitol Hill visit among Mattis, McCain and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. “The war is morphing,” Graham said after the Mattis meeting. McCain and other Armed Services Committee members subsequently said they were pleased with the new level of cooperation from the Pentagon and would lift the holds. “We are moving this process along,” McCain said during the most recent nominations hearing Thursday. “We will be holding hearings and hopefully moving forward with this as quickly as possible.” The committee advanced three additional nominations to the Senate floor as it heard from four more Trump nominees. The Senate committee approved by voice vote Robert Behler to be director of operational test and evaluation, Thomas Modly to serve as undersecretary of the Navy and James Geurts to be assistant secretary of the Navy for research, development and acquisition. This month, the Armed Services Committee is poised to hear from 17 nominees – close to the same number who testified before the panel in the first seven months of Trump’s presidency. By November, the administration had filled 17 of 54 primary Pentagon senior politically appointed positions, according to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan Washington think tank. The administration has officially nominated 24 to Pentagon posts, but has yet to name 13 nominees for other vacant position. But plenty of key positions remain without named candidates. Key vacancies include the Pentagon’s top lawyer, an inspector general and assistant secretary for manpower and reserve affairs. At this point in the George W. Bush administration, 40 of these key positions had been filled, while Obama had filled 28, the Partnership for Public Service said. There have been additional challenges for the Trump nominees. McCain also said that a revolving door issue between the Pentagon and the defense industry was compounding concerns of nominee approvals. Last week, the committee approved former Raytheon lobbyist Mark Esper as Army Secretary – poised to gain the title – finishing up the top civilian spots for each service department. He will also mark the last industry executive to advance as a Pentagon nominee, McCain has warned. “I would be remiss if I did not reiterate my concerns about the number of nominees from defense industry filling out the leadership ranks at the Department of Defense,” McCain told Esper during his nomination hearing. “My reservations grew out of early consultations I had with the [Trump] administration about potential nominees, including yours and a handful of others. It was then that I decided I couldn’t support further nominees with that background.” The process hasn’t been a walk in the park for other nominees either. Officially, three nominated individuals have failed the process, with at least one candidate who withdrew early in the process. Trump’s first two picks for Army secretary failed. His first pick for Navy secretary also failed. On Thursday, the committee passed for now on approving Dr. Dean Winslow to be Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs. A retired Air Force colonel, Winslow made controversial comments as he testified on Tuesday about guns and abortion that appeared out of line with the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers. A committee staff member said McCain withheld a vote on Winslow’s nomination while members sought answers to additional questions concerning his comments. During testimony, Winslow voiced support for the use of “therapeutic abortions” if the mother’s life is endangered. The military has long been banned from providing abortions in nearly all cases. Winslow also went on to express horror that U.S. gun laws allow citizens to legally acquire military-inspired, semiautomatic rifles such as the weapon used in a mass shooting in a Texas church that left 25 people dead, including a pregnant woman, earlier this month. The killer should have been barred from owning a firearm after he was convicted of assaulting his wife and her baby in 2012 and was kicked out of the Air Force. “I may get in trouble with other members of the committee,” Winslow said, but “how insane it is that in the United States of America, a civilian can go out and buy a semiautomatic assault rifle like an AR-15?” McCain was obviously not pleased. “Dr. Winslow,” he interjected, “I don’t think that’s your area of responsibility or expertise.” grisales.claudia@stripes.com Twitter: @cgrisales dickstein.corey@stripes.com Twitter: @CDicksteinDC Sign-up to receive a daily email of today’s top military news stories from Stars and Stripes and top news outlets

Attackers are linked by frequent mental health problems – and access to guns Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.16 BST While nearly anything, including human hands, may be used to kill, the gun is created for the specific purpose of killing a living creature. Gun-love can be akin to non-chemical addictions like gambling or hoarding, either of which can have devastating effects, mainly economic, but murder, suicide, accidental death, and mass shootings result only from guns.  The definition of “mass shootings” varies, but is generally defined by four or more deaths in one location by a lone gunman or in a few cases, such as Columbine and San Bernardino, two. Although each of these mass killings is idiosyncratic, they often share many features, including but not limited to the most obvious, which bears repeating – their use of guns. There were 127 mass shootings with 874 victims in the United States between 1966 and 2016, an average of seven deaths in each. Nearly all of them were carried out by white men. Only three of the 130 shooters were women. If domestic shootings are included – meaning a man shooting his partner, often including their children and other relatives – the number of mass shootings rises dramatically. A New York Times report, titled How Often Do Mass Shootings Occur? On Average, Every Day, Records Show, uses the measure of four or more wounded, and includes domestic shootings. More than two-thirds took place in private residences and included “a current or former intimate partner or family member of the attacker”. Half of all victims were women. Investigative journalist Jane Mayer has further linked domestic violence and many non-domestic mass shootings. Shortly after the June 2017 shooting that wounded House majority whip Steve Scalise and four others, it was learned that the shooter, James Hodgkinson, had a history of domestic violence. The shooter in the 2015 Planned Parenthood Clinic attack had an arrest record of rape and sexual violence. Mayer writes: “Many domestic-violence suspects, like Hodgkinson, are arrested only to have the charges dropped later, which leaves them armed and dangerous. The National Rifle Association and its allies have successfully argued that a mere arrest on domestic-violence charges … is not sufficient reason to deprive a citizen of his right to bear arms.” Devin Patrick Kelley, the former US air force serviceman who killed at least 26 people and injured another 20 in a Texas church this past Sunday morning, had been court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and stepson. He was able to purchase his murder weapons even though, since 1996, federal law has banned people with domestic violence convictions from owning guns. Some mass shootings have taken aim at women simply because they are women. On 16 October 1991, a 35-year-old civilian named George Jo Hennard drove his pickup truck into the plate glass window of Luby’s Cafeteria in Killeen, Texas – home to the enormous Fort Hood army base – while some 150 patrons were having dinner. Armed with a Glock 17 and a Ruger P89, he then jumped out of his vehicle and into the restaurant yelling: “All women of Killeen and Belton are vipers!” Then he began shooting, killing 23 people, 14 of them women whom he appeared to be targeting, yelling “bitch!” as he shot. The violence ended when he shot himself. Like Sunday’s massacre, the first notable mass shooting was carried out by a white man with a military background who lived in Texas, where there is an unbridled gun culture. Some experts have also argued that this attack, in 1966, may have been a model for Stephen Craig Paddock, the shooter who murdered 58 people in Las Vegas this October. The University of Texas (UT) mass shooting is often not counted among lists of such killings, because there were no more that fit the definition until 1982, when they began with some regularity. But, in retrospect, the 1966 attack was no anomaly – more like a comet that would return. Former marine sniper and UT engineering student Charles Whitman shot and killed 14 people and wounded another 32 while perched for 90 minutes on top of the 27-story clock tower on the University of Texas, Austin, campus, before he was killed by police. Early that morning, he had strangled his mother to death and murdered his wife by stabbing her in the heart as she slept. He later explained that he didn’t want them to be ashamed of him and suffer for his actions. Whitman had been in the Marine Corps, but did not serve in combat and completed his service before US troops were deployed to Vietnam. However, he had suffered a head injury from a Jeep accident during his service. Whitman kept a detailed journal in the months before the shootings, recording his severe headaches and feelings of rage and his failure to get help from multiple doctors he consulted and the ineffectiveness of the medications they prescribed. In the autopsy of his body, doctors discovered a pecan-sized tumor in his brain that could have caused his derangement. In the wake of the tragedy, rather than taking action to improve preventive healthcare at the university or the state, authorities created the first Swat team, soon to be replicated in nearly every police force in the country. In January 2016, a new Texas law went into effect allowing handgun permit holders, who had been required to conceal their weapons, to carry handguns openly except not on public or private university or college campuses. Then, on 1 August 2016, on the 50th anniversary of the University of Texas tower shooting massacre, the legislature included public university campuses in the right to openly carry handguns. “Especially among Texas politicians, there’s a locker-room lust for weaponry that belies noble-sounding proclamations about self-protection and Second Amendment rights,” the writer Lawrence Wright, himself a Texan, has written. “In 2010, Governor Perry boasted of killing with a single shot a coyote that was menacing his daughter’s Labrador. Perry was jogging at the time, but naturally he was packing heat: a .380 Ruger. The gun’s manufacturer promptly issued a Coyote Special edition of the gun, which comes in a box labelled ‘for sale to Texans only’.” James Oliver Huberty was born and lived most of his life in Ohio. A serial failure at starting a business, he moved to Tijuana, Mexico, then San Ysidro, California, in 1983. Back in Ohio, he had been a dedicated survivalist, accumulating an arsenal and also hoarding food and other survival necessities, all of which he took along in the move west. He believed government regulations had caused his business failures and that international bankers controlled the Federal Reserve, with communist dominance everywhere, economic collapse and nuclear war imminent. (These were the Reagan years.) Guns are a sign of potency for many white Americans who otherwise feel they have been wrongly disempowered or disenfranchised, whether by the government, by an employer or colleagues, or by members of other social, political or ethnic groups. The mass shooting that Huberty carried out in a McDonald’s in San Ysidro, in 1984, was the largest up to that time. It left 22 dead, including the shooter, and 19 wounded; one of the victims was pregnant, and another victim was an eight-month-old baby. San Ysidro is inside the United States, on the border across from Tijuana, Mexico, but 90% of its population is composed of people of Mexican descent; nearly all the shooting victims were. Huberty, a 41-year-old Anglo-American, was armed with a shotgun and an Uzi. After 78 minutes of his killing spree, with at least 245 rounds fired, a Swat team moved in and shot him. Nearly 30% of all mass shootings that have resulted in multiple deaths have occurred in workplaces, usually by an angry former employee. The first workplace shooting that resulted in a large death toll took place in Edmond, Oklahoma, a small college town north of Oklahoma City. In August 1986, a 44-year-old former marine and part-time US Postal Service worker, after receiving a negative work review, stormed into the town’s small, busy post office. Dressed as if for work in his mail carrier’s uniform and carrying three handguns in his mailbag, he killed 14 and wounded six before shooting himself. In the decade before, there had been five other post office shootings by former or current workers, with one or two fatalities. More followed almost annually, giving rise in the early 1990s to the grim term “going postal”. Dozens of other workplace shootings have taken place – in office buildings, strip malls, factories, night clubs, restaurants, military bases, and universities (employee-related, in addition to the separate category of “school shootings”, targeting students) during the time period of mass shootings, from the late 1980s on. Thirteen per cent of mass shootings have occurred in schools. Not the first but the most shocking one up to that time was the 1999 Columbine high school shootings by students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold that took 13 lives – 12 students and a teacher. The apparently normal upper-middle-class families of the two high school students seemed an unlikely setting to produce such violence under their noses, without their noticing anything awry about their sons. The shooting rampage inside the school took place over several hours, while most students escaped. Only after the sound of gunfire ceased did police storm the building, where they found the two killers had shot themselves. Certainly there had been many shootings in schools from the early 1800s to the 1966 Texas tower massacre, but none had been mass shootings with multiple victims. There were dozens of school shooting incidents between the 1966 UT tower shooting and 1989, but they began with troubling frequency and became more deadly in the 1990s, culminating in Columbine at the end of the millennium. After 2000, the number of school shootings increased from single digits to double digits by 2005, with three catastrophic ones, none of which fit the alleged “patterns” that had been theorized – mainly about possible reactions to bullying –bringing into question whether any of them did. None was more baffling and tragic than the December 2012 mass shooting at the elementary school in Newton, Connecticut, where 20-year old Adam Lanza slaughtered 20 first-graders along with six adult school personnel before ending his own life. Children and babies had been killed in past mass shootings, but not specifically targeted, as at Sandy Hook. Earlier, Lanza had shot and killed his mother while she slept in the home they shared. The mother, Nancy Lanza, was a gun hoarder and avid recreational shooter. Because her son had Asperger’s syndrome, he was mostly home-schooled and had little social life, and she found that he enjoyed going with her to the shooting range, which she apparently considered appropriate therapy. She obviously had no fear of possible violence from the son, as she kept her multiple high-powered firearms and ammunition in the house where they both lived. On 16 April 2007, a new record was set for mass shootings, with 32 dead and 23 wounded on the Virginia Tech University campus in Blacksburg, Virginia. The shooter was 23-year-old senior Seung-Hui Cho, using Glock 19 and Walther P22 pistols, and stocked with four hundred rounds of ammunition. The other national news coming from Virginia that spring was eclipsed by the shooting –the 18-month celebration of the founding of the first British colony of the 13 that followed over the next 125 years. The Virginia Tech shootings were described in 2007 as the worst “mass killing”, the “worst massacre”, in US history. Descendants of massacred indigenous ancestors took exception to that designation. Lakota Joan Redfern expressed the reaction of many, saying: “To say the Virginia shooting is the worst in all of US history is to pour salt on old wounds. It means erasing and forgetting all of our ancestors who were killed in the past.” The Virginia Tech shooter, born in South Korea and brought to the United States by his parents at eight, was himself a child of colonial war: the US war in Korea and the continued presence of tens of thousands of heavily armed US troops on the Korean peninsula. He had been diagnosed as depressed but was likely bipolar. He appeared to be overwhelmed by wealthy, white students, who made up 75% of the undergraduate student body. In the videotaped manifesto Cho made and sent to the press before his rampage, he called his fellow students “sadistic snobs” and further said: “You have never felt a single ounce of pain your whole life. Did you want to inject as much misery in our lives as you can just because you can? You had everything you wanted. Your Mercedes wasn’t enough, you brats. Your golden necklaces weren’t enough, you snobs. Your trust fund wasn’t enough. Your vodka and cognac weren’t enough. All your debaucheries weren’t enough. Those weren’t enough to fulfill your hedonistic needs. You had everything.” On Wednesday evening, 17 June 2015, perhaps the most historically symbolic, specifically targeted, and racially motivated mass shooting took place in Charleston, South Carolina. The site of the slaughter of nine people was a church. For evangelical Protestant congregations in the United States, Wednesday evening is prayer meeting and Bible reading in gatherings of the most dedicatedly faithful. But this was a very specific Protestant church, the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal (AME) church of Charleston – “Mother Emanuel” – the oldest historically black church in North America, and a historical site of slave resistance. Later explaining that he sought to ignite a race war by his vile deed, 21-year-old Dylann Roof, who is white, arrived at the Wednesday prayer meeting and was welcomed by the 12 African American attendees, including the nationally and internationally known and respected AME senior pastor, who was also a South Carolina state senator, Clementa C Pinckney. After an hour of Bible study, Roof pulled out a Glock 41, and a .45 caliber pistol, both loaded with hollow-point bullets, reloading five times, killing all but three people present. He may have been expecting a larger attendance as he was carrying eight magazines filled with bullets. Roof fled the bloody scene and was later apprehended and arrested. The date he had chosen to hatch his plan was obviously premeditated – it was the 193rd anniversary of a slave revolt planned by the founder of Mother Emanuel. Images circulated on social media quickly made clear that Roof was a white nationalist. First there was his manifesto – loaded with slurs against African Americans, Jews, Latinos, and Asians – that claimed he had become “racially aware” following the shooting of Trayvon Martin in 2012. He said that while searching the web to learn about the case, he concluded that the killer George Zimmerman was right; what convinced him was the information he came upon at white nationalist websites and chatrooms. Then there was Orlando. Outdoing all the mass shootings of this type that had preceded it, 49 were killed and 53 wounded. The shooter, Omar Mateen, a 29-year old US citizen of Afghani Pashtun descent, used a SIG MCX semi-automatic rifle and a 9mm Glock 17. Like Cho, he was at war with his peers. His victims were from the LGBTQ community, most of the fatalities that night being of Puerto Rican descent; it was Latino night at the Pulse gay nightclub on 12 June 2016. Mateen had frequented the club. This was the second mass shooting of civilians directly associated with ongoing US wars. Mateen, a Sunni Muslim, had sworn loyalty to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (Isis), the most recent terrorist jihadist group to rise out of US wars in the Middle East. Six months earlier, Syed Riz-wan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, a married couple who were legal immigrants from Pakistan, interrupted a holiday party at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, where Farook was an employee. They pulled out automatic weapons, firing randomly, it appeared, killing 14 and injuring 22. Quickly, the FBI traced the terror attack back to before their immigration to the US and their allegiance to the Islamic State terror organization that the US is at war with in Iraq. On Sunday evening, 1 October 2017, records were broken again for the number of people killed during a mass shooting perpetrated by a single gunman. On that occasion, 64-year-old Stephen Craig Paddock shot to death 59 people, including himself, with nearly 500 hospitalized with injuries resulting from the incident. Paddock was born in Iowa and had lived in Florida, Texas and an upscale retirement community in Mesquite, Nevada, near the Arizona and Utah borders. Four days before his massacre-suicide, Paddock checked into a 32nd-floor suite at the luxury Mandalay Bay casino-hotel in Las Vegas. Having been a high-rolling professional gambler at the hotel for some time, Paddock was familiar to the staff, who comped him the expensive suite as a perk for gambling on their premises. Under the lax scrutiny of “what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas”, Paddock managed to stockpile his room with 22 high-powered scoped rifles ranging in size from .308 to .223 caliber, two tripods, and thousands of rounds of ammunition. Just after 10pm that Sunday night, Paddock broke two windows in the suite and began firing semiautomatic weapons that had been fitted with a “bump stock” device that allowed him to increase the speed he could fire bullets into the crowd. His target was a packed, shoulder-to-shoulder crowd of 22,000 people enjoying the final set of a country music festival taking place in the open air across from his hotel. Paddock attacked the audience with 10 long minutes of non-stop shooting. Paddock owned multiple properties in Nevada, where police found more weapons, approximately 50 in all, half of which Paddock had purchased during the previous 12 months in Nevada, Utah, Arizona and California. Every weapon and device Paddock owned was legal and registered under his name, including the bump stock. For gun enthusiasts and those familiar with them, the number of weapons Paddock possessed was far from shocking. During the days following the mass murder in Las Vegas, the NRA and Republican leadership, as well as President Donald Trump, cautioned those who immediately demanded gun control legislation not to “politicize” the tragic event during a time of mourning. Yet on 5 October 2017, in an unprecedented move since its extreme mass shootings radicalization, the NRA announced its support for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms to consider firearms regulation: “The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semiautomatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations.” Indeed, the history of public mass shootings by a lone gunman killing or wounding strangers parallels the rise of the gun rights movement and the United States’ ramped-up militarism, suggesting that it is not only the sheer number of guns in the hands of private citizens or the lack of regulation and licensing, but also a gun culture at work, along with a military culture, a more difficult matter to resolve than imposing regulations on firearms. Disturbing as mass shootings are, they currently account for only 2% of gun killings annually. The total gun deaths in the US average around 37,000 a year – roughly equal to death-by-vehicle incidents – with two-thirds of those deaths being suicides, leaving approximately 12,000 homicides, 1,000 of those at the hands of the police. In a satirical essay written following the Orlando nightclub killing, historian and theologian Garry Wills concluded that gun control in the United States is “inconceivable”: So this time let us skip all the sighing and promising and moments of silence. Why keep up the pretense that we are going to take any real and practical steps toward sanity? Everyone knows we are not going to do a single damn thing. We can’t. We are captives of The Gun. The Gun is patriotic. The Gun is America. The Gun is God. In response to mass shootings, no money can be found to finance mental health facilities, mental health problems being the one attribute that nearly all the mass shooters share.

http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2743515-las-vegas-marathon-2017-route-course-map-times-rock-n-roll-event-details," Las Vegas is a city that never sleeps. It's also a place that hosts one of the country's signature marathons, part of the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon Series. This year marks 20 years of the Marathon Series, as runners from all over the country meet in Sin City for a race that shuts down the entire Las Vegas strip. Here's an excerpt from the marathon's official website describing the backdrop of the race: ""As the only private event to shut down the famed Las Vegas Strip, this is a unique opportunity for marathoners of all backgrounds. With the race starting just as the sun is setting, the city comes to life with lights shining like you’ve never seen before. Even when the course moves off of the Strip, music and lights will keep you moving one foot in front of the other, all the way back to the finish line.""  The 2017 Las Vegas Marathon takes place Sunday, November 12, from 4:30 to 10 p.m. For road closures during the race, check out the official list here. For the complete course map, you can view it here. As one of the country's more popular tourist destinations, the city will be filled to the brim with runners, supporters and gamblers all looking to soak in the atmosphere. On a more serious note, security has been kicked up a notch for this year's race, which is Las Vegas' first major outdoor event since October's mass shooting, according to The Wall Street Journal. Clark County Nevada's official Twitter account also provided some information for race participants to check out: The Las #Vegas @RunRocknRoll Marathon is Sunday! It's the first gathering of a large number of people since #1october. The Strip will close to vehicles &amp; other road closures will be in place.  Visit https://t.co/fvdVcRlEqY for more #Traffic information. https://t.co/2cPzwK5a07 Las Vegas police Capt. Andy Walsh promised the safest conditions possible for runners and the best security detail they've had in the race's history, per the Las Vegas Review-Journal. “We took a good punch in the stomach, obviously. But we’re going to get back on our feet and show the world that Las Vegas is a safe place for people to live, work and visit.” Race organizer Dan Cruz echoed those sentiments in the same story: ""No question this race in Las Vegas on the Strip in the aftermath of October's tragedy will have the most intense protocols and procedures that we’ve experienced with the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon Series ... Runners should expect an increase in security, both visible uniformed law enforcement officers as well as private security officers, but also know that many other safety measures are taking place behind the scenes.""

A man puttered around his front yard, tidying up. A backhoe tore into a pile of rubble, shattering the morning quiet. Kevin and Janet Shaevitz watched it all. Their Anaheim Hills home burned down last month in the Canyon Fire 2, one of 15 homes in the area that were destroyed.  Janet Shaevitz looks over the remains of her Anaheim home as workers prepare to bulldoze the remains and haul it away. Shaevitz said she had about 45 minutes to grab her most cherished possessions which included family photos, a dog and three cats. “Everything else we can replace,” she said.(Photo by Mindy Schauer, Orange County Register/SCNG)  Kevin Shaevitz finds soot-covered Christmas cards in the rubble of his Anaheim home on Sunday, November 5, 2017.(Photo by Mindy Schauer, Orange County Register/SCNG)  Kevin Shaevitz walks through all that remains of his Anaheim home that was ravaged by the Canyon 2 fire last month.

(Photo by Leonard Ortiz, Orange County Register/SCNG)  And on a recent Saturday, as workers removed charred timbers and shattered tile from damaged lots, Janet Shaevitz perked up as she clambered over some debris to retrieve items she recognized — Christmas ornaments made by her kids. She held up a green paper stocking and saw her son’s face smiling from the top. Recovering from a devastating fire is a journey that’s just beginning for the Shaevitzes and several of their neighbors on Canyon Heights Drive. But not far away, in neighborhoods much like theirs, are dozens of homeowners who went on the same trip, after the 2008 Freeway Complex Fire. And some of them have returned with a road map. “You know what they’re facing. They’ve got two years of just absolute misery,” said David Ramocinski, a retired dentist who rebuilt his home in Yorba Linda’s Hidden Hills neighborhood after the 2008 blaze. But as much as he went through, Ramocinski said, he’s glad he came back. “It’s good to be home.” The Canyon Fire 2 took about 9,200 acres and destroyed 15 homes. The Freeway Complex Fire was bigger, burning more than 30,000 acres and destroying 187 homes, mostly in Anaheim Hills, Brea and Yorba Linda, which took the heaviest hit. Brian Stanley, 54, who lost his home in Anaheim Hills in ’08, said his son — then 4 years old — was “completely shell-shocked” after the fire and that the trauma lasted for years. “Every time he hears fire trucks or a helicopter, even today, he’s still a little gun-shy,” Stanley said. Because of the fire, Stanley said, he lost his passport and had credit cards set up in his name by identity thieves. He’s had to change his email address nearly a dozen times in eight years. Since the fire, he said, some couples in the neighborhood have separated or divorced. And, he added, he’s become “paranoid” about his rebuilt house. It’s designed with extra indoor sprinklers, spark-stopping attic vents and hose hook-ups all around the outside. “I probably have 14 or 15 smoke detectors.” But those feelings aren’t visible. What can be seen, in Hidden Hills, looks pretty secure. Today, trees have grown back to the edges of the road that carves the canyon. There’s no sign that five dozen homes in the neighborhood had some degree of fire damage, though a few empty spots show where houses were never rebuilt. Rebuilding their home, near the top of the canyon, took Ramocinski and his wife, Cheri, two years and eight months. It cost them half a million dollars from their retirement savings and the energy of routine bureaucratic, legal and emotional struggles. They had to deal with the city, an insurance company and the courts, where a lawsuit filed by fire victims against the Yorba Linda Water District resulted in a $70 million settlement. The process, David Ramocinski recalls, involved regular conflict. “First, it was every day, then it was once a week; you’d have a little battle of some sort.” It took time for the couple to process the loss of heirlooms they’d spent a lifetime collecting. A battered photo album chronicles that part of their pre-fire life, filled with pictures that Cheri Ramocinski snapped just before they evacuated, to show the insurance company later. “I miss that piece a lot,” she said, pointing to a photo of an antique Belgian china cabinet. In 2008, she hoped that they might return to their burned-out home and uncover some of the family silver or her jewelry. Instead, their home’s ruins were looted at least twice. Someone even stole all the burnt copper wiring. Within a year or two of the Freeway Complex Fire, recovery was well underway for many families. Jim and Sylvia Joubert were on a cruise when their Hidden Hills home of 16 years burned to the ground. They lost everything but the clothes in their suitcases and a few family photos that their daughters grabbed as they evacuated. The Jouberts treated the disaster as an opportunity. They invited friends over to watch the final demolition of their old home. They browsed eBay to replace the Waterford crystal Christmas ornaments that Sylvia Joubert had collected since the 1970s. The crisis ultimately brought the family closer, Jim Joubert said, because everyone pulled together. While some neighbors sold their charred lots and moved away, those who stuck it out supported each other. Rosemary and Anthony Philippello, retirees who live across the street from the Jouberts, said their doctor drove to their house after the fire to make sure they were safe. Since the recent fire, a similar spirit of community is emerging. An Anaheim Hills couple who lost their home has used their real estate office as a collection center for donations to help victims of the much larger wildfires in Northern California. Kevin Shaevitz, a 53-year-old chiropractor and father of four, stood amid the rubble of his home and said he’s received encouragement from neighbors. As he spoke, he stood near charred hulks of his washer and dryer and a backyard hot tub, murky with algae. He knows there’s a long road ahead. “You can’t hurry up and do this,” he said. “There is a grief process. And there’s several stages to that. And most of my family’s in denial.” Those who rebuilt after the 2008 fire are more prepared today. Saad Rajab, a 43-year-old physician who bought a partially rebuilt Hidden Hills home from an investor, completed the structure with stucco and avoided any exposed wood. Most of the front yard is concrete pavers, and he pays a fee to have brush cleared regularly from the slope behind his house. Brian Stanley scans all his important documents and stores them in the cloud. He keeps a “go box” with several days’ worth of clothes and other necessities for his family, and, in case of a fire, they always have an escape plan and a meeting place if they’re separated. The Ramocinskis have become advocates for other victims. After a 2015 fire that burned 11 square miles and destroyed 40 homes in the eastern Sierra Nevada, the couple reached out to homeowners, advising them about insurance and referring them to an attorney with whom they’d worked. David Ramocinski called it “the information I wish I never had to share.” But his wife said, “When you help, you heal.” Brian Stanley also tries to use what he’s learned. He took a disaster-preparedness course, runs a neighborhood watch and has hosted community meetings on how to be ready for a wildfire. Recent fire victims “need to take a deep breath, take a few days, and get away from the area,” he said. “If you have to look at it every day, it’s depressing.” Jim Joubert said it gets easier, and it helps to talk with others who have experienced the same thing. “You grieve the things (you lost) early on, but as time goes by you don’t think about them that much.” A constant that remains is the risk of another fire. Some residents said they’re apprehensive when the Santa Ana winds blow or they see a wisp of smoke in the hills. But they’ve accepted fire is part of the landscape. “I think I consider this part of living in California,” said Rajab, who finished the half-rebuilt home. “There is no protection from fire anywhere.” For some fire victims, the lesson learned was about letting go. Stanley said since the fire he quit wearing suits, buying designer clothes and driving a BMW. Now he wears shorts and T-shirts. “You realize everything you have means nothing,” he said. A few days after the most recent fire, Kevin Shaevitz said the family’s belongings were all replaceable. Still, when he found his wife’s Precious Moments Nativity scene intact, he was happy. “Maybe it’s symbolic,” he said. “I’m choosing to see it like that and take that as a sign that good things are going to come even though there’s tough times now.” Get the latest news delivered daily!

https://www.aol.com/article/finance/2017/11/10/uber-loses-uk-appeal-bid-to-overturn-workers-rights-decision/23273336/," LONDON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Taxi app Uber lost a bid on Friday to overturn a decision by a tribunal which had said its drivers deserved workers' rights such as the minimum wage, in a blow to the company as it also battles to keep its license in London. Uber immediately said it would appeal to higher courts against Friday's decision by the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) in central London. RELATED: LinkedIn's top 50 startups, 2017 The U.S. ride-hailing service has faced regulatory and legal setbacks around the world amid opposition from traditional taxi services and concern among some regulators. It has been forced to quit several countries, such as Denmark and Hungary. Last year, two drivers successfully argued at a British employment tribunal that Uber exerted significant control over them to provide an on-demand taxi service and should grant them workers' rights such as holiday entitlement and rest breaks. That decision did not automatically apply to the app's 50,000 drivers in Britain but was seen as likely to prompt more claims. It could benefit workers at thousands of companies including firms in the ""gig economy,"" where individuals work for multiple employers without a fixed contract, such as courier Deliveroo. The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, which backed the two drivers, said these companies were ""choosing to deprive workers of their rights."" ""Today’s victory is further proof, as if any more was needed, that the law is clear and these companies are simply choosing to deprive workers of their rights,"" said Jason Moyer-Lee, the IWGB's general secretary. Uber says its drivers enjoy the flexibility of their work and are self-employed, entitling them in British law to only basic entitlements such as health and safety. The firm argued in September that its drivers operate in the same way as minicabs, or private hire vehicles, which sprung up in Britain more than 50 years ago. On Friday it confirmed it would appeal against the latest decision. A spokesman said the company had 14 days to submit its application and decide whether to apply to take the case to the Supreme Court, Britain's top judicial body. ""Over the last year we have made a number of changes to our app to give drivers even more control,"" said Uber UK’s Acting General Manager Tom Elvidge in a statement. ""The main reason why drivers use Uber is because they value the freedom to choose if, when and where they drive."" Yaseen Aslam, one of the drivers involved in the case, said they would continue their fight to ensure workers' rights were respected. ""I am glad that the judge today confirmed what I and thousands of drivers have known all along: that Uber is not only exploiting drivers, but also acting unlawfully,"" he said. Uber, which is valued at around $70 billion with backers including Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, will be back in court on Dec. 11 to appeal a decision by London's transport regulator to strip the app of its license. Transport for London shocked Uber in September by deeming it unfit to run a taxi service and refusing to renew its license, citing the firm's approach to reporting serious criminal offenses and background checks on drivers.

http://www.theroot.com/pastor-considering-demolishing-texas-church-after-horri-1820328695,"The pastor of the Sutherland Springs, Texas, church where 26 people were killed in a horrific shooting rampage is considering tearing down the building and putting up a memorial in its place. According to Reuters, the pastor, Frank Pomeroy, whose 14-year-old daughter was killed in the massacre at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, met with Southern Baptist Convention leaders and “expressed his desire to raze the building,” convention spokesperson Roger Oldham told the news wire. The building, which can hold approximately 75 people, is riddled with bullets. Pomeroy said that using it again could be just too painful, and Oldham said the pastor is considering planting a memorial garden on the site. The church, however, will continue on, and is already planning a worship service on Sunday behind a community center not far from the church building. The service will “show the world that we may be knocked down temporarily but WE ARE NOT DEFEATED,” Pomeroy’s wife, Sherri, wrote on Facebook on Thursday. “Please come help us honor their lives doing what they died for: worshipping our sovereign God!” Target breakouts and wrinkles at the same timeEach item is also free of all possible pore-cloggers and contains zero hormone disruptors.

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/489959398/0/usatodaycomnation-topstories~In-Texas-shooting-town-thereaposs-always-been-one-constant-church/,"SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas (RNS) — After the mass shooting at First Baptist Church, a command center was needed to help investigators, disaster relief teams and families of the dead. So the town turned to the only other civic institution here capable of handling it all — another Baptist church. In Sutherland Springs, a crossroads hamlet with one flashing red light, two gas station/convenience stories and a Dollar General store, churches are the bedrock of the community. That’s where life is lived and people are cared for. Within 24 hours of the shooting that left more than two dozen people dead and many others injured, River Oaks Church sprang into action, turning classrooms and meeting spaces into a crisis center for governmental services and disaster relief teams, from the Red Cross to the Southern Baptists of Texas Convention. Deputy sheriffs guarded the entrance and turned away scores of media organizations to allow victim families to come and go freely. That the two Baptist churches, about 3 miles apart, form the mainstay of this small town is not surprising. Founded in 1926, First Baptist Church and the much newer River Oaks — originally formed in 1948 and then rebuilt and revitalized in the 1990s —  nourish and sustain the town. Extended families — such as the eight members of the Holcombe family, spanning three generations, who died in the shooting — attend one or the other church. “Our churches are interconnected by families along with friendships,” said Paul Buford, the pastor of River Oaks Church. “Some of the people from over there will come and visit here and some of the people here will go and visit there because they want to be around friends. We work together on everything in the community. We’re the body of Christ, so that’s what we do.” There are other churches in the area: Mt. Zion Fair Baptist, a mostly African-American church, and Cowboy Fellowship, a nondenominational church. And there’s an Islamic cemetery on the outskirts of town whose members live elsewhere. But River Oaks and First Baptist constitute the town’s core. The Christianity preached at both churches is standard evangelical fare, built around a personal conversion to faith in Jesus, an inerrant reading of the Bible and a commitment to converting non-Christians. But even people who are not members — a sizable group — benefited from the congregation’s ministries. Each Thursday, First Baptist prepared a free meal for the community. It also housed a food pantry. On Sundays, it would treat members and guests alike to breakfast before the church service. More: Texas church, site of deadly massacre, to be demolished More: Volunteer groups come to the aid of families, faith leaders More: 'Evil descended on this small town': Pence visits site of Texas tragedy At Halloween, First Baptist would put on a Fall Festival, an alternative to a holiday some evangelicals view as celebrating the occult. The night before Thanksgiving, the men of the church would cook turkeys. Their wives would come in the following day to prepare side dishes and dessert. After a prayer service, they would eat a noon meal together. At Christmas, troupes of members would go caroling around town. Each Easter, the church held a sunrise service. “The people there are completely and utterly nonjudgmental,” said Tambria Read, the chair of the town’s historical museum. “Pastor Frank Pomeroy takes in everybody, whether you have drug troubles or law troubles, domestic troubles. You are taken in with open arms.” Even Devin Patrick Kelley, the gunman who last Sunday killed 25 members ages 1 to 77, including a pregnant woman, was welcomed into the church. Less than a week before the shooting, Kelley attended the church’s Fall Festival, said Frank Page, the president and chief executive officer of the Southern Baptist Convention Executive Committee. Investigators say Kelley may have been motivated by rage against his estranged wife’s mother, a member of First Baptist. She was not among those killed, though her mother was. Churches aren’t the town’s only institutions. There’s a community building that hosts weddings and family reunions, a post office, a cemetery, and a history museum. Once upon a time, there was much more. In the mid-1800s, John Sutherland settled the town, establishing a clinic that took advantage of the 27 varieties of mineral waters that flow from the springs here. Soon many people were flocking to Sutherland Springs to get treatments for such ailments as rheumatism and diphtheria. A 52-room hotel was built in the early 1900s and a sulfur-filled swimming pool. At one point there was a bank, a movie theater and a dance hall in town. A flood and a fire wiped out most of the businesses. Later, during World War II, many left for nearby San Antonio to help with the war effort. The town dwindled in population. There are still some cattle ranchers in town, and a Purina-owned feedlot called Texana. But many residents commute to San Antonio, about 30 miles away. What has remained constant is the church. Rob Hines, who teaches history at Palo Alto College in nearby San Antonio, said the importance of churches in these small Texas communities, both in the past and in the present, cannot be understated. “Churches and the religious life are strained by the realities of this modern age — job losses, geographic mobility, and the breakup of extended families,” Hines said. “We need each other, and a good church helps fill that need. When a small town loses its schools and churches, it’s the beginning of the end.” Townspeople say they do not intend to let the town lose its first and central church. Southern Baptist leaders say the congregation plans to raze and rebuild the church. “We’re not going to let this defeat us,” said Buford, the pastor of River Oaks Church. “That’s not going to happen. Evil does not win. It might give us a punch to the gut. Even in that, we know we’re more than conquerors through Christ Jesus. We’re going to make it and going to be with our Lord and Savior.” Contributing: Kimberly Winston"

http://www.startribune.com/opinion/letters/456735293.html,"Like some of the candidates who just ran for office in the Minneapolis city election (“Three cheers for multiple choices,” Nov. 10), I support ranked-choice voting when it is applied to single-seat positions. However, RCV is more problematic where multiple seats are being filled — such as for the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board’s at-large seats and the Board of Estimate and Taxation seats. Such voting could be more acceptable and understandable if the three seats were designated — No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3. Candidates would thus know whom they were running against, and voters would have the option of designating a first choice, second choice and third choice for each seat. If there is to be confidence in the election system, voters need to understand how winners are determined, and in the case of multiple-seat winners, it is nearly impossible to do so without extensive explanation. I urge the Minneapolis Charter Commission to initiate consideration of how this might be done. Margit Berg, Minneapolis ELECTION TURNOUT Our ‘duty’ to vote? Only if we are also dutifully informed A Nov. 10 letter writer stated: “It is your duty as a citizen to vote.” That is ludicrous! Radio and TV reporters will interview people on the street. Many people don’t have a clue what is going on — locally or nationally. A citizen should vote only if they have a reasonable understanding of the issues and candidates. Dick Hansen, Edina ELECTION INFLUENCE Social media saturates the local campaign landscape, too No question — we know the Russians tried to influence the 2016 presidential election. We mustn’t be naive — the Minneapolis election also was heavily influenced by social media. We are in a new era of campaigning that extends far beyond door-knocking and yard signs. If you are on social media, you have been constantly peppered with campaign ads for candidates during the past few weeks. Candidates buy “audience target” ads that radiate everywhere, even beyond their knowledge or control. Several candidates placed inadvertent ads in Breitbart — an association not viewed favorably in Minneapolis. A one-issue socialist candidate won the first-choice balloting in the Third Ward City Council race — supported by constant postings targeting Third Ward residents. Fortunately, ranked-choice voting eventually determined the outcome. A weekend opinion piece posted by a respected ex-mayor circulated widely and rapidly. It probably doomed a Park Board candidate. Social media serves a primary role as it transforms campaigning. Like it or not. Alexander Adams, Minneapolis GUNS A persuasive moment, as with sexual misconduct? Well … Judging from the number of incidents recently reported and the comments regarding them, the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment revelations were truly a “watershed moment.” Now the question becomes, why haven’t we had a similar watershed moment concerning gun violence? John Fredell, Minneapolis • • • Great idea! Sue the manufacturers and dealers of the firearms used in these mass shootings! (“After another mass shooting, it’s time for class action,” Readers Write, Nov. 9.) Only one problem. Congress was a step ahead of us. Not long after the federal assault-weapons ban expired in September 2004, Congress, lobbied by the NRA and realizing the likelihood that mass shootings would occur and wrongful death suits would follow, passed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which stripped victims of their right to sue these manufacturers and dealers. So, in a wicked irony, the victims of these mass shootings cannot sue the suppliers of these deadly weapons, but the perpetrators, in the event their weapon misfires or jams, can. Elizabeth T. Cantrell, Burnsville • • • The Nov. 9 letter writer forgot to mention another billion-dollar industry in her call for class action. A quick Google search showed that in 2016, there were more than 40,000 deaths caused by automobiles. It is time to take the auto industry to court and sue the industry for every penny it has. These multibillion-dollar companies advertise there death machines on national TV. How many families have suffered due to someone being killed by or in an automobile? Let’s not forget the motorcycle, ATV and snowmobile folks. Let’s get the elderly and medicated people to court, also. Line up, lawyers; you will make millions. The writer is an obvious gun hater, probably never used one. I am 65 and got, and still have, my first gun at 12. As I write this, my guns are downstairs as usual doing nothing. You will never stop a person who is bent on killing. They will find a way. Do not paint all us gun owners with the some brush. Barry Peterson, Prior Lake • • • Why is it that when an AR-15-style rifle is used for good, as in the case of Stephen Willeford stopping the Texas gunman who killed 26, the weapon is simply referred to as “his rifle” (“Area resident hailed as hero for engaging Texas gunman,” Associated Press article on StarTribune.com, Nov. 7). But when the weapon is used for evil (“Act now, America, while the pain is fresh,” editorial, Oct. 3), it is referred to as being among “AR-15-style assault weapons.” Why is the Star Tribune creating a public perception that “AR-15-style assault weapon” equals bad and “rifle” equals good when at the end of the day they are the same firearm? Is it to avoid the fact that the firearm didn’t make the action good or evil? The person using it did. Marc Ohmann, Bloomington TAX REFORM Don’t be obtuse; state and local deductions should remain I found D.J. Tice’s Nov. 5 column expressing ironic surprise at Gov. Mark Dayton’s dismay with possible loss of state and local tax (SALT) deductions purposely shortsighted. Although the direct benefits go to the higher earners, they are the people all of us depend upon to finance our state’s superior services and quality of life. The loss of SALT deductions would give more ammunition to lower the state taxes toward, say, Wisconsin or the Dakotas. Nobody likes to pay taxes, it always hurts to some degree, but how else do we pay for law enforcement, education, protection and enhancement of the environment, medical/social services, and roads and infrastructure? These are the measures that lead to high quality-of-life ratings, and why people put up with our taxes. We already send more money to Washington than we get back; this will make things worse. I think the Republicans are delighting in the fact that they would be sending blue-state money to red states. If we value our quality of life here, we should let our Republican representatives know that the loss of SALT deductions would be a grave error. David Brockway, Edina • • • Recently President Trump tweeted: “How can you blame China for taking advantage of people that had no clue? I would’ve done the same.” I urge people to keep this tweet in the forefront of their minds when considering the proposed tax plans. Scott Christenson, Minneapolis © 2021 StarTribune.

http://www.denverpost.com/2017/11/10/commentary-country-music-is-becoming-the-soundtrack-of-a-nonexistent-apolitical-no-place/,"Trending: By hris Richards, The Washington Post Country singers like to talk about how they provide fans with a form of escape, but that just can’t be right. How are songs about everyday life supposed to help us escape from our everyday lives? Country music isn’t a way out of reality. It’s a way to get deeper inside of it. But then I heard Brad Paisley — mainstream country’s most progressive utopian — sing an ode to small towns called “Heaven South” during Wednesday’s Country Music Association Awards in Nashville and everything felt upside down. “Turn on the news, you’d think the world ain’t got a prayer,” the song went. “But if you turn it off and look around, it’s just another day in Heaven South.” So all our planet’s problems will go away if we stop paying attention to them? I guess that’s one way to escape reality, but it was still disheartening to see Paisley, the CMA telecast’s co-host for the 10th consecutive year, acquiescing to Nashville’s disengagement reflex and encouraging listeners to “turn it off.” Especially at this year’s CMAs, where not one artist found the courage to say a single word about gun control after 58 fans were shot dead at a country music festival in Las Vegas last month. And sure, nobody expected the CMAs to transform itself into a three-hour town hall discussion about the Second Amendment. But did anyone expect such monolithic quiet after such a catastrophic event? Apparently, the ghost of the Dixie Chicks’ career still haunts this town in terrifying ways. (In case you forgot, the colossally popular country trio spoke out against President George W. Bush at a concert in 2003 and were instantly boycotted by radio stations across the country, sending the entirety of mainstream country into a state of political paralysis that has lasted 14 years and counting.) Now, a style of music that used to proudly address the real-life struggles of real-life Americans won’t go near the issue that everyone in our harried republic is currently struggling with. After last month’s massacre in Las Vegas, another 28 people were killed in a mass shooting inside a church in Texas — the setting of countless country songs. Yet, instead of singing about life in America, today’s country stars are singing about an apolitical no-place that doesn’t actually exist. I guess it’s called Heaven South, and apparently, you protect it by circling the wagons. That was the plan at Wednesday’s CMAs. “Tonight, we’re gonna do what families do,” co-host Carrie Underwood promised at the top of the telecast. “There’s a family in this room,” Miranda Lambert said after winning female vocalist of the year. “We’re a family,” Garth Brooks said after taking the night’s biggest prize, entertainer of the year. And so the brightest names in country music stood together in the name of standing together — which is basically what happens at this tight-knit industry function every November. It was still the same annual group-hug, this time just a little tighter. Despite the circumstances, the telecast’s organizers were hoping for a business-as-usual kind of night anyway. Last week, after CMA officials announced that they reserved the right to eject any journalist who asked an artist about their politics, Paisley immediately spoke out against that pre-emptive censorship, tweeting, “I’m sure the CMA will do the right thing and rescind these ridiculous and unfair press guidelines.” And voila, they were promptly rescinded. But that didn’t embolden any of the artists to volunteer their thoughts on the state of the nation on Wednesday night, not even Paisley. “I love the way we’ve all come together,” he said during one interstitial segment, as if he might be warming up some spontaneous bombshells. Then he confessed that he’d “gone off script,” and returned to the business of introducing the next performer. As for the night’s performances, many of them felt intentionally ordinary, save for Keith Urban singing “Female,” a new solidarity anthem intended as a response to the sexual assault and harassment scandals currently detonating across Hollywood. He wasn’t taking a risky position here, and the song’s lyrics aren’t the greatest, but the sentiment was welcome. Then again, we were watching a man sing about feminism at an awards show where the top prize had no women nominees. But Urban had the right idea. Awards shows give you an opportunity to say something significant in an acceptance speech, but a great song tends to send a message much farther, and some artists have already gotten to work on that front. In the days following last month’s shooting in Las Vegas, Maren Morris released “Dear Hate,” a ballad about the eternal fight between love and evil. Eric Church penned a song about survivor’s guilt called “Why Not Me.” And while both Morris and Church performed at Wednesday’s CMAs, they didn’t sing either of these new tunes. Why not? It left Underwood to give the evening’s most somber performance, singing the hymn “Softly and Tenderly” during an in memoriam segment that honored the concert attendees slain in Las Vegas. In the song’s final phrases, she sounded as if her voice had suddenly vanished from her throat — there were a few short pauses where the words couldn’t get out. And when it was finally over, you may have wondered about all of the words that everyone else in the building had purposefully chosen to swallow throughout the night. Surely, today’s country stars have more to say about this nation, its leaders and its laws, and the fate of the people they’re singing to. But if those words aren’t coming out now, when will they ever? Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts"

https://www.nationalreview.com/article/453655/roy-moore-sutherland-springs-shooting-two-calls-conversion,"Follow Us National Review The Wit and Wisdom of Thomas Sowell Topless, a Noir Tragicomedy That Anticipated the Scandals of the Present How to Handle a Phoenix in Your Fireplace Don’t Let Democrats Turn the U.S. into Europe Persian Parables Two things in the headlines this week should be like sirens calling us to conversion. The first was the largest mass shooting in a church in U.S. history. The evil that was done to the people of First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs made hearts ache with compassion for those who died as they were worshipping God and for those who mourn them. And yet it somehow seemed to take no time before social media users were atwitter, pouncing on “thoughts and prayers.” The standard “What would Jesus do?” convention took on the form of an attack on prayer, with many insisting prayer was not an action but an excuse not to get behind gun-control legislation as the remedy for evil. And yet, both that question and the frenzied response of repulsion to the idea of “thoughts and prayers” ought to challenge us to ponder what the Gospel does require of us. Father Donald Haggerty, a priest of the Archdiocese of New York, who is currently stationed at St. Patrick’s Cathedral, has some insights on that topic. In his new book, Conversion: Spiritual Insights into an Essential Encounter with God, he writes: There is a link between the crisis of unbelief in Western culture and the loss of religious intensity among those who claim the importance of faith. Belief is never simply an interior conviction about religious matters. It entails a personal cleaving to Jesus Christ as God and man that cannot be unaffected by his manner of life. But do we forget to keep our eyes fastened on the poor and crucified man of Nazareth whom we proclaim as divine and the object of our love? Belief in Jesus of Nazareth as God in the flesh has to face with some pain and distress the poor life he preferred for himself and the love for poor people that he chose. Otherwise, our faith in the Incarnation risks becoming an abstraction only useful for maintaining a correct belief. It misses an essential truth of this actual thirty-three years that calls for some effort of resemblance on our part. Which brings us to the accusations against Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore. (There have been several vile defenses of him, in particular, one that shamelessly made use of the holy family.) Again, I quote from Father Haggerty: A conversion is not just a change of life-style. The new recognition of God infuses strong desires in our soul that God should be known by others as we now know him. A kind of missionary zeal for souls can take hold of our heart and enter into our impulses with other people. We would like to see conversions spread contagiously among our contacts with people. More immediately we would be happy at times to bowl over an unbelieving soul with the overwhelming truth of God. This enthusiasm for winning souls may be naïve in its optimism regarding the appeal of God to people who do not know him. But, in another sense, it is a sign of our love for God. And a zeal for souls as we continue life is essential to a love for souls. We taste a graced impulse in wanting to bring others to the truth of God and to Catholic faith. We have to be led by God in this love for souls, learning wisdom of heart and suffering for souls, if we truly want their conversion to the faith. Even God in his omnipotence cannot convert a soul that does not want to know him. People need to know converted souls. While conversion happens daily, if people are meeting Christians who are not surrendering themselves to the hard work of conversion, of course they are not going to believe that thoughts and prayers are worth anything. And if they see people using and abusing religion for ideology or other worldly power, of course they won’t have any interest in conversion either. I can’t help but keep thinking of (there I go with thoughts again!) and be drawn into prayer (!) for Frank Pomeroy, the pastor of First Baptist Church and his wife, who lost their daughter in the shooting Sunday. He has a peace about him even in his devastating grief. I can’t help but think it comes from something Father Haggerty describes: Surrender to God from a deeper layer of soul always conceals a promise that must also be heard, even without words. God is not casual and nonchalant when great offerings are made. He does not receive them so frequently that he can be dispassionate toward a soul that casts itself in abandonment into his hands. His fingers are strong in holding on tightly to such souls. If these souls are asked to bear their share of suffering in future days after their suffering in future days after their offering, even so, the firm hand of God never releases them but, rather, clasps them to his heart. And that embrace compensates for every risk that might earlier have intimidated a soul. There is a fearlessness and freedom that comes with real faith, the kind where the soul begs for further conversion. For every misuse and abuse and manipulation of, or even mere miscommunication about, religion, there are those who truly try to live configured to Christ, a true transformation. In the introduction to his book, Father Haggerty quotes Saint Edith Stein, the famous convert to Catholicism from Judaism who died in the Holocaust. She writes: Immediately before and for a good while after my conversion, I was of the opinion that to lead a religious life meant one had to give up all that was secular and to live totally immersed in thoughts of the Divine. But gradually I realized that something else is asked of us in this world and that, even in the contemplative life, one may not sever the connection with the world. I even believe that the deeper one is drawn into God, the more one must “go out of oneself,” that is, one must go to the world in order to carry the divine life into it. Not only do we need room for people of faith to be people of integrity, living their faith in the world — i.e., religious freedom — but we need people who are overwhelming our lives and culture and yes even politics with real religion, not the fake kind that remakes God into our own image instead of offers our lives for Him to remake them. The people of Sutherland Springs not only need and deserve our prayers, their very witness to faith is a prayer for us to go deeper, for real, for the sake of our souls and the souls of all we hold dear — which includes our country and its politics and its culture. Our thoughts and prayers ought to be for conversion to the kind of faith that radiates confidence in true hope in God, clinging to Him, not to ideological and other selfish self-reliant manipulations.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/11/tracking-trump-mood-swings-in-asia-and-election-struggles-at-home,"The US president’s comments wavered from aggressive to conciliatory as he visited Japan, South Korea and China – and finally made a stop in Vietnam Last modified on Thu 7 Jan 2021 00.04 GMT Donald Trump spent the week bouncing around Asia, his mood swinging wildly from deferential and complimentary to, well, fiery and furious. After dropping in on Hawaii – “See you in Pearl Harbor!” he had told the press cheerfully on Friday – he quickly picked up the theme of the North Korean nuclear menace, telling dictators at a US base near Tokyo not to “underestimate American resolve” but also suggesting he would be happy to sit down with Kim Jong-un at some point. Trump made sure he got in a round of golf with one of his best friends on the world stage, the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, along with the five-time PGA Tour winner Hideki Matsuyama, who elicited a rare show of self-awareness and perhaps even modesty from Trump: “If I come back and say I was longer than him, don’t believe it.”  If that defied one stereotype, Trump seemed happy enough to indulge in another when he reportedly asked why Japan, “a country of samurai warriors”, had not shot down the missiles North Korea has fired over its territory. Ever the businessman, he pressed Abe to buy more military equipment from the US to counter this threat from Pyongyang. Back home, another mass shooting had taken place on Sunday, in Texas, and by Monday many were quick to point out the contrast between the thoughts and prayers to which Trump confined himself in response, and his rush to implement harsh new policies when a killer was Muslim, as appeared to be the case last week in New York. Arriving in South Korea, Trump went further in rejecting calls for stricter gun laws in the wake of the killings in Texas, suggesting gun control might in fact have made the incident worse. But he struck a more conciliatory tone in international relations, suggesting in Seoul that “we’re making progress” in resolving the issue of Pyongyang’s nuclear programme. And he found time to plug the Trump golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey, where he escaped for more than a few weekends this summer. By Wednesday, Trump had changed his tune again on North Korea. Speaking in front of lawmakers at South Korea’s national assembly, he told Kim: “Do not underestimate us.” But it was the US president who seemed to have underestimated the difficulty of organising a trip to the DMZ, between North and South Korea. Despite the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, getting dressed up in some army clothes for the occasion, heavy fog meant that the American helicopters could not land. The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, had prudently flown in earlier, but he waited for his guests at the front line in vain. A political fog had rolled in back on the home front, too, with Republicans losing a string of races for governor, state legislature, and mayor across the country, one year  after Trump’s 2016 presidential victory. The president made it quite clear that he personally could not be expected to shoulder any blame, attacking the failed Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie because he “did not embrace me or what I stand for”. While Trump strode the world stage in China, his erstwhile opponent Hillary Clinton took her book tour to Wisconsin, a state she infamously failed to visit during the 2016 campaign, and lost. She hailed Tuesday’s election victories, saying: “The fever has broken,” while on the other side of the globe, Trump continued his charm offensive towards Xi Jinping, blaming his US predecessors for the “huge” trade deficit between the world’s two largest economies. “Your ancient values bring past and future together into the present,” Trump noted. “So beautiful.” It was all a far cry from his rants about “China!” on the campaign trail, and the Chinese press duly gave the US president what he would probably refer to as “great reviews”. By contrast, the US media were less than impressed when the White House bowed to a Chinese insistence on gagging reporters during a supposed press conference, in defiance of much past US precedent. Trump infamously dodged the Vietnam war draft due to a letter from his doctor – ”a very strong letter on the heels” – and once mused to the shock jock Howard Stern that trying to avoid sexual transmitted diseases amounted to his own personal Vietnam. But on Friday, he finally made it to the real Vietnam, for an Apec leaders’ summit. Hot on his heels (thank you) was an old friend – Vladimir Putin, who received a friendly handshake from Trump and signalled his alignment with the American president by copying the multi-shirt style made famous by Trump’s ally Steve Bannon. But Trump had harsh words for the rest of the group, with an attack on their trade policies, and he even delivered some coded criticism of Beijing’s regional ambitions: Asian nations were “each a bright star, satellites to none”, he said. Trump presses on to another of those bright stars this weekend, where he will meet probably the only world leader more aggressive and offensive than himself: Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, who claimed on Friday that he had once stabbed someone to death, decisively outdoing Trump’s infamous boast that “I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose voters”. This isn’t a competition, guys."

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ted-lieu-moment-silence-guns_us_5a01de54e4b0368a4e874403?utm_hp_ref=gun-violence,"Senior reporter, HuffPost Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) says it’s time for legislative action ― not silence ― after Sunday’s mass shooting at a church in rural Texas. Lieu on Monday walked out of a moment of silence in the House of Representatives chamber meant to memorialize the 26 people killed and 20 wounded in the gunman’s attack. Lieu instead called on Congress to pass progressive gun safety measures that might prevent a future massacre. “I’m heartbroken about the children and adults that were killed in the worst mass shooting in Texas history this Sunday,” Lieu said in a Facebook video posted to his account from Capitol Hill. “My colleagues right now are doing a moment of silence,” Lieu continued. “I respect their right to do that and I myself have participated in many of them, but I can’t do this again. ... I will not be silent.” Lieu said he had participated in “too many” moments of silence, noting that three of the worst mass shootings in modern U.S. history have occurred since he was elected to Congress less than three years ago. On Sunday, Devin Patrick Kelley, 26, a former Air Force member court-martialed for domestic violence, opened fire on First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs with an assault-style rifle. The massacre was the fifth-deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Roughly a month earlier, a gunman shooting into a sea of Las Vegas concertgoers from a 32nd-floor hotel room killed 58 people, the worst mass shooting in modern history. He used semiautomatic rifles outfitted with devices called “bump stocks” to fire hundreds of rounds per minute. Lieu on Monday urged lawmakers to pass legislation that would ban assault rifles and bump stocks, as well as mandate a universal background check system for gun purchases ― a measure supported by the majority of Americans. “We need to pass gun safety legislation now,” Lieu said. “We cannot be silent. We need to act now.” Most Republican lawmakers have continued to reject Democratic calls for tighter gun safety measures. President Donald Trump claimed Monday that stronger background checks for firearm purchases could have led to “hundreds more” dead during Sunday’s mass shooting, because Kelley was shot and pursued by a rifle-toting bystander.

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/does-it-make-a-difference-if-many-of-the-mass-shooting_us_5a02326ee4b02f3ab3377df0?section=us_contributor,"Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst There’s a huge irony buried in the heinous and horrific mass carnage in Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs, Texas. The likelihood is that many of the shooting victims were Trump supporters. This is more than speculation. The shootings did not occur in deep blue California or Massachusetts. The targets of the mass murderers were in Las Vegas at a country and western music festival. In Texas, the victims were members of a conservative, evangelical, semi-rural Baptist church in an almost exclusively white, unincorporated town. The voter demographics in Nevada and Texas are rapidly changing ― more blacks, Hispanics and younger voters, who in time could shift both states to the blue column. But for now, the two states still track GOP and conservative, especially in small towns and areas such as Sutherland Springs. In interviews with many of the performers and participants at the country and western event in Las Vegas after the shooting, almost all said that they had been staunch opponents of tougher gun control laws, and many were gun owners. In Texas, the man who gave chase to the shooter ― and reportedly had a shootout with him ― is now being hailed as a hero. More than a few jumped in to parrot the gun control opponent’s mantra, “If only more people there had guns, then the shooter would have been stopped cold.” So, if many of the victims of mass shootings are white, conservative, anti-gun control, and likely Trump backers, then here’s the logical question ― no, two questions ― that must be asked. Shouldn’t this spark an epiphany about loose, rampant and virtually unchecked access to guns by anyone, anywhere, anytime? The other is: Should this give some pause to Trump and the GOP to stop cavalierly branding and dismissing these shooters as kooks, cranks and chronic malcontents? The brutal reality in trying to answer both questions is that the people being mass murdered now are the very people who Trump and the GOP routinely court every election and depend on to maintain their iron grip on state legislatures, governorships and the House. Aren’t they the voter demographic that Trump furiously courted during the 2016 presidential election and that he banked on to put him in the Oval Office? And, by and large, they did. Trump and the GOP haven’t ― and won’t ― connect the dots on the shootings and the victims to themselves, because they don’t see the shooters as one of them. They are nut cases or, to be more pseudo-scientific, they have “mental issues.” They are grotesque, monstrous aberrations who are so far out of the pale of normal society they can be neatly categorized and swiftly marginalized. This is a major reason these shooters are never banded as domestic terrorists, a label that’s almost exclusively reserved for, and quickly slapped on, Muslims who commit a terror act in the U.S. If so, it would put them back in the ranks of those who are red-blooded, born in America, patriotic Americans. A rigid separation must be made between the mass murderers and their victims to salve the conscience of Trump and the GOP that they are not one of us. The other problem is race. The majority of the victims in Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs were white, as were their killers. This simply doesn’t fit the ingrained stereotype of who commits murder and mayhem in America, including serial murders and mass terror slaughter. The perps are almost universally viewed, endlessly played up in the media and mass warehoused in jails and prisons as young blacks, Hispanics, and now Muslims. To admit that mass murderers can be white and made in America would require Trump and the GOP to turn the mirror on themselves and frankly admit that people who share their values, views and even politics are also capable of committing atrocious acts of terror. It would require a sea change by NRA that has held Congress virtually hostage with its money, power and massive membership to torpedo even the most innocuous and tepid gun control legislation. The organization would have to admit the dire peril that unchecked gun access poses to many of its own constituents. For now, this is all fantasy land hope. It’s just easier for Trump and the GOP to point a damning finger at Muslims, blacks and Hispanics as the only real terror threat in America. This doesn’t require any need to justify why they aren’t doing more than just offering prayers and thoughts to the victims and cursing the shooters as nut cases to back even the most minimal gun control restrictions. And to warn that mass murderers aren’t only in ISIS land but can be the neighbor next door. This gross failure to do this, though, will be no consolation to the victims of the almost inevitable next mass shooting ― no matter how many of them are Trump backers.

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/enough-already-do-something_us_5a04cacbe4b0f1dc729a6997?utm_hp_ref=business-travel,"One Fit Widow Enough already. Seriously. Is anyone listening? Is anyone hearing the cries of parents and children and the eternal sorrow, anxiety, and grief that accompanies every new news cycle in this country? What is wrong with us? Why are we going back about our business and letting our weary hearts forget the life-altering pain for our fellow humans? I know, it's too much, right? We can't handle the bad news, so it's easier to ignore tragedy unless it has a direct effect on us personally. Let me tell you about my tragedy. My life changed in the blink of an eye. On a beautiful October day, my husband took off in a small plane, and within seconds everything we dreamed of was gone along with him. His children lost their father at the age of 1 and 2, and I was left PERMANENTLY changed and deeply affected by our family tragedy. DEEPLY. The shock was so powerful there are no words in the human language which do it justice. Gutting. Like a thief in the the night taking all I owned, my shock and grief stole my entire being. I was left void of all emotion, the ability to sleep, and the desire to move forward because my central nervous system was not prepared to deal with such life-altering pain. Those feelings revisited me last Sunday as I watched the HORROR surrounding the mass murder and domestic terror in Sutherland Springs, Texas. I found myself, thousands of miles away, paralyzed by the pain of others. I don’t know a single soul in that small town. I don’t know one victim that died in Vegas, the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, either. It doesn’t matter if I know them. Their pain is so real. On some level, I recognized the agony of loss, and while I’ve never experienced the pain of a mass shooting, I can assure you based on my loss, it is life-changing on the deepest and most disturbeing level. These people will NEVER be the same. EVER. They will bury their children, their parents, grandparents, and friends. They will see them in their dreams for the rest of their lives. Many are likely to have PTSD, anxiety, anger, years of profound grief and a lifetime of reliving the worst day of their lives. They will need therapy, they will need friends who stay, and they will need us to stand up in unison as the human collective and scream, “ENOUGH!” It has been five days, and I can already see the normality returning to our Facebook walls, our Tweets, and Instagram photos. Many political officials are changing the subject because it’s tricky, complicated and messy and their views may cause them NOT to be re-elected. Each time we live through yet another horrific and mind-numbing tragedy, we become more accustomed to pain, and we allow ourselves to justify murder, or sweep it under the carpet. The murder of children. The murder of parents. The murder of human beings. If only I could make you understand how devastating it is to raise children who’ve lost someone important in their world; the nights of crying, the heartbreaking questions, the void that can’t be filled by anyone else. It doesn’t end two weeks later, a month later, or a year later. It’s forever. These children will have this pain FOREVER! Can you live with that? Can you contemplate that pain for even just a second? Can you rise above your political affiliations and opinions long enough to think of the children? What about the parents who lost their children in such a senseless and violent manner? You think they will recover from this? They may, in time, find some healing and move forward, but I can promise you they will never, ever be the same. Sure, you may be reading this and thinking, “Yes, that’s terrible, how sad” but let me ask you, what are you doing to stop it? We have to stop changing the subject because it’s too uncomfortable. We have to stand up, stop the infighting and demand change. I’m not here to fight the second amendment or advocate for guns being taken away, but are you really going to tell me I have to take my shoes off to go through the security line at the airport tomorrow, but I can walk around my hometown with an AR-15??? Seriously??? America, we’ve lost our collective spine, and we have become numb to the unthinkable. Children dying at school, in church, at a park, or at home is NOT a political issue. Children dying anywhere at the hands of others is UNACCEPTABLE by all standards that make us human. We’ve been complacent after every recent tragedy, and there are too many to list them all. We turned our blind eye because it’s too big of a fight and swimming upstream after the immediate horror of the pain seems too challenging. It’s not the time to ignore the pain of people we might never meet. This cycle must end, and it must end now. It is not the time to go back to business as usual. When you are eventually touched by the death of a person you love more than anyone else in this world, these tragedies will bring you to your knees. Unavoidable death should never be acceptable to us. Nobody should have to feel it. Nobody should have to live through it. We are allowing it. We are all allowing it. Enough already. Let’s do something this time. Where can you start? Let’s show the bereaved and their dead that it matters to us too. It matters enough to come out of our comfort zones while we still have them.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/LmtqBXOk5xE/,"An ex-wife of Devin Kelley, who authorities have identified as the gunman responsible for the mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, earlier this month, described his alleged abuse in a television interview. “He just had a lot of demons or hatred inside of him,” Tessa Brennaman, 25, said on CBS’ Inside Edition. Kelley had a history of domestic violence; TIME reported earlier this week that, in 2012, Tessa Kelley accused him of beating and choking her, breaking her infant son’s skull and threatening her with a gun. A military court charged Kelley with domestic violence and sent him to a mental hospital in New Mexico, but he briefly escaped. Later that year he pleaded guilty to domestic violence charges, and a year after that was discharged for bad conduct after spending a year in military prison, according to CBS News. In her interview with CBS News, Brennaman describes how Kelley allegedly threatened her with a gun over a speeding ticket. “He took that gun out…. and he told me ‘do you want to die? do you want to die?'” she recalled. She also said he threatened to kill her and her whole family. Kelley, 26, who died after the shooting, killed more than 26 people — including an 18-month-old baby — and injured at least 20 others when he opened fire at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on the morning of November 5. Officials said they believe the attack was the result of a domestic dispute, citing threatening messages Kelley had sent his mother-in-law, who was a member of the church. According to the Associated Press, Kelley was able to obtain the weapons that he used because the Air Force did not relay his criminal past to the FBI. If they had, he wouldn’t have been able to buy a gun. Write to Alana Abramson at Alana.Abramson@time.com."
http://www.denverpost.com/2017/11/11/sutherland-springs-shooting-recovery/,"Trending: SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas — The people of Sutherland Springs have not held news conferences, they haven’t made appearances on network morning television shows, and while they’ve been polite to the media, they’re not exactly forthcoming. Instead, this rural community is turning to the one thing that has buoyed them in good times, and sustains them now: an unshakeable faith in God. David Colbath, one of 20 people who were injured but survived Devin Patrick Kelley’s rampage at the First Baptist Church, held Bible study from his hospital bed. Judy Green, a church member who avoided the carnage because she and her husband were running an errand, sought counseling at another church because of what she saw when she drove up to the building that day. Crystal Barkley, a Sutherland Springs resident who doesn’t even attend the church, prayed and “stayed at home for a couple of days, collecting strength.” There have been no fewer than three prayer vigils for the victims. One, held Wednesday and attended by Vice President Mike Pence, was so large that it had to be held in the neighboring town’s football stadium. On Sunday, the town will gather for church services in its community center, which is next door to the church and was part of the crime scene for several days. Residents have included reporters in impromptu prayer circles and have tried, quietly, to let the world know that it is a God-loving town, not a place of violence. “We want to be known for more than this,” sighed Tambria Read, president of the local historical museum, schoolteacher and lifelong resident. “We are not a shoot-’em-up community.” It’s difficult to put into words what happens to a place after a mass shooting, and each has its own way of dealing with the horror. In big cities like Orlando and Las Vegas, it was possible for those not directly affected to mourn and move on, to try to get back to normal as quickly as possible and mend aching hearts. Suburban sprawl and the comforts of urban life helped smooth over the raw emotion and residents could ignore the media, the outsiders coming to help, the constant reminder of loss. In Sutherland Springs, there’s been no escaping Sunday morning’s shooting that left 26 dead. Every resident in town knew at least one person who was killed, and most knew several. The victims were cousins, former students, people who they laughed with not long ago at the annual Fall Festival. Eight were children, and one victim wasn’t yet born. “It’s a good, simple community,” said Rod Green, Judy’s husband. Green said he got a call from the church pastor, who was out of town. “He said, ‘what’s going on,’ and I said, ‘what do you mean?’ He said, ‘there’s been a shooting at the church. Aren’t you there?'” By the time Green and his wife arrived, police and first responders were there. There were wounded people in the parking lot. The Greens tried to comfort the wounded, while ambulances crisscrossed the road outside. Helicopters landed nearby to fly the critically wounded to hospitals. “I saw a lot of stuff in Vietnam, and I never expected to see that type of thing here,” he said. And now there are outsiders in Sutherland Springs, who stick out by virtue of the fact that they’re asking questions during a time when people are pleading for answers from God. It’s difficult for any community that’s been blindsided by sudden horror to cope with grieving in the public eye. But for Sutherland Springs, population 600, it’s been a particular challenge for several reasons — not the least of which is the fact that it’s set in rural Texas, a stoic and insular place. Scores of media trucks, vans and cars have hunkered down at the town’s one major intersection (there are no stoplights here, only a flashing yellow). Anchormen did live shots near a flower-covered cross nailed to a post, while across the street, chaplains stood in a prayer circle next to a Frito-Lay truck in a gas station parking lot. Charlene Uhl, whose 16-year-old daughter Haley Krueger died last Sunday, has spent the days since the shooting at home, comforting her other three children and planning a funeral. She hasn’t wanted to leave her house because the town is crawling with reporters. The media attention “has made it harder,” she said. “It’s hard for me to talk about it.” It’s no exaggeration to say that reporters have knocked on almost every door in Sutherland Springs, seeking stories about the victims. Just a few days after Joe and Claryce Holcombe lost eight members of their family spanning three generations — including a son, grandchildren and great grandchildren — Mike Hopper stood guard outside the gate to the family’s ranch to keep the crush of media at bay. As Hopper talked with a reporter on Tuesday, family members drove up in a pickup truck and said they would soon be calling authorities to keep the media away. They lamented how journalists were staking out their relatives’ homes, depriving them of their peace and time to grieve. The word “vultures” was used. A shiny, new black-and-orange “No Trespassing” sign was stapled to the farm gate. Hopper said a woman from town drove around, handing them out. The signs sprouted in front of driveways and on fences all over the area. “There’s just a lot of emotion and protection,” Hopper said. It’s not that Sutherland Springs hasn’t weathered its share of tragedies. In the decades since people settled there in 1854 — the community was named after a doctor who treated soldiers at the Alamo — the town flooded, a high school burned down, and dozens were killed during a flu epidemic in 1919. But in recent decades, things have been quiet in this sleepy town southeast of San Antonio. It’s surrounded by rolling hills and cow pastures, and at night, overarched by vast Texas skies. “We ain’t got much news,” shrugged 84-year-old Richard Cardenas, who was born here and served as a county public works supervisor for decades. There was a flood in 1998, he recalled, and once, a woman with Alzheimer’s wandered into the woods and her body was found two months later. In 1993, the parents of Stephen Willeford were both killed in a motorcycle accident, said Cardenas’ wife, Theresa. (Willeford confronted Sunday’s attacker, shooting him, and has been hailed as a hero). The Cardenases were home Sunday when a friend called, wanting to know what was happening at the church. Richard Cardenas wept over the next few days as he watched his town’s tragedy played out on a television from a hospital bed in the family’s front room. He and his wife used to maintain the town cemetery, and now that duty’s fallen to his daughter Bertha and her husband. As a television anchor interviewed people about the shooting, Cardenas turned to his daughter and asked, “How many are they going to bury over there?” Bertha shook her head. “We don’t know yet.” She would be interviewed in The New York Times a few days later. Tambria Read, the teacher, says the presence of the media has put a certain pressure on the town, one it just isn’t used to. Live satellite trucks hum in the middle of town day and night as schoolkids pass by on buses, and white-hot lights illuminate the faces of the cable news hosts. “Did you look to the east sky and see the full moon this week?” she said. “The media’s lights have ruined the night sky.” ___ Associated Press writers Brian Skoloff and Emily Schmall contributed from Sutherland Springs.

It was lined and spiral-bound, nothing fancy, but perfect to 16-year-old Haley Krueger. On Sunday, Uhl dropped Haley off at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, where the teen regularly attended services. Haley arrived early so that she could help prepare breakfast for the parishioners, her mother said. She brought her new notebook along. The church had a special meaning to her daughter, Uhl said. Two years ago, Haley’s father died of pancreatic cancer, and the weekly youth group meetings carried her through difficult times. At some point on Sunday morning, Haley started to draw. On the first page of her notebook, she colored in pink hearts and sketched green crosses. “I accept God,” she wrote. “Take me away Jesus help me not hurt anymore.” That was the last communication Uhl would ever see from her daughter. A few hours after she left Haley with a kiss, Uhl received word that there had been a shooting. Haley was one of 26 people ― about a third of them children ― gunned down by Devin Patrick Kelley in the deadliest mass shooting in modern Texas history. On Thursday, Uhl stood on the road outside the church and stared at the line of wooden crosses erected in memory of the victims. Each one had a name, a red heart and a photo. “It’s unreal,” she told HuffPost. “No parent should have to bury their child.” Earlier that day, an FBI agent had returned Haley’s notebook to her because she kept asking for it. She was astonished when she saw what was on Haley’s mind before she died. She was thinking about heaven. She described her daughter as a vibrant and happy child who loved to help others. It was Haley’s dream to become a nurse and work in a neonatal intensive care unit, Uhl said. The two of them liked to watch television together and bond. “She’d make me watch Grey’s Anatomy,” Uhl said. “She was behind, and she realized that she liked the show, so she was going through all the seasons. And every night she’d be watching it in my bedroom.” Uhl has barely slept since she heard the news; when she tries, she has nightmares. “She went through a horrible tragedy,” she said about Haley. “I close my eyes and that’s all I see.” For now, Uhl said she is staying indoors and trying to help her three other children cope with the loss of their sibling. She was also busy planning the arrangements for her daughter’s funeral. A friend has launched an online fundraiser to cover some of the costs. But when she heard about all the white crosses she wanted to see them, so she made her way to the church. After HuffPost interviewed Uhl, she stood in front of the memorial by herself for a long time. She had nothing else to say. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"

SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas — Two white hearses carrying the bodies of a couple killed in last weekend’s Texas church shooting were followed by a long procession of vehicles Saturday evening that avoided passing the church, where more than two dozen people were fatally shot. Mourners instead drove around the tiny community of Sutherland Springs before reaching a small cemetery on the edge of town, where dozens more vehicles waited along a rural road for the private burial of Therese and Richard Rodriguez. Sheriff’s SUVs shielded mourners at the cemetery’s three entrances. The services for the recently retired couple followed a ceremony earlier in the day where about 100 people gathered to commemorate Veterans Day and to honor the shooting victims, nearly half of whom had ties to the Air Force. “Maybe this will start the healing process that will get Sutherland Springs and Wilson County to put this horrific tragedy behind us and look to the future,” county Judge Richard Jackson, his voice breaking, told the crowd, which included first responders and law enforcement officers. Jackson, the county’s top administrator, thanked the first responders and others who rushed to First Baptist Church in the aftermath of Sunday’s shooting. What they saw there will affect them the rest of their lives, Jackson said during the ceremony outside the town’s community center, where a wreath was placed near flags to remember those killed.

Greg Abbott during a candlelight vigil held for the victims of a fatal shooting at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Sunday, Nov. 5, 2017, in Sutherland Springs, Texas.  The gunman killed 25 people — authorities put the number at 26 because one was pregnant — and wounded about 20 others. The gunman died of what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound after being shot and chased by two men who heard gunfire from the church. Investigators have said the shooting appeared to stem from a domestic dispute involving the attacker, Devin Patrick Kelley, and his mother-in-law, who sometimes attended services at the church but wasn’t there the day of the shooting. Kelley had a history of domestic violence: He was given a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force after pleading guilty to assaulting his first wife and stepson. Sutherland Springs is about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southeast of San Antonio and not far from several military posts, including Lackland Air Force Base. The Air Force’s chief of staff, Gen. David Goldfein, said 12 of those killed were either members of the Air Force or had family ties to it. Among them were Scott and Karen Marshall, both 56, who had decided to retire in nearby La Vernia after meeting when they were in the service together more than 30 years ago. On Thursday, a military funeral was held for them at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph. Retired Chief Warrant Officer Mike Gonzales, who led Saturday’s Veterans Day ceremony, moved to Sutherland Springs with his wife to raise their children in 2009. He said many veterans choose to live in the San Antonio area because of its deep military ties, and families tend to migrate to the city’s surrounding rural areas. “We come here to enjoy life, to get quiet and to raise our children,” he said. “We’ve been to war zones and seen that tragedy firsthand. Never did we think that tragedy would strike here.” U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar told the gathering to lean on one another for support. The Texas congressman said $10 million in federal assistance has been secured to help cover overtime costs for law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation. Some in the crowd Saturday wore shirts that said “Sutherland Springs Strong” and included an outline of Texas with a heart of the town’s location. The shirts were donated by Brenda Bierd, who lives on the Gulf Coast and whose home was damaged by Hurricane Harvey in late August. “I hadn’t even heard of Sutherland Springs before the shooting, but this is what you do,” she said. “I just had this feeling I needed to be here.” A steady stream of people also visited a makeshift memorial of crosses adorned with flowers, photographs, red hearts and white, purple and pink balloons. Among the visitors was Jackie Lee, who said she asked her friends on Facebook if anyone would come with her from San Antonio this weekend. She said about two dozen people quickly said they would. “It was on my heart since it happened,” she said. “I needed to come to show the community some support, to show these people some support.”  Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts"

Davis opened the op-ed with a sampling of this week’s news headlines, about the mass shooting in Sutherland Springs that left 26 dead, as well as other shootings in Plano and North Austin. The Sutherland Springs and Plano mass shootings both involved domestic violence in some capacity. “While gun safety may not seem like a feminist issue at first blush, it doesn’t take too much digging to see that women are uniquely vulnerable to and disproportionately the victims of gun violence,” Davis wrote. She cited the harrowing statistics that show how seriously women are affected by gun violence (54 percent of mass shootings, for example, involve domestic violence), and wrote about how important it is that women to take their rage to the ballot box. “Virginia and New Jersey voters just kicked a whole string of NRA-ass-kissing elected officials out of office and replaced them with governors and legislative members who are committed to common-sense gun-safety measures,” she wrote about Tuesday’s elections. Those voters, she said, were “propelled by” women-led groups that work to end gun violence, like Moms Demand Action and Americans for Responsible Solutions, led by former Congresswoman and mass shooting survivor Gabby Giffords. “A wise lawmaker once said to me, ‘Change happens when mama bear gets mad,’” Davis wrote. “Well, in the face of repeated mass shootings around the country and the human carnage left in their wake, mama bear is fire-engine-red mad right now. And she’s not backing down.” Head over to Cosmo to read the whole piece. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the name of the Texas city in which there was a recent mass shooting.

If it’s destroyed, the church will follow in the footsteps of other mass shooting sites that have been razed and rebuilt. Frank Pomeroy, pastor of the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, told leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention that the church building held painful memories for his congregation. Steve Gaines, president of the SBC, and Frank Page, president and CEO of the SBC’s executive committee, visited Sutherland Springs on Tuesday to meet with Pomeroy and his wife. “As he’s thinking through what the future will look like, the pastor expressed his personal desire that the current worship center be razed and perhaps a prayer garden be put on the site and a new church build on the property,” SBC spokesperson Roger Oldham told HuffPost. That decision is ultimately up to the congregation, Oldham said. A spokesperson for the church told HuffPost that it was too early to say what the congregation would decide to do with the building. “They did say, ‘We can’t go back in there,’” Page told Religion News Service, referring to surviving members of the church’s congregation. “It’s going to be a reminder of the horrific violence against innocent people.” Pomeroy and his wife were not at the church on Sunday, but their 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle, was among the victims. Roughly half of those killed were children. Crystal Holcombe, who was eight months pregnant, was also among the victims. The ages of the wounded and dead ranged from 18 months to 77 years, in addition to Holcombe’s fetus. A witness told San Antonio TV station KENS 5 that the fatalities accounted for about half of the church’s congregation. In the town of just 600 people, the death toll amounted to roughly four percent of Sutherland Springs’ population. Sheriff Joe Tackitt Jr. of Wilson County, where Sutherland Springs is located, said deputies found “blood everywhere” when they arrived at the church. “Wherever you walked in the church, there was death,” he told The New York Times. Oldham said it was Pomeroy’s “personal desire for the congregation to move forward and not have to return to that scene of devastation.” There’s a precedent for demolishing and rebuilding sites following mass shootings. Columbine High School in Colorado, the site of a 1999 mass shooting that left 13 people dead, was renovated to replace bullet-ridden carpeting and ceiling tiles. The school library, where 10 of the victims were killed, was razed and replaced with a glass atrium. A schoolhouse in Nickel Mines, Pa., where five Amish girls were murdered in 2006, was torn down 10 days after the shooting. A new building was erected nearby six months later. Virginia Tech’s Norris Hall, where many of the victims of the 2007 mass shooting were killed, was partially shut down and underwent major renovations. It reopened two years later. The Utoya, Norway church youth camp where 69 people, many of them teenagers, were killed by a gunman in 2011 was largely renovated and many of the building rebuilt. A steel memorial engraved with the victims’ names was hung from pine trees overlooking the adjacent Tyrifjorden lake. Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., was demolished after the mass shooting that left 20 children and six adults dead in 2012. The new school building opened in 2016. Of the houses of worship that have become sites of mass shootings in recent years ― including Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C., the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church in Knoxville, and The Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in Oak Creek ― none have been demolished. But their congregations have found other ways to reclaim the space and move forward. Michelle Walsh, a Unitarian Universalist minister, conducted research at the Knoxville Unitarian Universalist Church following a 2008 shooting in the sanctuary. “I have said sometimes there is a fierceness for survivors who say, ‘We have survived this and we have a faith that survives even in the face of something like this,’” Walsh told RNS. The congregation repainted the church’s walls, removed but saved a bullet-ridden curtain, and rededicated the sanctuary to bless the spots where the shooting’s two victims were killed. Walsh said: “It is a reclaiming and it is a marking of a place as not just a place of death, not just a place of loss, but of life.” Hayley Miller and Damon Dahlen contributed to this article.

I’m still feeling horrified by the killing of 26 children and adults that occurred just down the road from my home on Sunday. I’m equally horrified by how quickly my mind has wandered to other things like how much laundry I have to do or the e-mails I need to return. My brain tells me that this is the new normal; that I need to just accept that dying by mass shooting is an American thing now. But my heart screams out, “No! We have to do more.” I keep hearing that we have a “mental health problem,” not a gun problem. So here’s my question: Why do we lead the WORLD in public mass shootings (and that’s not including gang-related violence) when there are plenty of mental health issues and mental health diagnoses in other countries? As a mental health professional, I can tell you that my clients are far more likely to be the victims of violence rather than perpetrators. However, let’s just say that a potential shooter is struggling with a mental health crisis. If they do reach out for help, chances are that their insurance won’t cover the counseling or psychiatric care. We as a nation decreased drunk driving by 51 percent since 1982. We as a nation have decreased the incidence of SIDS by 50 percent since 1988. We as a nation prohibited and recalled 11 million drop-side cribs after the suffocation and strangulation deaths of 32 infants. We, as a nation, MUST find ways to decrease gun deaths and eliminate horrific mass shootings. We can do it. This issue is complex. It is non-partisan and there are no simple answers in a country that is saturated with firearms. So, instead of continuing my rant, I’ve decided to focus on what I CAN do. And here are the tough ones… These are things I CAN do and I will do. We need to keep talking about this.

http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/nov/12/maybe-it-s-time-to-get-a-gun-20171112/,"We're outnumbered. There are more firearms than people in this country now. In 2015, the Washington Post guessed there were 357 millions guns and 317 million people. There's probably more than that, for the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms data they relied upon only cover legal guns. Unregistered firearms are just that, phantoms floating across state and national borders. Nobody knows how many. No serious person is considering confiscating them. The only way you're going to take some people's guns is at gunpoint. And people with guns can point them right back at you. Even so, most people in this country don't have much to do with guns; only about a third of households in the U.S. have any. Around here, the percentage is somewhat higher. One study had it at about 57 percent in 2013, which made Arkansas No. 2 in gun ownership rates behind Alaska, at 61 percent. A lot of them are what I'd call casual gun owners, the sort of people who might keep a .22 rifle in a closet or a .38 in the drawer of a bedside table but never think much about them. They don't hunt or go to shooting ranges. But there are also a lot of Arkansans who duck hunt or deer hunt, who might have a couple of pricey long guns they lock away in safes. You might not have a gun in your house, but your friends and neighbors do. The topic probably doesn't come up often in casual conversation. On the other hand, there are also people who really like guns. I've known a few of them. I've gone out in the woods with some of them and chopped up targets and small trees with them. I can understand their enthusiasm, for there's something beautiful in a well-made tool; a sense of satisfaction available in the balanced, greasy precision of a good weapon. Add in its lethal potential and the understanding that for hundreds of years real heroes have used similar instruments in noble struggles for worthwhile things all over this blighted planet and yes, it's possible to work up a solemn emotional attachment to a hunk of iron and wood or bakelite. I don't think we need to worry about these folks, though some of them seem to be overly susceptible to the sales pitches and scare tactics of the National Rifle Association, which after spending a few decades functioning as the marketing arm of the gun and ammo industry has recently branched out into general right-wing paranoid politics. (With Barack Obama out of office and Hillary Clinton defeated, they've had to step up their search for bogeypeople and have started producing their own streaming content, demonizing immigrants, liberals and the ""violent left"" that wants to punch self-proclaimed Nazis in the throat. ) I don't know anyone who'd argue that the vast majority of gun owners are decent people. They've just made a choice to exercise their right to own a firearm. They don't have to explain themselves. While there's probably a discussion to be had about what weapons are appropriate for individuals to own (we already restrict fully automatic weapons), while we might be able to require people who own dangerous instruments to carry liability insurance or to stop the sale of high-capacity magazines, unless you're a felon or mentally ill you have a right to own a gun. And you should have that right. But that right was given you by a group of old-timey white men rebelling against governmental authority, not by God. Just because we invoke God doesn't mean we speak for him. God has always been silent on the issue of gun rights. Nothing in our Constitution is scripture. Gun rights are pretty much an American idea. Which doesn't necessarily mean it's the best idea, only that it's a product of our culture and history. Other countries do just fine without their citizens enjoying an enshrined right to a killing appliance. Some people like to suggest that we're not that different from other countries in terms of the number of firearms per capita. They'll say there are a lot of guns in Canada and Switzerland too, but they don't have the sort of problems with mass shooting that we do, so it must be that there's something sick and desperate in our culture that causes our problems. Some facts: There are a lot of guns in Canada and Switzerland relative to most of the world. But there are more than three times as many guns per capita in the U.S. than in Canada; more than four times as many guns per capita than in Switzerland. There are almost twice as many guns per capita in the U.S. as there are in the second-place country, which is Serbia. (We have about 113 guns per 100 people. Serbia has about 58.) But these people aren't entirely wrong. There is something sick and desperate in our culture. And part of that manifests in the toxic, erotic attachment a certain class of gun owners hold for their weapons. These are the folks who revel in gun porn and imagine themselves good guys who would stop the massacres that now occur on a weekly basis in the country. I know that whenever I address the subject--and I've been writing basically the same column about guns in America now for about 30 years--I'm going to hear from them. They're going to tell me about all the times they've prevented crimes by pulling their guns out in public (four times, one correspondent assured me). They insist that folks who mistakenly call AR-15s assault rifles are idiots who ought to have no standing in any debate about how we move forward on this issue. These are the real gun nuts, and they exist. They're the ones who buy all those cool military-looking non-assault rifles and the bullets to feed them. They're the ones with tactical body armor and bump stocks. They're the ones who fantasize about being good guys. They're the ones who get their feelings hurt and shoot up churches. Who deny the reality of Sandy Hook and Las Vegas. Who insist their rights trump your kid's life. And they're right. You get the thoughts and prayers; the NRA gets the legislation it wants. It's just business. You can't rely on government to help you, you got to exercise some self-reliance, son. So get yourself a gun. pmartin@arkansasonline.com Read more at www.blooddirtangels.com Editorial on 11/12/2017 Print Headline: Maybe it's time to get a gun Copyright © 2021, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/nov/12/california-program-on-guns-in-spotlight/,"SAN JOSE, Calif. -- It's difficult to keep guns away from ex-cons and the mentally disturbed, but a one-of-a-kind California program is designed to do just that. And in light of the Texas church shooting that left 26 dead, some are debating whether a program like it could have thwarted Devin Kelley's murderous rampage. The Armed and Prohibited Persons System program, proposed in 1999 and updated in 2006, makes California the only state in the country to establish an automated system for tracking firearm owners and to provide the legal authority to proactively disarm convicted criminals, people with certain mental illnesses, and others deemed dangerous. Supporters like Richard Aborn say programs like that one need to be replicated in other states given the increased frequency of mass shootings. Aborn is president of the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City and an architect of the defunct federal assault weapons ban, as well as the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which implemented routine federal background checks for gun purchasers. ""What we saw on [Nov. 5] is what happens when a deranged individual has possession of lawful firearms,"" Aborn said. ""Every time [the Armed and Prohibited Persons System] is enforced and guns are returned, we're preventing a tragedy. Mass shootings are a form of domestic terror. We should equip citizens to prevent mass shootings as much as we can."" But the program has endured periodic criticism since its inception. A lack of resources has prevented the California Department of Justice from keeping up with the backlog of prohibited people. And gun-rights advocates have said uneven administration of the policy is unduly infringing on Second Amendment rights. The biggest challenge is that a large number of people are not supposed to be in the program, said Craig DeLuz, spokesman for the Firearms Policy Coalition and the Calguns Foundation. DeLuz and fellow advocates say a big problem with the system is that there's no quick way to remove someone's name once his court-ordered weapon restriction ends. ""There is no guarantee that when your time is up, your name is going to be removed,"" DeLuz said. ""A big part is simply keeping up with the system and doing basic administration that could really make a difference."" Aborn acknowledges that the execution of the program can always be improved, but that should not be taken as an indictment of its broader policy aims. ""If the test of the validity of government programs is they act 100 percent perfectly, there would be no government programs. We'd never do anything,"" he said. ""We can do better, but just because we can't do everything doesn't mean we can't do everything we can."" In late 2006, California set up a database to track firearms owners and cross-reference those names with criminal and mental-health records to identify individuals ""who have been, or will become, prohibited from possessing a firearm subsequent to the legal acquisition or registration of a firearm or assault weapon."" The trouble is, the list of those people grew faster than the state could take away guns from those who shouldn't have them. In 2013, after the Sandy Hook shootings in Connecticut, there were more than 20,000 people on the prohibited list who had never been contacted by the state. In response, the state Legislature granted $24 million to the state Department of Justice to hire more agents to reduce the backlog. Those growing pains appear to have subsided -- to a degree. According to the latest Armed and Prohibited Persons System report released in March, the number of individuals in the database prohibited from owning firearms in calendar year 2016 grew by more than 14 percent, in large part because the state expanded its data-collection beyond handguns to include long guns like shotguns and rifles. But overall the number of people in the database was cut from 12,691 on Jan. 1, 2016, to ""an historic low of 10,634 subjects,"" according to the report. The last time the database contained so few subjects was February 2008, the report stated. In 2016, the Armed and Prohibited Persons System enforcement program completed 9,183 investigations, resulting in 511 arrests and the seizure of 3,954 firearms. Other significant seizures include 947,653 rounds of ammunition, 3,742 magazines, and 663 large-capacity magazines. Challenges remain, especially when it comes to hiring enough agents to knock on the doors of everyone on the Armed and Prohibited Persons System list. According to the 2016 report, the program got 36 limited-term agent positions, 10 of which the state Department of Justice was able to fill last calendar year. With the Texas church shooting, attention is once again focused on California's unique campaign to get guns away from people who shouldn't have them. In Kelley's case, the U.S. Air Force admitted that it had failed to submit his domestic-violence conviction to a federal database after he was discharged from the military. That conviction could have prevented him from buying the rifle he used -- although only in California might it have led authorities to seize guns he already had. The military's failure to enter his name into the National Criminal Information Center, a federal database, apparently allowed Kelley to pass several background checks and buy the firearms. The lapse fueled the ongoing push-back from gun-rights groups about California's gun-confiscation policy. ""What we saw in Texas is what happens when unfortunately one government agency doesn't do its job,"" DeLuz said, adding that nationalizing a policy like the Armed and Prohibited Persons System, and trying to unite assorted record-keeping and registration standards from state to state, would only worsen the situation. ""We wouldn't let someone's free speech or property rights be violated in the same way we do with the Second Amendment,"" he added. Aborn said imperfection does not justify inaction, particularly by Congress, which has the ""moral imperative"" to invoke changes in an era where mass shootings have become more frequent. He noted that since the federal assault weapons ban that he helped craft was rescinded in 2004 after a decade, the number of mass shootings has nearly tripled to at least 30, and the number of mass-shooting victims has increased more than fivefold to nearly 1,000.

http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-sutherland-springs-texas-sunday-church-20171112-story.html,"SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, TEXAS — Hundreds of mourners crowded into the tiny town of Sutherland Springs for the first Sunday service since a gunman stormed the First Baptist Church a week earlier, killing more than two dozen people in the worst mass shooting in Texas history. After an emotional sermon held outdoors under a massive white tent, congregants and the public were invited to return to the church for the first time since the tragedy. A chilling memorial set up inside the church included 26 white chairs — including one for the unborn baby of a victim who was pregnant — bearing each victim's name or nickname painted in gold. Pastor Frank Pomeroy shared his personal heartache and a message that the community bound together by faith can move past the evil that attacked the church seven days earlier. ""Rather than choose darkness as that young man did that day, we choose life,"" Pomeroy said during the service, his voice cracking as he spoke about his 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle, who was among those killed in the Nov. 5 rampage. ""I know everyone who gave their life that day,"" he said, pausing to gather himself. ""Some of whom were my best friends and my daughter."" He wiped his eyes, then added, ""I guarantee they are dancing with Jesus today."" Initially, the church had planned to hold Sunday's service at an adjacent community center, which can accommodate a few dozen people. But when organizers realized hundreds planned to attend, the service was moved to a massive white tent erected in a baseball field. So many people turned up that the tent's side flaps had to be opened for an overflow crowd so that those who couldn't get a seat could see and hear what was going on inside. Mark Collins, a previous pastor at First Baptist, said it was the largest gathering in the church's 100-year history. The front three rows were reserved for survivors of the attack and the families of those killed. Many arrived early, as a steady rain fell on the tarp roof, offering hugs to each other and prayers. Congregants wept during the service and a moving version of ""Amazing Grace,"" led by three singers and a man on guitar, as the voices of hundreds sang along. Some bowed their heads, others raised their hands and swayed as the music played, and tears streamed down their faces. ""Amazing Grace"" was also played at halftime at Floresville High School at Friday night's game, in tribute to the victims. Later Sunday, the First Baptist Church opened its doors for the first time since the shooting. The inside had been transformed into a memorial with its walls, floor and pulpit painted white. Broken windows and ceiling tiles had been replaced and bullet holes filled. The church's pews, the carpet and all equipment had been removed. All that filled the space were the 26 white chairs, each with a red rose tied to it except for one that had a pink rose for the unborn baby. A line of about 85 people snaked from the church entrance and curved around the block, including people who traveled from as far away as the East Coast, said Collins, the church's former pastor who has returned to help in the tragedy's aftermath. Constructing the memorial wasn't an easy decision, he said. Some members have said they never wanted to step foot inside the site, he said, while others have said they needed to see it. Next Sunday's service is expected to take place on the grounds of the church, likely in a makeshift structure, Collins said. Church members will have to decide whether to demolish the church, as some have said is likely, he said, but plans are also being discussed to build a new structure nearby. The gunman, Devin Patrick Kelley, went aisle to aisle looking for victims and shot crying babies at point-blank range, according to witness accounts. The dead ranged in age from 18 months to 77 years old. About 20 people were wounded in the shooting. Kelley died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound after he was shot and chased by two men who heard the gunfire at the church. Investigators have said the attack appeared to stem from a domestic dispute involving Kelley and his mother-in-law, who sometimes attended services at the church but wasn't there the day of the shooting. Kelley had a history of domestic violence: He was given a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force after pleading guilty to assaulting his first wife and stepson. The church has reached out to Kelley's family and was praying for them, Collins said. ""Our hearts and prayers go out to his family,"" he added. For Sunday's service, people from other churches dropped off handmade prayer cloths and tiny wooden crosses, among other gifts. Mental health organizations provided tissues and brought therapy dogs to the service. Republican Sen. John Cornyn spoke at the service, saying lives were stolen as darkness overtook one man's heart. ""The pain of losing 26 members is overwhelming,"" Cronyn said. ""Many lives have been changed forever. ... I can't imagine what you've been grappling with ever since.""

SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas – The Latest on the Texas town recovering from last weekend's mass shooting at a church (all times local): 5:45 p.m. A line of about 85 people snaked from the entrance of the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs and curved around the block as the house of worship opened its doors to the public at 5 p.m. for the first time since a deadly shooting last Sunday. Associate Pastor Mark Collins says people traveled from as far away as the East Coast to pray at the site of the shooting. He says that while they will be allowed inside the church to take part in the memorial, it was set up with members in mind. Collins says constructing the memorial wasn't an easy decision because some members have said they never wanted to again step foot in the place where they lost so many friends or family members. But, he says, other members and family of those who were killed needed to see the church. He says the memorial was a way to honor the victims without focusing on the shooting. He says the church has reached out to the family of shooter Devin Kelley, and that church members are praying for Kelley's family. The congregation will hold services on the grounds of the church next week. Collins says those services likely will take place in a makeshift structure. He says church members will have to decide whether to demolish the church, but plans are also being discussed to build a new structure nearby. ___ 4:45 p.m. A Texas church where more than two dozen people were killed in the deadliest shooting in the state's history has opened its doors to congregants and the public for the first time since the tragedy. The inside of First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs had been transformed into a memorial when it was opened Sunday, one week later. Broken windows and ceiling tiles had been replaced. Bullet holes were filled. But the vibrant church's sandy stained pews, the carpet and all equipment had been removed. The walls, floor and pulpit were painted white. Twenty-six white chairs — including one for the unborn baby of one victim who was pregnant — were placed where each congregant was sitting when they were shot. A red rose was tied to each chair, and a pink rose for the unborn baby. Names or nicknames were painted in gold on each chair. A recording of scripture readings from a previous church service played as small groups of people walked around the room silently. ___ 2 p.m. Organizers say their fundraiser barbecue has raised more than $50,000 for the families of those killed in a mass shooting at a Texas church. Mike Ritch, a chef who co-founded Smokin' Angels BBQ Ministry after Hurricane Harvey battered the Texas coast, said Sunday that the exact tally hadn't been determined but that it exceeded the group's $50,000 goal ""by some portion."" He says the group wants to notify the families before announcing the total raised by the weekend event, which was held at St. Mark's Lutheran Church in Adkins, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from Sutherland Springs. Plates were priced at $10, but Ritch said dozens of people came through the line and paid more for to-go orders. He says all of the money will go directly to the families. ___ 1:15 p.m. Congregants have departed crying and hugging one another after the first worship service since last week's mass shooting at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The service Sunday was expected to draw about 500 people. It attracted an overflow crowd to a tent set up a baseball field in the small South Texas town that became the scene of the worst mass shooting in Texas history. Children also attending began playing on the baseball field as people at a community building are preparing to feed about 350, including families and survivors of the shooting. Former Pastor Mark Collins says next week's service will be held at the church site. ___ 12:50 p.m. The former pastor at the Sutherland Springs, Texas, church where a gunman opened fire a week ago says the first service since the worst mass shooting in Texas history is the most attended in the congregation's 100-year history. Former Pastor Mark Collins says the First Baptist Church ""is still alive"" and is encouraging people to give themselves to Christ. He says those who died would want those supporting them now to stand up and give themselves to Christ. Church officials had expected about 500 people to attend Sunday's service but dozens more chairs were added. The flaps on the sides of a tent that's serving as the worship site had to be lifted so hundreds more outside could see and hear. Collins says there's hope, saying it's only been seven days since the shooting and ""already this community is back to worship, bound together by faith."" ___ 12:40 p.m. The pastor of a small Texas church says evil was responsible for the worst mass shooting in the state's history. Frank Pomeroy spoke during the congregation's first Sunday service since last weekend's shooting that killed more than two-dozen people at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs. Pomeroy says he wanted to ensure everyone who walked in to the service ""knows that those who died lived for their Lord and savior."" He says rather than chose darkness as the gunman did seven days ago, ""we choose life."" The congregation held the service at a baseball field, setting up folding chairs under a large white tent. Pomeroy's voice cracked as he paused, and described the victims as ""my best friends and my daughter."" Then he wiped his eyes before saying: ""I guarantee they are dancing with Jesus today."" The crowd stood, clapped and raised their hands to heaven. ___ 11:10 a.m. Organizers have set up hundreds of folding chairs under a large white tent on the baseball field in Sutherland Springs, Texas, for the first Sunday service since last weekend's mass shooting at the First Baptist Church. The front three rows are reserved for First Baptist Church members and their families, as a steady rain falls on the tarp roof while church-goers slowly file in. Some are hugging and others are praying or sitting quietly. People from other churches have dropped off handmade presents such as prayer cloths and tiny wooden crosses and mental health organizations have provided tissues and brought therapy dogs to the service. Initial plans called for gathering at a community center that could house a few dozen people. But when organizers realized about 500 people were planning to attend, the service was moved outside.

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/488634436/0/phoenix/suns~Slow-starts-in-both-halves-doom-Suns-in-loss-to-Spurs/,"SAN ANTONIO – At the end of a long five-game, 10-day road trip the last thing the Suns could afford to do was exhaust themselves playing catch-up basketball against the San Antonio Spurs. They managed it once. But twice? That was too much to ask, and Phoenix limped home with a 112-95 loss to a Spurs team Sunday that didn’t have Kawhi Leonard, Tony Parker or Manu Ginobili. The Suns went 2-3 on the road trip but their final three games all had something in common – poor starts. Phoenix fell behind by 17 points against the Washington Wizards after the first quarter before rallying to win. They trailed the Knicks by 15. On Sunday, it was 28-21 Spurs after 12 minutes. Thanks to 26 points from its bench – including 11 first-half points from Troy Daniels – Phoenix actually had enough juice to not only get back in the game but lead 55-51 at halftime. But as soon as the starters came back on the floor to start the third quarter, the game turned. The Spurs scored the first 12 points of the quarter to take a 63-55 lead and from there the rout was on. Phoenix had nothing left in the tank. The lead grew to 27 before the Suns closed the gap in garbage time. So the question: What can Phoenix do about those slow starts? “I thought we were pretty good in the first quarter,” interim coach Jay Triano said. “I thought we battled early. The third quarter was the big one. We knew they were going to come out after us after having a lead at halftime. Sure enough they guarded and things and we had a hard time scoring in the third quarter.” The Suns were outscored 34-13 in the third quarter but the more important numbers were the struggles of the starters. Devin Booker had a season-low nine points on 3-of-11 shooting, point guard Mike James was 2 for 7 through three quarters and Marquese Chriss had just three points and three rebounds in 19 minutes. Phoenix’s starters were outscored 61-46. Triano didn’t indicate he’d make any changes to his starting lineup. Instead, he was more focused on the Suns letting their offensive struggles dictate their defense. “We can’t get discouraged when we miss open shots,” he said. “You’re going to miss some. I thought we had great looks, missed open shots and we don’t really guard as well as we’re supposed to on the other end and we don’t really run back the same way. We have to be able to handle adversity a little better than we did. It’s mental toughness. Put the misses aside and say, ‘OK we have to make another stop.’ ” T.J. Warren, who led Phoenix with 17 points, thought the Suns got impatient offensively. “We just have to do a better job at being disciplined and if a person’s second option isn’t there the team has to run the offense even in a bad situation throughout the possession,” he said. “We have to stay disciplined for the whole 24 seconds.” It didn’t help that the fatigued Suns were facing a Spurs team that, even without Leonard, Parker and Ginobili, still can take offenses out of their game. Every time Booker came off a screen, the Spurs bodied him up in an attempt to wear him down, something Triano said, “We’re trying to teach.” “Their defensive scheme, they don’t change it much but they know what they are doing and they are all on the same page,” Booker said. One Spur who didn’t take any enjoyment from the win was coach Gregg Popovich. The Sutherland Springs, Texas church that was the scene of a mass shooting Sunday is about 40 miles from San Antonio. “We won a basketball game but considering everything that has gone on today it is pretty meaningless,” Popovich said. “When you think about the tragedy of those families that are suffering, it is just inconceivable and impossible to wrap your head around. Talking about basketball tonight is pretty inappropriate.” RELATED: NBA fines Suns guard Eric Bledsoe $10K for tweet MORE: Warren in Suns' starting lineup after suffering head injury "

Swift, Contributing Photographer)  Chase Rice was performing “Everybody We Know Does” on Saturday night when he paused to emphasize one verse’s heightened relevance after the mass shooting last month in Las Vegas. Then the Driftwood Festival headliner told the large crowd, “That’s what country music’s all about. When you get knocked down, you get back up.” Many concertgoers in Dana Point wore Route 91 Harvest Festival hats, T-shirts and “Vegas Strong” slogans. Since it was Veteran’s Day, artists like Lit and A Thousand Horses thanked military personnel everywhere. Two local vets were also brought onstage between sets and saluted. Alcohol tastings (mostly craft beer, but also wine and vodka) were a big draw at the fest and long booth lines near the sand held steady through the afternoon. At one point, a dozen concert-goers line danced in the rear concourse area. Rice made an immediate impact with a hard-hitting band often reminiscent of Metallica. He opened with the ominous Fall Out Boy-styled “Lions,” from upcoming album “Lambs & Lions, due Nov. 17. The rap-style cadence of “50 Shades of Crazy” went down well. The set fared better when the mood shifted – and actually sounded country – on acoustic guitar-based latest single “Three Chords & the Truth” and another memorable new one, “Eyes on You.” Sensual hits “Gonna Wanna Tonight” and “Ride” drove female fans crazy. Rice jokingly sang directly to a pal’s girlfriend on the latter while seated on stools. Florida Georgia Line’s “Cruise,” his first big success as a co-writer, drew a hearty response. Later, as the evening wound down, band introductions led into bits of Blink-182 songs. “This is the most beautiful show I’ve been part of; my heart is bursting with joy,” said Frankie Ballard, the Driftwood MVP. Far better than at Stagecoach ’15, the Michigan native emerged to Rufus Thomas’s 1953 Sun Records tune “Tiger Man (King of the Jungle)” and a revving engine sound. A similar charge ran through his set, with ample displays of Ballard’s electric guitar prowess and mighty drummer Travis McNabb (Sugarland, Better Than Ezra). Standouts included country airplay chart toppers “Young & Crazy,” “Helluva Life” and “Sunshine & Whisky” (all hearty audience singalongs), “It Started with a Beer” (the popular hit off 2016’s underrated “El Rio”) and a fine bluesy medley of “Hound Dog/Heartbreak Hotel.” Cassadee Pope’s ebullient performance began with one of her best-known songs, “I Wish I Could Break Your Heart.” The audience responded loudly to “Think of You,” the No. 1 recording with Chris Young (done here as a duet with the guitarist), but they were far less attentive to midtempo fare, several unreleased numbers and unfortunately a riveting solo acoustic cover of Keith Urban’s “Stupid Boy” – initially done when Pope won NBC’s “The Voice.” Fullerton band Lit, always solid live, previewed promising new material from a new album scheduled next month, including a thought-provoking “Fast” (whose video did well at CMT), the earthy “Just Feels Right,” “All Eyes on Us” and “Real Good Problem” (where leader A. Jay Popoff coaxed co-writer Michael Hobby of A Thousand Horses onstage to sing a few bars). Popoff had no trouble getting the crowd excited, especially during closer “My Own Worst Enemy.” A Thousand Horses’ delivered soulful Southern country/rock with fervor. Locking into a groove from the get-go with “Burn Like Willie,” the foursome seldom let up on the power, from the catchy, newer “Blaze of Something,” The Faces-styled “First Time” and spiritual vibe of “Sunday Morning” to the memorable radio faves “Smoke” and “(This Ain’t No) Drunk Dial.”  Caroline Jones, who hosts a SiriusXM radio show, put out the “Bare Feet” EP over the summer and recently toured with Zac Brown Band. The multi-instrumentalist’s pleasant set was most notable for “Worth the Wait,” which nicely segued into Loggins and Messina’s “Danny’s Song” and “Old Blue,” a 19th-century folk ballad in which Jones showed off her wide vocal range with producer Ric Wake watching near the soundboard. Mark Mackay lived up to the unenviable task of playing to early arrivals. The San Francisco native’s current album “Trials and Tribulations” is one of the best indie releases I’ve heard all year. Backed by a band that included a lap steel player, Mackay dazzled with his electric guitar work. Standouts included the rousing “Mustang,” a John Mellencamp-styled “Settle for a Small Town,” an affecting “I Can’t Stop You” (co-written by country heavy hitter Jeffrey Steele) and winning cover of Jackson Browne’s “Running on Empty.” With: Chase Rice, Frankie Ballard, Cassadee Pope, A Thousand Horses, Lit, Caroline Jones, Mark Mackay When: Saturday Where: Doheny State Beach, 25300 Dana Point Harbor Drive, Dana Point Next: Music starts at 1 p.m. today (Sunday), with Kip Moore, Dan + Shay, Maddie & Tae, Canaan Smith, Raelynn, Gethen Jenkins, $49-$129 VIP, www.driftwoodfest.com   Get the latest news delivered daily!

http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-texas-church-shooter-ex-wife-20171112-story.html,"NEW BRAUNFELS, TEXAS — The former wife of the man responsible for killing 26 people in a Texas church last week said he had threatened to kill her over the course of their relationship, once putting a gun to her head and asking her whether she wanted to die. The comments, the first public statements made by gunman Kelley's first wife, Tessa Brennaman, add to the growing portrait of Devin Kelley as an unstable young man whose path through life was marked by disruption, anger and the potential for violence. In an interview with ""Inside Edition"" published in part on CBS' website, Brennaman, 25, described her former husband as someone with ""a lot of demons or hatred inside of him"" and said he once threatened her for getting a speeding ticket. ""He had a gun in his holster right here and he took that gun out and he put it to my temple and he said, 'Do you want to die, do you want to die?' "" she told a television interviewer. Kelley's treatment of Brennaman, then Tessa Kelley, during their marriage has come into harsh focus in the aftermath of the mass shooting — the worst in Texas history — leaving unanswered questions about how the conviction and prison sentence he was given for domestic abuse against her and her son were not reported to federal authorities. Brennaman and Kelley divorced after the incident, which resulted in him being court-martialed and sentenced to a year of confinement. The domestic violence charges should have prevented him from being able to buy the guns he used in the shooting, the Air Force said. Other information about Kelley's turbulent life has emerged in recent days. Officials in New Braunfels, where Kelley lived with his family, have been unable to explain why his court file is marked with a yellow flag, which denotes psychiatric issues, in their digital records. ""We can't figure out who put it in and why,"" the county's sheriff, Mark Reynolds, said. Records released by the New Braunfels Independent School District show that Kelley racked up a lengthy disciplinary record in high school, including seven suspensions for falsifying records, insubordination, profanity and a drug-related offense. He graduated 260th in a class of 393 in 2009, with a 2.32 grade-point average. His martial arts instructor from those years said Kelley had signed up because he had been bullied as an adolescent. ""He had it tough,"" said the instructor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying he hoped to avoid unwanted attention. ""He didn't quite fit in. He was a good athlete, not a great athlete. He was a good student, not a great student. So I think he was struggling to find his place."" The instructor said he had believed that Kelley's karate work — Kelley earned a black belt about midway through high school after about four or five years of training, he said — had helped set the teenager on solid footing. Unlike other family members who went to Texas A&M University in nearby San Antonio, including his father and two sisters, Kelley joined the Air Force after high school. But his problems seemed only to grow there. Jessika Edwards, a former Air Force staff sergeant who said she worked with Kelley at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, told CNN that he was constantly getting into trouble. ""It was problem after problem,"" she said. His behavior caused her to worry about his potential for violence toward others; Edwards said he displayed a fascination with mass murders. ""He would make jokes about wanting to kill somebody,"" she said. Edwards said Kelley had threatened to harm himself before the Air Force referred him for mental-health treatment, according to CNN. He escaped from a mental-health facility near the base in 2012; police dispatched to find him said they were told that he ""was a danger to himself and others."" A police report said he had been caught sneaking guns onto an Air Force base ""attempting to carry out death threats"" against military superiors. After Kelley was given a bad-conduct discharge from the Air Force in 2014 stemming from his domestic violence case, Edwards said, he reached out to her, asking her whether she'd be a reference for him as he applied to jobs. But some discussions they had over social media continued to alarm her, she said. He told her that he bought dogs on Craigslist so he could shoot them, and he expressed admiration for Dylann Roof, who killed nine people at a South Carolina church in 2015, CNN reported. ""He would say 'Isn't it cool? Did you watch the news?' "" Edwards said, according to CNN. ""He would say he wished he had the nerve to do it, but all he would be able to do is kill animals."" Kelley was charged in 2014 with a misdemeanor count of animal mistreatment in El Paso County, Colo., where he lived at one point, after neighbors complained that a man matching his description had punched a dog. Edwards said that though she blocked Kelley on Facebook because of his messages, she didn't think he would act on them. ""In a sane person's mind, when people say something like that, you don't think it's something they're going to do,"" she said. She gave him her number and an instruction to call if he felt as if he was going to hurt himself or someone else. He never did. Instead she got a text from a friend after Kelley had been identified as the gunman last Sunday evening. ""I dropped a glass and started crying,"" Edwards said. Two parishioners of the First Baptist Church also said that Kelley's demeanor at a recent fall festival held by the church had concerned them. Judy and Rod Green told CBS that Kelley had showed up in all black and seemed ""completely distant and way out in thought."" Rod Green told the outlet that he had tried to determine whether Kelley was armed at the time, saying he would have escorted him from the area if he had been. A woman who identified herself on Saturday to The Washington Post as Kelley's grandmother said the whole family was devastated. ""I know he lost it,"" she said. ""It's broken all of our hearts. We feel so very sad."" Of Kelley's parents, she said: ""They're walking through a living hell right now."" Todd Friesenhahn, justice of the peace for Guadalupe County's Precinct 4, said a complete autopsy report on Kelley's body, which will include toxicology information, might be done ""within three weeks.""

Inside a darkened movie theater. At a nightclub throbbing with sweaty bodies. During Sunday services at church. At an outdoor country music concert. These days, home seems like the safest bet. But the truth is, the most likely location for a mass shooting is precisely in that presumed refuge. The nightmarish reality is that most mass shootings in America are related to domestic violence. The overwhelming majority take place behind closed doors. From 2015 to early November 2017, there were 46 mass shootings in the U.S., defined as an incident in which four or more people were shot and killed, not including the gunman. According to data collected by Everytown for Gun Safety, in 27 cases, or about 59 percent, the perpetrator killed an intimate partner or family member during the massacre or had a history of domestic violence. Perpetrators of mass shootings, far from being strangers to their victims, are usually husbands or boyfriends. They kill their romantic partners and family members, as well as friends, neighbors, co-workers and innocent bystanders. To be sure, the overwhelming majority of men who abuse their families do not go on to commit acts of mass violence. Domestic violence is prevalent in our society; mass shootings are not. But it’s worth noting the connection, as researchers have identified the key warning signs of abusers who are likely to kill in the future. They share remarkably similar traits: They have histories of strangling their partners, stalking and death threats. And, crucially, they have access to firearms. Below, we have included information on all mass shootings since 2015 in which the alleged killer targeted a family member or intimate partner during the massacre, or had a history of domestic violence. Some of these incidents made the news, but many didn’t. Here are those stories. Senior Reporter, HuffPost Reporter, HuffPost"

Fearful. Uncertain. These are all emotions that many of us find ourselves navigating after several churchgoers in Sutherland Springs, Texas were gunned down on an otherwise normal Sunday afternoon. So here we are—yet again. Yet another group of families that will never be whole again. Yet another community that will carry the permanent weight of loss. Yet another moment when our country is plagued by confusion and fear, wondering when close-knit churches, outdoor concerts and nightclubs in our neighborhoods became as treacherous as war zones halfway across the world. Whether our families were directly impacted or not, we are all mourning. So how do we deal with the reality of violence and the inevitable grief in the aftermath of violence? Here are five things that you can do today. Talk It Out Tragedies often leave us struggling to find the words to explain to our children and, even ourselves, why something so tragic, so seemingly senseless, had to happen—again. It may feel easier to shy away from hard topics like these, but resist the urge. Talk to your children. Make them feel safe. And reach out to people that you love just to remind each other that you’re there. You’ll find that communication is comforting. Take Action If you have the means to volunteer or donate to support those directly impacted by a tragedy, do it. There is so much to be done for families and communities. Financial support for children who have lost parents and husbands and wives who lost spouses. Meals for those who need to spend days at hospitals with critically-injured loved ones. Counseling for survivors. Search for national and local organizations that may have a need for your much-needed donations of time and money. Pray Rely on your faith. It is very common to question God when devastation happens. Stand on your belief system for peace, strength and hope for those who must endure the loss for a lifetime. Pray for those families, the community and those on the front lines as grief and trauma affects them too. We must pray for their wisdom as they respond, make decisions and save lives. Emotional and Mental Wellness Anxiety, fear and worry are often the immediate responses to a mass shooting, and our mental and emotional wellness is impacted in a number of ways. The surviving victims who must relive the vicious attacks over and over, the churchgoers across the country who are now terrified to go into their respective places of worship and anyone, anywhere in the world, who is watching the devastation on the news and wondering if there is anywhere to really be safe. If your emotions feel too heavy to carry, first, be honest about it. Then, find a counselor or grief therapist to help, and journal your feelings if that helps. Love yourself enough to release your emotional burdens. Take a Break It is good to be informed and aware of what is going on in the world however limit your exposure to the news when necessary. Take a moment to lift your spirits .Strive to have balance, with the consistent tragedies that are happening around the world. Pictures, Videos and images are powerful and you want to be mindful of contributing to any stressors that can aid any distress. Grieve Remember that grief is a process. You cannot go around grief but through it. There is no set time frame to grieve a loss or particular set of stages one muct go through. Grief is unique. Everyone is different and everyone grieves differently. Stay vigilant If you find yourself in a threatening situation, as soon as you notice something strange is happening, feel uncomfortable or see a gun once finding a safe place use technology to increase awareness and to alert others. Send a text message, and copy and paste the same message to as many people as possible as well as on social media if you have time. It can be as simple as, “Need Help Call 911”, “Call Police, I’m at church, Terrorist attack” or “Call Police, School Shooter. 911” to give a warning to others. Once hidden or having distance away, if going live is an option, this may show family, friends and officals where to find you. Use media and messaging to reach out as soon as you can. Having access to your phone may not always be an option however in some instances, use social media as a safety strategy to help yourself and others.

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/487450452/0/usatodaycomwashington-topstories~OnPolitics-Today-Texas-weaposre-so-sorry/,"We’re struggling with all the news coming out of Texas. There’s no doubt that the deaths of 26 people is a tragedy. The question, from the OP perspective, is what happens now? In recent years, we’ve witnessed mass shooting after mass shooting. The names of the places where tragedy has struck have become a part of our vocabulary. Virginia Tech. Sandy Hook. Charleston. And yet, Congress often finds itself paralyzed on how it should respond. After the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history left 58 people dead and more than 500 other injured in Las Vegas one month ago, House Speaker Paul Ryan acknowledged that the “smartest, quickest fix” to address rapid fire devices is regulation. Lawmakers from both parties have proposed banning “bump stocks,” which accelerate a semi-automatic rifles rate of fire. But in the face of the massacre in Sutherland Springs, President Trump says this “isn’t a gun situation.” “Mental health is the problem here,” he said. This week marks one year since Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election. And what a year it’s been. As USA TODAY rolls out our coverage, Susan Page explains how Trump has changed Washington more than Washington has changed him. “The nation’s 45th president has upended yet another norm — in this case, the assumption that moving into the White House will have a sobering impact on a newly elected commander-in-chief,” Page writes. “Facing awesome responsibilities and the sudden responsibility for governing, a new president typically moves to moderate his rhetoric and reach out to old foes, at least for a while.” One thing Trump has likely figured out by now: Campaign promises are easy to make on Twitter, but hard to make a reality. With North Korea threat looming, Trump seeks $5.9 billion for military Chuck Grassley seeks more info about James Comey's decision not to charge Hillary Clinton Paul Manafort, Rick Gates to remain under house arrest with movements tracked by GPS, judge orders Secret Service makes arrest at White House after tip man wanted to kill 'all white police' JFK files: CIA started to disavow knowledge of Lee Harvey Oswald within hours of killing"

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)  Eric Gay  SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas — Hundreds of mourners crowded into the tiny town of Sutherland Springs for the first Sunday service since a gunman stormed the First Baptist Church a week earlier, killing more than two dozen people in the worst mass shooting in Texas history. After an emotional sermon held outdoors under a massive white tent, congregants and the public were invited to return to the church for the first time since the tragedy. A chilling memorial set up inside the church included 26 white chairs — including one for the unborn baby of a victim who was pregnant — bearing each victim’s name or nickname painted in gold. Pastor Frank Pomeroy shared his personal heartache and a message that the community bound together by faith can move past the evil that attacked the church seven days earlier. “Rather than choose darkness as that young man did that day, we choose life,” Pomeroy said during the service, his voice cracking as he spoke about his 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle, who was among those killed in the Nov. 5 rampage. “I know everyone who gave their life that day,” he said, pausing to gather himself. “Some of whom were my best friends and my daughter.” He wiped his eyes, then added, “I guarantee they are dancing with Jesus today.” Initially, the church had planned to hold Sunday’s service at an adjacent community center, which can accommodate a few dozen people. But when organizers realized hundreds planned to attend, the service was moved to a massive white tent erected in a baseball field. So many people turned up that the tent’s side flaps had to be opened for an overflow crowd so that those who couldn’t get a seat could see and hear what was going on inside. Mark Collins, a previous pastor at First Baptist, said it was the largest gathering in the church’s 100-year history. The front three rows were reserved for survivors of the attack and the families of those killed. Many arrived early, as a steady rain fell on the tarp roof, offering hugs to each other and prayers. Congregants wept during the service and a moving version of “Amazing Grace,” led by three singers and a man on guitar, as the voices of hundreds sang along. Some bowed their heads, others raised their hands and swayed as the music played, and tears streamed down their faces. “Amazing Grace” was also played at halftime at Floresville High School at Friday night’s game, in tribute to the victims. Later Sunday, the First Baptist Church opened its doors for the first time since the shooting. The inside had been transformed into a memorial with its walls, floor and pulpit painted white. Broken windows and ceiling tiles had been replaced and bullet holes filled. The church’s pews, the carpet and all equipment had been removed. All that filled the space were the 26 white chairs, each with a red rose tied to it except for one that had a pink rose for the unborn baby. A line of about 85 people snaked from the church entrance and curved around the block, including people who traveled from as far away as the East Coast, said Collins, the church’s former pastor who has returned to help in the tragedy’s aftermath. Constructing the memorial wasn’t an easy decision, he said. Some members have said they never wanted to step foot inside the site, he said, while others have said they needed to see it. Next Sunday’s service is expected to take place on the grounds of the church, likely in a makeshift structure, Collins said. Church members will have to decide whether to demolish the church, as some have said is likely, he said, but plans are also being discussed to build a new structure nearby. The gunman, Devin Patrick Kelley, went aisle to aisle looking for victims and shot crying babies at point-blank range, according to witness accounts. The dead ranged in age from 18 months to 77 years old. About 20 people were wounded in the shooting. Kelley died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound after he was shot and chased by two men who heard the gunfire at the church. Investigators have said the attack appeared to stem from a domestic dispute involving Kelley and his mother-in-law, who sometimes attended services at the church but wasn’t there the day of the shooting. Kelley had a history of domestic violence: He was given a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force after pleading guilty to assaulting his first wife and stepson. The church has reached out to Kelley’s family and was praying for them, Collins said. “Our hearts and prayers go out to his family,” he added. For Sunday’s service, people from other churches dropped off handmade prayer cloths and tiny wooden crosses, among other gifts. Mental health organizations provided tissues and brought therapy dogs to the service. Republican Sen. John Cornyn spoke at the service, saying lives were stolen as darkness overtook one man’s heart. “The pain of losing 26 members is overwhelming,” Cronyn said. “Many lives have been changed forever. ...

Filed under: Netflix’s The Punisher might not be what you’re expecting — but it’s not that good either Netflix’s line of Marvel shows is by now so disconnected from the Marvel Cinematic Universe that we may as well call it the Marvel Netflix Universe, and its latest installment is perhaps the most divorced from the MCU yet. But The Punisher is already an odd one out in the Defenders setting — it’s the first of its line to not have been a part of initial planning for the streaming service’s Marvel offerings, the first to not have been built on a road that led to The Defenders. It’s also about a character who is an odd one out even in comics; his anti-hero ethos existing explicitly to contrast the superheroic black and white morality of the majority of Marvel’s superheroes. The Punisher isn’t a superhero, but a reflection of them. Reviewing Netflix’s Marvel shows before release always comes with some risk, as the company only offers the first half of the season to press. Still, it seems fair to judge a show based on those episodes alone, and update once the rest become available. But here, again, The Punisher feels like a different beast. (Update: The full review is below.) The Punisher has a small array of subplots, some of which are wrestling with incredibly weighty issues, like the grooming of young, dissatisfied men into political tools and the care (or lack thereof) the system gives to the mental health of veterans. With some of these elements, it’s unclear how they are going to (presumably) connect back to the show’s main plot. How well the Punisher writers’ room has crafted those eventual connections and conclusions will make or break a lot of the show. So consider this our Punisher pre-review. And, so far, The Punisher might not be exactly what you’re expecting. Frank Castle’s classic image — a white guy with lots of guns who typically fires many of them into other people — has given his series an uncertain appeal in, shall we say, our current environment of current events. Star Jon Bernthal has talked about the show’s uncomfortable relatability in interviews. Netflix has even canceled a major appearance of the Punisher cast at New York Comic Con in October, in deference to the Las Vegas mass shooting in which 58 people died and 546 were wounded, and delayed the release of the show. (In the intervening weeks, 26 churchgoers were killed by a single shooter in a small town in Texas.) And The Punisher is certainly about a lone gunman — but in its first six episodes it’s much more about America’s intelligence ecosystem in the era of the War on Terror, and the lives of soldiers once they return to our shores. What I remember most from those episodes isn’t the blowout fights or the car chases, it’s the spycraft and intrigue of trained intelligence professionals who can’t afford to trust anyone figuring out how to work together toward common goals, and the clever positioning of Frank Castle and a government agent as opposing figures investigating the same corruption. The Punisher’s first episode is sleepy and repetitive; nothing in it is anything we didn’t see in the second season of Daredevil. Along those same lines, The fifth and sixth episodes already drag more than the others, an indication of the usual mid-season Netflix slump. But at least Punisher’s repetitive beginning is part of the first narratively necessary step in the show’s plot: moving the goalpost on Frank’s revenge. Yes, The Punisher is our second story about Frank Castle taking revenge on the people who destroyed his family, but it obeys the canonical law of the sequel: If you’re going to have the same plot, at least make it bigger and more complicated. To that end, the show fills out Frank’s supporting cast with some real character gems. As in his comic book incarnation, Ebon Moss-Bachrach’s Micro becomes Frank’s new partner, or, in the immortal words of Spider-Man: Homecoming, his “guy in the chair.” We’re introduced to a whole host of Frank’s old army buddies, only some of whom are aware that he’s still alive. But my favorite of the bunch is Amber Rose Revah’s Dinah Madani, a welcome twist on the usual trope of the good cop in a corrupt system who wants the same thing as the anti-hero, but could never work with them — unless, of course, desperate circumstances might force them to. (Consider my fingers crossed.) Madani is practically our second lead; she’s given loads of time in the plot to explore her history as an upwardly mobile, female, first-generation Iranian-American Department of Homeland Security agent. And Punisher puts Madani and Frank Castle on a collision course (at one point, literally), as they both charge after the same conspiracy from within and without the system in which it secretly flourished. Charging after that conspiracy is the main plot of the show and is where it does its best work. The tensest moments for me were all about Micro trying his best to impress a highly paranoid and extremely dangerous Frank Castle — and also gain his trust at the same time. The ways in which Micro and Frank wrestle for leverage over each other even after they recognize their shared goals is just as engaging as Madani’s struggle for recognition in the DoHS. In comparison, the drawn out firefights, bloody commando flashbacks and soft-focus remembrances of Frank’s family bored me. However, the focus on the Department of Homeland Security — as well as scenes within the CIA and the flashbacks to Frank’s military career — bring one of the show’s strangest choices to the fore. The Punisher makes the frankly unbelievable presumption that, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the history of the War on Terror as well as the CIA and the Department of Homeland Security have undergone no especially notable divergences from our own reality. It’s not a show-breaking detail, but it does seem like a missed opportunity. The Punisher has the fewest connections to the Marvel Universe in a group of shows that were billed on their interconnected setting and have since notably ignored that they’re in the same world as Iron Man, War Machine and Captain America. In the first six episodes, superheroes have been mentioned once, and then only in a sentence that wouldn’t be out of place for a show where they only existed in comic books. The Punisher also has a habit — not a unique one, by any means — of setting up characters who are obvious in their intolerance so that their leads can swat them down, a lazy way of establishing their bonafides as Not That Kind of Guy. Creating an unsubtle caricature of a racist for your hero to oppose with a quip does not actually contribute to the conversation around Islamophobia in post-9/11 American culture, nor properly depict the nuances of the issue you’re trying to address. And how The Punisher approaches its nuances in the last half its season will have a big impact on its overall quality. If Frank’s unit was part of a military conspiracy without his knowledge, is the show trying to absolve him of or implicate him in its misdeeds? This other veteran character, struggling to connect, violently lashing out and looking for another fight to join — will he eventually represent a “realistic” version of Frank Castle’s story? Or does he represent the kind of uncontrolled violence that Frank channels so carefully and deliberately at criminals? These are the questions the last half of The Punisher has to answer, and I’m curious to see how it does. My biggest concern, coming out of episode six of The Punisher, was that it would make a serious misstep in its attempt to address gun violence and mass killings in America. In the end, the subplot stood on its own sturdy legs without much fuss — but without really taking a stand, you might say. While it’s admirable that The Punisher acknowledges the parallels between the behavior that we’re all tuning in to see Frank Castle commit — bloody, gun-fueled, extra-judicial revenge — and America’s seemingly ever-present incidents of mass shootings, the show goes no farther than that. Punisher stays dedicatedly neutral on what the solution to lone-gunman mass violence in America should be, by creating character stand-ins for both the guns rights and gun control side of our national debate and then depicting them both as hypocritical, lying, cowardly stereotypes. Without a broader, braver message on the subject, the acknowledgment of the fact that Frank’s personal quest for revenge can be so easily conflated with an anti-government, pro-guns bombing campaign enacted on innocents undercuts the heroic vigilante ideal. Frank is a fantasy. Bringing him this close to reality takes all the wind out of him. But then, in its totality, The Punisher already feels like something that’s had the wind taken out of it. It feels like too little plot stretched over too many episodes, a tight action movie with a dollop of spycraft that was pulled like taffy until it was thirteen hours long. But maybe it’s just that it’s hard to keep a sense of rising stakes in a show where the lead fundamentally doesn’t care if he lives or dies throughout the entire climax — and very few other characters do either. The main narrative thrust of The Punisher actually ends an episode before the show does, leaving the audience to drag on another hour through an unnecessary extension of Frank’s revenge quest. And by this point The Punisher has undercut itself in other ways as well, by slowly exposing its villains as near cartoonishly evil, complete with crazed laughter, walking-away-slowly-from-an-explosion and one-weird-dead-eye. Then, without giving anything away, the resolution of the climax manages to both feel out of character for Frank (in a way I expect many Punisher fans will find alienating) and implausibly favorable to him. This is Punisher’s second biggest problem after how slow it moves: that it wants to be a show about the real experiences of veterans and terrorist, political mass violence in America today and it wants to be a show about Frank Castle putting a skull on his chest and surviving a near-death beating from a cackling secret agent. The Punisher’s tone and pacing problems ultimately overwhelmed any goodwill I had towards Frank and Micro and Agent Madani from the outset. A late-season brush with a Rashomon-style episode was only a brief breather from an otherwise dull experience. The Punisher didn’t having me rolling my eyes at its dialogue, as I have with the worst of Marvel’s Netflix fare, but its attempts to tackle weighty real-world tensions undercuts its attempts to be a bullet-filled revenge fantasy. And its hesitance to follow through on its real-world elements and take a stand leave it feeling like a bridge with no middle; two opposed poles with just the wind between them."

True. Trump’s first year has been a wake-up call heard around the world. But are we really waking up? And who is “we”? And what, if anything, is the new awareness that we are supposed to wake up to? This column inquires into these questions, and announces a major initiative that blends the news and social media power of HuffPost with the online-to-offline movement-building capacities of MITx u.lab. Over the past few months, having attended events and grassroots gatherings in various parts of the world, I’m encouraged that such a waking-up and movement building process is well underway. I’ve seen firsthand a new landscape of initiatives focused on transforming the foundations of our economies and our social structures that is emerging. At the same time, social media movements such as #MeToo have shown how quickly latent and necessary changes can be catalyzed in our current moment. While there is still much more structural and systemic work to be done, it’s increasingly clear that as our old economic structures and civilizational forms hit the wall of our planetary limits, a new world is taking shape that focuses on bridging the three major divides of our time: the ecological divide, the social-economic divide, and the spiritual divide. This awakening process is not only happening in grassroots movements. It’s equally observable among many, particularly younger, leaders working inside our traditional institutions. Everyone knows that we live in a moment of profound disruption. An old order is about to end. And something new is about to be born. Last week, I was running a session at the European Central Bank in Frankfurt. During the discussion, one of the senior management attendees said: “The problem you describe is not totally new. The destructive dynamics of prejudice, ignorance, hate, and fear have been around for a long time.” And then he asked, “But why is it so much worse today? What is actually different now?” What a great question. It prompted me to deepen my own sense making. In earlier columns, I have framed the global politics of our present moment in terms of three different responses to disruption that are playing out in all sectors and systems: Figure 1: Three Responses to Disruption: Muddling through (downloading), Moving backward (closing mind, heart, will), Moving forward (opening mind, heart, will) The first response just extends the status quo: business as usual. As Hillary Clinton’s loss in 2016 and the recent elections across Europe have demonstrated, the mainstream option is increasingly unattractive and unacceptable to the majority of voters. The mainstream parties in the Dutch, French, German, and Austrian elections this year have lost by greater margins than the right right-wing parties have gained. In the United States we see this outcome mirrored in the 2016 presidential primaries: the anti-mainstream candidates, Trump and Sanders, gained much more support than the candidates endorsed by the party establishment (Bush and Clinton). The reason Sanders did not make it onto the ticket was because of the manipulative influence of the Clintons and their foundation on the operations of the Democratic National Committee. In other words, the main story of the past year is not just the rise of the far right but the decline of the mainstream status quo parties combined with a failure of the entire political system to generate any viable alternative to the mainstream option other than the outdated ideologies of yesterday (nationalism) or the day before yesterday (white supremacy). The second response says that the system is broken and that we need to “drain the swamp” by orienting ourselves backward. This response is much more radical than muddling through. It connects to the felt sense of frustration. But it operates on the closing of the mind, heart, and will, i.e., the amplification of prejudice, ignorance, hate, and fear. As filmmaker Michael Moore put it so succinctly: “Ignorance creates fear, fear creates hate.” The five main behaviors of this cycle include: Denial: Not seeing what is going on. Example: This year, the United States has been hit by one “worst ever” hurricane after another. What conversation are we not having? The conversation about climate change. There is more than one mass shooting every day (on average), but what conversation are we not having? The conversation about gun laws. That’s what denial looks like on a societal level. Denial is reinforced through the politics of lying. Since Donald Trump took office, he’s made at least 1,318 false or misleading statements (but by the time you read this the actual number will be higher.) De-sensing: Being unable to empathize with others. Donald Trump is the living embodiment of that condition. But Trump is only the symptom. The deeper problem includes a broader loss of empathy in society. The amplification mechanisms here include digital echo chambers within social media and the use of micro-targeting and dark posts, designed to stir up hate and fear across racial and other divides, funded by the Russian government and by U.S. billionaires like Robert Mercer. Absencing: Losing the connection to one’s emerging future self—that is, getting stuck in the rigid identities of the past, getting stuck inside one’s ego boundaries: Me First! Blaming others: The inability to reflect on one’s own role. Blaming others deepens and hardens the dynamics of “Us vs. Them” and results in delusional fantasies about building walls against outsiders that keep us trapped into an architecture of separation. Destruction: The outcomes of this cycle result in the destruction of nature (pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, disabling the Environmental Protection Agency), the destruction of trust and the undermining of international institutions (UN, NATO, the Iran nuclear deal), and the destruction of institutions like healthcare that keep our societies together. The United States isn’t the only country dealing with these things. There is a cycle of destruction and self-destruction observable in many systems and sectors of our civilization today. In most global systems today we collectively create results that (almost) nobody wants. The third response is perhaps the most important and least familiar. This response attends to disruption by leaning forward into the unknown, by sensing and actualizing the future that wants to emerge. To do that you need three critical capacities: listening and curiosity (an open mind), empathy and compassion (an open heart), as well as confidence and courage (an open will). If you face a moment of disruption and you lack these critical capacities, you are easily thrown into the space of absencing—that is, into a self-reinforcing dynamic of separation and destruction. Seen from this angle, we can see the rise of Trumpism and fundamentalism not only as the result of economic and political failures, but first and foremost as a massive educational failure. Figure 1 summarizes how our responses to disruption give rise to both of these cycles: the cycle of absencing and destruction, and the cycle of presencing and co-creation. Both cycles co-exist in society today. We know both of them well from our own behavior. They are separated only by the degree of openness in our minds, hearts, and wills as we respond to disruption. If we look across systems today, we see a lot of evidence that both these cycles exist and that both have a lot of evidence and momentum. But why does the public conversation and public consciousness focus almost exclusively on the cycle of absencing and self-destruction? Why does the cycle of absencing and destruction dominate the public conversation—while the cycle of creation remains largely invisible and unattended to? I see five structural forces that make what’s happening today different. Let me quickly describe them and then conclude how the destructive direction of these forces can be turned around to functioning as forces for co-creation. Media and social media keep amplifying the noise and creating distractions that penetrate every corner of our private and professional lives. One of the drivers is that negative news often sells better than positive news. It’s better business for the platform. For example, it was widely reported by BuzzFeed that at the height of the 2016 U.S. election people shared more fake news stories on Facebook than they shared stories from real news sites. Much of what the news and social media do amounts to amplifying the noise machine and magnifying society’s condition of collective ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)—that is, jumping from one crisis flash point to another, without ever addressing any of the deeper issues involved. Instead, we need to deepen our collective focus on the systemic root issues that underlie the symptoms. We need to close the feedback loop of collective awareness and action—that is, we need to become aware that in this age of reflexive modernity our own actions can backfire and crumble the foundations of our own system (see figure 2). Figure 2: Reflexive Modernity seen through the German weekly Der Spiegel (“Washington, one year later”) The second structural force is technology as it currently shows up through tech giants like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple. Technology was first seen as force for good. But as companies like Facebook and Google grew, they started to put their profitability and ambition for global empire building above their commitment to be a force for good. That choice has turned us, the users, from being customers to being the product that is sold to whoever pays most (i.e., right wing billionaires or the Russian government). The result is that these companies have become a force for undermining our democracy, as last week’s congressional testimony by tech executives made shockingly clear. The use of dark posts, micro-targeting, and algorithm-based social echo-chambers are examples of how technology is now a sophisticated mechanism to manipulate voters in ways that increasingly rip our communities apart. The heightened incidence of aggression and violence within the United States is just one example. As these giant monopolistic forces increasingly dominate our lives and refuse to behave responsibly, we have to ask ourselves what future we want for our societies. A future in which human behavior is just an extension of machine-made algorithms, or a future in which these monopolies are broken up unless they voluntarily refocus their purpose from global empire building to serving the well-being of all. If aiming for the latter, it would require the leaders of these organizations to shift their mindset from ego- to eco-system awareness, from empire building to serving a larger eco-system of societal innovation and renewal. The final three structural forces relate to the missing update of the operating system that we use to run our economies, democracies, and educational systems. The ever-increasing levels of inequity represent the third structural factor in our current moment of disruption. Two quick facts to illustrate this point. One, in the United States the life expectancy of the country as a whole is becoming shorter, which is extremely unusual and alarming for a highly developed country. The decline is particularly pronounced for white males with low levels of education and income—i.e., the “forgotten people” that Trump has given voice to. Two, eight rich people in the world own as much as half of mankind combined. At the root of this massive economic failure—the four-decade-long decline of the middle class—is the neoliberal economic paradigm that promised a rising tide of wealth would lift all boats, but never delivered on that promise. Instead, the biggest of these boats just got bigger and bigger. One of the main amplification mechanisms here, as we also learned this week through the Paradise Papers, is the tax system that allows the 0.01%, the superrich individuals and institutions (like Apple) to engage in legal tax avoidance and re-using the same money to further (legally) bribe the political class in D.C. to even increase these same tax loopholes in the system. Which brings us to the fourth factor. The fourth structural force concerns the creeping death of democracy that is nowhere more visible than in Washington, D.C. If you are lawmaker, you spend roughly 50 percent of your time raising money for your next election campaign. How do you do that? You go where the money is. That means you spend your time listening to the 0.01 percent and their armies of lobbyists. Five major industries control the lion’s share of all lobbying power in Washington: Wall Street, Big pharma, Big energy, the military-industrial complex, and the Silicon Valley big data empires. The lobbying power of these industries makes sure that all major policies reflect their interests and preferences, while the will of the majority of voters is routinely ignored. Examples: Wall Street banks roll back financial regulation and consumer protection, health care costs, already the highest in the world, keep soaring, environmental protection is being dismantled, climate change ignored, weapons are sold into crisis regions, and the right of citizens to control their own private information is almost completely ignored. In her book Dark Money, Jane Mayer describes how the rise of Trump and the far right is the result of a long term multi-billion-dollar investment by a small group of billionaires that included to change the public perception of climate change and the creation of a movement that put the Trump administration into office to execute the five point special interest group agenda mentioned above. Some of them have been long-term investors and funders, like the Koch brothers. Others, like Robert Mercer, only recently joined that field (by making the Breitbart media platform work for Trump messaging). The Koch brothers and friends intentionally created a climate denial industry. Over the course of just seven years, from 2003 to 2010, they invested no less than half a billion dollars in this venture. The campaign was funded by 140 conservative foundations that pooled their money and distributed $558 million in the form of 5,299 grants to ninety-one different nonprofit organizations (Dark Money, p. 251). While it is not new that plutocrats in the United States (and elsewhere) buy political influence or entire elections, what is new is the level of professionalism in the strategic funding effort, including the pooling of resources and strategic long-term investing in high-impact individuals with influential ideas, well-known think tanks, and university programs and media infrastructures, as well as in on-the-ground movement building. So we have some media-related issues. We have economic and political issues that relate to the lack of further evolving our economic and democratic operating systems. But what is at the even deeper source level at issue here? Education and learning. The fifth force concerns a massive failure of our educational systems. In most educational systems we have moved from an input orientation (1.0) to an output orientation (2.0) as outlined in figure 3. Figure 3: Matrix of Educational Evolution Education 2.0 can also be described as “bulimia learning”: fast in, fast out. Information is ingested and regurgitated in standardized tests, but never has a chance to become real knowledge. While the mainstream schools have moved into 2.0 and the better schools today are moving from 2.0 to 3.0—that is, to a more student-centric architecture—only the most innovative are beginning to move into education 4.0, which focuses on activating the deeper sources of creative, professional, and human development. Thus, the primary challenge for our educational systems is to move beyond education from 2.0 towards 3.0 and 4.0, i.e., student centric forms of learning that activate the deeper sources of creativity and knowing. What does it take to turn the tide of these five forces from destruction to co-creation? If we attend to it, we can see many inspiring initiatives on local, city, and sometimes state or country levels that are modeling ways of bridging the ecological, social, and spiritual divides. But only a few of them are doing so on a larger level of scale that is called for today. What does it take turn these manifold grassroots seeds into a vibrant eco-system that transforms capitalism towards social and environmental justice, towards well-being for all? One part of what it takes are new coalitions, new cross-sectional partnerships that pool our resources, networks, and capacities to serve this larger purpose. To prototype such collaborations, HuffPost is teaming up with the Presencing Institute (PI) in a joint initiative that blends the online news media reach of Huffpost with the global capacity and movement building infrastructures of PI and MITx u.lab in order to launch a joint initiative that will: Create an interactive multimedia hub to move the new economic narrative from marginal to mainstream. Shine a spotlight on pioneers and inspiring living examples of the new economy and the principles that guide them. Connect aspiring change makers with the pioneers that already created inspiring living examples around the various key acupuncture point areas of transforming capitalism Share key frameworks that link the transformation of capitalism and the upgrading our democratic and educational systems with the UN framework of the 17 SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) Provide methods, tools, and movement building capacities that help change makes to move from idea to action. HuffPost has already launched a Facebook page and started reporting on New Economy topics. The main interactive multimedia learning hub is being developed now and will be launched in March 2018 on the PI website. It will include monthly, online live-broadcasts on key areas of transforming capitalism, regular digital community café’s in which change makers and movement builders connect with each other in order to form place based hubs for change, and many other features that will help change makers to move their initiative from intention to impact. So, to return to the question of the ECB manager, why seem the forces of destruction so much more powerful than the forces of co-creation? Because the latter one’s do not have any real amplification mechanism. And that’s exactly what we are trying to build and prototype over the next few months. The main purpose of the interactive media hub and platform is to help the emerging global movement sense and see itself across sectors, systems, and cultures. To the degree that this happens we will see the dynamics shift from destruction to creation, from absencing to presencing. If you want to join this local-to-global movement building for awareness-based systems change, please sign up for the PI mailing list so we can keep you informed when the enabling infrastructures are ready for launch.

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-judicial-nominees-not-qualified_us_5a049b07e4b0f76b05c429e2?utm_hp_ref=donald-trump,"Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― One of President Donald Trump’s judicial nominees didn’t tell the Senate about a major conflict of interest in his bid to become a lifetime federal judge: his wife is chief of staff to White House counsel Don McGahn, who oversees the president’s judicial nominations. As first reported by The New York Times, Brett Talley, a nominee to an Alabama district court seat, did not disclose in his questionnaire to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he’s married to Ann Donaldson, McGahn’s top aide. The questionnaire specifically asks Talley, 36, to identify family members who are “likely to present potential conflicts of interest.” He did not identify his wife. Neither Talley nor the White House returned a request for comment. Talley, who is currently a deputy assistant attorney general at the Justice Department, has already sparked controversy with his nomination. He has only practiced law for three years. He has never tried a case in court. And he was deemed “not qualified” to be a judge by the American Bar Association, making him Trump’s fourth judicial nominee to earn the rare and abysmal rating by the nation’s top legal organization. Christopher Kang, who oversaw the selection and vetting of President Barack Obama’s judicial nominees for more than four years, said the “insanity” of Talley’s nomination extends to his job at the Justice Department, where he vets judicial nominees and helps them with their nomination paperwork. “It is literally his job to help nominees fill out these forms honestly and completely,” Kang told HuffPost. “If this is how he approached his own nomination, what is he advising everyone else?” Before he was a judicial nominee, Talley also made his political positions clear. In tweets that have since been made private, he said “Hillary Rotten Clinton might be the best Trumpism yet” and that she belonged in jail. A month after the 2012 mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, he wrote a blog post titled “A Call to Arms: It’s Time to Join the National Rifle Association.” None of these details stopped the Senate Judiciary Committee from advancing Talley’s nomination last week. All Democrats voted against his nomination. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), the top Democrat on the committee, said Monday that the Senate shouldn’t hold Talley’s confirmation vote unless he explains why he didn’t tell them about his wife’s role in the White House. She noted that Donaldson is also a witness in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. “Judicial nominees are required to disclose potential conflicts of interest‎,” Feinstein said in a statement. “Talley’s nomination shouldn’t be considered by the Senate unless he answers questions about this glaring omission and clarifies matters concerning when he would recuse himself.” Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who chairs the committee, did not respond to a request for comment on whether he is having second thoughts about supporting Talley given his failure to disclose his wife’s job to the committee. Alabama Sens. Richard Shelby (R) and Luther Strange (R) recommended Talley’s nomination to Trump. Strange said he stands by Talley. “Brett Talley’s record reflects a nominee well-equipped to serve on the federal bench, and he has my full confidence and endorsement,” Strange said in a statement. “As my Deputy Solicitor General in Alabama, he applied his reverence for the Constitution and the rule of law to crucial cases, arguing multiple times before 11th Circuit Court of Appeals and building a reputation for professionalism.” Shelby did not respond to a request for comment. Talley is on track to get his Senate confirmation vote as soon as this month. UPDATE: 10:30 p.m. ET ― White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders gave no signs that the president is backing off of Talley’s nomination. “Mr. Talley served as Deputy Solicitor General for the state of Alabama, currently serves in the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Policy and was recommended by Alabama’s U.S. Senators,” Sanders said in a statement. “He is more than qualified to serve in the federal judiciary.” Another White House spokesman, who requested to speak anonymously, emphasized that Donaldson “is not involved in this judicial selection or other judicial nominations. The men and women the president nominates should be judged on their own merits.” Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how."
http://people.com/crime/texas-church-shooting-holcombe-family-service-wednesday/,"Nine members of the Holcombe family were among the 26 killed in the Nov. 5 mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas Funeral services for the nine family members killed in the Nov. 5 mass shooting at a Sutherland Springs, Texas, church will be held Wednesday at 1 p.m., according to a Facebook post by John Holcombe — who lost his wife, unborn child, parents and other family members in the attack. The Holcombe family comprised more than a third of the 26 people killed in the sanctuary of First Baptist Church: Bryan and Karla Holcombe, John’s father and mother; his wife, Crystal, and children Emily, Megan and Greg Hill from Crystal’s first marriage; their unborn child (under Texas law, an unborn child is counted as a victim); and John’s brother, Marc “Danny” Holcombe and Danny’s 17-month-old daughter, Noah. Crystal’s oldest son, 15-year-old Philip Hill, was sick and didn’t go to church that day, the Hill family says. Crystal’s 7-year-old daughter, Evelyn, was in the congregation but survived along with John. On Facebook Monday, Sarah Slavin, who is John’s sister, wrote: “If something you say makes me burst into tears, please just let me cry. “Don’t apologize. It doesn’t mean you said the wrong thing,” she continues. “Don’t try to cheer me up. Just love me and let me cry. Hug me if you want but let me go if I try to pull away. Cry with me if you feel it. Love you all.” The funeral services at the Floresville Event Center in nearby Floresville are open to the public, with burial at a later time, according to the announcement. John and Crystal, 36 and a mom of five, had already picked out a name for their new baby: Carlin Brite Holcombe. John posted on Facebook they didn’t yet know the sex of the child. Crystal was 18 weeks pregnant, a relative tells PEOPLE. • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

Joe Holcombe, John’s grandfather, has told PEOPLE that the family’s tremendous faith has helped them through the tragedy. “It’s not as hard on us, because we know we’ll be together again and it will be for a long time this time,” he said. Slavin spoke of her tremendous faith in a Facebook video about their parents, Bryan and Karla: “They are at peace right now, and I feel that peace. It’s tangible and undeniable.” On Sunday, on the same day that its first worship service since the mass shooting was held, Sutherland Springs First Baptist Church opened its doors for visitors to pay their respects. The church sanctuary has been transformed into a moving memorial for the victims, with 26 white folding chairs commemorating the dead at each of the spots where they were killed, reports CNN. On each chair is a single red rose and the name of the shooting victim inscribed into the chair’s back, with a small pink rose for Crystal Holcombe’s unborn child next to his or her mother’s chair. "
http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/zrvrU_2fGKc/,"In his first service since 26 members of his congregation were killed in Texas’ largest mass shooting, Pastor Frank Pomeroy said, “We choose life.” The pastor’s 14-year-0ld daughter, Annabelle, was among those killed when a gunman entered the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs on November 5. Following the service, the church opened the doors of the building where 26 people lost their lives and 20 others were wounded. Church officials converted the building to a temporary memorial. A memorial for the victims of the shooting at Sutherland Springs Baptist Church includes 26 white chairs, each painted with a cross and and rose, placed in the sanctuary, Sunday, Nov. 12, 2017, in Sutherland Springs, Texas. A man opened fire inside the church in the small South Texas community last week, killing more than two dozen. (AP Photo/Eric Gay) Pomeroy was not in attendance that fateful Sunday, having traveled to Oklahoma with his wife. However, on the Sunday before the massacre, Pomeroy told his congregants, “Even if things happen you don’t understand, you still need to do what God is calling you to do,” CBN News reported. The pastor presented a choice to those who attended this weekend’s service, held in a white tent on a baseball field not far from the church. (AP Photo/Eric Gay) “Rather than choose darkness as that young man did that day, we choose life. We have the freedom to choose, and rather than choose darkness as that one man did that day, I say we choose life. Amen?!!,” Pomeroy said. Of those who died, he said, “Those 26 that are no longer with us are dancing in His presence today.” The mother-in-law of the shooter attended the service this week. She did not attend services on the day Devin Patrick Kelley came to kill her and the other members of the church community. (AP Photo/Eric Gay) Church leadership placed white chairs on the spot where each person was killed. Pomeroy previously stated that he wants to tear down the building and convert that part of the land to a permanent memorial. He would like to build a new sanctuary on a different part of the land.

http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-judicial-nominee-brett-talley-20171113-story.html,"Brett Talley, the young lawyer nominated by President Donald Trump for a lifetime federal judgeship in Alabama, was asked by a Senate committee to disclose family members who are likely to present potential conflicts of interest if he is confirmed. In response, Talley said he would evaluate ""real or potential conflict, or relationships that could give rise to appearance of conflict"" and recuse himself from cases if necessary, according to a Senate Judiciary Committee questionnaire. He did not, however, identify any family members - including his wife, who is one of Trump's attorneys. Annie Donaldson is White House Counsel Donald F. McGahn II's chief of staff. Talley's failure to mention his wife in the 30-page written questionnaire was first reported Monday by the New York Times. Talley could not be immediately reached for comment. The White House did not respond to questions about whether the administration sees a potential conflict of interest, and whether Talley should have disclosed that he is married to a White House attorney. A spokesman for the Senate Judiciary Committee and its chair, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, did not respond to a call seeking comment. As a district judge, Talley could end up presiding over cases in which the federal government or the White House is one of the parties. For example, district judges in Hawaii and Maryland had previously heard cases challenging the Trump administration's travel ban. Talley attracted controversy for what some say is his limited experience in practicing law and the level of partisanship he had shown in the past. The Judiciary Committee, on which Republicans outnumber Democrats, approved Talley's nomination last week on a party-line vote. His nomination is now headed to the Senate for a full confirmation vote. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the ranking Democrat on the committee, said the Senate should not confirm Talley in light of the new revelation. ""By failing to disclose that his wife is one of President Trump's lawyers, Talley has betrayed his obligation to be open and transparent with the Senate and American people,"" Feinstein said in a statement, adding later: ""Talley's nomination shouldn't be considered by the Senate unless he answers questions about this glaring omission that clarifies matters concerning when he would recuse himself."" Feinstein said reports that Donaldson has been interviewed by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's team as it investigates Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election show ""a clear conflict of interest that should have been disclosed."" The Times reported that Mueller's team recently talked to Donaldson about her notes on conversations with McGahn regarding the firing of former FBI director James Comey. Feinstein and other Democrats on the committee have opposed Talley's nomination, citing his lack of trial experience and political comments he previously made on social media, on his political blog and in several opinion pieces he had written for CNN. The American Bar Association, which vets federal judicial nominees, has rated Talley as ""not qualified."" Trump judge nominee, 36, who has never tried a case, wins approval of Senate panel Talley, a 36-year-old lawyer from Alabama who also writes horror stories on the side, has practiced law for only three years and has yet to try a case. Before his nomination in September, he had been unequivocal about his political views. For example, one tweet from his account, which has since been made private, says, ""Hillary Rotten Clinton might be the best Trumpism yet."" On his political blog called Government in Exile, he wrote a post with the title, ""A Call to Arms: It's Time to Join the National Rifle Association,"" in January 2013, a month after a gunman in Newtown, Conn., killed 27 people before taking his own life. He criticized gun-control advocates, who, he said, ""have exploited"" the Newtown mass shooting to advance an agenda to strip people of their Second Amendment rights. Answering written questions from Democrats on the Judiciary Committee about his previous political statements, Talley said he would recuse himself in cases in which his impartiality is questioned, as required by federal statute, and that his personal views on the Second Amendment and other issues ""will have no bearing on how I would rule in a case."" He also said the blog post calling on people to join the NRA was meant to attract opposing views and encourage constructive discussion. Challenged about his lack of trial experience, Talley said he had previously argued motions in federal district court on behalf of the state of Alabama, often through written briefs rather than in person. He also said he had argued cases before the 11th Circuit appeals court and the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals. He said it would be ""inappropriate"" for him to comment on his recommendation for the federal bench - a decision made by two U.S. senators from Alabama, Richard Shelby and Luther Strange. Talley graduated from Harvard Law School in 2007. Shortly after, he became a law clerk in Alabama, spending two years in a federal-district court and another two at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. He worked as a political speechwriter for three years, first for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign in 2012 and then for Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, from 2013 to 2015. In April 2015, Talley became an Alabama deputy solicitor general, a position he held for nearly two years until he became deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department in January. In a statement defending Talley's nomination, Grassley said he does not believe ""extensive trial experience"" is the only factor in deciding on a nominee's qualifications. ""Mr. Talley has a wide breadth of various legal experience that has helped to expose him to different aspects of federal law and the issues that would come before him,"" Grassley said. Talley's nomination comes as Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., continue to intensify efforts to place conservative jurists on the federal bench. Talley and Donaldson were married in August 2015. Donaldson was an associate for the Washington law firm Jones Day before she was appointed to the White House post. She is one of several lawyers from the firm who were tapped to join the Trump administration, some as attorneys for the White House, including McGahn. Among the others: Greg Katsas, James Burnham and David Morrell, who now work in the Office of the White House Counsel. Katsas, Trump's deputy counsel, is also a judicial nominee. The Senate last week approved Katsas' nomination to an appellate court in Washington. CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"
http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/492074560/0/phoenix/nation~The-Latest-Raiders-break-ground-on-new-stadium-in-Las-Vegas/,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — The Latest on the ground-breaking ceremony for the new Raiders stadium in Las Vegas (all times local): 8:20 p.m. The Oakland Raiders on Monday broke ground on a 65,000-seat domed stadium in a ceremony that balanced the glitz that Las Vegas embodies and the tragedy from which it is still recovering. Prince protegee Judith Hill opened the ceremony with a rendition of Andra Day's song ""Rise Up"" as police, firefighters, EMTs and other members of the local community walked through a temporary venue. During the ceremony, fifty-eight beams of light shone behind the stage, each representing one of the victims of the Oct. 1 attack, which was the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Longtime Las Vegas entertainer Wayne Newton, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and Hall of Famer Howie Long were among the crowd that witnessed officials and team leaders turn dirt with shiny shovels emblazoned with the Raiders logo. ___ 1 p.m. After years of planning, dealing and getting millions in public financing approved, the Oakland Raiders will break ground Monday on their new 65,000-seat, domed stadium in Las Vegas. Contractors will be working under an ambitious timeline as the team wants to kick off the 2020 season at the new stadium. But the Raiders are yet to reach crucial agreements for the $1.9 billion project and now could lose millions under the tax reform bill proposed by House Republicans. The stadium's financing plan includes $750 million in publicly issued tax-exempt bonds. The Raiders and the NFL are expected to contribute $500 million, while the team has also secured a $600 million bank loan. The Raiders' plan to relocate to Las Vegas began when NFL owners shot down their plans to move to Los Angeles."

http://www.espn.com/sports/endurance/story/_/id/21395386/las-vegas-beefs-marathon-security-concert-attack?device=featurephone,"LAS VEGAS -- Las Vegas ramped up security for the annual Rock 'n' Roll Marathon, which was the first major outdoor event on the Strip since the mass shooting. Tens of thousands of people participated in the race, with many wearing T-shirts that read ""Vegas Strong"" in memory of the Oct. 1 attack. Some runners who picked up their race packages Thursday at a convention center mentioned defiance, strength and resilience among their reasons to take part on the event less than two months after the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history rattled a city known for its partying atmosphere. With an American flag pinned to his shirt, Ben Rumph, who lives in the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson, said he never considered canceling his participation after the shooting. The 80-year-old U.S. Navy veteran had trained year round to run the half marathon for the 10th time. ""The shooting was an entity, an event, by itself. I was going to run whether that happened or not,'' Rumph said. ""I'm a veteran. I stood up and raised my hand that I would either kill some people or be killed to protect what we have in this country. My decision is to do the same thing today. I don't mean to go kill or anything like that, but to stand up for that principal.'' Another half marathon participant, Esther Reincke is running to honor a friend who was killed during the massacre. Reincke said 28-year-old Cameron Robinson, whom she described as a happy and ""wicked smart'' guy, had been part of her team in a 200-mile relay race last year. They both met while working for the city of Las Vegas. ""It is still hard to believe not only that this event happened in our city, but for it to hit home that close, he was one of our co-workers and a friend of mine,'' Reincke, 60, said. ""I'm running because Cameron can't. He loved running and that's kind of my connection to him. When I get my Vegas Strong shirt, I'm going to have his name somewhere front or back.'' The start of the marathon is usually outside Mandalay Bay, where Stephen Paddock unleashed gunfire from a 32nd-floor suite. Because of security concerns, the start line was moved a mile north. Capt. Andrew Walsh said about 350 officers were working and were aided by a helicopter. Large city vehicles were positioned at key intersections to prevent anyone from driving onto the course. Gilles Rubio prevailed on the men's side Sunday with a blistering time of two hours, 38 minutes and four seconds. Americans Karel Burger and Tyler Pence finished in second and third place, respectively, with times of 02:41.27 and 02:43.55. Marisa Hird, also an American, won the women's field with a time of 02:55.19."

            First published on Tue 14 Nov 2017 07.00 GMT They see the alerts on their phones. They turn on the news. And then, like the rest of us, the survivors of America’s previous mass shootings watch the grim details of the latest attack unfold. This month a gunman killed 25 people at a rural church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, just over a month after 58 people were murdered and more than 500 wounded in Las Vegas, the worst mass shooting in recent US history. The tragedies join a long, somber list of high-casualty killings that dominate the headlines and then gradually fade from public view. We asked survivors and family members of victims from six previous mass shootings – including some that were, briefly, the deadliest, the worst – what they do after each new incident. How do they make sense of the country’s response to these shootings? What do they want to see change? How do they cope with the intense coverage of the latest incident – and the silence when the news cycle suddenly moves on? In the 911 tapes, you can hear art teacher Patti Nielson screaming at Austin Eubanks and his friend Corey DePooter in their high school library, to get “under the table, kids!” The juniors had heard a burst of gunshots earlier but had dismissed it as construction noise. As Nielson screamed, the boys ducked down. Two of their classmates entered the library and opened fire. A few minutes after the shooting stopped, Eubanks saw other students running, and he ran, too, through a library filled with smoke, the fire alarm blaring. Outside, he called his family from a police car. It was only when his father arrived and jumped over a fence to get to him that his state of shock began to fracture. “I said, ‘They killed Corey,’ and I just broke down in his arms.’” Eubanks had been shot in the hand and the knee. In the hospital, he was given his first pain medication. His physical pain wasn’t so bad, but the opiate medication had a dramatic impact on his emotional suffering. “It was like somebody put a warm blanket” over him, he says. Related: It’s time to end America’s gun violence epidemic. Help us change the conversation He was sent home with a 30-day supply of opiate medication. Within months, he was addicted, manipulating doctors to prescribe him more medication, eventually buying online and on the street, moving on to cocaine and ecstasy and whatever else he could find. His parents saw his behavior changes early, but, knowing little about the signs of addiction, attributed them to the trauma he had been through. It took him 12 years, after racking up multiple arrests for fights, theft and impulsive behavior, and making multiple attempts at recovery, before he finally got sober. Today, Eubanks is the chief operating officer for a long-term residential treatment program in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, and beginning to speak nationally on the opioid epidemic. At the root of America’s addiction crisis, he explains, is untreated trauma. “We have this society that is filled with emotional pain and trauma, and we have people prescribing narcotics that are very effective with treating emotional pain and trauma,” he says. In recovery, more than a decade after Columbine, Eubanks finally went through stages of grief for the friend he lost. About 80% of the clients in recovery he has worked with can identify the trauma at the root of their addiction. It doesn’t have to be as dramatic as surviving a mass shooting: painful events in early childhood, like a divorce, can have a deep emotional impact but are often dismissed. Eubanks has watched the increasing pace of mass shootings with fear. “We’re lessening the threshold of how crazy someone needs to be to commit a mass shooting,” he says. “Now we had a guy [the Las Vegas shooter] who committed this crime for no other known motive other than notoriety, and that is incredibly scary to me. “Every time this happens, the ripple effect gets larger,” he says. “I don’t think we have a five-year or a 10-year solution. I think we’re looking at a 25-year solution.” Caren Teves and her husband Tom were on vacation in Maui in 2012 when they received a frantic phone call from Amanda Lindgren, their son Alex’s girlfriend. Amanda and Alex had been at a movie. There had been a shooting. She didn’t know what had happened to him. For the next 12 hours, the family desperately tried to locate Alex. In between frantic phone calls to the police and different local hospitals, they watched the sensationalistic TV news coverage about the mass shooter who attacked a midnight viewing of The Dark Knight Rises in Colorado. Photos of the perpetrator, with his garishly dyed red hair, kept appearing on the screen. Related: 10 gun violence prevention victories since Sandy Hook Lindgren would later describe how she had kept standing up in shock as the shooting began, and how Alex had pulled her down and covered her body with his own. He had been killed trying to shield her. In the days after they learned Alex had been killed, Tom Teves challenged news anchors to report on his son’s heroism, and the bravery of other survivors and first responders, instead of trying to delve into the mind of the shooter. It was an uphill battle. Some TV segments simply cancelled their interviews with the Teves family over their request that the perpetrator’s photograph not be displayed during an interview with them. “I wish I had not done that,” Caren Teves says, believing now that their principled stance only served to silence them. “I would have still been able to talk about Alex and call them out, whether the picture was up or not.” Since 2012, the family has launched a campaign to prevent media coverage from playing into the perpetrators’ craving for fame by spreading the shooters’ photographs, focusing on body counts and ranking different shootings against each other. Over the past few years, the No Notoriety campaign has seen bipartisan progress, with endorsements from law enforcement groups and victims’ families, and some journalists pledging to abide by the principles of trying to use shooters’ names and images sparingly. Law enforcement officials in Sutherland Springs, Texas, last week announced they would follow a similar approach. “If you notice I use ‘shooter’ instead of the suspect’s name, we do not want to glorify him and what he’s done,” Freeman Martin, a spokesman for the Texas department of public safety, said last week. Related: What do you want to know about America's gun crisis? But many media outlets still resist the “No Notoriety” principles, which Erik Wemple of the Washington Post has called “a public service, not some nefarious ‘glorification’ quest’”. Teves is scathing about the media’s refusal to change how they cover shootings. “Their argument boils down to: you’re not going to tell us what to do,” she says. “It’s a moneymaker for them. Sensationalism sells.” Today, she worries that the sheer horror of mass shootings is a barrier to Americans endorsing political change. “A lot of people don’t want to grasp it, because it’s that awful.” But if, after mass shootings 20 years ago, “we all stood up and said, ‘enough is enough,’ Alex would still be alive. He’d still be here.” Erica Lafferty was barely awake one morning at the beginning of last month when she saw a Facebook alert from a childhood friend who had recently moved to Las Vegas, marking herself “safe.” Lafferty called her immediately. The friend had wanted to go to the country music concert the Las Vegas shooter had targeted, but “It was sold out by the time she had tried to get tickets,” her friend told her. For Lafferty, the first hours after a mass shooting are the most excruciating. She knows that family members of the victims of a new attack are waiting, like she once did, for news, and “they’re still holding out this little bit of hope” that somehow their loved ones are still alive. Five years ago, her mother, Dawn Hochsprung, an elementary school principal in Connecticut, had been in a meeting when she heard gunshots. She came out into the school hallway and was immediately shot by a disturbed young man with a military-style rifle who had forced his way inside. Lafferty had to wait until until the early hours of the day after the shooting before she was finally told her mother had been murdered. After the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting, the Obama administration endorsed a slate of gun control reforms, with the biggest push in favor of bipartisan legislation that would expand background check requirements on gun sales. The congressional vote on the background check legislation “was my biggest moment of hope”, and when it narrowly failed to get enough votes in the Senate, “also my biggest letdown”. She was devastated again after Hillary Clinton, whom she had enthusiastically supported, lost the 2016 presidential election. “Gun laws had been this taboo subject in politics for so long, and not only did we have our first woman presidential candidate, this woman was constantly talking about gun violence and how it’s plaguing our country and her actual plan to do something about it.” Asked what she thinks accounts for Clinton’s loss, she says, “I still don’t know. I feel like I lost all faith in humanity after that one.” Lafferty, who now works for advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety, says she is comforted by the people who have made the issue a priority, even without being personally impacted by it. “If they can get up and do it out of the kindness of their hearts, I better be able to do it for my mother,” she says. After the mass shooting at Pulse Nightclub in Orlando last year, Lafferty could not function. She lay on her couch, watched the news coverage, and cried. But this year, after Las Vegas, she felt stronger, and immediately began to work to respond to the shooting, and to rally other people to call and email their elected officials and get involved in fighting for tougher gun laws. “In the wake of the election, my anger is just a lot more intense than it used to be. I don’t have time to be sad,” she says. Damian Meins could just as easily not have been in the office that Wednesday afternoon. Retired and working a new job as an inspector with the San Bernardino health department, Meins was expecting to be out in the field until he got last-minute word that he had to come in to the Inland Regional Center for a meeting. Even still, with his wife battling a brutal case of the flu, he considered staying home before thinking better of it and going in. These are the types of “what ifs” that rack the minds of people like Tina Meins, Damian’s daughter: the small choices and facts of happenstance that place a loved one in the wrong place at precisely the wrong time. “That was tough to accept,” she said. “He shouldn’t have even really been there in the first place.” But he was there. According to Damian Meins’ co-workers, he had been standing by the Christmas tree at the office holiday party when two people entered the building with semi-automatic rifles and handguns, donning tactical gear and firing off rounds in rapid succession. They managed to kill 16, including Meins, and injure 24 before being gunned down by police in a shootout. Tina Meins, then 33, remembers showing up with the rest of her family a few hours after the news broke and being hustled off to the reunification center, which was set up a few blocks away from the site of the shooting. Busload after busload of survivors pulled into the location, each bringing with it a moment of hope followed by a little bit more dread. “Finally the last bus came and he wasn’t on it,” Meins says. “It’s really weird because you hold on to hope even if you know …” She pauses. “Even if you basically know, you hold on to hope until the very last second. “There’s obviously the emotional and psychological trauma of trying to deal with the fact that you no longer have a dad. But there’s also the logistical and practical side of you that thinks: ‘OK well. What does this mean? Financially is my mom going to be able to live in this house?’ … You find a different way to live but it takes a long time for things to even feel OK.” Part of that new life for Meins, her mother and her sister has been as advocates for what she calls commonsense gun control for things like universal background checks on gun purchases nationwide. “You kind of wonder with every passing shooting, what will be the proverbial straw that breaks the camel’s back. They [Congress] have already had two people in their own ranks shot,” Meins says, referring to Steve Scalise and Gabrielle Giffords. “But I do feel some optimism that things will change eventually. I don’t think it’s a short path, but I think it’ll change eventually.” For Brandon Wolf, ever since he came to Orlando as a young man, the Pulse LGBT nightclub was a refuge, a safe haven. “Pulse was a place where I met people that were like me – that were young and had moved here in search of new things and to find themselves,” says Wolf, who was among the hundreds in the crowd the night that a gunman entered the club with an AR-15 and began firing indiscriminately at patrons. Wolf was in the bathroom getting ready to leave when he heard the first gunshots. He remembers seeing more than a dozen people frantically run into the bathroom and pin themselves back against the corner of the wall. “A few seconds after this group of people was the smell of gunsmoke … and you could almost get a hint of blood behind it.” Wolf and his now partner, Eric, made a split-second decision. They locked hands, ran out from the bathroom through the caustic plume of smoke until they saw an exit, then they kept running for several blocks until the panic and shock took over. “My legs were like cement and I couldn’t run any more and I just collapsed on the sidewalk,” Wolf says. It struck him that his close friends, Christopher “Drew” Leinonen and Juan Guerrero, were still inside. After a frantic and sleepless night, Wolf’s worst nightmare would be confirmed by law enforcement the day after the shooting. Leinonen and Guerrero were among the 49 killed in what was, at the time, the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. Wolf shut down. For days he could barely even make it out of bed. Even as he resumed work, he described living in a deep fog for months. “I was a zombie. I was going through the motions. I was making it happen but it was always on my mind.” It was largely through speaking up and out about his experiences that Wolf was able to start to rebuild a new normal. “Words are my coping mechanism. I use words to heal myself as much as to spread the message to other people.” Wolf says he has lost track of the number of speaking engagements and events he has attended in the wake of the shooting to lobby for gun control, which have included speaking on stage at the Democratic national convention and addressing January’s Women’s March in Washington DC. And as for how he feels in crowded places like nightclubs now: “I think it’s different for everyone, but I feel powerful. I feel emboldened to be able to go into a public space and be myself and not be afraid because, ultimately, that’s what he wanted,” Wolf said. “The person who did this to us, he wanted us to feel afraid. He wanted us to feel small, and so to be able to have that power back is really freeing for me.” The Mother Emanuel AME church in Charleston, South Carolina is practically part of Malcolm Graham’s DNA. He was baptized there, he sang in the youth choir as a young man and watched a number of relatives get married there, too. “Emanuel was a part of my foundation and our foundation as a family. That was the family church,” Graham says. So it was no surprise to him when he discovered that his sister, Cynthia Graham Hurd, was one of the nine people killed at Bible study when a gunman pulled out a pistol and began firing during a round of prayer. As is so often the case for the families of victims, Graham first learned about the shooting the way many Americans do: from the news. “I called Cynthia because she was well known in the community and she attended Emanuel so she was my source of information to find out what’s going on down there. “She didn’t answer. Then an hour went by and I started getting concerned.” Graham, then living in Charlotte, North Carolina, eventually got word from a niece that his sister was missing and that the family believed she had been at the Bible study. Malcolm, who knew a number of officials in Charleston law enforcement, learned from police that she had been killed before official word was released. “It was probably the most intense two weeks of my life because I lost my sister in a very public way, dealing with internal family issues and then feeling the obligation to talk about it publicly,” says Malcolm Graham. A veteran politician who had spent 16 years in elected office through 2014, Graham took on something of a spokesperson role for his family as questions from the press became a major part of their lives through the immediate aftermath and the two trials in which the shooter was found guilty and sentenced to death. Related: Inside the minds of American mass shooters “That was my therapy, if I can use that analogy,” Graham says. “She would want me to get out and and stand up for her and speak out for her so that’s just what I did.” In 2016, fueled in part by his sense of loss over his sister, Graham launched an unsuccessful bid for a US congressional seat. He hoped to use that position to advocate for “commonsense gun laws” and for families like his who have been forever changed by this type of violence. “It’s a strange fraternity to belong to, of people who’ve been wronged in such a public way,” Graham says. “When I saw Las Vegas and Orlando I could relate to how the families felt. I could relate to how the community was hurting. I could relate to people not understanding and asking the question why,” Graham says. “It’s awful for any community to have to bear that name: Charleston strong. Orlando strong. Las Vegas Strong.” Read more: • It’s time to end America’s gun violence epidemic.

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/492163650/0/usatodaycomsports-topstories~Raiders-mark-new-chapter-with-Vegas-stadium-groundbreaking/,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — In a ceremony that balanced the glitz that Las Vegas embodies and the tragedy from which it is still recovering, the Oakland Raiders broke ground on a 65,000-seat domed stadium across the freeway from the city's world-famous casinos. Prince protegee Judith Hill opened Monday's ceremony with a rendition of Andra Day's song ""Rise Up"" as police, firefighters, EMTs and other members of the local community walked through a temporary venue to a standing ovation. Fifty-eight beams of light shone behind the stage, each representing one of the victims of the Oct. 1 attack, which was the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Longtime Las Vegas entertainer Wayne Newton, musician Carlos Santana, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and Hall of Famers Howie Long and Fred Biletnikoff were among the crowd that witnessed state and local officials as well as team leaders turn dirt with shiny shovels emblazoned with the Raiders logo. ""Only in Vegas can you turn a ground-breaking ceremony into a show,"" NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said during the event. Contractors will be working under an ambitious timeline as the team wants to kick off the 2020 season at the new stadium. But the Raiders have yet to reach crucial agreements for the $1.9 billion project and now stand to lose millions under the tax reform bill U.S. House Republicans unveiled earlier this month. The Raiders' relocation to Las Vegas was a plan years in the making after NFL owners shot down their plans to move to Los Angeles. Shortly after, casino mogul Sheldon Adelson announced his interest in helping build a domed stadium on the UNLV campus that could be shared with a professional team. Lobbying began, and the Nevada Legislature approved a tax increase to contribute $750 million to the project. Adelson later withdrew his multimillion-dollar pledge from the project, and the Raiders chose a different site for the stadium. UNLV and the Raiders will still share the stadium, but the joint-use agreement is pending. So is an agreement that is meant to ensure the greatest possible participation by the local community in the design, construction and operation of the stadium. The agreement, known as the ""community benefits plan,"" has been the subject of public debate during meetings of the Las Vegas Stadium Authority board, the public entity responsible for overseeing the stadium. A draft the team presented during a board meeting last week requires that minority and female workers carry out at least 38 percent of construction work hours and 55 percent of operation hours on event days. While Raiders Executive Vice President Dan Ventrelle described the proposed agreement as the most aggressive ever for a stadium project, board members expressed concerns over the hiring targets. The financing plan for the Raiders stadium includes $750 million in publicly issued tax-exempt bonds. The Raiders and the NFL are expected to contribute $500 million to the project, while the team has also secured a $600 million loan from Bank of America for construction. But the tax-exempt bonds are now at risk. The GOP tax reform bill released last week would bar state and local governments from issuing tax-exempt bonds for stadium construction, a common feature of stadium deals over the past two decades. A study on stadium subsidies released last year by the Brookings Institution found that the federal government has subsidized stadium construction to the tune of $3.2 billion since 2000. The staff contracted by the stadium authority has estimated that the bill could cost the public board $3 million a year. After Monday's ceremony, Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval said it is his under he is hopeful that any version of his fellow Republicans' tax overhaul proposals won't include that language. ""I don't know what the fairness of that would be. We already made this deal,"" he said. ___ More AP NFL: http://pro32.ap.org and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL"

All rights reserved. BILLBOARD is a registered trademark of Billboard IP Holdings, LLC Jason Aldean performs in concert on NBC's ""Today"" at Rockefeller Plaza on Aug. 25, 2017 in New York City. For the first time since the mass shooting that took place during Jason Aldean's set at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas on Oct. 1, the country singer sat down with the Today Show on Tuesday morning (Nov. 14) to explain how he felt on that horrible night. Aldean described the moments leading up to him running off stage after he realized what was going on. “So when it first happened, I thought a speaker had blown is what I thought. It just sounded like a crackling something,"" he said. ""And so, you know, I’m kind of looking around like, 'What is that?' Trying to figure out what it is. Well then it stopped. So I was like, alright well they must have got it fixed. And so I kept doing my thing, and then it happened again and it lasted longer the second time."" Jason Aldean Aldean explained that as the sound continued, the reality of the situation did not hit him until he looked around to see where his guitarist was. ""So then I was actually kind of getting aggravated, so I looked over at my monitor guy that’s on the side of the stage as if to say, 'What is that?' And, 'fix it.' And when I turned to look my guitar player had run behind me and was telling me to move, to 'let’s go,' and my security guy was running on stage telling me to run.” “It was so hectic, I mean you just, everybody was scrambling,"" Aldean said of the hectic moments that followed. ""You just didn’t know what was going on. It was just panic, is probably the best way I could describe it. I think everybody just kind of panicked and didn’t really know where to go or what to do, ‘cause I mean we’re not in that situation. I mean, I’ve never been in that situation before you know, and obviously nobody else out there had either. So it was just kind of crazy. Pandemonium.” The singer explained that seeing his family was his first priority after leaving Vegas, but that quickly leaving the area didn't give him time to properly process the trauma. Of course, as we have seen from the Nov. 12 Country Rising benefit show where he and some fellow country stars including Lady Antebellum, Sam Hunt, and more performed and raised $4 million for victims of this tragedy, as well as for hurricane relief - getting back to work was therapeutic. Aldean added, “Honestly being back onstage probably helped us more than anything.” Aldean has obviously been very moved by the tragedy -- which took the lives of 58 fans and injured more than 500 -- offering a bit of insight as to how the worst mass shooting in modern American history made him think about some of the political issues that arose in its wake regarding gun control. “I feel like at the end of the day there’s so much focus on you know, politics and race and all these other things that just, you know at the end of the day we’re all in this together,"" he said. ""We spend so much time arguing with each other and not enough time working on the issue that’s really the problem.” Of course, one of Aldean's first priorities is healing for himself, and for his fans - which he's tried to accomplish by returning to Vegas to visit those harmed at the festival.  ""I just hope everybody can start to heal and some of this stuff you never get over, but I hope it gets better for everybody as time goes on.” View the entire interview, below.

More than 20 years later, Tom Wheeler can still remember the sound that several thousand tons of aluminum train make when they crash into an abandoned vehicle. Wheeler, who would eventually serve as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission under President Obama, was at the time working on the opposite end of the regulatory spectrum, as CEO of the cell phone lobbying group, CTIA. He was sitting in the office of then-FCC chairman Reed Hundt. On the desk between them sat an old reel-to-reel tape recorder. Hundt hit play, and urged Wheeler to listen closely. It was a recorded 9-1-1 call, in which a frantic woman reported being stuck in her car on the railroad tracks. She wasn’t sure of her exact location; she tried her best to describe her surroundings instead. Then came the train whistle. The woman rushed out of her car, moments before the train collided with it. “Reed turns to me and says, ‘We’re going to solve that problem. Your technology has got the ability to be located, and we’re going to solve that,’” Wheeler remembers. And he agreed. He just didn’t realize how long it would take to do it. Years later, FCC pass a rule in 1998, backed by the CTIA, that would require all wireless carriers to enable location tracking for 9-1-1 purposes. That landmark decision kickstarted a decades-long domino effect in which location-tracking abilities inside devices rapidly improved, relying first on the location of cellular towers and, eventually, on GPS. The technology advanced to the point where, today, your Uber driver not only knows what block you’re on, but whether to pick you up on the north or south side of the street. And yet, while the app economy has profited handsomely from these developments, they’ve gone woefully underutilized in emergency scenarios, particularly as it pertains to wireless emergency alerts, those push notifications that tell you when a flood or wildfire is heading your way. That’s partly because wireless carriers and smartphone manufacturers have lobbied extensively against new forms of regulation. Earlier this month, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced the commission would move forward with an Obama-era order calling for wireless carriers to pinpoint emergency alerts down to the cellular tower level. Until recently, these alerts have targeted entire counties, an area so vast that, typically, people either receive alerts that are irrelevant to them, or emergency managers forgo alerts altogether—with potentially disastrous consequences. The alerts will also include embeddable links that can redirect people to additional information. For public safety and communications experts, including Wheeler, these upgrades represent a crucial step in a multiyear battle with the cell phone industry. “It is great the FCC has announced they're going to do something,” Wheeler says. “Too bad it took tragedies to get that to happen.” Sonoma County stretches for 1,768 square miles. When wildfires swept wine country this fall, emergency managers had a choice: Send alerts to all of its roughly 500,000 citizens, or don't, to avoid mass panic and roads clogged with an unnecessary number of evacuees. They opted against. The fires engulfed the area, killing more than a dozen people in Sonoma alone. Sonoma State University President Judy Sakaki told the San Francisco Chronicle she ran out of her home in a bathrobe after waking up to find her house on fire. “There’s been a steady stream of stories about individuals in Sonoma County whose first signal they had to get out of the house right now was from a neighbor or a police officer coming to the house, or from the embers,” says Retired Admiral David Simpson, former chief of the FCC’s Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau. After the wildfires, California senators Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein co-authored a letter urging Pai to update geotargeting requirements for emergency alerts. Hurricane Harvey's historic flooding confronted Harris County, Texas with a similar decision in August. In fact, weeks before Harvey touched down in Texas, one Harris County official warned the FCC that the local government rarely uses wireless emergency alerts, because “it does not want to potentially alert the entire county when a WEA message may only pertain to a certain portion of the county.” But while this year’s series of natural disasters painfully illustrate the need for more sophisticated targeting, the FCC and the wireless industry have known about the problem for years. According to Retired Admiral Jamie Barnett, who preceded Simpson at the FCC, the agency saw the potential for smartphones to improve emergency alerts as early as 2009, just two years after the iPhone debuted. “Even back then we knew that geotargeting could be done much better,” Barnett says. And yet, he notes, the wireless industry proved to be “reluctant partners.” 'If you can hail a ride using that part of the phone or order a pizza, of course we should be able to use that for something as worthy as microtargeting alerts.' Retired Admiral David Simpson Participating in the wireless emergency alert system is voluntary, but if carriers do agree to participate—and all of the major ones do—the FCC holds them to certain requirements. Time and again, the industry has argued that those requirements are technically unworkable. Apple has resisted device-based geo-targeting, urging the FCC to “carefully assess the feasibility of this approach.” AT&T, meanwhile, has warned the FCC that “imposing, and enforcing, unrealistic duties at exorbitant cost will jeopardize future voluntary commitments,” by the company and others in the industry. The CTIA has pushed back against the inclusion of clickable links, and against proposed FCC rules that would require multimedia content, including photos, to be embedded in alerts. In a petition to the order, the association called the changes “unnecessary and burdensome mandates that have not been studied,” and suggested that the industry’s voluntary participation hangs in the balance. Their fear, according to Matt Gerst, associate vice president of regulatory affairs at CTIA, is that local emergency alert managers are already inadequately trained in deploying alerts efficiently. Adding additional media to alerts, he argues, could do more harm than good. ""We were concerned about things like network congestion,"" he says. ""All of a sudden you can have a lot of people downloading a lot of data."" And yet, in the wake of recent, high-profile failures of the existing system, the five major carriers—AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, US Cellular, and Verizon—have all begun supporting links in alerts, and allowing emergency managers to more narrowly target those alerts. “People’s continuing experience with location services in the commercial arena really is raising the expectations legitimately,” Simpson says. “As consumers get greater functionality and wireless carriers make money on that functionality, if they don’t also do the right thing for public safety, they’re going to get called out on that.” This also means, he argues, that the FCC could go even further in pushing wireless carriers and device manufacturers to improve upon emergency alerts. By utilizing the same triangulating technology that Uber uses to figure out exactly where you’re standing on a crowded corner, carriers could, say, pinpoint where potential victims are inside a building in the event of a mass shooting. Emergency responders could then send targeted instructions to people in one part of a building and a different message to people in another. Recommended Issie Lapowsky Brian Barrett Issie Lapowsky “If you can hail a ride using that part of the phone or order a pizza, of course we should be able to use that for something as worthy as microtargeting alerts,” Simpson says. The FCC has also floated proposed rules that would require carriers to send alerts in different languages and support multimedia alerts. Of course, none of these improvements will matter unless local governments decide to use them. According to Simpson, only 20 percent of local jurisdictions today are registered with the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System today. That's one reason why Gerst says alerts are often used ineffectively—or not used at all—because community leaders remain unaware of how the technology can be used.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/13/10-gun-violence-prevention-victories-since-sandy-hook,"States have strengthened laws and missing mental health records have been added to the background check system, among other steps aimed at saving lives Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.16 BST Nearly five years after a mass shooter murdered 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook elementary school, Republican politicians are still blocking any attempt to pass tougher federal gun control laws. The lack of congressional action has prompted outrage, despair and a sense that the gun debate is intractable.  But outside Washington, at the state and local level, the fight to prevent gun violence is anything but over. Here are 10 victories since 2013 in the fight to prevent gun deaths and save lives – including a major effort led by the gun industry itself. Laws designed to keep guns away from domestic abusers have advanced across the country since 2013, including in conservative states such as Alabama, Louisiana, Utah, North Dakota and South Carolina. In some cases, the National Rifle Association has quietly supported the legislation, marking a rare point of bipartisan agreement on laws that multiple studies have found prevent murders and save lives. In a single week in 2009, a gun store in New Hampshire sold three guns to people who used them to commit suicide. Shaken, the gun store’s owner teamed up with mental health and suicide prevention experts to develop the Gun Shop Project, an effort to educate gun store workers and customers about what they can do to prevent gun suicide, which claims more than 20,000 American lives a year. Variations on the model have spread nationwide. Early this year, the approach got a major endorsement from the gun industry’s association, which announced it was partnering with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, hoping to save thousands of lives through education and outreach. As one gun rights advocate in Vermont put it: “This is not an anti-gun or a veiled anti-gun campaign – this is strictly us helping ourselves.” In early 2013, the pastor Michael McBride led a group black ministers to Washington to press, unsuccessfully, for the Obama administration to make a major investment in  preventing gun violence among young men of color. The Live Free Campaign argues that tougher gun laws alone are not enough: violence prevention also requires criminal justice reform, police reform and community-based strategies. The campaign received a $2m boost from Google.org this summer, with some of the funding going to community efforts in eight cities, including San Bernardino, which suffered from everyday gun violence long before it became famous as the site of a mass shooting. “People are starting to see that we can prevent gun violence in urban communities, which have the largest share of homicides, without getting bogged down in a second amendment fight,” McBride said. Weeks before he murdered six people and injured 13 more in a rampage across a California college town, Elliot Rodger received a visit from local law enforcement. His mother had seen the disturbing videos he posted on YouTube and requested a welfare check. Rodger would write about the incident later, noting that he had firearms hidden in his apartment. The local sheriff’s department would defend its officers’ lack of options in dealing with an apparently calm, polite young man. Later that year, California passed a law creating a “gun violence restraining order”, which gives family members and law enforcement a way to petition a judge to temporarily bar a high-risk person from owning or buying firearms. Washington passed a similar law last year and advocates have launched a joint effort this year across 20 states to pass similar extreme risk protection order laws. In 2011, a gun control group analyzed the records in the national background check system, and found that 23 states had submitted fewer than 100 mental health records to the federal database – and some had submitted none at all. This meant, as happened with the Sutherland Spring shooter this month, that high-risk people disqualified from legally owning guns were still able to walk into gun stores and buy them. Today, the number of mental health records in the database has nearly quadrupled, and, as of last year, only three states – Montana, Wyoming and New Hampshire – had submitted fewer than 100 records, according to William Rosen, the deputy legal director at Everytown for Gun Safety. More effort is still needed. The Department of Defense is investigating whether the air force’s failure to submit the Sutherland Springs shooter’s domestic violence record was part of a broader problem in military reporting. After a pilot program funded by the justice department showed promising results, New York City invested $12.7m in expanding a strategy that uses neighborhood “violence interrupters” to monitor and defuse conflicts before they turn fatal. An in-depth evaluation of this “Cure Violence” approach, which tries to work directly with the people at highest risk, found steeper declines in violence in neighborhoods with the program than without it. The program is now active at 18 sites as part of a broader violence prevention strategy. New York City saw shootings hit a record low in 2016. Sandy Hook Promise, a not-for-profit group formed by family members of some of the victims of the 2012 shooting, has developed free training programs to help schoolchildren and adults recognize the signs of at-risk behavior and know how to respond. More than 2 million students and adults have taken part, including students in large public school districts in Miami and Los Angeles. After Sandy Hook, parents of the children murdered joined with the Obama administration to make a major push to close loopholes in the national requirements for conducting background checks on gun buyers. Despite support from a majority of the Senate, the legislation failed. Since then, 10 states have passed universal background checks or expanded background check requirements, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, part of a laborious, costly effort to close the federal loopholes one state at a time. What safety benefit these new laws have had at the state level alone is not yet clear: a new study found that in at least two states, the new laws had little measurable effect, probably due to a lack of enforcement and the failure of citizens to comply with the new regulations. In Nevada, the new background check law passed last year has yet to be enforced, sparking a standoff between gun control advocates and the state’s Republican attorney general, an NRA ally. It’s hard to ban any kind of gun or firearms accessory in the US – even “bump stocks”, a dangerous toy with zero self-defense value that allows semi-automatic rifles to be fired more quickly, mimicking fully automatic fire. After the Las Vegas mass shooting, the deadliest in modern American history, officials said the shooter had multiple bump stocks. Some congressional Republicans and even the NRA said they would consider tougher regulation of the gimmicky device. But bump stock ban legislation went nowhere, even as the company that manufactured the devices announced it was accepting new orders. Massachusetts became the first state since the Las Vegas shooting to ban the device. One way that new gun control advocates found quick wins in the months after national reform failed in 2013 was to focus on pressuring corporations to oppose gun-carrying in their stores. Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America has celebrated Starbucks, Chipotle, Target and other stores for asking customers not to bring guns into their stores (with the exception of law enforcement officers). As Starbucks’ CEO put it, this is “a request and not an outright ban”, but the consumer battles have given gun control advocates a symbolic way to respond to the expansion of America’s gun-carrying culture."

https://www.inquisitr.com/4622759/carrie-underwood-no-longer-inducted-oklahoma-hall-of-fame/,"Carrie Underwood will reportedly no longer be inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame this week after suffering a fall outside her home near Nashville, Tennessee. Though Carrie was set to be inducted into the Hall of Fame this week by fellow Okie and country music star Vince Gill, because she can no longer attend the ceremony, her induction has now seemingly been revoked. According to News OK, after Underwood suffered a broken wrist and a number of other injuries following her nasty fall, she's now unable to attend the ceremony in her home state this week, and as a result, she will not be inducted with the Oklahoma Hall of Fame's 90th class at all this year. A spokesperson for the organization confirmed that Carrie's inability to return home to Oklahoma City from Tennessee means the honor won't be handed out in her absence and suggested that she will now need to be considered again by the committee in order to be inducted in the future. ""First and foremost, we want Carrie Underwood to know our thoughts and prayers are with her during her recovery,"" said Oklahoma Hall of Fame President and CEO Shannon L. Rich in a statement issued to News OK. ""She exemplifies the very definition of an Oklahoma Hall of Fame Honoree and we are certain that she will be considered for future induction.""   The outlet then noted that Carrie, who was born in Muskogee but lived in nearby Checotah until finding fame on American Idol in 2004, ""will be eligible to be nominated again and considered for induction in a future class."" It's not clear exactly why Underwood's absence means she now won't be inducted into the Hall of Fame alongside the class of 2017, though fans of the seven-time Grammy winner made it pretty clear they were not happy about the rules that mean the star won't receive the honor this year due to her inability to travel. ""A person gets injured so Oklahoma revokes their hall of fame induction? Nice & compassionate,"" @maddkat57 responded to the report, while another Twitter user added, ""Makes no sense why she isn't receiving the award anyway. Have to be considered again? Why?? She had better be inducted next year!""  Carrie also canceled her scheduled performance at the Nashville Rising benefit, which took place on November 12, after her injuries were revealed. The concert raised funds for those affected by a number of recent disasters, including the Las Vegas mass shooting at Route 91 Harvest festival in October and the recent natural disasters in Florida, Texas, and Puerto Rico. Underwood hasn't responded to the organization's decision not to honor her this year but took to Twitter on November 11 to thank fans for the well wishes following her fall, which took place on the evening on November 10, but Carrie said that she would need a little time to recover from the accident.   ""Thanks so much for all the well wishes everybody... I'll be alright... might just take some time,"" she tweeted, just days after co-hosting the 2017 CMA Awards with Brad Paisley for their tenth straight year. ""Glad I've got the best hubby in the world to take care of me."" Underwood's rep first confirmed to The Tennessean that she had sustained a number of injuries after falling down some steps outside her home and had been taken to a local hospital for treatment. A statement from Carrie's team confirmed that she had suffered ""non life-threatening injuries including a broken wrist and cuts and abrasions"" following what they described as a ""hard fall"" and said that her husband, former Nashville Predators captain Mike Fisher, had returned home from a trip to be by her side as she recovers.

He kept playing, thinking it was a technical issue with a speaker, he told NBC’s “Today” show in an interview that aired Tuesday. He didn’t realize that a gunman overlooking the stage was firing upon the thousands of spectators below. “I was actually kind of getting aggravated,” Aldean said, recalling his initial response to the disruptive sound. “So I looked over at my monitor guy that’s on the side of the stage as if to say, ‘What is that?’ and ‘Fix it.’” He stopped playing when he saw his guitarist start running for cover and a security guard urging him to do the same. So he bolted as well. “Everybody just kind of panicked, and didn’t really know where to go, or what to do,” he said. “It was just kind of crazy, pandemonium.” Aldean and everyone on stage with him Oct. 1 managed to escape, but 58 people were ultimately killed and more than 500 others were wounded in what would become the nation’s worst mass shooting in modern history. “No one can take away the fact that music is such an escape and such a therapeutic and healing thing.” Members of the Grammy Award-winning trio Lady Antebellum, who appeared beside Aldean during his interview, said they reached out to the star to express their love and support in the moments after the shooting. They said they aren’t going to let the traumatic experience stop them from performing. “No one can take away the fact that music is such an escape and such a therapeutic and healing thing,” said musician Dave Haywood. Country music stars gathered at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee, on Sunday for a benefit concert, raising more than $4 million for victims of the Las Vegas shooting and people affected by recent hurricanes. Lady Antebellum and Aldean were among the acts that performed. “It’s been a rough couple months for us up here, and it’s a lot of fun to get back out and play for the people who matter which is you guys,” Aldean told the crowd, according to the Country Rising Benefit Concert’s website. “I love getting up every day and playing music, and I’ll be damned if anybody out there will ever stop me from doing that.” Moving on from a devastating event doesn’t mean you’ve forgotten what happened, Aldean said on “Today.” “I just hope that everybody can start to heal,” he said. “Some of that stuff you can never get over but I hope it gets better for everybody as time goes on.” Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost"

http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/492461552/0/alternet_all,"Just days after the mass shooting at a Texas church, the Michigan Senate voted to allow people to carry guns in schools, churches, daycare centers, preschools and hospitals. The bills had been up for consideration last month when a gunman opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers in Las Vegas. Senator Arlen Meekhoff, who sponsored the legislation, called the timing “awkward.” In a year that has already seen 307 mass shootings, turns out it’s nearly always an awkward time to pass ever looser gun laws. The legislation has parents alarmed about the safety of their children, and educators concerned about what allowing guns into schools will do to the learning environment. The showdown over what some are calling “Pistols in Preschools” is just the latest battle between Michigan schools and gun-rights advocates. Last year, Ann Arbor Public Schools took a challenge to its gun-free zone from a gun-toting parent to the Michigan Court of Appeals and won the right to prohibit guns in their schools. Earlier this year, with that legal precedent, Kalamazoo Public Schools followed by instating their own gun-free policy in all of the buildings in their district. So much for local control Ironically, while Republican ideology lauds local control, these bills would strip authority from local school districts in Michigan, and force them to concede to guns in their school buildings. Meanwhile, voters who go in search of information from their representatives, including tallies of how many constituents called or wrote their senator in opposition to the bills versus how many called or wrote in support of them, are likely to be disappointed.That's because Michigan is one of only two states that exempts the state legislature from disclosing records and communication. If the comments on 20th District Senator, Margaret O'Brien's Facebook page are any indication, her constituency was overwhelmingly opposed. On the same day that she voted in support of the bills, O'Brien posted information on her Facebook page about an active shooter preparedness event. The comments section contained dozens of angry replies, along with a handful of supporters. Notably, Kalamazoo, which is part of O’Brien’s district, experienced a mass shooting last year which left six people dead and two more seriously injured. Educators on edge While the bills must pass the GOP-controlled House and be signed into law by the governor before going into affect, Michigan educators are already feeling uneasy. Carey Gardner is a middle-school behavior specialist in the Kalamazoo Public Schools, a district where officials have been outspoken about the need to keep guns out of schools. Gardner says she understands why people could feel like guns in schools might make people feel safer. “You have people who are faced with a shooter and they have nothing. I mean, they're at their mercy,” she says. But she says the idea of having guns in school buildings is scary and intimidating and sends the wrong message. “I think I could speak for everybody without even talking to anyone, we would all be on edge at some point. Because we don't know everybody's history,” Gardner says. “What if a student comes behind me and was to pull something, whether it was from myself or from a coworker? Or we have a parent that comes up, or parents that come up that are aggressive and agitated and frustrated? How do we know if a person's going to be too quick to react because they're scared?” Gardner imagines a school environment that turns into the Wild West with shootouts in the building. With the presence of guns or even the mere wondering about who has guns, Gardner sees the inevitability of someone getting hurt. Her concern is backed up by data. Recently NPR reported on the work of Stanford law professor John Donohue. His research on three decades of data around right-to-carry laws has found that as concealed carry rates increase, the rates of violent crimes also increase. On average, 93 people are killed by guns in the U.S. each day, and the U.S. gun homicide rate is 25 times the average of other high income countries. Gardner says that not knowing whether or not people in her school building were carrying guns would change the culture and the climate of the building. “It's supposed to be your safe haven, your safe place, where you learn your social skills and academically, and it changes the whole dynamic of the culture of the school.” Wild West worries Brandi is a special education resource room teacher in a Michigan elementary school (she asked to be identified only by her first name). Brandi says she and her coworkers already feel the tension of the possibility of an active shooter. Their first back-to-school staff meeting of the year involved a presentation about active shooter preparedness that included audio from a teacher's phone call during the Columbine shootings. “It was sobering and difficult to hear. But I wouldn't say it makes a difference on how we do our day-to-day activities,” she says. That's because teachers in her building, like everywhere else in the state, are juggling so many things already that trying to be constantly vigilant about the possibility of an active shooter is next to impossible. Brandi works in an older school building that makes it hard to comply with building security. Sure, doors are locked and people need to be buzzed into the building, but, she says, office staff members are busy and can't guard the door, so once buzzed in, it's mostly like an honor system for visitors to come directly to the office. “As a staff we are expected to stop people in the hallways if they are not wearing a visitor's pass and ask them to return to the office, but I know that I've felt uncomfortable doing that and have not stopped people, nor have other staff members. The teachers are supposed to cover the windows on classroom doors (so an active shooter could not see in), and keep doors locked at all times, but many do not,” Brandi says. Teachers are already being asked to simultaneously be instructors and building security guards—jobs with completely different skill sets. Brandi says she's never been a proponent of giving more people guns to combat other people with guns, but especially not in a school full of children. “I know I personally would not be physically stable enough to handle a gun properly, and I don't really trust another random citizen to do the same. I would personally rather see buildings made more secure and providing teachers and classrooms with non-violent tools (e.g. for barricading doors) than adding more gunfire to a combative situation.” Neither Brandi nor Gardner feel like they have a solution for gun violence in the country or in schools, but they both agree that having guns in schools is not the answer. “Having more people with guns to fight other people with guns sounds like a war zone, not a school,” says Brandi.   So do we. The past year has been the most arduous of our lives.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/14/northern-california-shooting-deaths-school,"Attacker fired shots at multiple sites in the state’s rural north, including Tehama elementary school, before police killed him, authorities say First published on Tue 14 Nov 2017 19.45 GMT A gunman in California fired at random victims on Tuesday, killing four people at multiple locations and injuring at least one child at an elementary school, police said.  Authorities have not named the shooter but said he was killed by law enforcement officers after firing shots in numerous places in a rural area in northern California, including Tehama elementary school. “It was very clear at the onset that we had an individual that was randomly picking targets,” said assistant sheriff Phil Johnston, the Associated Press reported. Two hospitals were treating a total of seven people, including at least three children, according to the AP, which reported that one student was wounded at the school and another child and a woman were hit while driving. Officials said there were calls of “multiple shots fired” around 8am local time in Rancho Tehama, an area three hours north of San Francisco. “That evolved to multiple victims and multiple shots at the elementary school,” Johnston told reporters earlier.

We have the children that were attending school in a safe location. “We are spread thin,” he said. Johnston also told reporters that he was “aware” of a domestic violence incident involving the suspect, which neighbors had reported. Authorities said they recovered a semi-automatic rifle and two handguns. The shooting happened the same day that family members of the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting victims were in court in a case challenging gun companies for marketing and selling an AR-15-style rifle. That weapon was used to kill 20 children and six adults in December 2012 in Newtown, Connecticut, in one of the worst mass shootings in America. The families face an uphill battle due to a 2005 law that protects gun manufacturers from liability when their weapons are misused by criminals. The northern California shooting happened less than two weeks after a gunman used an AR-15-style rifle to kill 25 people, including many children, at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. In Las Vegas weeks earlier, 58 people were killed and hundreds more injured in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history."
https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/11/14/sick-death-row-inmate-will-be-given-special-pillow-to-help-him-breathe-during-lethal-injection/23277200/," A sick death row inmate set to die by lethal injection this week will be given a special wedge-shaped pillow to help him breathe as he is executed. WCPO reports that death row prisoner Alva Campbell, 69, will be executed at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville, Ohio, on Wednesday for the 1997 murder of a Columbus teen. According to the Associated Press, Campbell suffers from severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder as the result of a decades-long two-pack-a-day smoking habit, which makes it extremely difficult for him to breathe while lying down. His attorneys said he uses a walker, relies on a colostomy bag, requires four breathing treatments a day and may have lung cancer. Additionally, medical professionals had a hard time finding suitable veins in Campbell's arms during an earlier medical exam, which might make it difficult to administer the lethal drugs and cause him excessive pain. To help mitigate some of these issues, the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction plans to use a wedge-shaped pillow to help Campbell breathe during his execution. ""At this time, (the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction) intends to use a wedge-shaped pillow on the gurney at Mr. Campbell's execution,"" JoEllen Smith, a spokeswoman for the department, told the Columbus Dispatch. ""Mr. Campbell's medical condition and history are being assessed and considered in order to identify any necessary accommodations or contingencies for his execution."" Photo: Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction Campbell first made parole in 1992 after serving 20 years behind bars for killing a patron in a Cleveland bar. While on his way to a court hearing five years later on April 2, 1997, on several armed robbery charges, Campbell, who was in a wheelchair and had allegedly been faking paralysis, overpowered a sheriff’s deputy, stole his gun and carjacked 18-year-old Charles Dials. Campbell drove around with the teen for hours before shooting him twice in the head in the trunk of his own car. He was sentenced to the death penalty over Dials' murder. Last month, Campbell petitioned that he instead be executed by firing squad, a request which Federal Judge Michael Merz rejected on Tuesday. Campbell's legal team asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stop Wednesday's execution. At the time of writing, the court had not said whether it would consider the request.

http://rssfeeds.jsonline.com/~/492456166/0/milwaukee/home~Gunman-kills-at-least-wounds-in-Northern-California/,"RANCHO TEHAMA RESERVE, Calif. — An apparent felon who had been shooting hundreds of rounds of bullets in recent days in a small community in Northern California began firing at random Tuesday, killing at least four people and wounding 10 others. The gunman shot at people and property in at least seven locations, said Tehama County Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston. He called the incident a ""bizarre and murderous rampage."" Johnston confirmed two children were shot and wounded in the shooting at Rancho Tehama subdivision, but said children were not among the dead. He said the motive ""looks like a guy trying to get even with his neighbor."" The Sacramento Bee and members of the Rancho Tehama subdivision identified the gunman as Kevin Janson Neal, 43. The rampage began shortly after 8 a.m. PT near Bobcat and Fawn lanes when the gunman stole a car. He crashed the car, and a man stopped to ask whether he was OK, Johnston said. The suspect shot at that man but didn't hit him. He did steal his vehicle. Johnston said officials at Rancho Tehama Elementary School heard gunfire and immediately locked down the facility. He says it was “monumental” that school workers took the action they did, and he had no doubt they saved children's lives. The school was the shooter's third stop, and he became frustrated when he couldn't get into the school, Johnston said. The gunman shot 20 to 30 rounds at the school, and went into a bathroom, the only part of the school not locked down. Coy Ferreira told KRCR-TV that he was dropping off his daughter for kindergarten when gunfire erupted and a secretary ran out and yelled for the kids to race inside. Ferreira says he wound up in a classroom where 14 students cowered under desks while shots rang out for what seemed nearly a half-hour. He says some bullets hit the windows and a boy was shot in the chest and foot. His family told KRCR-TV that he was in critical condition. The gunman was at the school for six minutes, then drove off and continued to shoot at people in various parts of the community, including at a pickup with a woman and two children inside. The woman was seriously injured, and one child received minor injuries. Law enforcement saw the suspect shooting at the pickup and gave chase, ramming his vehicle and forcing it off the road before two deputies killed him in a shootout. Johnston said the deputies, who weren't injured, found the gunman dead inside a car. They also found the semiautomatic rifle and two handguns they say he used. A second long gun was also recovered. One of the long guns was an AR-15, Johnston said. The entire incident lasted 45 minutes. ► Tuesday: Mass killings prompt college to drop mascot's name, Shooter► Sunday: Texas church members gather for first service after mass shooting► Friday: 'Guns don't kill people; men and boys kill people,' experts say ""This man was very, very intent on completing what he set out to do today,"" Johnston said. ""The shooter was bent on killing and shooting people at random."" Rancho Tehama resident Salvador Tello said he was taking his three children to school when the gunman fired at a truck in front of him. Tello saw bullets hit the truck, so he made his children get down and put his own truck in reverse, he said. As he left, he saw a woman lying in the street with her husband next to her. The 10 wounded were taken to various hospitals around the area: Three to Mercy Medical Center in Redding, two to St. Elizabeth Community Hospital in Red Bluff and five — three of whom were treated and released — to Enloe Medical Center in Chico, employees at those hospitals said. One of those patients was transferred to University of California-Davis Medical Center, a spokesperson there said. Deputies escorted a busload of students from the school, which houses about 100 kindergarteners to fifth-graders, to a safer location, the Rancho Tehama Association community building less than a mile away. No students or staff were killed, said Superintendent Rich DuVarney of the county education department. Joseph Raven was doing tile work with a co-worker at a Rancho Tehama home when the shooting started.""We heard the bullets fly right next to our ears,"" Raven said. ""There were screams: a female screaming, a male screaming. There were helicopters all over the place."" Brian Flint said he got a call in the morning that his roommate was injured and that his truck had been stolen. It turned out his neighbor was the gunman. “The crazy thing is that the neighbor has been shooting a lot of bullets lately, hundreds of rounds, large magazines,” Flint said. “We made it aware that this guy is crazy and he’s been threatening us.” Living near the gunman was ""hell,"" Flint said, adding he was a known felon who often harassed Flint and his neighbors. The exact motive remains unclear, but officials at an afternoon press conference said Neal had a history of problems with neighbors. Neal had been arrested in January for stabbing a woman and robbing another woman, both of whom obtained restraining orders against him. Johnston said the woman Neal stabbed was killed in Tuesday's rampage. Neal was released on $160,000 bail after that arrest. Prosecutors also alleged Neal fired a gun — possibly an AR-15 Bushmaster rifle — during the attack, according to court documents. The rifle was specifically mentioned as illegal in a criminal complaint filed earlier this year. Police declined to identify the shooter until his relatives are notified but confirmed the same man was charged with the January assault. The district attorney, Gregg Cohen, told the Sacramento Bee the man in that case is Kevin Neal. Court records also show Neal had misdemeanor hit-and-run case in 2013. ► Thursday: Shootings ramp up pressure for NRA-backed concealed-carry gun bill► Nov. 6: In a world that no longer feels safe, how do we cope? The FBI was sending teams to assist Tehama County investigators, said Jason Wandel, chief division counsel at the FBI's Sacramento field office. State Sen. Jim Nielsen, a Republican from Gerber, Calif., whose district includes Rancho Tehama, called the incident ""senseless violence."" Other politicians, including Vice President Mike Pence, also offered their condolences. Corning Union Elementary School District released a statement Tuesday evening saying that all Rancho Tehama students and staff had been accounted for and that the school would be closed until law enforcement completed an investigation and repairs could be made to the building. ""School staff is commended for their courageous and professional response to this terrible incident,"" the statement read. ""The school was able to go on lockdown very quickly and effectively, which prevented any further injury or violence."" ► Nov. 6: Texas shooter allowed to buy weapons after Air Force failed to flag him► Nov. 5: 3 mass shootings in 17 months have been among USA's bloodiest Katrina Gierman, who lives near the school, said she heard gunshots when she went outside. ""I have not left my house because I am with my newborn son, very scary moment,"" Gierman said. ""I have the right to bear arms, and I will protect my son if I have to."" Another resident with a baby, Casey Burnett, said she saw the gunman driving around the area, shooting randomly from his car. ► Nov. 3: Americans own 42% of 650 million civilian firearms worldwide► Nov. 1: Shooting at Colorado Walmart leaves 3 people dead The incident comes a week after a shooting spree at a Sutherland Springs, Texas, church left 25 people dead, including a pregnant woman whose unborn baby also died, and a little over a month after 58 people were killed in a massacre at a Las Vegas country music festival. Tuesday wasn't the first time the Rancho Tehama school had a gun scare. In December 2015, a then-43-year-old woman was arrested after a school employee called law enforcement because she allegedly was walking around with a sawed-off shotgun. The woman also was arrested, in part, because deputies said they found a stolen pickup in her yard. Rancho Tehama Reserve, a subdivision that is home to almost 1,500 people, is described on its website as a “quiet private country community” located 12 miles west of Interstate 5 and about 110 miles northwest of Sacramento. In 2010, more than 86% of the community's residents were white, and Rancho Tehama's poverty rate was 43%, according to Census Bureau data from 2010. The property Neal lived at is a collection of mobile homes scattered around a home. Google Earth images show numerous marijuana grows in the neighborhood. Rosie DeOliveira, administrative assistant at the association, said deputies for much of the morning had instructed the community, including the elementary school and airport, to shelter in place and stay low. ""Our doors are locked,"" she said. Contributing: The Associated Press. Follow Jim Schultz on Twitter: @JimSchultz_RS"

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/15/president-trump-sandy-hook-gun-reform,"There is also much that federal and state legislation can do to prevent violence, writes Nicole Hockley. We need leaders to embrace sustainable solutions Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.15 BST Like all Americans, I am devastated by the senseless massacre in Sutherland Springs, Texas, that claimed the lives of 25 people, including 14 children. The idea that anyone could intentionally plan to kill and hurt so many people is impossible to comprehend. The anguish, shock and heartbreak felt by the victims’ families, survivors and their entire community is impossible for most people to imagine.  Sadly, I can not only imagine it, I live with it every day. It has been almost five years since the mass shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school that also took the lives of 26 innocent people, including my six-year-old son Dylan and 19 of his first-grade classmates. The pain of his loss, especially to such a senseless and preventable act of gun violence, is with me every day, but it is also what compels me to find and deliver solutions that help prevent future loss of life. Unfortunately, we as a country deal with loss of life to gun violence far too often. It has become rampant, an epidemic that no other country experiences. Two of the five deadliest US shootings in modern history happened in the last 35 days. After every mass shooting, I hear arguments that have become all too familiar to me since Sandy Hook. Some argue for “gun control” or “gun freedom”. Others like me aren’t arguing about the gun, but are rather focusing on the person behind the gun and how their violent actions could have been prevented. As quickly as the debate about guns starts, it ends. These horrific attacks fade from the news headlines quickly, and over and over we are told ‘Now is not the time to talk about gun violence.’ The time to talk about gun violence is long past for the 25 in Texas, the 58 in Las Vegas, the 49 in Orlando, the 26 in Newtown, the 32 in Virginia, and the thousands of others who die from gun violence every year. The time to act is now. After the Texas shooting, President Trump said that this isn’t a “guns situation” but that “mental health is the problem”, and that a “very deranged individual” brought this horrific act of violence to First Baptist church in Sutherland Springs. Not only is this immensely stigmatizing language, it’s not wholly truthful. Millions of Americans live with mental health conditions daily and live healthy, prosperous, violence-free lives. People who live with severe mental health conditions are much more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrate it, and are more likely to hurt themselves rather than hurt others. In fact, mental illness contributes to less than 6% of gun violence. The truth is that mismanaged and uninterrupted fear and anger, coupled with nearly unfettered access to guns is what happened in Texas, and sadly in most mass shootings. It’s fear and anger that often escalates to a point at which the person sees no other path ahead of them except for self-harm or violence to others. Often, shooters give off warning signs that are either missed, misunderstood, or ignored. These tragedies could have been prevented if someone had recognized the signs and made an intervention. We know the shooter in Sutherland Springs had been jailed for assault against his wife and child, and that he sent threatening text messages to his mother-in-law, had a fascination with guns and other shootings, and should not have been able to pass a background check. Though there was an oversight by a number of parties, and policy failures along the way, the truth is that this shooter could have gotten a gun via a private or online sale in Texas, whether or not his records were correctly sent to NICS. Once again, the signs and signals were there but missed – another preventable tragedy. Citizens alone can do a lot within their own community to know the signs and take action to intervene before violence takes place. But there is also much that federal and state legislation can do to prevent violence. I am asking you, Mr President, to use your influence to create more meaningful and sustainable solutions. You, along with Congress, have the power to save lives of thousands of Americans and make our country safe again. You have the power to nationalize intervention programs that will train youth and adults how to recognize the signs and signals of individuals at-risk of violence. You also have the means to put pressure on states to comply with laws that help protect their citizens. Extreme Risk Protection Orders (ERPOs) are one way to protect families and communities from gun violence. With ERPOs in place, family members or local law enforcement can support someone who is adjudicated as at-risk to themselves or others – as in the case of domestic violence, suicide or homicide – and temporarily remove their access to firearms and block attempted purchases until they are no longer a risk. ERPOs have been proven to save lives and to protect due process and second amendment rights. ERPOs are established and have been successfully managed by several states including California, Oregon, Washington and Connecticut. Extreme Risk Protection Orders are legislation both Republicans and Democrats can, and should, support. The federal government should be doing everything it can to encourage states to enact such legislation that’s been proven to save lives, using the carrot or stick of federal grant money. Historically, when the president and Congress have wanted to mandate national safety rules, like a highway speed limit or minimum drinking age, it has used the power of the purse, making funding contingent on states taking certain actions. So, if the government is serious about combatting gun violence, it should put its influence where its money is. Use federal public safety grants – like highway or law enforcement funding – as a carrot to incentivize states to pass ERPOs. In the end, everyone wins – the federal government gets states to do what it wants, the states get the money they need, and people’s lives will be saved by a commonsense law. There is proof that this approach has worked not only to ensure state compliance, but to save lives. In 1974, when the president and Congress set the national speed limit at 55 miles per hour, road fatalities declined 16.4% in just one year. In 1984, Congress proposed cutting 10% of federal highway funds to states that did not comply with a new national drinking age of 21. President Reagan said, “In a case like this, where the problem is so clearcut and the benefits are so clearcut, then I have no misgivings about a judicious use of federal inducements to encourage the states to get moving, raise the drinking age, and save precious lives.” According to the NIH, drunk-driving accidents have dropped by 50% since the law was passed. Please, Mr President. Refuse to accept these national tragedies as the norm in America. Refuse to stop progress and prevention by remaining silent. Refuse to be part of an endless debate that goes nowhere but leaves more death and grieving families every day. Help stop gun violence before it starts and let this be part of your legacy of protecting American lives."

BTW, here’s his tweet from the actual day of the shooting in Sutherland Springs: He really puts a lot of thought into these tweets of compassion, doesn’t he? UPDATE: It took a while, but the tweet has finally been deleted. However, nothing has taken its place, since that would be a tacit admission of error on Trump’s part.

Among the 25 victims of the Nov. 5 attack were associate pastor Bryan Holcombe and his wife, Karla; their son Marc Daniel Holcombe and his 1-year-old daughter, Noah; their pregnant daughter-in-law, Crystal Holcombe; and three grandchildren, Emily Hill, Greg Hill and Megan Hill. Crystal Holcombe's husband, John Holcombe, and two of her children survived. In a Facebook post, the Franklin Funeral Home also listed ""Carlin Brite Holcomb"" — the name John Holcombe and the surviving family members chose for Crystal's unborn child. Half of Puerto Rico's power grid will be back up Wednesday, a consequential milestone for the U.S. territory decimated by back-to-back Hurricanes Irma and Maria roughly two months ago. While it could be months before power is completely restored to the island, lawmakers are pushing to rebuild a grid better capable of handling extreme weather. Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló told senators the island wants to increase dependence on renewable sources and develop a system of microgrids. Other vital systems are slowly returning to the island, too, Rosselló said. Water systems are now 90% back, telecommunication systems are 75% restored, and roads, supermarkets and hospitals are all re-opening. Zimbabwe's military detained President Robert Mugabe and his wife Wednesday, although the army denied reports of a coup after taking over the state broadcaster.Mugabe, 93, one of the longest ruling leaders in the world, came to power in 1980 during the country's war of liberation against white-run former British colony Rhodesia. Last week, he sacked Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa, a former defense minister with strong ties to the military, replacing him with Mugabe's wife Grace, 52. Leonardo da Vinci's Salvator Mundi, his haunting, 500-year-old portrait of Jesus Christ, can be yours Wednesday — but bring your checkbook. The painting, said to be the only one of da Vinci's 20 known works in private hands, is expected to fetch well over $100 million when it goes up for auction at Christie's in New York. Da Vinci's Mona Lisa might be more famous, but Mundi boasts a greater radiance, having been recently cleaned. ""This is the holy grail of Old Master paintings, some people call it the male Mona Lisa,"" says Christie's expert Francois de Poortere. SpaceX is taking to the skies yet again on Wednesday night. Elon Musk's rocket company is planning to take a mystery payload for the U.S. government into orbit.While not the first government mission, details on what exactly is being launched remain a mystery. Aerospace and defense company Northrop Grumman, which is working with the government, revealed only that the mission was for the ""U.S. government."" The launch is set to be the kickoff for the Space Coast's holiday season, with at least one more Eastern Range mission on the books, as well as a planned demonstration of SpaceX's highly anticipated Falcon Heavy rocket expected before the end of the year.

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-shooting-wrong-tweet_us_5a0bedf9e4b0bc648a0ebb0a?section=us_us-news,"Reporter, HuffPost People online tore into President Donald Trump after he appeared to offer his condolences on Twitter about the wrong mass shooting. On Tuesday night, Trump posted this message: The deadly incident at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, took place on Nov. 5. So it appears Trump ― or a staffer ― mistakenly resent a tweet his account shared in the aftermath of that attack: May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan. ...Or, Trump meant to comment on Tuesday’s shooting at the Rancho Tehama Elementary School in northern California which left at least four people dead and several injured, but he included the wrong town in his post. The tweet was timestamped at 11:34 p.m. and remained live as of early Wednesday morning. It was deleted around eight hours later. People online were quick to express their anger over the blunder: Did u just copy & paste this & forget to change the city? My God be with the people of [insert next mass shooting location here]. The FBI and Law Enforcement *have*  (correct grammar mine) arrived. #GunControlNow #TrumpIsAMoron The President of the United States is tweeting at midnight about the wrong mass shooting and it's like the 500th most insane Trump story of the week. No way. I thought people were joking. Donald Trump actually did tweet about the wrong mass shooting. Good lord. I know he's not the brightest, but it's wild we have such a big issue that POTUS can mix up the tragedies. pic.twitter.com/ec9ho0gUsJ Trump just tweeted again about the church shooting in Sutherland Springs. The 1st tweet was the day of the event, 9 days ago. Is this his shooting tweet template? He forgot to change the location to today's shooting: California. pic.twitter.com/IToC7UXkyP Jesus, he copy pasted his response to a mass shooting and forgot to change the location. What a clown.And, the FBI and Law Enforcement HAVE arrived. https://t.co/dM6kdu3fzL For god's sake, we had a TOTALLY DIFFERENT mass shooting today, in Northern California. Can you make an effort to keep up with the carnage #ThoughtsAndPrayers, please? Also: *have* arrived 1. We have too many mass shootings. ONE is too many.2. That's no excuse for a POTUS confusing them. Carelessness is callousness.3. Trump's done nothing to address root causes. His presence exacerbates the crisis. Donald's template for a white male shooter, usually with history of domestic violence:May God be with the people of . The FBI and Law Enforcement has arrived. You are the worst. The shooting today was in Northern California. I hope that the FBI and law enforcement arrived in Texas earlier than today The FBI and Law Enforcement are slow.  Your tweet verifies that it is time for #GunControlNow. May God be with the people of Bowling Green. The FBI and Law Enforcement has arrived. May God be with the people in the War of 1812. The FBI and Law Enforcement has arrived. https://t.co/0jEYQwbsmo Your president can’t even use proper grammar .. “The FBI and law enforcement HAVE arrived.” https://t.co/CajWiDMhO7 “The FBI and law enforcement have arrived.” Why is the correct usage of grammar beyond the reach of this man?! Sutherland Springs must be hard to find, since it took 9 days for the FBI and Law Enforcement to arrive. https://t.co/IHdcbWT8NS This tweet was sent 2 hours ago.The shooting in Sutherland Springs happened on November 5th, which was 9 days ago.I hope the FBI and law enforcement didn’t take that long to arrive. https://t.co/8bYtCg0iuO This article has been updated with details of the tweet being deleted.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/DNYjDJqIqSg/,"President Trump appeared to tweet condolences to victims of the wrong shooting late Tuesday night, after a gunman killed four people in northern California. A gunman opened fire on the small town of Rancho Tehama Reserve, which is about 130 miles from Sacramento, and fired off shots at four separate locations including an elementary school. At least four people were killed and 10 were injured in the attack, where the shooter appeared to target people at random, according to local authorities. The gunman was later shot dead by law enforcement. But instead of tweeting condolences to the small California town, Trump tweeted late Tuesday night: “May God be with the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI and Law Enforcement has arrived.” Seven hours later, the tweet was still online. Sutherland Springs, Texas was the site of a shooting two weeks ago. On Nov. 5, a gunman opened fire inside a church — killing 26 people in what is now the deadliest mass shooting at a house of worship. Shortly after the shooting, Trump tweeted his condolences using very similar language to his tweet Tuesday night. “May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan,” he wrote two weeks ago. Social media users were quick to point out Trump’s apparent mistake — chiding him for conflating two separate shootings. Some were quick to draw comparisons between Trump’s gaffe and the epidemic of gun violence in the U.S. “Pretty sad when there are so many mass shootings that you just use the same generic tweet to respond to them all,” one Twitter user wrote. “That was last week’s mass shooting dude,” another tweeted. The shooting at the Sutherland Springs church happened about a month after a lone gunman killed 58 people and injured more than 500 in Las Vegas, which became the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Both the Las Vegas massacre and the Texas church shooting are among the five deadliest mass shootings in modern American history. Write to Billy Perrigo at billy.perrigo@time.com."

In the wake of the mass church shooting, the tweet seemed an appropriate expression of condolence offered by Trump as he wrote that he was keeping an eye on the situation from Japan.    ""I think that is EXACTLY what happened."" ""I'm surprised that his staff haven't removed this yet to correct it. They must be asleep."" ""Honestly I am too. U would think someone would have had to have noticed it. It's 100% a mistake, there's no denying it."" ""In their defense, babysitting his Twitter acct 24/7 is an exhausting job. They need their sleep."" ""No doubt about it. It's like a 5 person job."" ""Trump just tweeted about the wrong mass shooting..."" ""The people of Sutherland Springs' probably didn't want to be back in the news as the subjects of your latest dotardedness."" ""Sad that the template has to be changed.

Trump is believed to have been attempting to publish his thoughts about the mass shooting on Tuesday, which took place in northern California, as reported by Newser. The Twitter mistake caused confusion and prompted the speculation that Trump may use a standard template about what to write when a mass shooting happens, wherein Trump simply changes the location of the shooting and the wording, as reported by People. Meanwhile, as if to cover up or divert from his Twitter mistake directed to the victims of the mass shooting in the Sutherland Springs church on November 5, Trump turned his Twitter attention to CNN. As seen in the below tweet, Trump claimed that he was forced to watch CNN whilst traveling overseas and as a result, the leader of the free world dubbed CNN a ""loser!"" "

https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/11/15/boy-6-shot-twice-at-school-by-california-gunman-recovering-from-lifesaving-surgery/23278213/," A young boy who was shot twice when a gunman opened fire on a California elementary school is expected to survive after undergoing surgery on Tuesday. Alejandro Hernandez was shot in the chest and foot when 43-year-old Kevin Neal unloaded some 100 rounds at Rancho Tehama Elementary school outside Sacramento in what cops say was a rampage that began with a dispute with neighbors.

He is expected to survive. RELATED: Shooting at elementary school in Rancho Tehama, California Meanwhile, a GoFundMe page has been created to help pay medical costs for the family, who reportedly only recently lost their home in a fire. ""His family needs prayers and support at this time and any donation and prayers are appreciated. Thank You,"" reads the page, which can be found here. Cops believe the school was one of a series of random sites where Neal opened fire after he killed two neighbors with whom he had been feuding since at least January when he was accused of assaulting a female neighbor. Tehama County Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston told reporters the school locked its doors and students and staff quickly ""sheltered in place."" The ""quick action of school officials saved countless lives and children,"" Johnston said. A second child was injured in a car along with his mother as they were driving to the school. Both are expected to survive. All told, 10 people are believed to have been wounded and five people killed before the rampage was stopped. Johnston said shooting spree ended when a patrol car rammed the stolen vehicle the shooter was driving before cops killed him in a shootout.

""May God be with the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas,"" Trump wrote on Tuesday night. ""The FBI and Law Enforcement has arrived."" Trump posted the tweet just after 11:30 p.m. ET and seemed to delete it roughly 10 hours later. The president did tweet about the shooting, which left 26 people dead, when it occurred 10 days ago.

http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-met-northern-california-shooting-huppke-20171115-story.html,"I’m not going to bring up gun control. We’re still under the “too soon” rule from last week’s massacre during Sunday service at a Texas church, so it’s certainly too soon to talk about guns in connection to Tuesday’s shooting spree. Maybe you didn’t hear about that one — such things tend to come and go with little fanfare these days. It happened in Northern California. A man with a semi-automatic rifle and two handguns started randomly shooting people all over a small town, including at an elementary school. Five people were killed and at least two children were wounded, one of them at the school. There’s no motive yet, just reports of a neighborhood dispute. Phil Johnston, assistant sheriff of Tehama County, told reporters: “This is an individual that armed himself with the motive of getting even with his neighbor and just went on a rampage. I don’t know how to describe it to you any different.” Maybe that’s because these tragedies all start to sound the same: some random guy; an inexplicable outburst of violence; lives shattered. Remember, I’m keeping quiet about the firearms. One has to be respectful. Instead, I’m going to talk about mental health. The wise folks, the ones who tell us guns aren’t the problem when it comes to a Texan shooting 26 people to death in a church or a Nevadan opening fire from a hotel window in Las Vegas and killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more, say mass shootings are a mental health issue. Period. I’m inclined to agree with that, except for the “period” part. There’s more than that to blame, but it involves something I’m not talking about right now because it’s too soon. So let’s just say mental health is a factor when it comes to murderous rampages. Law enforcement officials say the Northern California shooter tried to get into the elementary school to shoot more kids but was stopped because the school was on lockdown. Nobody’s going to convince me a person capable of such a thing is sane. So we have a mental health problem in this country. We’re reminded of that after every mass shooting. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle extend their thoughts and prayers, those who line their pockets with cash from the National Rifle Association say guns aren’t the problem and everyone brings up mental health and says it must be addressed. But it doesn’t get addressed, at least not in any significant way. Nothing changes with that other thing — the one that it’s too soon to speak about — either, but since there seems to be agreement on the mental health issue, let me ask this: Why no action? It feels like we’re being played. A New York Times story from September 2013, in the wake of the Washington Navy Yard shooting, read: “Despite deep divisions that have kept Congress from passing new gun safety laws for almost two decades, there is one aspect of gun control on which many Democrats, Republicans and even the National Rifle Association agree: the need to give mental health providers better resources to treat dangerous people and prevent them from buying weapons.” Yeah, that didn’t really go anywhere. Republicans worried it might be a back door to tighter laws on purchases of those things I’m not talking about and Democrats worried Republicans might use it as an excuse to not pass tighter laws on purchases of those things I’m not talking about and everyone just gave up and started waiting for the next mass shooting to roll around. Tragedy. Outrage. Too soon. Mental health reform. Nothing. Repeat. It has been only a month and a half since the Las Vegas massacre, which was followed by the Texas church shooting and now this shooting spree in California. That’s 89 people dead and hundreds injured. If we’re going to declare mental health the real problem behind these shootings, it seems fair to say America is facing a mental health crisis. What has happened this year, as bodies continue to hit the ground at concerts and in churches and elementary schools, is this: Republican lawmakers tried to repeal Obamacare, proposing a phaseout of the law’s Medicaid expansion that provides mental health care for hundreds of thousands of Americans. The law also makes employer health care plans cover mental health services on the same level as medical services. Obamacare repeal failed, but now Republicans are trying to push through a tax cut package that would sabotage the health care law by eliminating the individual mandate, which the Congressional Budget Office says would cause millions of Americans to lose their health care. I thought mental health was the big problem. I thought that was the thing we were supposed to be talking about in the wake of a tragedy like the one Tuesday in California. After the Texas church shooting, President Donald Trump said: “I think that mental health is your problem here. We have a lot of mental health problems in our country, as do other countries. But this isn’t a guns situation.” It’s good it’s not a guns situation, because we’re not allowed to talk about those things. We can only talk about mental health. What I don’t understand, then, is why the people talking about mental health in the wake of a mass shooting never seem to do anything to make our mental health care system better. I almost think they’re trying to distract us, hoping thoughts and prayers will be good enough. But people keep dying. And those thoughts and prayers aren’t solving anything. rhuppke@chicagotribune.com CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"

http://www.denverpost.com/2017/11/15/california-gunman-wife-found-dead-in-home/,"Trending: RANCHO TEHAMA RESERVE, Calif. — The wife of a gunman who went on a shooting rampage in a Northern California town was found dead inside their home, authorities announced Wednesday, raising the death toll from the attack to five. Investigators discovered the body of Kevin Janson Neal’s wife hidden under the floor. They believe her slaying was the start of the rampage, said Tehama County Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston. Neal shot and killed four other people and wounded 10 at different locations around the rural community of Rancho Tehama Reserve. Police later shot and killed him. At the time of the attack, the gunman was out on bail after he was charged with stabbing a neighbor. Others had complained about him firing hundreds of rounds from his house, and the assistant sheriff acknowledged officers had visited the home. “We can’t anticipate what people are going to do. We don’t have a crystal ball,” Johnston said. Yet Neal was free and able to use a semi-automatic rifle and two handguns Tuesday to shoot 14 people, including at an elementary school, before he died in a shootout with police. It’s not yet clear what the terms of Neal’s bail were, and whether he would have been allowed to possess and fire the weapons on his property at the end of a dirt road in Rancho Tehama Reserve. But his many contacts with authorities raised questions of why he was out of custody and able to go on the 45-minute rampage. Two of his neighbors were killed in an apparent act of revenge before he went looking for random victims. Cristal Caravez and her father live across a ravine from the roadway where the gunman and his first victims lived. She said they and others heard constant gunfire from the area of the gunman’s house, but couldn’t say for sure it was him firing. “You could hear the yelling. He’d go off the hinges,” she said. The shooting “would be during the day, during the night, I mean, it didn’t matter.” She and her father, who is president of the community’s homeowners’ association, said neighbors would complain to the sheriff’s department, which referred the complaints back to the homeowners’ association.

The gunman’s sister, Sheridan Orr, said her brother had struggled with mental illness throughout his life and at times had a violent temper. She said Neal had “no business” owning firearms. The shooter was facing charges of assaulting one of the feuding neighbors in January and that she had a restraining order against him, Johnston said. He did not comment on the shooter’s access to firearms. Johnston declined to identify the shooter until his relatives were notified, but he confirmed the gunman was charged with assault in January and had a restraining order placed against him. The district attorney, Gregg Cohen, told the Sacramento Bee he is prosecuting a man named Kevin Neal in that case. Neal’s mother told The Associated Press her son, who was a marijuana grower, was in a long-running dispute with neighbors he believed were cooking methamphetamine. The mother, who spoke on condition she be named only as Anne because she fears for her safety, lives in Raleigh, North Carolina, where she raised Neal. She said she posted his $160,000 bail and spent $10,000 on a lawyer after he was arrested in January for stabbing a neighbor. Neal’s mother said the neighbor was slightly cut after Neal grabbed a steak knife out of the hand of the neighbor who was threatening him with it. She wept as she told The AP she spoke to Neal on the phone on Monday. “Mom it’s all over now,” she said he told her. “I have done everything I could do and I am fighting against everyone who lives in this area.” She said Neal apologized to her during their brief conversation, she thought for all the money she had spent on him, saying he was “on a cliff” and the people around him were trying to “execute” him. “I think the motive of getting even with his neighbors and when it went that far — he just went on a rampage,” Johnston said. Police said surveillance video shows the shooter unsuccessfully trying to enter a nearby elementary school after quick-thinking staff members locked the outside doors and barricaded themselves inside when they heard gunshots. Johnston said the gunman spent about six minutes shooting into Rancho Tehama Elementary School before driving off to continue shooting elsewhere. Johnston said one student was shot but is expected to survive. He said the 45-minute rampage ended when a patrol car rammed the stolen vehicle the shooter was driving and killed him in a shootout. Johnston said officials received multiple 911 calls about gunfire at an intersection of two dirt roads. Minutes later, more calls reporting shots flooded in from different locations, including the school. Witnesses reported hearing gunshots and children screaming at the school, which has one class of students from kindergarten through fifth grade. Rancho Tehama Reserve is in a sparsely populated area of rolling woodlands dotted with grazing cattle about 130 miles north of Sacramento. ___ Elias reported from San Francisco.

http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/hottopics/~3/hxCsgHChGn4/ct-las-vegas-shooting-lawsuits-20171115-story.html,"CHICAGO — Legal action following the mass shooting at a Las Vegas concert is picking up with lawsuits filed Wednesday on behalf of 14 concertgoers, including some who were shot or injured trying to escape and one woman who is so traumatized that she has since mistaken the sound of rain for gunshots. The hotel-casino from where Stephen Paddock fired, concert organizers and the makers and sellers of a bump stock gun accessory that enabled him to fire rapidly are named as defendants. The court filings argue that they all share blame for the worst mass shooting in recent U.S. history. The 14 civil complaints, filed together in state court in Las Vegas, follow at least three others filed since Paddock opened fire Oct. 1 from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds of others. The lawsuit seeks unspecific compensation for both ""physical and mental injuries."" The challenge for mass-shooting lawsuits is clearing a high legal bar to prove someone other than the shooter bears any responsibility. Such litigation typically drags for years and can end with victims and their families receiving little to nothing. One of those suing, Elisha Seng, described in a phone interview haunting images she can't dispel — of bullets thudding around her on the concert grounds and of turning to see a young woman covered in blood after being shot, clutching her throat and falling forward. ""I don't sleep at night and, when I do, I have nightmares,"" said the 46-year-old from Bartlett, Ill., just outside Chicago. Recently, as heavy rain began to fall outside overnight, she jumped up from her bed. ""I thought it was gunshots."" Seng, who wasn't physically injured, returned to work as a sales representative, but said she quickly tires from her lack of sleep. Going to concert or sports halls can prompt flashbacks. She recently attended a Chicago Blackhawks game and found herself nervously calculating the best escape routes should someone open fire. A Chicago law firm helped to prepare the filings, which include several plaintiffs from the Chicago area. Victims named in the suits also include a California man, Anthony Crisci, who was rushed to a hospital with a gunshot wound in a truck crowded with other victims. Among deficiencies at the concert venue were poorly marked exits, Wednesday's filings say. And the hotel, it says, should have had gunfire-location devices that pinpoint where shots are coming from. The 64-year-old Paddock, who killed himself just before his room was stormed, is also named in a bid to seize assets from his estate. Paddock was able to use VIP status conferred on him as a high-stakes gambler to stockpile more than 20 rifles in his hotel suite, including by using exclusive access to a service elevator over days, the filings say. They argue what should have been routine checks of Paddock's bags and his room would have revealed his growing arsenal. The filings name a leading bump stock maker, Texas-based Slide Fire Solutions, as a defendant. A lead attorney, Chicago-based Antonio Romanucci, said it wasn't yet clear which manufacturer, wholesaler or retailer made and sold the specific bump stock that Paddock used, but that the idea was to hold ""the entire supply chain"" responsible. Messages seeking comment from Slide Fire weren't returned. MGM Resorts International, the parent company of Mandalay Bay, called the shooting ""a meticulously planned, evil ... act"" in a statement Wednesday and added that it would respond to any allegations only through ""the appropriate legal channels."" Live Nation, a concert organizer named in the filings, said in a statement it cannot comment on pending litigation, but that the company remains ""heartbroken for the victims."" Bump stocks were originally created ostensibly to make it easier for people with disabilities to shoot. But the filings allege that Slide Fire geared its marketing to regular gun owners who wanted their semi-automatic rifles to mimic fully automatic weapons. Civil cases in mass shootings are becoming increasingly common. Romanucci has also filed a lawsuit on behalf of victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting that killed 49 people last year in Orlando, Fla. It alleges, among other things, that a security firm that once employed gunman Omar Mateen knew Mateen was mentally unstable and had threatened violence, and should have alerted authorities. Mateen was killed in a shootout with police. The 2007 Virginia Tech campus shooting in which Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people illustrated the difficulties posed by such lawsuits. In 2013, the Virginia Supreme Court overturned a jury verdict siding with parents of two victims who claimed the state was negligent. A statement from the state attorney general's office at the time said the reversal showed what it had argued during years of litigation: ""Cho was the lone person responsible for this tragedy."" Cho killed himself after his rampage. Seng said she joined the civil case to force better security at concerts and at hotels. She said she can't fathom how a hotel-casino that devotes so many resources to catching gamblers that cheat didn't notice Paddock bringing in high-powered weapons over a number of days.

SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas — Three thousand people mourned eight members of a family who were among the more than two dozen killed in a shooting at a small Texas church Wednesday before the funeral procession headed to a cemetery near the site of the massacre. Surrounding the multicolored caskets, mourners released light pink and blue balloons at a graveside service for the Holcombe family in rural Wilson County. Church member and survivor John Holcombe had invited the public to attend the funeral of his pregnant wife, Crystal, 36, and three of her children from a previous marriage, Greg Hill, 13, Emily Hill, 11, and Megan Hill, 9; his parents, 60-year-old Bryan and Karla Holcombe, 58; a brother, 36-year-old Marc Holcombe, and Marc’s 18-month-old daughter, Noah. Fire marshals had to turn hundreds more people away from the services at an events center in Floresville, Texas, about 12 miles (19 kilometers) from the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, where the Nov. 5 shooting occurred.

News reporters were barred from entering the event center and were being held in a pen with two trucks obscuring the view inside. In an earlier Facebook post, John Holcombe thanked friends and well-wishers for their support, adding: “Please continue to pray for us.” The gunman, Devin Patrick Kelley, began firing into First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs as Bryan Holcombe, an assistant pastor, ascended to the pulpit. Walking up and down the center aisle, Kelley killed 25 people at the church, including crying babies at point-blank range, according to witness accounts. Authorities have put the official toll at 26, because Crystal Holcombe was pregnant. John Holcombe was managing the church’s audio-visual operations at the back of the building when gunfire erupted. He and Crystal’s 7-year-old daughter Evelyn escaped the barrage. Crystal’s eldest child, 14-year-old Philip, had stayed home from church services that day. After his rampage, Kelley fled in a vehicle parked near the church, pursued by a barefoot observer with an AR assault rifle and another man in a pick-up truck. The man with the rifle shot and struck Kelley but authorities say the gunman died of what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Investigators have said the attack appeared to stem from a domestic dispute Kelley was having with his mother-in-law, a member of the church who wasn’t present that day. However, among the victims was Lula White, the gunman’s wife’s 71-year-old grandmother. Kelley had a history of domestic violence: He was given a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force after pleading guilty to assaulting his first wife and stepson. Under federal law, anyone convicted of domestic violence cannot purchase a firearm. But the Air Force failed to inform federal law enforcement authorities that Kelley had been court-martialed. When he tried to buy guns after his release from a military prison, his conviction was not in the database used to conduct background checks, and the purchases went through. In addition to those killed, another 20 people were injured in the shooting. Eight survivors remained hospitalized Wednesday at two San Antonio-area hospitals, their conditions ranging from good to critical. Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts"
http://theweek.com/speedreads/737697/14-more-lawsuits-filed-over-las-vegas-mass-shooting,"Las Vegas shooting Drew Angerer/Getty Images Another 14 lawsuits have been filed from people seeking damages in connection to the mass shooting Oct. 1 at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas, which left 58 people dead and more than 500 injured. The complaints, filed in Clark County on Wednesday, allege that Mandalay Bay, the hotel from which the gunman fired on the crowd, did not adequately train its security staff and did not have a plan for what to do during an active shooter situation. Additionally, the plaintiffs want to know why there weren't more security cameras in place on the 32nd floor, where the shooter's room was located. The suits also claim that Live Nation Entertainment, the festival's organizer, did not train employees properly on what to do in an emergency and did not have clearly marked exits, and alleges that Slide Fire Solutions, the manufacturer of the bump-stock devices used by the gunman to fire faster into the crowd, sells its products ""without any reasonable measures or safeguards and which the killer used to such horrifying ends."" Attorney Timothy Titolo told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the plaintiffs are from Nevada, California, and Illinois, and include concertgoers and at least one employee who worked the festival. ""Of these 14 cases, there's a couple who were shot and survived, a wrongful death, and a lot of other people who were hurt not by a gun, but by shrapnel or during the escape,"" he said, adding that all experienced emotional trauma.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/16/heroes-of-las-vegas-the-hospital-staff-called-to-action-after-the-mass-shooting,"When a festival became the scene of the worst mass shooting in modern America, Sunrise hospital staff had only minutes to prepare. Here are their stories Last modified on Wed 20 Feb 2019 16.08 GMT Sunrise Hospital’s emergency room was already full at about 10pm on 1 October when a police officer dropping off an accident victim received a call on his radio announcing: “Shots fired.” Doctor Kevin Menes and nurse Rhonda Davis looked up from their charts. “Is this for real?” Menes asked. A series of gunshots crackled through the officer’s radio in automatic bursts. It sounded like a combat zone. As he ran out, the officer said, “That’s the Route 91 concert.”  Immediately, Menes realized there would be hundreds if not thousands of victims, and Sunrise – Las Vegas’s largest trauma center and the hospital nearest to the site of the country music festival – would probably receive the most. He and Davis started to prepare. Menes contacted house supervisor Kat Comanescu, who then summoned all available nurses to the ER to help move or discharge patients. Davis requested crash carts and gurneys. With only four ER doctors and one trauma surgeon on shift at the time, a mass casualty incident alert went out to bring in day-shift doctors, nurses and support staff. On a typical day, Sunrise receives 20 trauma patients, but in the coming hours they would see approximately 200, including 124 people with gunshot wounds, the first of which would arrive within 15 minutes. The staff waited with a line of stretchers and wheelchairs in Sunrise’s ambulance bay as the sirens grew closer and louder. The plan was to separate patients into triage zones based on whether each person had seconds, minutes or hours to live, then stabilize or resuscitate them in preparation for surgery. Everyone who was there that night described the blood and chaos, but also shared oddly uplifting stories of teamwork, humanity and grit. The Guardian interviewed 10 Sunrise staff members – here are their experiences. The first thing Menes did was get a police radio from his car. As well as being an ER physician, he is a medic for the Swat team, and listening to the Las Vegas Metropolitan police channel he began to grasp the scope of the tragedy. Menes gathered the four other ER doctors on shift, and they agreed that Menes would handle lead triage. That meant organizing patients for nurses and physicians who would focus on blood, intubation, chest tubes and everything else needed before surgery. Menes told secretaries to prep all 24 operating rooms and call every surgeon and anesthesiologist. “The surgery department is really what’s going to save people’s lives,” he told the Guardian. “As ER doctors we bring people back to life and keep them alive for a short time, but surgeons are the ones who work the miracles. They’re the ones who get the bleeding to stop and continue to get them better over next days and weeks, and eventually get them home.” All available gurneys and wheelchairs were taken out to the ambulance bay, where non-ER staff would wheel patients in. They set up and waited. “At about that time I was out on the driveway,” Menes recalled. “You could hear it in the distance. You could hear the sirens coming soft initially, then getting louder and louder. The first cars that came were police cruisers. They can run red lights and had filled up with as many patients as they could.” There is a textbook way to handle a mass casualty surge. Patients are given colored tags based on whether they have seconds or minutes to live (red), an hour or so (yellow), are unlikely to die (green), or have died (black). But to save time, Menes designated the four trauma bays as red, orange, yellow and green, inventing an extra severity level and skipping black – those he believed to be dead would go to the red tag area so a second doctor could assess them in case Menes was wrong. Those who had died went to a temporary morgue in the endoscopy room. It was a plan he had developed through studying the hospital’s layout and the city’s vulnerability. “It’s an open secret that we have a lot of crowds here in Las Vegas and there is always the potential for something like this to happen. For years I’d been thinking about what I’d do. I never said anything to anyone though because I didn’t want them thinking I was crazy.” After 150 people had been brought in, a nurse came out to the ambulance bay to say, “Menes, they need you inside; they’re getting behind.” He went to help stabilize or resuscitate people who were near death, while a trauma surgeon decided who would go into the operating room next. At one point Menes told nurses to take every unit of O-negative from the blood bank and fill their pockets with the intubation drugs to save the precious time it normally takes to fill out paperwork and use digital devices that track supplies. “These are complete no-nos in nursing – carrying drugs in pockets that aren’t accounted for,” Menes admitted. “But we had to do it to save patients’ lives, and it worked.” After 30 minutes, more staff showed up, additional operating rooms were opened, and after an hour more surgeons and doctors arrived. “We were getting more and more patients out of the ER and into life-saving surgeries. This dance continued on for hours, and when everything was said and done, at 5am, it was like a ghost town. Almost everybody had been taken care of.” Sixteen people of at least 200 patients seen that night died in their care, but during the first six hours the trauma team performed 28 surgeries to stop internal bleeding, and 67 operations in the first 24 hours. More than 100 physicians and 200 nurses had come in. “As a medical community we came together. But it wasn’t just us. This happened all over the [Las Vegas] Valley, and in a smaller way this happens every night all over the world, 365 days a year.” “We actually got a few minutes’ heads-up quicker than anyone else because that officer just happened to be standing in our ER,” recalled Davis. “It kind of took a while to process what was really going on. Hearing a barrage of bullets was shocking – I was stunned.” After worrying about friends at the show her “nurse brain” kicked in. “I thought: oh my goodness, this is going to be huge.” She helped notify doctors and surgeons. They started getting the trauma bays ready, which required moving non-critical patients to other areas of the hospital. Emergency dispatchers for Clark County, which contains Las Vegas, usually estimate how many people each hospital will receive, but this time all they could do was stress: “You will get a lot of patients.” “Even then I didn’t quite get the grand scale of what it would be,” Davis recalled. “It’s hard to imagine that you’re going to get hundreds of patients in minutes.” This first wave arrived in police cars and private vehicles. She saw a young man with a gunshot wound to his leg, and seconds later the most critical patients started coming in, covered in blood. The most critical cases were gunshot wounds to the head, chest and stomach. Some of the patients did not have a pulse. “We were trying to do CPR, putting chest tubes in, all of the life-saving measures that you would do,” she said. “We get patients like this all the time, but maybe two at a time at most. You do all these steps to try to save their life. At this moment we had several who needed all these life-saving critical interventions at the same time. We went patient to patient as quickly as possible, trying to help save them. I wasn’t thinking. You just kind of do. Quickly it turned into a sea of blood and patients.” Nurses usually get assigned patients to care for through their shifts, but in this case “you literally did whatever you could to whatever patient”, she recalled. The four trauma bay rooms typically hold six patients in total, yet each one was being used for four or five people, and there were more in the halls. She recalled receiving a young female who had been shot in the chest. With every square inch of the trauma bay taken, Davis and an anesthesiologist worked on her in the hall. He was trying to put a chest tube in, because she wasn’t breathing, and when they could not detect a pulse Davis started doing CPR immediately. “I was leaning up on top of the gurney doing chest compressions, trying to save this poor girl’s life, and there’s just blood coming out of her chest from the wound.” At one point Davis looked up and saw three more patients being moved into the hallway. Doctors and nurses were doing the exact same things for them. There was blood all over the floor. Unfortunately, the patient she was working on could not be saved. Davis had to move on very quickly to the next patient: another young female in the same situation. Not a day goes by without Davis thinking about that night. “Some moments during the day I’m completely fine, then I’ll hear something or see something and the memory of that scene in the ER will pop in my mind. It’s very vivid still.” When she received the first Mass Casualty Incident alert, Sondereker turned on the news and saw nothing. She called her unit and was told: “There’s blood everywhere. Get in here now.” While driving in she heard that 75 ambulances had been dispatched to the Strip, which was “beyond comprehension”, she said. “That’s never happened before.” Ambulances flew past as she drove in, and while turning into Sunrise, pickup trucks cut her off; she heard injured people crying in their flatbeds. “In 35 years in medicine I’ve worked in ambulance, EMS, trauma and helicopter crews. I’ve seen burn ward devastation, but nothing like this.” The victims arrived in cars, trucks, rideshares, police SUVs and of course ambulances, which instead of the usual one patient would transport six to eight at a time. She too mentioned a “sea of blood”: “I’ve never seen this amount of trauma in a few hours come through the door. The bullet wounds were the size of your nail bed, but the devastation those bullets caused in the human body was catastrophic. People could be talking with a small wound in their chest then be gone within seconds. “The night flew so fast,” she said. “You directed it, but it was surreal how things just happened; the flow was amazing. We’d call for more stretchers and recliners and they’d appear. The ER was full, so we moved people up and discharged from the top floors. In all the chaos was a calmness I can’t describe because everyone was working their hearts out. That’s one reason it was successful – a camaraderie and teamwork like I’ve never experienced in my life.” She added: “Hospitals have an option to divert [patients]. EMS kept asking me, ‘how many more can you take?’ I kept saying 10 more. It was an eyeball thing – like where are we at? How many have I moved to cardio, to ICU, to surgery?” Within an hour, 100 physicians and 100 nurses had arrived to help. “I’m from small-town Iowa; I’ve seen camaraderie, but nothing like Las Vegas has put out in the past few weeks. The way they came together was heroic – concierges helping people in, nurses’ assistants holding hands, even the patients who said “take care of those who are hurt worse. I’m good.” It wasn’t an ER of screaming. There was a calmness, because people were being taken care of.” Sanguinet had to wait for her mother to come to watch her kids before she could get to Sunrise at 4am. The hospital was on lockdown and the halls were quiet. “The fear and anguish was palpable,” she said. “Everyone had the same look of shock.” At that hour victims’ families were also trickling in, some from out of state. Sanguinet went to the family resource center to help provide food, blankets and emotional support. Victims who had already been discharged from the ER were interspersed with families, holding each other’s hands. “People swirled around us,” she recalled, “because they saw a badge and saw us taking names. It definitely put my skills to a test. I tried to set aside my own emotions as a parent, but obviously I’m still human, so as I’m walking and doing my job, I’m also crying.” She and two colleagues took it upon themselves to search for people. They photographed images from the families’ cellphones and walked floor to floor, in some cases scrutinizing victims’ tattoos or piercings. “A lot of people unfortunately had issues where they weren’t recognizable. You also look different in a hospital than when you’re on the street smiling and happy.” If a victim was alive and could be touched, staff immediately ran to the family to bring them to their side. But if the person was in the morgue, it was more complicated. Sanguinet personally matched eight or nine fatally wounded victims to their family members, a bittersweet experience. She delivered the news with a team that included clergy, medical staff and a case manager. “I was there for the comforting part.” A couple of days later, one of those parents called to see if her late daughter’s boots had been found – the family wanted to bury their daughter in her favorite outfit. Very few patients’ belongings were at Sunrise – a lot of loose items fell off or were torn away at the site. But at the bottom of the ER’s storage box were the young woman’s boots in a bag. “I went to package them,” Sanguinet said. “I took them out of the bag and saw they were covered in blood, dirt, and filth from the event. I’m a mom. I have kids, and God forbid this would ever happen to me, I wouldn’t want that to come back. I wouldn’t want that reminder. I closed my door, I put something on the floor, and I sat there for two hours scrubbing those boots. A co-worker brought me a tool to help clean the soles. “It was really a cathartic time for me to sit and reflect on everything that had happened. It brings home the fact that Las Vegas is my home now, and Sunrise hospital is my home now. I know that that mom is grateful that I took the time; for me it was a bit of closure to know that even out of tragedy you could do something to make a difference in an outcome that was so horrible.” As a former trauma nurse, Comanescu knew exactly what was needed when Menes called saying: “Something has happened at the Mandalay Bay,” the hotel from which the killer shot into the crowd. Her ER experience also allowed her to stay calm. “I was thinking we needed manpower, space and supplies if a lot of people are coming. Our hospital was almost full.” She broadcast to intensive care and telemetry units: “Send all your available nurses to the ER.” Less critical patients needed to be moved out of trauma bays. Each department was also instructed to keep one “crash cart”, or mobile cabinet, and these were rolled to the ER, their trays full of chest tubes, drugs and other life-saving supplies. They were in high demand when the ER became overrun with gunshot wound victims as patient after patient needed to be stabilized and intubated for emergency surgery. “They were amazing,” Comanescu says of her staff. “People were just coming to help, bringing all these supplies. The fact that people came from home and opened spaces that weren’t open … That night will stay with me for the rest of my life.” Parish ran full speed pushing crash carts to the ER. They are heavy machines, and to keep supplies flowing she would sprint back and forth between the pharmacy and the ER throughout the night. A nursing student, once the ER was stocked with drugs, she told the charge nurse: “There are limited things I can do, but I can help.” So many patients were in danger of bleeding out that she helped assess wounds, apply tourniquets, place IVs and monitor vital signs to notify doctors when patients crashed, until on-call staff nurses arrived. “Some of the nurses from upstairs were traumatized,” she recalled. “They’ve seen patients pass before, but on a scale this size it’s overwhelming.” She helped colleagues focus on a checklist: assess and if necessary pack the wounds – stopping the bleeding came first. And she helped victims call their families. “There were people who couldn’t operate their phones because they had blood in their eyes, were in shock, or had lost their phones. I let them use mine, and it’s been a little hard now. I have families contacting me to say thank you even though their people didn’t make it.” By that time the staff was operating with mechanical efficiency, she said. “Everybody was doing exactly what they needed to do to help as many people as they could. At that point I was in awe … Ever since I started nursing school, the human race has been declining and hating on each other. I was debating whether I wanted to be a nurse. But when I looked around, I was like, this is what it’s about: saving people. We were the helpers. That was the most memorable moment. Yeah, there was a lot of trauma happening, but at the same moment humanity was happening and it was amazing.” “A lot of mass casualty alerts end up not significant, or false alarms,” said Fisher. “But when I first pulled in it was an unbelievable sight. I got a pit in my stomach walking up because I knew something huge happened. There were multiple Metro vehicles, ambulances pulling in, nurses bringing out multiple gurneys to take people in stretchers from private vehicles.” Two other surgeons were already in and three more were en route. Fisher went to the operating room where the first patient was on the table, prepped and draped. The anesthesiologist came in while Fisher located the wounds. He started operating. The key difference from a normal night, apart from the sheer volume of patients, was that the wounds were from a rifle, which is more serious because the rounds have a higher velocity than handgun bullets. Their assembly-line approach worked “fantastically well”, he said. “Patients didn’t have to wait to be operated on. We used all 24 operating rooms. All the staff came in right away, and that made a huge difference.” Fisher operated on five people during a 24-hour shift. In between, he helped coordinate where patients would go and who would be next while performing triage. Everyone was in the zone, and the gravity of the mass shooting did not hit him until he went home the next night and his dogs smelled and licked the blood on his shoes. He put them in the trash. At first, Szymanski experienced the night’s trauma as a concertgoer. She and her husband were about to leave the Route 91 festival when the gunfire started. They believed they were hearing the sound of firecrackers. Security officers screamed that people should turn around and take cover, so they ducked into a bar with a roof overhead. They ran out in between shots, and she called her hospital to tell them what was happening. As they got away, they passed injured people resting against dumpsters, and Szymanski asked them: “Are you OK?” “Honestly, it felt very debilitating,” she recalled, “because I’m a non-clinical member of our team.” All she could do was help Sunrise prepare. Showing up in her concert T-shirt and shorts, she turned the auditorium into a waiting room for victims’ families. There, she gave people in blood- or dirt-stained clothes fresh outfits and handed cellphone chargers out, got the cafe open to provide coffee, and began working with case managers to help find missing loved ones. “Going back and forth between the war zone was unlike anything I’ve ever seen, but the patients were so wonderful. Many of them laying on gurneys in the ER were saying, ‘No I’m not that bad, go to work on them not me’.” The next day she managed a massive influx of food and water donations and brought in therapy dogs. Between five and 12 golden retrievers would visit Sunrise over the next few weeks, interacting with families, patients and staff. “My phone was blowing up with names of people who needed fuzzy love. It made a big difference.” Brown was part of the team that moved people upstairs from the ER, and then came back down to help triage the emergency cases. “It was difficult,” she said. “We’re not used to being the first line, per se. I had to revert back to training and try to think of basic things that needed to be done.” When she returned to the ICU at 7am, she cared for patients whom she had helped stabilize downstairs who had now gone through life-saving surgeries. In the weeks that followed, she watched them further improve. “Some people we thought might not wake up, or talk or walk again were able to get up and move. From everything we saw that night to a week later the progress was amazing.” Her most vivid memory, though, was of a patient who had arrived at the ER before the shooting, an older blind woman who asked to leave. “She couldn’t see what was going on in the ER at all, but she could sense it, and hear it obviously. She had a daughter in town who’d gladly take her home, she said. In the middle of everything that was going on, when she came up to ask me that, it was touching. She was realizing she didn’t need to be in our busy ER for what she had at that exact moment. It kind of stuck. There were other victims who were the same way after that. You start to see all that good from people who’ve gone through something traumatic, and it keeps you going for all the ones who aren’t able to do that.” “As a level two trauma center we see all sorts of trauma, from stabbings to gunshots, to car accidents,” said Sklamberg, speaking in front of signed placards from medical staff in Orlando, San Bernardino, Denver, Boston and Newtown. “We drill and we prepare on a very regular basis, but nothing could have prepared us for this event in terms of the quantity of patients that came. Over 120 gunshot victims came into Sunrise over a two-hour period of time – unprecedented numbers in the history of the US. But the preparation, the drilling we do, gave us the foundation upon which to provide that care to all the patients who came in. “No patient was turned away.”"
http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/nov/16/vegas-concertgoers-sue-over-shooting/,"Legal action after the mass shooting at a Las Vegas concert picked up Wednesday with lawsuits filed on behalf of 14 concertgoers, including some who were shot or injured trying to escape and one woman who said she is so traumatized that she has since mistaken the sound of rain for gunshots. Named as defendants are the hotel-casino from which Stephen Paddock fired, concert organizers and the makers and sellers of a bump stock gun accessory that enabled him to fire rapidly. The court filings argue that they all share blame for the worst mass shooting in recent U.S. history. The 14 civil complaints, filed together in state court in Las Vegas, follow at least three others filed since Paddock opened fire Oct. 1 from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds of others. The lawsuit seeks unspecific compensation for both “physical and mental injuries.” A Chicago law firm helped to prepare the filings, which include several plaintiffs from the Chicago area. Victims named in the suits include a California man, Anthony Crisci, who was rushed to a hospital with a gunshot wound in a truck crowded with dead and injured people. Among the deficiencies at the concert venue were poorly marked exits, Wednesday’s filings say. And the hotel, the filings say, should have had gunfire-location devices that pinpoint where shots are being fired. The 64-year-old Paddock, who killed himself just before his room was stormed, is also named in a bid to seize assets from his estate. Copyright © 2021, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

Just days before this year's New York Comic Con, Marvel and Netflix cancelled their panel for The Punisher. The mass shooting in Las Vegas a few days prior had left 58 people dead and more than 500 injured and ""it wouldn't be appropriate"" for the violent, gun-heavy show to participate in the convention at that time,  the companies said in a statement. Tomorrow, a little more than a month after NYCC, The Punisher finally hits Netflix. More time has passed since the Las Vegas shooting, but the tragedies haven’t stopped. Less than two weeks ago, a mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas left 26 dead and another 20 wounded. Five people were killed by a gunman in Northern California earlier this week, and the US has averaged about one mass shooting incident per day in 2017. All of which is to say, if it wasn't appropriate to promote Netflix's latest Marvel adaptation at a comic book convention because it was in the wake of a horrific incident of gun violence, is it right to release the show itself after another one? Moreover, if there are always mass shootings in America, will there ever be a suitable time to release The Punisher? Related Stories Angela Watercutter Joanna Pearlstein Angela Watercutter, Peter Rubin, Adam Rogers, Jason Parham, and Brian Raftery Questions about the intersection of entertainment and real-world violence come up often. Folks asked them when Suicide Squad came to theaters so soon after last year's Orlando nightclub shooting. They were incredibly salient following the 2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting, which happened during a screening of The Dark Knight Rises. And yet, the creators of The Punisher—a show named after the alter-ego of gun-toting vigilante Frank Castle—seemingly didn't give them much thought when creating the series. In fact, in a recent interview with Syfy.com showrunner Steve Lightfoot said the issues of mass shootings and gun control weren't considered by the writing staff at all. ""With regard to certain recent events, we started making the show a year and a half ago,"" Lightfoot explained. ""We wrote most of the show before the election so I think we'd have to think back to then when we started and the short answer is not really. We had just started with the character."" Lightfoot said he also didn't consider the fandom law enforcement officials have for the character: ""I can speculate about why the Punisher resonates so strongly with them, but I sort of didn't give it too much thought as we were writing."" That the man in charge of a Punisher show didn't give such things ""too much thought"" is telling. It's indicative of a sense that Lightfoot, and perhaps Marvel as a whole, doesn't want to engage with the idea of Frank Castle as anything other than a damaged, but ultimately sympathetic, antihero—one who does whatever necessary to get the bad guys. For them, seeing Castle as any sort of reflection of reality is a step too far. That's certainly their prerogative. The Punisher is a fictional character, and it's up to Marvel and Netflix to decide how to tell his stories and how deep those stories go in interacting with the world. It’s not like Thor and Squirrel Girl are expected to act as commentary on the current political climate—what's the big deal if the Punisher is treated as just a Death Wish-esque fantasy character? (Death Wish, of course, started as something far more sober than its later sequels would suggest, and it's worth pointing out that its upcoming remake is under fire for its seeming political stance.) The Punisher isn't Thor or Squirrel Girl, though. He's not even Iron Man or Spider-Man. He’s a street-level character living in Marvel's version of the real world, with no powers but his arsenal. (The closest any other Marvel character gets to the Punisher's contemporary cultural relevance is Captain America, and that's only because he was temporarily a Nazi)  In a country where gun violence is permanently an issue, albeit one never fully examined or discussed, the Punisher's modus operandi of channelling his frustration through firearms means he ends up representing—or at least reminding people of—real-world issues, whether his creators want to admit it or not. It's understandable that Marvel would want to avoid the issue if at all possible, but ducking the question might not work, especially when the cancellation of the New York Comic Con panel proved that the company is aware of the character's wider cultural context. There may be another option, though. At NYCC, Marvel's publishing arm devoted part of its panel to the relaunch of the Punisher comic book, which features the Punisher using old Iron Man armor to overthrow a European despot for S.H.I.E.L.D.. That vision of the Punisher may be outside the traditional Frank Castle norm, but it points to a future for the character that doesn't evoke quite so much real-world grief. If Netflix grants The Punisher a second season, this new version of Castle might just warrant some consideration. More From WIRED Contact © 2021 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/16/las-vegas-shooting-lawsuits-filed-on-behalf-of-14-concertgoers,"The hotel-casino from where the gunman fired, concert organizers and the makers and sellers of a bump stock gun accessory are named as defendants Last modified on Wed 20 Feb 2019 16.08 GMT Legal action following the mass shooting at a Las Vegas concert is picking up with lawsuits filed on behalf of 14 concertgoers, including some who were shot or injured trying to escape and one woman who is so traumatized that she has since mistaken the sound of rain for gunshots. The hotel-casino from where Stephen Paddock fired, concert organizers and the makers and sellers of a bump stock gun accessory that enabled him to fire rapidly are named as defendants. The court filings argue that they all share blame for the deadliest mass shooting in recent US history.  The 14 civil complaints, filed together on Wednesday in state court in Las Vegas, follow at least three others filed since Paddock opened fire on 1 October from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds of others. The lawsuit seeks unspecific compensation for both “physical and mental injuries”. The challenge for mass shooting lawsuits is clearing a high legal bar to prove someone other than the shooter bears any responsibility. Such litigation typically drags for years and can end with victims and their families receiving little to nothing. One of those suing, Elisha Seng, described in a phone interview haunting images she can’t dispel – of bullets thudding around her on the concert grounds and of turning to see a young woman covered in blood after being shot, clutching her throat and falling forward. “I don’t sleep at night and, when I do, I have nightmares,” said the 46-year-old from Bartlett, Illinois, just outside Chicago. Recently, as heavy rain began to fall outside overnight, she jumped up from her bed. “I thought it was gunshots.” Seng, who wasn’t physically injured, returned to work as a sales representative, but said she quickly tires from her lack of sleep. Going to concert or sports halls can prompt flashbacks. She recently attended a Chicago Blackhawks game and found herself nervously calculating the best escape routes should someone open fire. A Chicago law firm helped to prepare the filings, which include several plaintiffs from the Chicago area. Victims named in the suits also include a California man, Anthony Crisci, who was rushed to a hospital with a gunshot wound in a truck crowded with other victims. Among deficiencies at the concert venue were poorly marked exits, Wednesday’s filings say. And the hotel, it says, should have had gunfire-location devices that pinpoint where shots are coming from. The 64-year-old Paddock, who killed himself just before his room was stormed, is also named in a bid to seize assets from his estate. Paddock was able to use VIP status conferred on him as a high-stakes gambler to stockpile more than 20 rifles in his hotel suite, including by using exclusive access to a service elevator over days, the filings say. They argue what should have been routine checks of Paddock’s bags and his room would have revealed his growing arsenal. The filings name a leading bump stock maker, Texas-based Slide Fire Solutions, as a defendant. A lead attorney, Chicago-based Antonio Romanucci, said it wasn’t yet clear which manufacturer, wholesaler or retailer made and sold the specific bump stock that Paddock used, but that the idea was to hold “the entire supply chain” responsible. Messages seeking comment from Slide Fire were not returned. MGM Resorts International, the parent company of Mandalay Bay, called the shooting “a meticulously planned, evil … act” in a statement on Wednesday and added that it would respond to any allegations only through “the appropriate legal channels”. Live Nation, a concert organizer named in the filings, said in a statement it could not comment on pending litigation, but that the company remains “heartbroken for the victims”. Bump stocks were originally created ostensibly to make it easier for people with disabilities to shoot. But the filings allege that Slide Fire geared its marketing to regular gun owners who wanted their semi-automatic rifles to mimic fully automatic weapons. Civil cases in mass shootings are becoming increasingly common. Romanucci has also filed a lawsuit on behalf of victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting that killed 49 people last year in Orlando, Florida. It alleges, among other things, that a security firm that once employed gunman Omar Mateen knew Mateen was mentally unstable and had threatened violence, and should have alerted authorities. Mateen was killed in a shootout with police. The 2007 Virginia Tech campus shooting in which Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people illustrated the difficulties posed by such lawsuits. In 2013, the Virginia supreme court overturned a jury verdict siding with parents of two victims who claimed the state was negligent. A statement from the state attorney general’s office at the time said the reversal showed what it had argued during years of litigation: “Cho was the lone person responsible for this tragedy.” Cho killed himself after his rampage."
http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-athletes-call-on-nfl-to-sign-colin-kaepernick-20171116-story.html,"Michael Bennett and other athletes, including the WNBA's Brittney Griner and Breanna Stewart, as well as Olympic fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad, are calling on the NFL to sign Colin Kaepernick. In a statement issued Wednesday by a Bennett-led group called Athletes in Action, they said, ""No one should be denied employment for having the courage to follow their convictions and take action for equality and social justice."" ""Join me and many others to get Colin Kaepernick signed!"" Bennett, a Seahawks defensive end, said on Twitter. Kaepernick has been a free agent since parting ways with the 49ers in March, and many believe that he is being deliberately shunned by the NFL for being the first in the league last season to stage protests during the national anthem. The 30-year-old Kaepernick has filed a grievance against the NFL for colluding to deny him employment, and attorneys for the quarterback are seeking to obtain depositions from several team owners, as well as Commissioner Roger Goodell. ""Every day that goes by and he doesn't get signed is another nail in the NFL's defense,"" one of the attorneys, Mark Geragos, told The Post's Mark Maske earlier this month. Bennett's group, which also includes former Olympian John Carlos, famous for raising a black-gloved fist on the medal podium during the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City, is seeking to harness people power on behalf of Kaepernick. Other Athletes for Impact campaigns include initiatives on gun safety, mass incarceration, police violence, LGBTQ rights, immigration and climate change. In its statement Wednesday, the group traced a tradition of athletes protesting social injustices back to the 1960s, then through the 1996 anthem protests of former NBA player Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf and demonstrations last year by WNBA players, before Kaepernick began sitting, then kneeling, during renditions of ""Star-Spangled Banner"" ahead of preseason games. ""Kaepernick was clear in live interviews and in writing about the intentions of his protest,"" the group said, ""stating time and time again the specific reasons for his demonstration, and that it was not intended to disrespect the military but start a national conversation and action around issues of injustice."" ""It is now clear that because of his courage and willingness to speak truth to power, Kaepernick has not been signed by any NFL team,"" the statement claimed. ""As Seattle Seahawks star, Michael Bennett said of Kaepernick, 'if you look at the quarterbacks in the NFL right now, out of the backups, I can't name one better than him . . .' ""Legendary athletes such as Muhammad Ali, Tommy Smith and John Carlos were disparaged by many in their day for using their platform to speak out against racism and injustice. Today their statues stand proudly in the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., and they are widely celebrated as truth tellers ahead of their time. It is time we start celebrating our truth tellers from the start."" Bennett was among the first NFL players to stage anthem demonstrations this season. Including the preseason, he has sat on a bench on Seattle's sideline during the anthem before every game except two. Earlier this month, he stood along with every Seahawks player while the host Arizona Cardinals celebrated their ""Salute to Service"" night, and before an October game they all stood to honor the victims of the Las Vegas mass shooting. After Goodell said last month that his league believes ""everyone should stand"" for the anthem, but would not force players to do so, Bennett said, ""I plan on sitting down."" With talks occurring between the NFL and its players about how to negotiate an end to the protests, the two-time Pro Bowler said at the time, ""I think the first step to even being able to even have a conversation is to make sure that Colin Kaepernick gets an opportunity to play in the NFL. ""I think all of us are having opportunities to be able to speak to our employers, but to think about the guy who started everything not to be able to have a voice at this moment, it just doesn't seem very right to me,"" Bennett added. Last week, Geragos disputed a claim by an NFL spokesman that Kaepernick's camp had not responded to an offer from the league for the quarterback to have a one-on-one meeting with Goodell. The attorney said that Kaepernick ""would be happy to attend"" a meeting with the commissioner, but that the presence of a mediator would be required because of the grievance the quarterback has filed. In its statement, Athletes for Impact said, ""We call on all NFL owners, general managers and coaches with a positional need to summon the courage to sign Colin Kaepernick and to stand with us on the right side of history.""

After Goodell said last month that his league believes “everyone should stand” for the anthem, but would not force players to do so, Bennett said, “I plan on sitting down.” With talks occurring between the NFL and its players about how to negotiate an end to the protests, the two-time Pro Bowler said at the time, “I think the first step to even being able to even have a conversation is to make sure that Colin Kaepernick gets an opportunity to play in the NFL. 
“I think all of us are having opportunities to be able to speak to our employers, but to think about the guy who started everything not to be able to have a voice at this moment, it just doesn’t seem very right to me,” Bennett added. 
Last week, Geragos disputed a claim by an NFL spokesman that Kaepernick’s camp had not responded to an offer from the league for the quarterback to have a one-on-one meeting with Goodell. The attorney said that Kaepernick “would be happy to attend” a meeting with the commissioner, but that the presence of a mediator would be required because of the grievance the quarterback has filed. 
In its statement, Athletes for Impact said, “We call on all NFL owners, general managers and coaches with a positional need to summon the courage to sign Colin Kaepernick and to stand with us on the right side of history.”

“It is now clear that because of his courage and willingness to speak truth to power, Kaepernick has not been signed by any NFL team,” the statement claimed. “As Seattle Seahawks star, Michael Bennett said of Kaepernick, ‘if you look at the quarterbacks in the NFL right now, out of the backups, I can’t name one better than him . . .’ 
“Legendary athletes such as Muhammad Ali, Tommy Smith and John Carlos were disparaged by many in their day for using their platform to speak out against racism and injustice. Today their statues stand proudly in the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., and they are widely celebrated as truth tellers ahead of their time. It is time we start celebrating our truth tellers from the start.” 
Bennett was among the first NFL players to stage anthem demonstrations this season. Including the preseason, he has sat on a bench on Seattle’s sideline during the anthem before every game except two. Earlier this month, he stood along with every Seahawks player while the host Arizona Cardinals celebrated their “Salute to Service” night, and before an October game they all stood to honor the victims of the Las Vegas mass shooting.

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/holcombe-family-8-members-sutherland-springs-church-shooting_us_5a0da534e4b0c0b2f2f830a5?section=us_religion,"Religion Reporter, HuffPost Thousands gathered in Texas on Wednesday to grieve with a family ripped apart by the Sutherland Springs church shooting. Three generations of the Holcombe family lost their lives in the mass shooting at First Baptist Church on Nov. 5. The eight family members ranged widely in age ― from an 18-month-old child to the church’s 60-year-old associate pastor. One of the victims was also pregnant. The Holcombe family’s losses accounted for one-third of the 26 deaths in the shooting. On Wednesday, John Holcombe, a survivor of the shooting, invited the public to attend memorial services for his family members at the Floresville Events Center, about 12 miles from First Baptist Church. Holcombe lost his wife, Crystal, who was pregnant. Three of Crystal’s kids from a previous marriage were also killed. Both of John’s parents were killed, along with his brother and 18-month-old niece. Tara McNulty, a close family friend, was also remembered at the funeral. At least 3,000 people showed up to pay their respects, filling the center to capacity, the AP reported. John shared stories about his wife and his three deceased stepchildren during the service, according to My San Antonio. He also spoke about the hopes the couple had for what would have been their first child together. Crystal was due in April, and they were going to name the baby Carlin Brite “Billy Bob” Holcombe. He described Crystal as a woman who could “take sick plants and heal them.” “Like how she took a broken man and made him whole again,” he said. Two of Crystal’s children are still alive ― a 7-year-old daughter named Evelyn who survived the shooting and a 14-year-old son named Philip who had stayed home from services that day. Sarah Slavin, John’s sister, reportedly spoke during the funeral about their deceased parents, Bryan and Karla. She described the parents as people who had great faith in God. The massacre at First Baptist Church was one of the deadliest mass shootings in modern U.S. history. Authorities say the shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, was involved in a domestic dispute with his in-laws, some of whom attended the church. Kelley had a history of domestic violence, including a conviction that should have prevented him from being able to purchase firearms. Kelley died after the attack, from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Joe Holcombe, Bryan’s father, reportedly took time during the service to pray for Kelley’s family, The Washington Post reported. In addition to the deaths, 20 people were also wounded in the shooting. Eight remained hospitalized on Wednesday, the AP reports. The church where the shooting took place has been turned into a memorial. The pews have been removed and 26 white chairs mark the spots where church members lost their lives. In a Facebook status posted on Nov. 8, John Holcombe asked members of the public for their continued prayers. “Please continue to pray for us in the coming days / weeks / months as we work through all of the issues,” he wrote. “I ask for prayers for health, healing, guidance, wisdom, discernment, understanding, protection, and God’s will in our decisions and in our lives. Also please keep our Church family in your prayers.” Religion Reporter, HuffPost"

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/newsy-allvideos/~3/jgWSYKBkJmw/,"Senators from both parties want to prevent mass shootings — not by proposing harder gun control measures, but by boosting enforcement of existing law. The Fix NICS Act, unveiled Thursday, aims to make federal agencies and states more vigilant. Both are already asked to report crimes that would legally prohibit someone from buying a firearm. But, in many cases, they fail to pass that information on to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System,or NICS. The Washington Post notes the NICS database is missing millions of records for these kinds of convictions. That problem became more evident after a mass shooting in Texas earlier this month. The suspect in the shooting was able to buy a gun because the U.S. Air Force didn't report his past general court-martial for domestic violence. Related StoryThe Law That's Keeping Congress From Getting The Facts On Gun Violence The proposed act offers either carrot or stick, depending on the target. Congress has power over federal agencies, so the new act would punish them if they fail to upload criminal records. But the federal government can't enforce states on this, so the act would offer them financial incentives. A number of high-profile senators are behind the proposal. But two are said to be leading this bipartisan group: Republican Sen. John Cornyn from Texas and Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy from Connecticut. Murphy joined the Senate shortly after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and has been a vocal supporter of gun control measures. Cornyn, on the other hand, has been a consistent supporter of the NRA. Connect With Us Newsy © 2021 Newsy is an E.W. Scripps Company Brand"

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/17/nra-gun-lobby-gun-control-congress,"Compared with others, the 145-year-old lobby group isn’t a vast spender – but the NRA has the power to mobilize a grassroots support and make Washington listen First published on Fri 17 Nov 2017 07.00 GMT Why is the National Rifle Association so powerful? Here’s a clue: it’s not (just) about the money. The vast majority of Americans support gun control, and yet Congress has failed to toughen laws even in the wake of a series of mass shootings. With the NRA pouring money into political races at record levels it is an easy argument to make that the gun lobby has bought Washington – but that fails to paint a full picture.  In 2017, the NRA spent at least $4.1m on lobbying – more than the $3.1m it spent in all of 2016. That’s real money, but for comparison, the dairy industry has spent $4.4m in the same period, according to the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP). The National Association of Realtors, one of the biggest spenders, has paid out $32.2m lobbying on housing issues. The US Chamber of Commerce, the largest spender of all, has spent $104m. The NRA’s influence does not stem solely from lobbying. Thanks to the supreme court’s Citizens United decision, the spigot is now wide open for “independent expenditures” allowing groups and individuals to back – or attack – candidates, as long as those campaigns are not made in cooperation with, or at the request of, a candidate. The NRA bet big on 2016’s presidential election, making independent expenditures worth $53.4m. And the cash seemed to have been well spent. The NRA poured $14.4m into supporting 44 candidates who won and $34.4m opposing 19 candidates who lost, according to CRP. Its only big loss was in Nevada, for the seat vacated by the Democratic minority leader, Harry Reid. Nor does the power of the guns manufacturers fully explain the NRA’s power. Guns are big(ish) business. Gun and ammunition manufacturers will have revenues of $13.3bn and profits of $1bn in 2017, according to IBISWorld. Gun and ammunition stores this year will have revenues of $85.bn and profits of $256m. But there are far bigger industries. The auto industry (which has spent $51.8m on lobbying so far in 2017), is on course for revenues of $105.3bn and profits of $3.1bn in 2017. The NRA’s influence, too, is out of proportion to its financial firepower. This is a world with far bigger spenders in Washington – the billionaire Koch brothers spent $889m on the election. And far bigger industries: Apple’s revenues were a record $52bn in the last three months alone and their cash, along with the other tech giants, makes the gun industry look like a rounding error. Dan Auble, a senior researcher at CRP, said NRA’s spending was at a record high but remained “paltry” in comparison to groups like the pharmaceutical industry. If the gun lobby is to be successful, it needs to spend money in Washington, and it does. But the amount alone does not explain the NRA’s success. “The NRA is not successful because of its money. To be sure, it is hard to be a force in American politics without money. The NRA has money that it uses to help its favored candidates get elected. But the real source of its power, I believe, comes from voters,” said Adam Winkler, professor of constitutional law at the UCLA School of Law and author of Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America. By choosing its battles wisely, the NRA has shown an ability to swing primary elections in favor of pro-gun candidates, Winkler said. “That’s the real source of their strength,” he said. That and its use of a relatively small number of highly motivated people to push an agenda that appears out of step with the general population, which, according to recent polling, is in favour of stricter gun laws. The 145-year-old organization claims 5 million active members, although that number is disputed. But whatever its actual size, that membership is a powerful tool, said Robert Spitzer, professor of crime, law and policy and gun control at the State University of New York at Cortland and the author of five books on guns. “They have a very powerful ability to mobilize a grassroots support and to engage in politics when most Americans can barely be bothered to vote,” he said. “I mean more than voting. I mean going to a meeting, writing a letter, contacting a friend,” he said. “And because so few Americans do those things, if you get a bunch of people in a locality who are all prepared to go out to a meeting they can have a big effect. “Elected officials feel the impact of constituents when they hear their voices,” said Spitzer. “Politics is often about the squeaky wheel – who makes the loudest noise, who gets the most attention.” There are, however, problems on the horizon for the NRA. For one, the gun control lobby is growing. Billionaire Michael Bloomberg’s gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety is threatening to spend more than $25m in 2018 races. Americans for Responsible Solutions, a gun control political action committee set up by Gabrielle Giffords, a former Democratic congresswoman whose career was ended when she was shot along with 18 others in an Arizona suburb, spent $13.4m in 2016. The issue for gun control advocates is that they have yet to develop as powerful a voice – or as deep contacts in Washington – as the gun lobby. “I think it’s fair to say that so far they have been thwarted at the federal level,” said Auble. “They are just not as well funded, not as established, and don’t have the history the NRA has.” Even if the gun control groups gave the same amount of money to the same candidates, said Winkler, those candidates would not vote in favor of gun control. “It’s not just money,” he said. “If Michael Bloomberg said he will give you $2 for every $1 the NRA gives you, it is not going to work.” The truth is that gun control is not an area where money is leading politics, he said. It’s an issue that some voters care a lot about and elected officials respond to those voters. “Especially the intense, mobilized, minority of voters that support most vigorously the right to bear arms.” But putting the money and its current influence aside, the NRA faces existential issues in the years ahead as its opposition grows. The election of Donald Trump was a major victory for the NRA. On the eve of his 100th day in office, Trump addressed the NRA’s annual conference, the first sitting president to do so since Ronald Reagan in 1983. “You came through for me, and I am going to come through for you,” Trump told the cheering crowd. “I am here to deliver you good news: the eight-year assault on your second amendment freedoms has come to a crashing end.” That cheering crowd – largely white, male and older – was a snapshot of the people who swung Trump’s victory. It’s also a picture of a demographic in decline. By mid-century the US is expected to become a majority minority nation. The NRA’s core constituency is basically older white males. Younger people are not taking up gun ownership at the same rate as older people did, said Spitzer, and polls of minorities show they feel more strongly about gun control. Attempts by the NRA to broaden its appeal do not seem to have paid off. “They are facing an existential demographic problem,” said Spitzer. Even a Trump presidency may not be good for the NRA. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton presented the NRA with obvious foes. Gun sales are falling after the glory years of the Obama administration, when each mass shooting led to a spike in sales as Democrats called for gun control and gun owners ran to the shops. With their people in office, the industry – and the NRA – lack a demon to drive sales and membership. The NRA has shifted gears post-Obama, taking a leaf out of Trump’s all-caps textbook and attacking the media for demonizing gun owners and the president. Such a move is unlikely to win over minority support. “If the NRA really wants to reach a new generation, maybe they need to reach out to Black Lives Matter. Who are the people who are being abused by government agents the most? You would think that Black Lives Matter would have some affinity with that idea that you need guns to protect yourself against a hostile government that can’t protect you,” said Spitzer. But even the NRA knows that the best thing that the gun control movement could see right now would be a lot of African Americans or Muslims carrying guns around America. The NRA has changed many times in its history, for much of the 20th century it supported gun control. For all its current power there is nothing to suggest the organization is invulnerable to change. Indeed, in this month’s special elections NRA favorites fell to candidates who support more gun control. “The NRA face really significant challenges. How they manage them remains to be seen,” said Spitzer."

http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-rosenstein-crime-speech-20171117-story.html,"He didn't bring the same fire as his bosses, but Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein did carry the same message about Chicago and crime as he spoke Thursday night at the annual dinner of the Chicago Crime Commission. “Chicago is one of America's great cities, but it has a serious crime problem,” Rosenstein said during a 20-minute address. “The city is afflicted with gangs, drugs, violent crimes, shootings and murders. We can spend hours debating the root causes, historical circumstances that compel people to commit crime. … But we do not have the luxury of time to stop the killers.” Rosenstein didn't go as far as President Trump, who has called the city a ""total disaster"" because of its violence.  And he didn't blame the violence on Chicago's status as a sanctuary city, as Attorney General Jeff Session has, linking policies on undocumented immigrants to soaring crime rates. But he did note that the more than 4,300 shooting victims and 760 homicides in the city last year translated into a person shot every two hours and two people killed each day. Rosenstein took issue with some recent decisions by the Chicago Police Department, including a requirement that officers fill out forms for routine investigative stops.  They were ordered after the American Civil Liberties Union released a study showing minorities have been predominately targeted for stops here. The information was intended to help a retired federal magistrate judge evaluate whether officers were following the constitution when they make street stops.  But the police union has claimed traffic stops declined 80 percent because officers found the forms burdensome.  They have since been streamlined twice. Rosenstein said the requirement contributed to a  “dramatic disruption in policing” that has contributed to the spike in violence crime.  “Deterrence is about fear,” he said. “If dangerous criminals are not afraid, then law-abiding citizens are not safe. “So when we see a surge in violent crime that follows a dramatic disruption in policing, as happened in Baltimore and Chicago, it’s obvious there is a lapse in the deterrent effect of law enforcement,"" he continued. ""The debate about what caused the lapse will endure, as will efforts to remedy the root causes and improve relationships between police officers and residents of high crime neighborhoods.” Rosenstein implored the law enforcement officials at the dinner to “rededicate themselves to nonpartisan principles of law enforcement” and their commitment to serving high-crime neighborhoods. “We must never give up on the people who live in those neighborhoods,” he said. ""The majority of the residents are not violent people. They struggle every day to survive violence that surrounds them. They are our people and it is our duty to protect them. Every city should be a sanctuary where people live in peace, not afraid.” Earlier in the day, Rosenstein met with Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson for two hours at a strategic decision support center in the Englewood police district, according to chief police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.  The department says the level of violence in Englewood has dropped to its lowest point since 1999, and it credits the decline to the expansion of gunshot detection technology and analytic tools. Rosenstein said he found the decrease “very encouraging” and praised the department proactive policing, including raids on people on a “strategic subject list,” a compilation of people most likely to commit or be targeted by violence. “Targeting dangerous repeat offenders is not a zero tolerance strategy. It does not involve arresting random people for minor offenses,"" Rosenstein said. Much of Chicago’s top brass, including Johnson, were not at Rosenstein’s speech because it coincided with a Chicago Police Board meeting. Many suburban police chiefs, including those from Maywood and Robbins, were among  several hundred law enforcement officials in attendance. Rosenstein’s appearance came after months of blistering criticism of the city from the Trump administration. After the mass shooting at a Texas church, Trump downplayed the need for gun control, incorrectly asserting Chicago has “the strongest gun laws in our nation.” He described the city as a “total disaster.” Rosenstein’s immediate boss, Sessions, has feuded with Chicago and other “sanctuary cities,” threatening to withhold grant money if local law enforcement doesn't cooperate with immigration agents. Rosenstein has been embroiled in controversy over much of Trump's tenure. Trump initially pointed to a memo from Rosenstein as a basis to fire FBI director James Comey, who had been overseeing the investigation into Russia interference in the 2016 election. Sessions later recused himself from the matter and Rosenstein, the department’s second-in-command, appointed former FBI director Robert Mueller as special counsel. Rosenstein joked about the audience he drew in Chicago, fielding questions from law students at John Marshall Law School in Chicago.  “I have not answered so many questions since my last congressional hearing,” he said.

Lydia and her sister at Mass Firearms School, in Holliston, Massachusetts Lidia Jean Kott Lydia Emmanouilidou's older sister has been begging her to go to the gun range with her for years. But Lydia has always said no. “One year, she even asked me to go with her as her birthday present,” says Lydia. “I refused.” Growing up, guns just weren’t part of their lives. Lydia’s family immigrated from Greece — a country where it's uncommon to own a firearm unless you’re a police officer or in the military — when she was about 12, and her sister about 15. But after they moved to the US, her sister bought a gun for self-protection and began going to the gun range to practice with it, developments that Lydia found confusing. But, recently, Lydia agreed to go to the gun range with her sister. She hoped the trip would help her better understand why her sister got into American gun culture, and why she herself never did.

https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-11-17/after-mass-shooting-thoughts-and-prayers-then-what,"Skip to content Conflict The World November 17, 2017 · 4:00 PM EST Listen to the story.  People pray in the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, where 26 people were killed in a shooting attack on Nov. 5, 2017. The church was opened to the public as a memorial to those killed. Rick Wilking/Reuters News about the mass shooting at a Texas church in early November hit Pardeep Kaleka particularly hard. Kaleka is a member of the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in Oak Creek. Back in 2012, a white supremacist went into the temple on a Sunday morning and fatally shot six people, including Kaleka’s father. When he heard about the deadly attack at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Kaleka says he started reliving that horrible day five years ago, once again. “Those wounds that are there already are sort of ripped open again,” Kaleka says. “The whole day is pretty much gone for you, because now you can’t get your mind off what they’re going through [in Texas].” Related: When trying to determine why the US has so many mass shootings, only one statistic matters Kaleka is a gun owner, which makes sense because he’s also a former police officer. And it squares with his religion too. He says Sikhs are known for being warriors. “We have a saying in our faith that after you exhaust all other means, it is proper to pick up the sword. And now, people have replaced that sword with a gun.” But Kaleka says gun violence in America is a public health crisis. And he fears things are going to get worse before they get better. “My nine-year-old came home a couple of days back and told me about an active shooter drill that they’re doing at their elementary school,” Kaleka says. “Why is that necessary?” “I just think we have way too many guns [in America],” he says. These days, it seems like no place is safe. The deadly attack at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs was the 14th fatal shooting at a house of worship since 2012, according to the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, which tracks gun violence. Related: How other countries can help us understand America's mass shooting crisis “It’s only gotten worse as the power of the NRA and the gun industry has grown and is holding Congress hostage,” says director Rabbi Jonah Pesner. Along with representatives from 50 religious organizations, Pesner signed a letter calling on US lawmakers to take tougher action on gun control. “Enough is enough with empty thoughts and prayers that are not followed by action,” Pesner says. “As a Jew, I believe that every prayer is a call to action.” And Pesner is reassured by recent polling data that shows broad support from American voters for what he calls common-sense gun regulations. “Evangelicals tend to see it differently,” says Joe Carter, editor at The Gospel Coalition, a network of evangelical churches founded in 2005. “One reason is regional,” Carter says. “A lot of evangelicals are from the South. A lot of them served in the military. A lot of them are more familiar with guns than the average American, and they own more guns than the average American.” Conservative evangelicals are skeptical about the wisdom of passing new gun control regulations, Carter says. “They’re just not being enforced.” “I mean, if you’re going to shoot up a church, you’re not going to worry about a gun control law,” says Carter, who is also a vet and a gun owner himself. Gun ownership is not the solution in all cases, Carter says. But a good guy with a gun can prevent somebody who is armed and prepared to do innocents harm, he says. Carter says many of the mass shootings at US churches or elsewhere are the result of domestic violence, which is something religious leaders need to take more seriously. “That’s the problem with the gun control issue,” Carter says. “That’s always the go-to thing. And it drowns out other conversations we should be having.” Mara Nathan has changed the way she thinks about firearms. She grew up in the New York City area, where relatively few people owned guns. Now, as the senior rabbi at Temple Beth El in San Antonio, Texas, Nathan says some members of her congregation are ranchers or hunters. And, she’s pretty sure that some of them come to synagogue and bring their gun. “I know that there are people who do,” Nathan says. “Whether they left it in their car, or whether it’s in their bag or whether in their cowboy boot.” Nathan says she respects gun owners and the right to own firearms. But she still thinks that a big part of the solution to gun violence in America is tougher gun controls. There is no agreement on this issue, Kaleka says. But he thinks people of faith bring an important perspective to the conversation. “We can do something about this,” he says. “God exists in every person, regardless of race, creed, caste, class.” “God exists in our compassion, in our forgiveness, in our ability to see the soul in another person, and say, ‘Hey, I need to protect life.’ And that’s where people of faith need to step up.” Want a seat at the table?

https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/11/19/most-mass-killers-are-men-who-also-attacked-their-families/23282297/," Research indicates that many mass killers have a history of domestic abuse and violence towards their wives and girlfriends. Up to 30% of domestic violence cases go unregistered resulting in the abuser's gun rights remaining intact. If police wait for broken bones, they miss more than 95 percent of domestic violence incidents. An average of 50 American women are shot to death each month by a current or former intimate partner. Most abusers will not become mass killers, but effective domestic violence laws might keep us all safer. What do most mass killers have in common? As a researcher who studies coercive control in intimate relationships, I can point out a few key characteristics. First, they are men. Additionally, they have a history of controlling and abusing their wives and girlfriends – and sometimes other family members – before ""graduating"" to mass killings. Considering a few recent examples makes the pattern clearer. Devin P. Kelley, 26, who shot to death 26 people and injured 20 more at a Texas church on Nov. 5, had kicked, beaten and choked his first wife and infant stepson, fracturing the baby’s skull. In the following years, he was investigated for other charges of violence against women including sexual assault and rape. Since 1996, those convicted of domestic violence – even misdemeanor offenses – are supposed to be entered into the National Criminal Information Database and permanently barred from legally purchasing guns. However, Air Force officials neglected to register Kelley’s conviction, leaving him free to walk into a sporting goods store and purchase the rifle used to murder Texas churchgoers. A congressional report determined such registration failures happen at least 30 percent of the time. Esteban Santiago, charged with killing five travelers in a mass shooting at the Fort Lauderdale airport in January 2017, was previously accused of assaulting and strangling his girlfriend. Spencer Hight shot and killed his estranged wife and seven of her friends who had gathered to watch football on TV in Plano, Texas. These family-based mass shootings rarely gain the same kind of publicity as those conducted in public, perhaps because the average person mistakenly thinks they can avoid being victimized if the shooting occurs ""in the family."" From Jan. 1 to Nov. 5, 2017, the U.S. experienced 307 mass shootings, which the government defines as a shooting that kills or injures four or more people. However, not all domestic violence perpetrators who become mass killers use guns. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who planned and executed the Boston Marathon bombing along with his younger brother, had been arrested for assaulting his girlfriend. Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, who plowed a truck through a crowd in Nice, France in 2016, killing 82, and Khalid Masood, who killed five and injured 50 driving through a crowd in Westminster, London, both controlled and abused the women in their lives. An obvious question arises. If domestic violence laws were more effective, could perpetrators be caught earlier? Could they be deprived of their access to weapons, jailed when necessary and given the kinds of intensive intervention and supervision that would curb their behavior? In other words, could stronger domestic violence laws prevent some mass shootings? The laws in the U.S. that are currently used to address domestic violence were developed for attacks by unrelated people. They don’t work so well for what happens in families. A bar fight is over when the violence ends, but abusive violence in couples does not end. In as many as 40 percent of cases, the abuser assaults his partner several times a week and sometimes daily, often over many years. Most domestic violence incidents involve pushes, slaps, kicks, pulling hair and the like. If police wait for broken bones, they miss more than 95 percent of domestic violence incidents. As Evan Stark of Rutgers University points out, the seriousness of partner violence derives from the cumulative weight of all previous abuse, rather than the severity of a particular assault. U.S. law does not adequately address these ""minor"" violent incidents, nor the constant intimidation, harassment, monitoring and the limiting of a partner’s freedom that is so typical of violent control in couples. In 2015, England and Wales made controlling a current or former partner a serious crime. This new offense recognizes the harm that can result from an ongoing pattern of controlling behavior. A relative of Westminster car attacker Masood’s ex-wife is quoted in The Guardian describing their relationship: ""He was very violent towards her, controlling in every aspect of her life – what she wore, where she went, everything."" Masood’s behavior is an example of coercive control. Coercive control combines tactics designed to instill fear, like violence and threats, with tactics that isolate a partner, degrade her and deprive her of basic rights. Eighty percent of abused women are being coercively controlled and not simply hit. In the U.K., police and prosecutors have undergone intensive training related to the criminalization of coercive control. Police have learned to use an incident of reported domestic violence as a window through which to examine the entire relationship. One of the earliest convictions for coercive control concerns a 30-year-old named Nigel Wolitter, who was arrested for vandalizing machinery belonging to his partner’s family to punish her for refusing to give him money for marijuana. As a result of their new training, police traced Wolitter’s vandalism to a 13-year pattern of dominating his girlfriend. The prosecution linked photos of injuries from his partner’s cellphone with her compelling testimony that he had ""controlled every aspect of my life from where I went to what I wore, to what possessions he allowed me to own."" Wolitter received a 4.5-year sentence. It’s the pattern of enforced subordination that is the problem here, not one or two incidents. Changing the domestic violence laws to include coercive control will draw attention to serious cases of controlling behavior and obligate law enforcement to examine them more closely. According to the American nonprofit organization Everytown for Gun Safety, an average of 50 women in the U.S. are shot to death each month by a current or former intimate partner. While most domestic abusers will not become mass murderers, early, consistent and effective domestic violence intervention might keep us all safer.

https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/11/20/sean-hannity-got-a-scathing-response-when-he-asked-one-of-roy-moores-accusers-to-appear-on-his-show/23282765/," Paula Cobia, an attorney representing one of Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore's accusers, slammed Fox News host Sean Hannity after he invited her client onto his show. Cobia said it was ""laughable"" to assume Hannity was ""capable of conducting a fair and balanced interview."" Though Hannity called for Moore to withdraw from the Senate race if he was unable to debunk the allegations of sexual misconduct against him, the Fox News host has largely either defended Moore or stayed mum since then. Paula Cobia, an attorney representing one of the women who has accused Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore of pursuing teenage girls when he was in his 30s, had some harsh words for Fox News host Sean Hannity when a booker for his nightly show, ""Hannity,"" reached out to book Cobia's client. Cobia represents Gloria Thacker Deason. Deason told The Washington Post earlier this month that she was 18 when she started going out with Moore, who was 32 at the time. Deason added that Moore also bought her alcohol when she was 18 or 19. At the time, the drinking age in Alabama was 19. In response to the booking request from Hannity's show, Cobia replied that she ""would never submit a survivor of abuse to the inevitable on-camera bullying and persecution by [Hannity]."" She pointed to Hannity's relatively lenient treatment of Moore when he appeared on Hannity's radio show, as well as the host's apparent refusal to disavow Moore's candidacy. Several other women have accused Moore of sexual misconduct, including Leigh Corfman, who told The Post that she was 14 when the 32-year-old Moore made unwanted sexual advances towards her. Another said during a press conference that Moore tried to sexually assault her when she was a 16-year-old waitress. Another accused Moore of groping her when she was 28, and of asking her whether her two young daughters were as pretty as she was. Cobia slammed Hannity's treatment of Moore's accusers, saying that he had ""belittled, defamed and engaged in an on-air intimidation campaign against the victims of Mr. Moore."" RELATED: Sean Hannity through the years ""He is totally uninterested in discovering the truth,"" Cobia said of Hannity. ""He gave Mr. Moore a lazy, softball interview which his own panel did not find credible. In fact, the panel mocked Mr. Moore over his inconsistencies and lies."" When he appeared on Hannity's radio show last week, Moore began by saying the allegations against him were ""completely false and misleading."" However, his responses appeared to vary as the show went on. First, he said he ""generally"" did not remember dating teens as young as 16 when he was over 30. Moore claimed to know two of the first four accusers, but denied that he had acted inappropriately with either of them. He said, of allegations brought by one accuser, Debbie Wesson Gibson, that he did not remember going out on dates with her, and that he knew her as a friend. ""If we did go out on dates, then we did. But I don't remember that,"" he told Hannity. Later, he said that when he returned from the military in the late 1970s and early 1980s, he ""dated a lot of young ladies."" ""I do recognize the names of two of these young women,"" he said of Gibson and Deason. He denied that he gave Deason alcohol when she was underage. ""As I recall, she was 19 or older."" Later, he said that dating teenagers ""would be out of my customary behavior"" and that he ""never"" would have dated a teen without her mother's permission. Of the allegation that he made unwanted advances towards Corfman when she was 14, Moore said the incident never occurred. When several new allegations against Moore emerged following the interview, Hannity said he would give the former judge 24 hours to respond and debunk the claims. If he could not do so, Hannity said Moore should drop out of the Senate race. The next day, Hannity told viewers he had received a phone call from Moore addressing all the allegations, and that Moore was free to remain in the race. Cobia told Hannity's booker that it was ""laughable to assume that Mr. Hannity is capable of conducting a fair and balanced interview."" She continued: ""He is not known for journalistic integrity. He is merely seeking an opportunity to publicly attack and further defame Mr. Moore's vulnerable victims. Well that's not happening. Not on my watch."" Moore has seen waning support as the allegations against him continue to grow in number. So far, at least nine women have said that Moore pursued them when they were teenagers or that he engaged in sexual misconduct. Several Republican lawmakers in Congress have disavowed Moore and called for him to drop out of the race, but the Republican establishment in Alabama has been steadfast in its continued support for Moore. On Sunday, most of Alabama's biggest newspapers had a scathing editorial against Moore splashed across their front pages. Moore, for his part, has painted the allegations against him as part of a liberal smear campaign brought by the ""Obama-Clinton Machine.""

Having lost three straight, something the team did only once in the regular season last year, the Avalanche were desperate to come away with two points. It was easily the most entertaining game the Avalanche have had this season and it was all thanks to the team’s top guns. Colorado went head-to-head with the two-time reigning Stanley-Cup Champion Tampa Bay Lightning on Saturday and walked away from Amalie Arena with a 4-3 shootout victory. Colorado’s season hasn’t gotten off to the start expected, can Jared Bednar’s Avalanche start the turn around in Tampa against the defending Stanley Cup champion Lightning? It is far too soon to throw the Colorado Avalanche’s 2021-22 season out, but they’re already as bad as their worst stretch of futility last season. Colorado dropped its third straight game on Thursday, falling 4-1 to the Florida Panthers. Over the 56-game regular season in 2021, the Avalanche had one of the stingiest defenses in the NHL. They often held the team to 20 shots or less, giving then starting goalie Philipp Grubauer every opportunity to post a shutout or surrender just one goal. After Tuesday night’s 6-3 loss at the hand of the Washington Capitals, the Colorado Avalanche fall to 1-2-0 and extend their frustrating start to the season. It’s been years since Anisimov played in Russia, and even longer since he spent a whole season with Lokomotiv. Selected in the second round in 2006, it was clear that Anisimov’s heart was set on coming to North America. Not a lot going right for the Avalanche right now Although Nathan MacKinnon jetted into the lineup for this game the Colorado Avalanche still took its patchwork show on the road for their first trip to the eastern time zone in nearly two years. It certainly wasn’t the start the Avalanche were hoping for to begin their three-game road trip. The Avs welcomed back superstar center Nathan MacKinnon but were outmatched in every aspect of Tuesday’s 6-3 loss to the Washington Capitals at Capital One Arena. Avalanche star Nathan MacKinnon, tested positive for the coronavirus last week and had been in the league's COVID-19 protocols since Oct. 12, is eligible to play against the Capitals on Tuesday. The first week of the NHL season is in the books, and the Colorado Avalanche split a pair of games to start what they hope is an eventual march to the Stanley Cup. On a night when the Colorado Avalanche honored their former president and general manager, the late Pierre Lacroix, hoisting his banner to join the Avalanche elite in the rafters of Ball Arena, little went right for the home team. Avalanche drop to 1-1 Going into this game against the St. Louis Blue expectations were low in Avalanche country after the team announced that Nathan MacKinnon (COVID), Devon Toews (lower body), Valeri Nichushkin (upper body), Gabriel Landeskog (suspension), and Jack Johnson (COVID) would all be missing the team second game of the season. Not many things could push the actual game to an afterthought. Especially one that nearly saw the home team erase a late three-goal deficit. But the Avalanche’s banner-raising ceremony for the late Pierre Lacroix — the general manager and architect of the team’s two Stanley Cup championships — certainly stole the spotlight Saturday at Ball Arena. The emotions were high before the puck dropped between the Avalanche and St. Louis Blues on Saturday at Ball Arena. Not only had the Avs just finished Jack Johnson is presently asymptomatic but will be out indefinitely. The Colorado Avalanche are being hit with the injury bug early this season, as forward Valeri Nichushkin is sidelined week-to-week with an upper-body injury. Landeskog has been suspended three times but is not considered a ""repeat offender"" because his last incident occurred more than 18 months ago. The NHL Department of Player Safety has come down on Colorado Avalanche captain Gabriel Landeskog just one game into the 2021-22 NHL season. He has been suspended two games for his hit on Kirby Dach of the Chicago Blackhawks, a boarding hit that caught Dach in a vulnerable position. According to Peter Baugh of The Athletic, things are “trending in the direction” when it comes to Jack Johnson getting signed with the Colorado Avalanche. Saad hit free agency after just one season with the Colorado Avalanche in which he registered 24 points (15 goals, nine assists) and 12 penalty minutes through 44 games.

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wei-li-mass-shooting-threat_us_5a131266e4b0aa32975cb89f?section=us_crime,"Reporter, HuffPost An Ohio man is facing federal charges after he allegedly threatened to stage a historic mass shooting at a Las Vegas casino where his estranged wife was employed at the time. FBI officials said Wei Li, of Cuyahoga Falls, also threatened to carry out a mass shooting at a church with at least 1,000 people in attendance, according to a department release. Authorities said the 28-year-old suspect made the threats through a series of text messages to his wife sent Nov. 6–9. “There are 1,000 people in our church,” Li said in one message, according to court documents obtained by Cleveland.com. “I will make the biggest in history.” Neither the name of the casino or church have been released. Li allegedly sent his wife photos of himself holding a rifle and knives, according to Cleveland.com. In a text sent Nov. 9, Li allegedly told his wife he’d kill her if he didn’t get his green card, according to Cleveland’s Fox affiliate. FBI officials said Li bragged that the planned shootings would go down in history and that he would blame his wife for all the deaths, according to the release. Federal agents conducted a joint interview with Cuyahoga Falls Police on Nov. 10. During the questioning, authorities asked Li to unlock his phone. Li complied but allegedly started to delete a string of text messages. At that point, he was arrested and taken into custody. The FBI said Li acknowledged sending the threatening texts to his wife, but said he didn’t intend to carry out the shootings. No firearms were found in his home, according to the Las Vegas Review Journal. Li was charged with interstate threatening communications and destruction of evidence, according to the release. He was transferred into federal custody on Nov. 16. The threats came about a month after 58 people were killed, and more than 500 were wounded, by gunman Stephen Craig Paddock at an outdoor country music concert in Las Vegas. Reporter, HuffPost"

All rights reserved. BILLBOARD is a registered trademark of Billboard IP Holdings, LLC Post Malone Post Malone has the No. 1 song in the U.S., so naturally, he’s been doing some press. In his joyously tone-deaf Rolling Stone profile last week, he talked about his large arsenal and the “pure” feeling of shooting guns just weeks after the Las Vegas mass shooting. He gave another interview to the Polish media outlet NewOnce, where he was asked about modern hip-hop. The results aren’t that much better. Around the 5:30 mark, Post Malone speaks at length about what you should be looking for in hip-hop. Post Malone If you’re looking for lyrics, if you’re looking to cry, if you’re looking to think about life, don’t listen to hip-hop. There’s great hip-hop songs where they talk about life and they spit that real shit, but right now, there’s not a lot of people talking about real shit. Whenever I want to cry, whenever I want to sit down and have a nice cry, I’ll listen to some Bob Dylan. Or whenever I’m trying to have a good time and stay in a positive mood, I listen to hip-hop. Because it’s fun. I think hip-hop is important because it brings people together in a beautiful, happy way. The video edits out the interviewer’s questions, so you only get Post Malone wildly gesticulating with a burning cigarette between his fingers without much context. But some of the other answers he gives throughout the interview suggest he isn’t quite aware about what’s going on in hip-hop. For one, he hat-tips Kanye West and 21 Savage, whose music both mine pain. 21’s “Nothin New” broods about black death and “Wolves” hits the abject darkness of a stolen sandwich. There’s also Post Malone citing Elvis Presley as one of his favorites: “I think Elvis was just a beautiful singer. Beautiful guitar player. He had the swag. He had the sauce.” It’s a darkly comedic line when you consider the black-appropriative parallels. And if you truly believe Post Malone cries to “If You See Her, Say Hello”—burning cigarette in hand—that’s on you. Watch the full video below. This article originally appeared in Spin.

http://newsblaze.com/usnews/politics/senators-unveil-bipartisan-gun-control-legislation_91165/,"Republican and Democratic senators have released a bipartisan gun control bill that would increase background check requirements for gun sales and encourage states to rigorously input convictions into the federal background check system. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, drafted and presented a bill that would improve the National Instant Criminal Background Check system. Potential buyers must be run through that system before sellers can give them a gun, according to NBC. Multiple other senators are sponsoring the bill, including Sen. Tim Scott, R-South Carolina, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nevada and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-New Hampshire, according to The Hill The bill is titled ‘Fix NICS Act’ and has not yet received public opposition from gun rights lobbyists like the National Rifle Association. The bill creates grants and other incentives for state agencies and federal agencies to produce and process documents that determine whether someone is eligible to purchase a gun or not so they can be entered into the system. The bill would withhold particular bonuses for states that don’t comply, and would provide funding for states to include domestic violence crimes to NICS, according to NBC. Cornyn said in a statement that the bill is intended to “fix what’s become a nationwide, systematic problem” in order to keep guns out of the hands of violent criminals and offenders, according to The Hill. It would also include a specific provision to ensure that states can more easily share information with NICS related to domestic assault cases. The bill comes in the wake of a mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, when Devin Kelley burst through the doors of the First Baptist Church and killed 11 people inside. In the days after the shooting, the Air Force revealed that former airman Devin Kelley had been court-martialed, according to a warrant search on domestic violence charges. He received a “bad conduct” discharge in 2014. However, the Air Force failed to report the court martial to the FBI, which would have entered his crime in the database and prevented him from purchasing a gun under current law. Gen. Mark Miley, the U.S. Army chief of staff, told ABC that as many as 20 percent of the army’s cases are never reported to the FBI, an issue he said is found throughout the U.S. military. Miley said the United States needs to “tighten up” its reporting policies, acknowledging that there have been a significant number of omissions in the past that would allow violent individuals to purchase guns. Miley said about 150 people annually are dishonorably discharged after being court martialed, and said all incidents need to be reported to the FBI in the future, according to ABC.

All rights reserved. BILLBOARD is a registered trademark of Billboard IP Holdings, LLC People pay tribute to the victims of the Las Vegas mass shooting at a vigil along near Mandalay Bay hotel on Oct. 4, 2017 in Las Vegas. Attorneys who filed one of the first lawsuits after the Oct. 1 mass shooting that killed 58 concert-goers and left hundreds injured on the Las Vegas Strip filed four new negligence cases Monday on behalf of more than 450 victims. This time, however, Houston-based lawyers Chad Pinkerton and Mo Aziz filed the cases in Los Angeles against companies including MGM Resorts International, the corporate owner of both the Mandalay Bay resort and the Route 91 Harvest Festival concert venue. Pinkerton said the intent was to get the cases before a jury less likely to be influenced by the size and clout of a casino company that is both an active political contributor in Nevada and the largest employer in the state. ""Los Angeles is a better venue for fairness for our clients,"" Pinkerton said in a telephone interview ahead of a news conference announcing the filing of two wrongful death lawsuits, a third case stemming from a woman's head wound and a fourth on behalf of 450 people claiming injuries in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. ""There would be certain advantages for MGM to defend its case in Nevada,"" Pinkerton said, adding that a jury in MGM Resorts' hometown might include people with direct or indirect ties to the company and its more than 70,000 employees. The company has said through representatives it won't litigate shooting lawsuits in the media. In statements, it has blamed the massacre on the gunman, Stephen Paddock. Defendants in the new lawsuits also include Live Nation Entertainment, the concert promoter. In a statement, the Beverly Hills, California-based company expressed sorrow for ""countless people forever impacted by this senseless act of violence"" and said it was cooperating with an active FBI investigation. It declined to comment about the lawsuits. Documents submitted Monday in Los Angeles also seek compensation from Paddock's estate. They included a refiling of a negligence claim originally filed Oct. 10 in Las Vegas on behalf of a wounded California woman, Paige Gasper. That case was dismissed Friday in Nevada. ""Most of our clients from California."" Pinkerton said. ""Most all are getting their treatment here."" The new lawsuits followed a wave of cases filed last week in Nevada state court in Las Vegas on behalf of 14 concertgoers, including some who were shot, injured or say they were traumatized trying to escape. A Chicago law firm helped prepare those filings, involving plaintiffs from the Chicago area and a California man who was shot and wounded. Police and the FBI say the 64-year-old Paddock rained bursts of gunfire for 10 minutes from a 32nd-floor room at the Mandalay Bay into a crowd of 22,000 people in the concert venue across Las Vegas Boulevard. Paddock, a high-stakes video poker gambler with homes in Reno and the southern Nevada resort town of Mesquite spent several days amassing an arsenal of assault-style weapons and ammunition in a two-room suite. Authorities say he killed himself before officers reached his room. A motive for the deadly rampage has not been identified. Plaintiffs in mass-shooting lawsuits face a high legal bar to prove responsibility and liability by someone other than the shooter, and lawsuits can take years in court. But Pinkerton said he believes he can show that tragedy could have been avoided if hotel and corporate officials followed hotel weapon possession policies already in place and implemented recent safety recommendations. ""We know in this day and age that evil does happen, and we have to protect against that,"" the lawyer said. ""This was the largest venue security failure in U.S. history.""

Melania Trump and her 11-year-old son Barron stepped out on Monday for the arrival of the official White House Christmas tree. The first lady looked absolutely stylish in her casual fall outfit -- black trousers, a pair of Victoria Beckham knee-high black boots, a bright red Ralph Lauren turtleneck and a plaid Calvin Klein coat draped over her shoulders. She kept her brunette tresses in its usual blown out style, light makeup and pale pink polish on her perfectly manicured fingernails. Meanwhile, Barron, who is already taller than his mother in heels, donned black trousers and a matching blazer with a white button-down shirt underneath. They both looked in good spirits as they exchanged smiles and chuckles during the short and sweet appearance. RELATED: Barron Trump through the years: This year's tree was grown in Wisconsin and will eventually be situated in the Blue Room. It was provided by the Chapman family of Silent Night Evergreens, which has provided the official White House Christmas tree since 1996. The tree greeting ceremony marks the start of the holiday season at the White House. The holiday festivities will continue on Tuesday with President Trump's first turkey pardoning. However, the first family will be spending Thanksgiving at Mar-a-Lago instead of the White House. Check out the slideshow above for photos of Melania and Barron.

https://pitchfork.com/news/live-nation-sued-by-hundreds-of-las-vegas-shooting-victims,"By Noah Yoo Live Nation is being sued by hundreds of victims of the October 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas, which took place during the Route 91 Harvest Festival, as Billboard reports. The concert promoter is among several parties named as defendants in a new wave of lawsuits filed on Monday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, including the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino (where the shooter was located) and its parent company MGM Resorts International. According to The Los Angeles Times, the victims’ lawyers claim that the festival did not have “adequate exits or properly trained employees for when the crowd began trying to evacuate,” resulting in more harm. The October 1 shooting ended with 58 killed and hundreds more injured from gunshot wounds or trampling. Pitchfork has reached out to representatives for Live Nation for further comment.

http://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/21502755/nhl-golden-knights-success-sidney-crosby-struggles-quarter-mark-superlatives?device=featurephone,"The 2017-18 season has reached its quarter mark. Nikita Kucherov is on pace for 70 goals, the New Jersey Devils are leading their division and an expansion team has almost twice as many points as the Arizona Coyotes. You know, just as we all predicted. Here are some superlatives and awards through the first fourth of the season. Team: Vegas Golden Knights
Player: Jaden Schwartz, St. Louis Blues The Knights are the story of the season, with a 12-6-1 record for 25 points and second place in the Pacific Division. Sure, we all underestimated how much talent they scraped together in the expansion draft and, yeah, playing seven of their first nine games at home gave them solid footing. But Vegas keeps picking up points despite a calamitous series of goalie injuries (Marc-Andre Fleury, Malcolm Subban, Oscar Dansk) and has a plus-10 goal differential, which for a first-year team is frankly unheard of. Schwartz (10 goals, 16 assists in 21 games) has been an offensive revelation for the Blues, as he's finally playing healthy and clicking mightily with offseason acquisition Brayden Schenn and sniper Vladimir Tarasenko. He might not be 1.24-points-per-game good when the dust settles, but for now he has helped the Blues subvert expectations that they'd be an injury-plagued offensive flop this season. Team: Edmonton Oilers
Player: Sidney Crosby, Pittsburgh Penguins To quote Obi-Wan Kenobi: ""You were the Chosen One!"" This was the season the Oilers were primed to make the leap to championship contender, and instead they're one Arizona Coyotes team away from the conference basement. Edmonton's season has been like an episode of ""The Twilight Zone,"" where GM Peter Chiarelli traded a bunch of scoring forwards for various needs and -- here's the twist -- the Oilers ended up needing those scoring forwards after all, as they limp to a paltry 2.50 goals per game while going 7-11-2. Connor McDavid deserves better. And by that we of course mean ""better than the local media criticizing his turnovers, which is like someone lambasting the chef on the Titanic for over-salting the soup as the ship descends into the icy depths."" Crosby has six goals and 10 assists in 22 games. Those numbers would be fine for anyone not named Sidney Crosby, as the Penguins star has averaged over a point per game in every season of his career. He's been on the ice for 13 more even-strength goals against than goals for this season. As usual, there's already a cottage industry of ""What's wrong with Crosby?"" takes that will seem antiquated when he starts scoring in bunches. But for now, his production and play are way off from his usual output, and questions about Sid, the Penguins and the amount of hockey they have played in the last two seasons are valid ones. New Jersey Devils. Even if that offense keeps cranking -- and it might -- the Devils' underlying possession numbers and defensive stats are a few average Cory Schneider starts away from a downward spiral. Although one hopes they don't regress, as they are one of the most entertaining teams in the NHL, which remains a really weird thing to say about the Devils. The Carolina Hurricanes have been possession monsters all season that simply weren't getting enough offense to win games. But the engine is starting to get revved: The Hurricanes have scored three or more goals in seven straight games, going 5-1-1 in them. Nail Yakupov, Colorado Avalanche. The first-overall pick in 2012 might always be considered a bust, but the 24-year-old has entered the Alex Daigle ""cheap reclamation project"" phase of his career. Yakupov signed a one-year deal worth $875,000 with the Avalanche, and has already matched his point total (nine) from last season in just 19 games. Steve Mason, Winnipeg Jets. Mason signed a two-year deal worth $4.1 million annually with the Jets in the summer. He has appeared in six games and has a 1-3-1 record with a 3.76 goals-against average and a .892 save percentage. You know who hasn't minded any of this? Jets goalie Connor Hellebuyck, who stole Mason's job and is having his best season in the NHL. Antti Niemi was signed by the Penguins, lost all three games he played for them and was waived; claimed by the Florida Panthers, for whom he played two games and was waived; and then claimed by the Montreal Canadiens. Niemi became the fifth goalie in NHL history to play for three teams in the same season. And it's November. C'mon, this can't be anything but the blockbuster that sent Matt Duchene to the Ottawa Senators, Kyle Turris to the Nashville Predators and seven assets of picks and players to the Avalanche. Duchene has had a rough start with the Sens, failing to tally a point in five games and skating to a minus-6. Turris? He has two goals and three assists in five games with Nashville. Alex Galchenyuk, Montreal Canadiens. He's been on the block for the better part of two years, he's off to a slow-as-molasses start (four goals and four assists in 21 games) and the Habs need a shakeup, desperately. How coach Travis Green has coaxed a 9-8-3 record out of the Vancouver Canucks and reduced the Sedins' ice time by over four minutes on average without the sky falling. Deryk Engelland's powerful speech to the Golden Knights crowd at their home opener, 10 days after a mass shooting in Las Vegas, remains one of the season's most poignant moments. But if we're talking about in-game moments, then it's Brian Boyle's goal on Nov. 10 against the Oilers, his first following a prolonged absence after his leukemia diagnosis. Boyle actually wept during his celebration on the ice. Canadiens GM Marc Bergevin has been in the job since May 2012. He's made a series of moves -- the P.K. Subban-for-Shea Weber trade and signing Karl Alzner among them -- with a ""win-now"" mindset. That becomes problematic when the team mostly loses now, going 8-11-2 this season. His is a seat hot enough that we're genuinely concerned about the well being of his perfectly tailored suit pants. (Although a relative lack of bilingual candidates to replace him could buy him some time.) Alain Vigneault, New York Rangers. There was heavy speculation he was going to be fired, but the Rangers' recent 7-3-0 spurt has them back on the playoff bubble and Vigneault safe, if he ever was in trouble to begin with. Shout out to the Anaheim Ducks, who are somehow 10-7-3 and in a playoff seed despite currently missing Ryan Getzlaf, Ryan Kesler, Patrick Eaves and Ondrej Kase, and having missed Cam Fowler, Sami Vatanen and Hampus Lindholm for stretches as well. Who's the Calder Trophy favorite? This wave of young stars has produced another stellar rookie-of-the-year field. Clayton Keller might have the early juice, with 11 goals and 9 assists for the Coyotes, but Mathew Barzal (4 goals, 15 assists), Brock Boeser (7 goals, 10 assists) and Nico Hischier (3 goals, 12 assists) are right there. You want defensemen? Charlie McAvoy of the Boston Bruins, Will Butcher of the Devils (a stellar 16 points) and Mikhail Sergachev of the Tampa Bay Lightning are here for you. When hockey met politics in the Penguins' White House visit, J.T. Brown's protest during the national anthem and Alex Ovechkin and Evgeni Malkin promoting ""Putin Team."" These athletes deserve the chance to use their platforms to make political statements -- or in the Penguins' case, to punt on one -- but nuance isn't exactly a hallmark of political discourse these days, and these situations created toxic deliberation among fans. What if Canadiens goalie Carey Price, whose eight-year, $84 million contract kicks in next season, gets more fragile with age? ... if you're a Florida Panthers fan, because you're watching a one-line team whose 7-11-2 start might be an unrecoverable stumble. ... if you're a Minnesota Wild fan, because while the Wild really need to tighten up defensively, they're got Charlie Coyle back, have shown signs of life and betting on coach Bruce Boudreau in the regular season is as money-in-the-bank as betting against him in the postseason. We're tracking the favorites for the NHL awards all season. Here's where things stand for the five majors: Hart: Johnny Gaudreau, Calgary Flames
Norris: Seth Jones, Columbus Blue Jackets
Vezina: Corey Crawford, Chicago Blackhawks
Calder: Mathew Barzal, New York Islanders
Jack Adams: Gerard Gallant, Golden Knights"
http://ew.com/music/2017/11/21/barbra-streisand-netflix-concert-movie-highlights/,"Hello, gorgeous! Barbra: The Music… The Mem’ries… The Magic!, a new Netflix concert film out Wednesday, shows a side of Barbra Streisand that audiences have rarely seen. Comprised of moments from her 2016 show in Miami and the making of her 2016 album, Encore: Movie Partners Sing Broadway, the nearly two-hour film takes fans on a ride through her six-decade career. But as the title suggests, it’s not just songs: Streisand shares funny stories with her audience, touching on everything from her directorial debut in 1983’s Yentl (“There’s nothing like your first time”) to shooting the cover of A Star is Born (“If you’re wondering what I was wearing during that shoot… it was musk”). The tales are also illuminating, clueing fans in on how Streisand controls everything in her career, right down to the winged tip of her eyeliner. “I’ve done it from the beginning,” she says of her makeup. “When I was doing Funny Girl,they said, ‘We’re going to make you up.’ I said, ‘What? Let’s do two tests: You make me up for one, and I’ll make myself up for one.’ They did agree that mine was better.” Read on for more must-see highlights from Barbra: The Music… The Mem’ries… The Magic! Midway through the first act, Streisand interprets Carole King’s “Being at War with Each Other” from the singer-songwriter’s 1973 album Fantasy. “Maybe I’m crazy, but I don’t understand it/Why do we seem to vote to dig more holes?” sings Streisand, whose support of the Democratic Party stretches back several decades. “It’s such a waste of a planet.” Standing in front of pictures showing war-torn cities, mass-shooting tragedies, and pride parades, Streisand’s message is simple and powerful: Love is always the answer. One of the most powerful reminders of Babs’ vocal prowess is when she pays homage to Yentl, for which she became the first woman to win Best Director at the Golden Globes. Her voice soars during “Papa Can You Hear Me?” — an excellent reminder of how just a few notes from Streisand can give you chills. In the second act, Streisand introduces the song “Isn’t This Better” from Funny Lady — the Funny Girl sequel — with an amusing story about Liza Minelli performing the song at a Streisand tribute. “It was so beautiful, the song, but I couldn’t place the song or why she was singing it, so I asked her, ‘Liza, why did you sing that song?’ And she said, ‘Barbra, you sang it in Funny Lady!” Then Babs fully takes on the role of her character, Fanny Brice, delivering sassy renditions of “How Lucky Can You Get” and “Don’t Rain on My Parade.” The resulting ovation is deserved. Even though Streisand can still carry a show on her own, she welcomes Jamie Foxx to the stage for a mesmerizing duet of “Climb Ev’ry Mountain” from The Sound of Music. “I wanted to sing with Jamie Foxx because he just has such a fantastic voice and soulful — very, very soulful — sound,” she says. That’s quite a compliment coming from Streisand, and Foxx lives up to it alongside the legend. For more where that comes from, watch Barbra: The Music… The Mem’ries… The Magic!, debuting Wednesday on Netflix."

Manson was a thief, a pimp and a murderous cult leader bent on race war. He was true scum. No wonder some alt-righters are pouring out drinks for him. “A great revolutionary,” said one commenter of Manson on the IronMarch neo-Nazi internet forum. ″The world really does feel a little emptier,” said another. One bereaved bigot simply posted a Celine Dion lyric: “Near, far, wherever you are I believe that the heart does go on ...” “Hero.” “Champion.” “Warrior of Truth.” Such were the tributes used Monday to describe a demented butcher. If you’re wondering who might rhapsodize a psychotic racist in this manner, the answer is other psychotic racists, many of whom belong to Atomwaffen Division, a particularly bloodthirsty and anti-American branch of the so-called alt-right that has made worshipping Manson a part of their cultish devotion to violent insurrection. Even within the alt-right — a loose association of white supremacists and fascists — the Atomwaffen Division is considered extreme. The group, whose name translates to “Atomic Weapons Division,” puts out ISIS-style propaganda videos on YouTube that feature members clad in skull masks and camouflage outfits, sometimes on training exercises in the woods, often holding guns and the organization’s distinctive yellow-and-black nuclear-themed flags. In one video, members burn a copy of the U.S. Constitution on a grill. pic.twitter.com/20BooyUUr2 Atomwaffen is best known for a double homicide in Tampa this May, in which Devon Arthurs, a member of the group who had converted to a violent, fundamentalist version of Islam, shot and killed two of his roommates, who were also Atomwaffen members. A fourth roommate, Brandon Russell, was arrested later for having bomb-making equipment and radioactive material. Russell, too, was part of Atomwaffen. He had a framed photo of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh in his bedroom. Apocalyptic lunacy has always been part of far-right politics, and a vigorous strain of it runs through today’s alt-right white supremacist movement. It should come as no surprise, then, that Manson, whose once-upon-a-time status as a longhair could never obscure the swastika carved into his forehead, might serve as a new vessel of madness for today’s violent racists. In many ways, he was a forebear of groups like Atomwaffen and a bug-eyed prototype for the modern race warrior. Okay NOW Charley is dead. He's waging Helter Skelter in the astral plane. pic.twitter.com/C2wfuS6Wnp Manson’s deranged political teachings were a mish-mash of Scientology, occultism and Nazism, all bundled into an original end-of-days tale. Stay with me, he told his followers, and you’ll be saved from the coming race war. “Manson was motivated by an apocalyptic belief in the imminent end of the world through a race war in which the White population was doomed to defeat,” Jeffrey Kaplan wrote in Encyclopedia of White Power: A Sourcebook on the Radical Racist Right. “The victorious Black population would in time realize that the White man is genetically more fit to govern, and would seek in vain for White survivors of the racial Holocaust to assume the reins of power. The Manson family, having survived the apocalypse by hiding in a timeless cave at the center of the world, would then emerge to take power.” This worldview led Manson and his followers into an especially desolate part of Death Valley called Barker Ranch in 1969, where Time magazine described them as “holed up in run-down cabins” leading an “indolent, almost savage existence, singing Manson’s songs, dancing, swimming in a small pool, stealing cars for cash and picking through garbage for food.” Here they would dodge the apocalypse. By the early 1980s, of course, Manson had failed to dodge his own downfall. He wasn’t in a timeless cave at the center of the world. He was in a cell in San Quentin, serving a life sentence for the gruesome murders of seven people. Manson had led his followers, known as The Family, in the 1969 slayings of actress Sharon Tate and six other people in a two-night killing spree in Los Angeles. It was in prison that Manson started a correspondence with a longtime American neo-Nazi named James Mason, who would come to view “Charlie” as a prophet of hate. Mason was the type of man who considered Auschwitz a “damned nice place,” and his wingnut journey would take him from the heart of organized white supremacy to years of inept obscurity and, ultimately, back to a faint relevance in the Trump era thanks to the alt-right and Atomwaffen. A fascist since he was 13, when he joined the youth movement of George Lincoln Rockwell’s American Nazi Party, Mason had radicalized himself while watching black people take to the streets during the civil rights era. As a young adult, he set up Nazi booths at county fairs in southern Ohio, where he’d grown up. “We should shoot for bringing down the system,” he would later say. “Destroy the system.” Mason eventually left the American Nazi Party and joined a splinter group called the National Socialist Liberation Front. Some NSLF members were fans of Manson, which prompted Mason to begin researching the cult leader. In 1980, Mason reached out to the incarcerated Manson. The two began communicating regularly by mail and phone. “What I discovered was a revelation equal to the revelation I received when I first found Adolf Hitler,” Mason would later explain. Through “Charlie,” Mason came to understand that Hitler’s death had brought about the end of Western civilization. Every government in the world was now part of an anti-white global conspiracy run by “super capitalists” and “super communists.” Nothing about Western culture or its institutions could be salvaged. It would all have to be blown to smithereens. “It’s just like a human organism that has ingested a fatal dose of poison,” Mason would explain. “[If] you fall asleep with it and try to ride it out, you’re going to die, but if you become suddenly, violently ill and expel that poison ― even though the experience may be rather unpleasant ― you at least have a chance to live. Manson called that Helter Skelter.” So inspired by “Charlie” was Mason that he took the murderous cult leader’s advice and renamed his neo-Nazi organization Universal Order. Mason began writing a newsletter called “Siege” to promote Manson’s views as a continuation of Hitler’s philosophy. In 1992, Mason would collect these writings into a book that neo-Nazi skinhead leader Tom Metzger called “435 pages of hot revolutionary style white propaganda.” For Mason and other white supremacists, Manson was almost a divine being, an atavistic incarnation of hate. The cult leader fit neatly into a strain of fascist magical realism called “Esoteric Hitlerism” that became popular after World War II when the Greek writer Savitri Devi proposed that Hitler was the ninth avatar of Vishnu and racist dupes somehow bought into it. This type of crazy remains en vogue among the alt-right today, with notable exponents such as Andrew “weev” Auernheimer, a neo-Nazi hacker and the webmaster for The Daily Stormer, whose charismatic ravings make him the closest thing to a contemporary Manson in the movement. (Auernheimer has ties to Atomwaffen and after the Arthurs murders issued an overloud declamation about how he knew the shooter and the victims but had previously banned Arthurs from a Daily Stormer forum.) But the effects of Manson on today’s white supremacist movement ― in no small part thanks to Mason’s efforts ― go beyond evil juju. Consider white separatism in the modern context. Organized racists in America these days like to call themselves “white nationalists.” This of course is partly a public relations gambit — “white nationalist” is maybe more palatable than “neo-Nazi” or “white supremacist” — but it’s also an accurate description of what they want. Groups across the racist political spectrum want a White Nation, an ethno-state, somewhere in America for just the White Race. The three-piece-suit-wearing figurehead of the alt-right, Richard Spencer, is very open about this. So is veteran skinhead Jeff Schoep, the leader of the National Socialist Movement. As is KKK-enthusiast Brad Griffin, aka Hunter Wallace, a leader of the League of the South. In 2000, Mason wrote Manson to thank him for this brand of white separatism. In a two-page history of the Universal Order he penned for Kaplan’s The Encyclopedia of White Power, Mason wrote: Although few would realize or admit it, the gradual move away from “White Supremacy” toward White Separatism, from any hopes of recovering the U.S. government, toward establishing new, independent regions, is precisely what animated the creation of the Manson enclaves in the Death Valley during the 1960s. At issue is bare survival as a species as the world system begins to crumble and die. Mason’s adulation of Manson made him somewhat of an outlier in the American neo-Nazi scene of the 1980s. And Manson veneration remains a prickly subject for current white nationalists. On Stormfront, another neo-Nazi forum, the commentary Monday about Manson’s passing mostly had a “Good riddance and thank God he’s dead” tenor. The Manson Family killed white people, after all. And Manson’s degeneracy reflects poorly on white supremacy. But degeneracy has never prevented neo-Nazis from attracting supporters. For years, Mason’s “Charlie”-inspired insights were sought after by other prominent racists, including Metzger, who interviewed Mason for over an hour in 1993 for his “Race and Reason” show. When talk turned to violence, as it often does with far-right extremists, Mason clucked disapprovingly about a 1984 mass shooting in which a survivalist gunman took out his rage at “international bankers” by massacring 21 people in a McDonald’s in San Ysidro, California. “It wouldn’t be such a bad thing if they would pick their targets a little more carefully,” he said. Mason faded into relative obscurity for the rest of the ’90s and early aughts, when he was in and out of prison on weapons charges and for an inappropriate relationship with a 14-year-old girl, of whom he had taken nude photographs. But in 2017, the year his hero “Charlie” would pass into the astral plane, Mason has found new relevance, and a fawning group of disciples in Atomwaffen. Earlier this year Atomwaffen republished Mason’s book “Siege” online, and announced the launch of a new Universal Order website. “JAMES MASON IS BACK!” read a July headline on the fascist zine Noose, an Atomwaffen site. After years of trying, the article said, Atomwaffen members had finally tracked down Mason for an exclusive interview! And to the violent group’s absolute glee, Mason was still Mason, an unhinged admirer of Manson and mass murderers. “My views on Manson have not changed,” he told an Atomwaffen member. “We had a society post-WW2 that was disintegrating, a mile a minute. We had a hippie generation, a country that was heading headlong into national suicide. Manson’s commune was solidly, solidly white.” When asked for his thoughts on Anders Breivik, the far-right Norwegian terrorist convicted of killing 77 people in a bombing and mass shooting in 2011, Mason replied that Breivik was “dead-on.” “I’m never gonna disown anybody who does something like that,” Mason said. Elsewhere in the interview, Mason said he’s “mildly encouraged” by the rise of Donald Trump. As recently as Sunday, one day before Manson died, Mason apparently wrote an article on the Universal Order website: a 1,400-word treatise praising Nazi eugenics and euthanasia.

Manson was a thief, a pimp and a murderous cult leader bent on race war. He was true scum. No wonder some alt-righters are pouring out drinks for him. “A great revolutionary,” said one commenter of Manson on the IronMarch neo-Nazi internet forum. ″The world really does feel a little emptier,” said another. One bereaved bigot simply posted a Celine Dion lyric: “Near, far, wherever you are I believe that the heart does go on ...” “Hero.” “Champion.” “Warrior of Truth.” Such were the tributes used Monday to describe a demented butcher. If you’re wondering who might rhapsodize a psychotic racist in this manner, the answer is other psychotic racists, many of whom belong to Atomwaffen Division, a particularly bloodthirsty and anti-American branch of the so-called alt-right that has made worshipping Manson a part of their cultish devotion to violent insurrection.

http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/nov/21/police-arkansas-college-student-had-firearms-dorm-/,"Police say a 20-year-old Arkansas college student is accused of constructing and testing explosives. According to a news release from the Siloam Springs Police Department, Timothy Constantin was arrested Tuesday. On Nov. 14, officers responded to a residence hall at John Brown University after reports of a suicidal student who had “made references to committing a mass shooting or bombing.” After searching Constantin's dorm room at J. Alvin Brown Hall, police found firearms and ammunition, according to the release. Authorities said that witnesses told officers Constantin had been constructing and testing explosives off-campus. Police said Constantin later admitted to constructing explosive devices, though no evidence had been located Tuesday. In a statement, the university said it was increasing the number of armed guards on campus and reviewing training procedures after the arrest. “While the student indicated thoughts of harm to himself and potentially to others, to the best of our knowledge there was not a specific plan to carry out any type of campus attack nor was there a specific person targeted,” the university said. As of Tuesday, the 20-year-old remained at Benton County jail on a charge of criminal possession of explosives. No bail has been set. The investigation is ongoing.

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/496972984/0/phoenix/sports~Arizona-Coyotes-return-home-riding-threegame-win-streak/,"The Coyotes are playing their best hockey of the season and entering Wednesday have won three straight games for the first time since January 2016. And while each of those wins feature heroes like Zac Rinaldo (momentum-shifting fight vs. Montreal), Anthony Duclair (hat trick and overtime winner vs. Ottawa) and Oliver Ekman-Larsson (game-winning goal vs. Toronto), there has been one constant throughout the streak. The man between the pipes: Antti Raanta. The Finnish goaltender is expected to start his eighth straight game for the Coyotes on Wednesday against the Sharks. Since returning from injury on Nov. 2, Raanta has started nine of the team’s 10 contests over that span. “It felt like forever to be out, and the team wasn’t winning so it was really frustrating,” Raanta said. “But now it’s like everything is in your head. Of course when you lose, you feel tired. When you win the games, you don’t feel anything other than ‘Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go.’ It’s a mind game and so much happens between the ears.” Raanta was acquired in the offseason to replace longtime netminder Mike Smith as the Coyotes No. 1 goaltender. But for Raanta, who had only ever served as a backup over four years with the Blackhawks and Rangers, such a role would require some adjustments. It was an inauspicious start to the season for the goaltender, who suffered two losses in his first two games before leaving his third contest with an injury. Even upon his initial return, there were struggles. But now Raanta feels like he has gotten himself into a groove. And his play is reflecting that. “The last three games have been tied or at least close towards the end,” Raanta said. “So at least for me those are the moments why you want to be a goalie. So you can make a difference in the game. I’ve been able to make a couple good saves late in the game, and of course that feels good. It feels nice to help the team in those situations.” RELATED: Coyotes 'dealt a bad hand' with early schedule One of the Coyotes biggest strengths this season has been its penalty kill. Dating back to Oct. 31, Arizona has killed off 31 of their last 35 penalties — and Raanta's .935 save percentage in such situations ranks second among NHL goalies with a minimum of seven games played. ""It was a tough start obviously with injury,"" Coyotes head coach Rick Tocchet said. ""But now he's kind of got his legs underneath him. It's allowed to get in a groove. Antti does a good job of giving us a chance to win, which is all we’re asking of our goaltenders."" The 28-year-old has embraced the responsibilities that come with being a No. 1 goaltender. Of course, shadowing Corey Crawford and Henrik Lundqvist help with learning the ropes Raanta said one of his most valuable learning experiences came last March when Lundqvist went down with a hip injury and was sidelined for two weeks. The Rangers had multiple back-to-backs over that stretch and Raanta shouldered the entire load. “We played probably eight games and six of those were back-to-backs, and I played all the games,” Raanta said. “So that was a good learning experiment. You make a couple mistakes in Friday’s game, travel that night and go to play the next game on Saturday. You don’t think about it anymore. You need to have a fresh mind and just do whatever it takes to be better than yesterday.” For Raanta, the biggest lesson learned was how to have a short memory. But as of late there hasn’t been much to forget. The Coyotes are playing an energized brand of hockey, one that has Raanta excited for every upcoming start. “It’s way more fun when you win the games,” Raanta said. “But we’ve been doing the right things and when the team is playing the right way it’s way easier for the goalie. You can read the game a little bit better and things like that. It’s been real fun and we’ll try to keep it going.” Now, Raanta aims to prove to Coyotes fans that he is ready to shoulder the burden of a No. 1 goaltender. “It’s a learning process still,” Raanta said. “How to be consistent every night and on a daily basis. But I feel like I’ve learned a lot over the last four years how to manage those situations. It’s just time to prove that I can do the job.” Coyotes defenseman Niklas Hjalmarsson rejoined the Coyotes on Monday to find a different team skating around him. Having missed the previous nine games, playing with a team with a newfound confidence made things a lot easier for the 30-year-old veteran. Perhaps more than any other Coyotes player, Hjalmarsson could feel a difference skating with his teammates on Monday in Toronto. Looking back on where the Coyotes were 20 days ago, the entire mood around the team seems to have chanced “Everybody, it just felt like the guys came together,” Hjalmarsson said. “We’ve been spending a lot of time together with a lot of road trips here and I felt a big difference just coming in and playing that last game compared to before my injury.” For Hjalmarsson, it made the adjustment of returning to the lineup much easier. “I felt like the guys played much better,” he said. “And it was easier for me to get into a team game when I feel like the team is playing a better overall team game. So I felt a big difference.” On the ice, the Swedish blueliner is regarded as a minutes-eater and an elite shot-blocker. For a goaltender like Antti Raanta, the addition of Hjalmarsson is welcomed with open arms. “When he’s on the ice, he’s a warrior,” Raanta said. “He blocks shots, he tries to do everything in order to help our team win. It’s a big part of our group and for a goalie you always want to have those guys in front of you who are putting their body on the line all the time. “He’s been doing that for many years,” he said. “He’s winning Stanley Cups in Chicago so you know he knows what you need to do to win the games.” Having the opportunity to rejoin the team for Monday’s game in Toronto meant a lot to Hjalmarsson. Getting his first win with the Coyotes meant even more. “It’s always nice to come back and contribute a little bit,” Hjalmarsson said. “It’s always rough to be sidelined and watching the guys play and battle and not feeling like you can do anything about it. But it feels great to be back and to be part of my first win with the team, so that felt good.” And while Hjalmarsson always makes his mark on the ice, it’s away from the rink where he provides the biggest impact — mentoring young players and instilling confidence in his teammates. “He’s helping the young guys, he’s talking a lot,” Raanta said. “He’s a big part of our group and he’s a mentoring guy.” Coyotes defenseman Jakob Chychrun has not skated in a game this season after undergoing offseason knee surgery, but the 19-year-old defenseman is progressing “ahead of schedule,” according to head coach Rick Tocchet. Chychrun skated with the team for the first time prior to the Coyotes game in Toronto on Monday. He was back on the ice Wednesday in Arizona ahead of the team’s home bout with the Sharks. “He’s a great kid and he’s worked so hard,” Tocchet said. “Just to get this opportunity to skate, it’s huge for him.” Tocchet has been so impressed with how the young blueliner looks on the ice, it’s hard for the coach to believe he’s still recovering. “He looks so good, you want him to play tomorrow,” Tocchet said. “The work ethic he’s done to get where he’s at, I think he’s ahead of schedule.” But as far as schedules go, there still isn’t one with Chychrun. It’s highly unlikely he’ll play on the current homestand, but the potential of a return in the next three to four weeks is certainly within reason. Still, the Coyotes will continue to monitor his progression before settling on a hard date. “He’s going to be such a huge asset for us,” Tocchet said. “Not only for the next month but for the future of the Coyotes. It’s almost like making a trade, having this young star join your team.” When: 7 p.m. TV/Radio: Fox Sports Arizona-Plus/KTAR-AM (620).

http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-ask-amy-ae-1122-story.html,"Dear Amy: I'm a young SAHM (stay-at-home mom) of a 5-month-old baby. My husband and I worked hard to budget, pay off debt and cut expenses prior to our baby being born. I'm the only mom in my friend group who stays home, and recently I've been getting asked to babysit (for free) quite frequently. One friend asked me well in advance to drive across town to pick their daughter up from school two days in a row and watch her until they got home. I agreed, knowing that the child care they had lined up had fallen through. Under those circumstances, I was happy to help. A week later, that same friend is asking me to watch their child for an entire day because she works and her husband has made other plans. I really don't want to do it, but feel bad knowing that I have no excuse. I just don't want to. Their child is much older than my own and requires a lot of attention. It's way different than my infant and takes away from my bonding with him. If there was some financial compensation I would be more inclined to do it, but I feel like free babysitting should be kept for times when they are REALLY in a bind. How can I politely decline without feeling guilty, or making up an excuse? -- SAHM Dear SAHM: If you are the only SAHM in your friend group, you might be fielding requests from several different sets of parents. Your job is to take care of your child, and to live your own life the way you want to. Because you are a good person and a good friend you will occasionally want to help out other parents who are facing an emergency. However, ""I'm working and my husband has other plans"" does not qualify as an emergency. And this friend should always offer to reciprocate when you step in. One way to handle this might be to leverage your own needs when replying to a request: ""I can take 'Sara' for the day, but could you reciprocate by taking care of 'James' this Saturday afternoon?"" Or if you want compensation, ask for it: ""What would you normally be paying your sitter for these days? I'll do it for the same fee."" Many parents would be thrilled to pay for a steady and reliable backup. Here are other words to say: ""I'm sorry you are in such a jam but I can't help you out. You really need to find backup child care, other than me."" Don't succumb to the temptation to pile on explanations, rationales, etc. Keep it simple. Dear Amy: This year has been one of the hardest of my life. My grandmother passed away, my uncle died from a stroke, my sister was killed in a car accident, I went through my first romantic heartbreak and I suffered a miscarriage. I've always been a positive person, and I am fighting to maintain that in my life right now. In an effort to do that, I am avoiding news reports on current events. I do this just so I won't break. Recently a co-worker asked me about a mass shooting and I expressed why I didn't keep up with such things. She scolded me, telling me I needed to be aware of these tragedies. Amy, I don't want to! I don't want to know that people kill each other for no reason. I am doing everything I can just to get out of bed some days! This co-worker complained that I was being rude. Was I? Am I wrong because I don't want to know about these things? -- Surviving in Texas Dear Surviving: I hear you. And I completely understand your instincts to avoid bad news. Unless you work in the news business, you have no obligation to keep up-to-date on the almost daily string of tragedies befalling us right now. I don't know if you were rude to your co-worker. But protecting and then defending yourself isn't rude -- it's your duty. Dear Amy: ""Not Easy"" described pressuring a guy in a fairly new relationship (four dates!) about being exclusive. I agreed with you that it is wise not to have sex until you are exclusive, but this means that all parties need to be patient. Sounds like a mismatch to me. -- Been There Dear Been There: It seemed to me like ""Not Easy"" was trapped between her values and the fact that she really wanted to have sex.

https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/11/22/ohio-man-threatened-historical-mass-shooting-at-las-vegas-casino/23285497/," An Ohio man is facing federal charges after he allegedly threatened to stage a historic mass shooting at a Las Vegas casino where his estranged wife was employed at the time. FBI officials said Wei Li, of Cuyahoga Falls, also threatened to carry out a mass shooting at a church with at least 1,000 people in attendance, according to a department release. Authorities said the 28-year-old suspect made the threats through a series of text messages to his wife sent Nov. 6–9. “There are 1,000 people in our church,” Li said in one message, according to court documents obtained by Cleveland.com. “I will make the biggest in history.” The name of the casino has not been released. Photo: CUYAHOGA FALLS POLICE Li allegedly sent his wife photos of himself holding a rifle and knives, according to Cleveland.com. In a text sent Nov. 9, Li allegedly told his wife he’d kill her if he didn’t get his green card, according to Cleveland’s Fox affiliate. FBI officials said Li bragged that the planned shootings would go down in history and that he would blame his wife for all the deaths, according to the release. Federal agents conducted a joint interview with Cuyahoga Falls Police on Nov. 10. During the questioning, authorities asked Li to unlock his phone. Li complied but allegedly started to delete a string of text messages. At that point, he was arrested and taken into custody. The FBI said Li acknowledged sending the threatening texts to his wife, but said he didn’t intend to carry out the shootings. No firearms were found in his home, according to the Las Vegas Review Journal. Li was charged with interstate threatening communications and destruction of evidence, according to the release. He was transferred into federal custody on Nov. 16. The threats came about a month after 58 people were killed, and more than 500 were wounded, by gunman Stephen Craig Paddock at an outdoor country music concert in Las Vegas.

http://www.denverpost.com/2017/11/22/nyc-macys-thanksgiving-day-parade-security/,"Trending: NEW YORK — Sand-filled sanitation trucks and police sharpshooters will mix with glittering floats and giant balloons at a Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade that comes in a year of terrible mass shootings and not even a month after a deadly truck attack in lower Manhattan. New York City’s mayor and police brass have repeatedly stressed that layers of security, along with hundreds of officers, will be in place for one of the nation’s biggest outdoor holiday gatherings, and that visitors should not be deterred. “We had a couple of tough months as a nation,” Police Commissioner James O’Neill said. “We won’t ever accept such acts of hate and cowardice as inevitable in our society.” A posting last year in an English-language magazine of the Islamic State group, which took credit for the Oct. 31 truck attack that killed eight people, mentioned the Thanksgiving parade as “an excellent target.” Authorities say there is no confirmation of a credible threat. “I want to assure the people that we swore to protect that anytime something happens anywhere in the world, the NYPD works with our law enforcement partners and studies it and we learn from it and it informs our decision making going forward,” O’Neill said. This year’s security plan includes dozens of city sanitation trucks, which weigh about 16 tons empty and up to twice that with sand, that will be lined up as imposing barriers to traffic at every cross street along the 2 ½-mile parade route stretching from Central Park to Macy’s flagship store on 34th Street. In addition, officers with assault weapons and portable radiation detectors will walk among the crowds, and sharpshooters on rooftops will scan building windows and balconies for anything unusual. Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday that security at the parade increases every year “because we understand we are dealing with a very challenging world.” He told crowds gathered to watch the parade’s giant balloons being inflated that “the amount of resources and personnel we put in has increased each year to make us safer.” New York officials also are asking the tens of thousands of spectators to be alert for anything suspicious. “There will be a cop on every block,” said NYPD Chief of Patrol Terence Monahan. “Go to that cop and say something.” The 91st annual parade begins at 9 a.m. and will be broadcast live on NBC. Smokey Robinson, Jimmy Fallon, The Roots, Flo Rida and Wyclef Jean will be among the stars celebrating, along with performances from the casts of Broadway’s “Anastasia,” ”Dear Evan Hansen” and “SpongeBob SquarePants.” New balloons added this year include Dr. Seuss’ Grinch, Olaf from the smash movie “Frozen,” and a puppy called Chase from Nickelodeon’s “Paw Patrol.” Beyond the pageantry, police say they have been working on security for the parade since the moment last year’s parade ended. It’s a plan that got renewed attention after a terror attack in lower Manhattan Oct. 31, when a man in a rented truck barreled onto a crowded bike path near the World Trade Center, killing eight people. Authorities said the 29-year-old suspect operated from a playbook put out by the Islamic State group. Sayfullo Saipov, an Uzbek immigrant, was charged with federal terrorism offenses that could qualify him for the death penalty. According to a criminal complaint, he made statements about his allegiance to the Islamic State group. Police also are mindful of the Oct. 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas in which a high-stakes gambler and real estate investor unleashed gunfire on country music concert-goers, killing 58 and leaving hundreds injured. The first major New York event since the bike path attack — the New York marathon, which drew tens of thousands of spectators and 50,000 runners from around the world — went off with no problems. “We said right away New York’s response is to remain strong and resilient,” de Blasio said. “We do not back down in the face of terror threats. The city is filled with resolve.” Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts"

She has posted a video on Twitter and YouTube describing the incident and asking others to share their stories. Speier says, Congress has been a breeding ground for a hostile work environment for far too long. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File)  Jackie Speier was a 23-year-old congressional staffer excited about her new job on Capitol Hill when her chief of staff got her alone in a room. The 50-year-old grabbed her face and stuck his tongue down her throat. Now, four and a half decades later, the Peninsula congresswoman is leading the charge in Congress to clean up what she calls a culture of sexual harassment in the Capitol. Since she went public with her story in late October, she’s been thrust into the national spotlight, introduced legislation to streamline harassment reporting procedures, testified at hearings on the topic and shed light on the big settlements paid out with taxpayers’ money to silence harassment complaints. “I’m embarrassed to say it, but I think Congress has been an enabler of sexual harassers for a long time,” Speier, a Democrat who represents San Mateo County, said in an interview this week. Speier has worked on sexual harassment policies for decades, beginning in California’s state Capitol. But when she was accosted in 1973, there weren’t any official channels to report what had happened — and even the term “sexual harassment” hadn’t entered the vernacular. “There was nowhere I could go,” she said. As wave after wave of sexual harassment revelations hit Hollywood and the media this fall, Speier shared her story in a YouTube video. She looked directly into the camera, urging other congressional staffers to come forward with their experiences with harassment and blasting the “breeding ground for a hostile work environment” that she says Congress has become. Speier is now the lead sponsor of a bill that would reform the Office of Compliance, the obscure congressional office that investigates — and, activists say, often covers up — sexual harassment. Victims of harassment in Congress who want to report their experiences have to go through a byzantine process, submitting to mandatory counseling, signing a nondisclosure agreement and waiting months before an investigation into their claims even begins. And interns and fellows still have no official channels to report sexual harassment. Get top headlines in your inbox every afternoon. Get the free PM Report newsletter. Sign Up From 1997 to 2016, the office paid out $15 million to settle sexual harassment complaints and other discrimination cases, without any real transparency or accounting of the claims. The office “was really created to protect the harassers,” Speier said. Her legislation would shake that up, prohibiting nondisclosure agreements as a requirement to start an investigation, speeding the process and including interns and fellows. It would also require members of Congress reimburse the federal Treasury for any sexual harassment settlements paid out because of their actions going forward. The bill, which was introduced in the Senate by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, has received bipartisan support. While Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, hasn’t publicly commented on the effort to reform the office, he has supported another Speier bill to mandate sexual harassment training for members of Congress and their staff. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a San Jose Democrat who is co-sponsoring the reform bill, said she had never known about Speier’s experience with harassment as a young staffer, even though the two were both working on Capitol Hill at the time. She praised her Bay Area colleague for speaking up. “It empowered people, and she just opened a floodgate,” Lofgren said. “I think we probably will have momentum on her bill.” As a California state assemblywoman and senator from 1986 to 2006, Speier wrote legislation mandating sexual harassment training. She said the recent allegations of sexual harassment in Sacramento — where almost 150 women recently wrote a letter decrying a culture of harassment — were disturbing. “I’m dismayed that (the training) didn’t have the effect we wanted,” she said. “It does seem like it’s an Animal House up there right now — it’s disgusting.” She urged California’s legislative leaders to take swift action. “It starts at the top,” she said. “To the extent that the leadership tolerates it, the conduct exists.” Since being elected to Congress in 2008, Speier has worked on issues like sexual assault in the military and on college campuses. In 2014, she tried to pass an amendment to the legislative budget mandating sexual harassment prevention training, but the chairman of the rules committee didn’t allow the measure to be debated. She also tried to add in more funding in the legislative budget for the compliance office to do more outreach, only to have that money removed in later revisions. “There was no willingness to look at this issue at all,” she said, unlike in recent weeks. “To see the change this dramatic is reassuring that if you take full advantage of timing, you can accomplish a lot.” But Speier said that she knows that national attention can be fickle, and thinks that she and other advocates may have a limited window to pass reforms while the focus is on sexual harassment. She pointed to the long-running debate over gun control, noting how congressional resolve to pass more firearm regulations gains steam after a mass shooting, only to dissolve within weeks or even days. “This has captured the interest of every American,” she said of the harassment issue. “I do think that we are in a defining moment culturally — which, at my age, I’m just reassured is happening.” That moment definitely hadn’t happened 44 years ago when Speier was forcibly kissed by her chief of staff, Joe Holsinger, who died in 2004. The two worked in the office of Rep. Leo Ryan, whose old district Speier now represents. Speier was shocked when Holsinger grabbed and kissed her, not understanding how he could think it was acceptable. “I recoiled, and I made sure I was never alone with him in a room ever again,” she said. Going public in the YouTube video wasn’t the first time that Speier used her own experiences as powerful arguments in policy debates. She made headlines in 2011 when she gave an impromptu speech on the House floor about having an abortion in the early 1990s after doctors told her she was losing a baby that she desperately wanted. In 1988, Speier became the first California legislator to give birth while in office. And she’s also known for surviving five gunshot wounds in November 1978 while investigating the People’s Temple in Jonestown, Guyana, with Congressman Ryan, who was killed in the attack. Jessica Levinson, a law professor at Loyola University, said that Speier’s decision to share her experience of harassment was a smart way to prod Congress to act. “Lawmakers make better policy when they have a variety of experiences,” Levinson said. “It’s vitally important that this isn’t just something where we get outside testimony of how sexual harassment can affect people, but it’s someone on the inside who can say, ‘Let me talk to you about my personal experience.”’ Since she released the video, Speier said she’s talked in person to four House staffers who have experienced harassment or assault, and on the phone to “many others.” Leeann Tweeden, a Los Angeles newscaster, said she decided to publicly accuse Sen. Al Franken, D-Minnesota, of harassing and groping her after interviewing Speier and hearing her story. Tweeden wrote in an article that she came forward because she wanted to have the same effect on other victims of harassment “that Congresswoman Jackie Speier had on me.” Speier has said she knows of two current members of Congress, one a Democrat and the other a Republican, who have been accused of sexual harassment. Neither of those is Franken or Rep. John Conyers, who was also the subject of public allegations this week, Speier said. And she’s not naming names. “Women and men who are inspired by public service come to Congress,” she said, “and we have to create an environment that’s not hostile.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters"

https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/11/24/las-vegas-shooter-fired-more-than-1100-rounds-police-say/23287320/," Gunman Stephen Paddock fired more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition during his attack on a Las Vegas country music festival last month, authorities said. Included in this total is about 200 rounds that Paddock fired from his Mandalay Bay hotel room into the hallway, injuring hotel security guard Jesus Campos, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo told the Las Vegas Review-Journal on Wednesday. 58 people, plus Paddock, were killed in the shooting. Here's what we know about Stephen Paddock: Authorities also found about 4,000 rounds of unused ammunition in the hotel room, Lombardo said. He said that officials have yet to determine a motive. “I’m frustrated,” Lombardo said, adding that city’s police department is still working with the FBI to process the ballistics evidence. Hundreds of victims have filed lawsuits in the wake of the shooting, claiming negligence on the part of MGM Resorts International, which owns the Mandalay Bay hotel, and Live Nation, the group that organized the festival during which the shooting occurred.

http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-life-stevens-wednesday-texas-shooter-shot-babies-1108-story.html,"He shot babies at point-blank range. I haven’t been able to get the image out of my head since I read it Tuesday. A couple who survived the church massacre in Sutherland Springs, Texas, said the gunman walked aisle-to-aisle and shot crying babies. Church video captured it happening, law enforcement officials announced Wednesday. Babies. I can’t believe this is the best we can do. I can’t believe we’re willing to accept this as the price of freedom. I can’t believe we’re weaving those babies’ deaths into a larger narrative that says, Look, the system worked: Bad guy starts shooting, good guy shoots back, problem solved. I listened to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton explain Monday on NPR why worshippers should consider bringing their own guns to church from now on. “It’s not the only response, certainly,” he told host Robert Siegel. “But it is a way of protecting innocent people and innocent lives. I mean, first responders in a rural community are sometimes 20 to 30 minutes away. And even in urban settings, they can be five, six, seven minutes away. And obviously with an automatic weapon, it’s difficult unless you have somebody in the church that can defend, either paid professionals, which — a church I go to in the Dallas area has security that they pay. But they are a big church, and they can afford it. But some churches may not have those resources, and so they might have to train their own people and be prepared if somebody like this comes in to harm their people.” I don’t know where that leaves babies. Presumably their parents are shooting on their behalf? Couldn’t we, instead, try a little harder to keep assault rifles out of the hands of a guy like Devin Patrick Kelley? A guy who beat his wife and cracked the skull of his infant stepson and escaped from a mental health center and was suspected of sexual assault and made death threats against his superiors in the military? We wouldn’t even have to change existing gun laws. We could just enforce the ones already in place. “The records that emerged Tuesday add up to at least three missed opportunities that might have offered law enforcement a way to stop Kelley from having access to guns long before he slaughtered much of the congregation in the middle of a Sunday service,” the Tribune reports. But the Air Force didn’t enter Kelley's criminal history into the federal database as required by military rules. And that sexual assault allegation was never really pursued. (The Comal County Sheriff’s Office is reviewing whether the investigation was mishandled.) A felony sexual assault conviction would have likely prevented him from purchasing a gun. Prevented him from legally purchasing a gun, many will point out. “We know that there’s black markets in everything that people want, right?” Attorney General Paxton said during the NPR interview. “Drugs, whatever. Just name it. If people want it, there’s a black market. And so to be naive and say that there wouldn’t be for guns is, I think, unrealistic.” But we don’t use that as an excuse to make heroin easier to buy. We don’t use that as an excuse to make child pornography easier to download. Well, we could crack down, but, you know, black market. We create and enforce laws that make it as difficult as possible for criminals to get their hands on them. Guns are different, I realize. Law-abiding citizens need to be able to purchase them to protect themselves from the law-breaking citizens who get them on the black market. I get it. But that’s not working. Kelley showed up in body armor and slaughtered 26 people — including babies — before the law-abiding citizen with a gun could arrive. We’ve got to work harder at prevention. We’ve got to examine a culture that shrugs off the laws that are already in place. We’ve got to step out of our gun debate corners long enough to talk about this honestly. We can’t be a country that keeps looking the other way. Children in classrooms. Country music fans at a concert. Moviegoers in a theater. Chicagoans on their sidewalks. Babies in church. I refuse to believe this is the best we can do. hstevens@chicagotribune.com Twitter @heidistevens13 CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"

http://theweek.com/10things/732681/10-things-need-know-today-november-13-2017,"Athit Perawongmetha/AFP/Getty Images 1 President Trump said Monday he had a ""great relationship"" with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte after their first formal one-on-one meeting. Trump declined to answer questions about whether he had pressed human rights issues with Duterte, an authoritarian leader accused of ordering extrajudicial killings of drug suspects. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that the issue of human rights ""briefly came up in the context of the Philippines' fight against illegal drugs."" Duterte's spokesman said Duterte talked about the ""drug menace"" but Trump never mentioned human rights. Duterte, who had tense relations with former President Barack Obama, expressed his affinity for Trump at a Sunday dinner by singing a Philippine love ballad that includes the line, ""You are the love I've been waiting for."" 2 A 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck near the Iraq-Iran border in the Iraqi city of Halabja on Sunday, killing at least 330 people, most of them in Iran. Iran's state-run news agency reported that at least 328 people were killed and about 3,950 were injured in the country. News videos showed people fleeing their homes in the night. More than 100 aftershocks were reported. At least seven people died in Iraq, and at least 535 were injured. The quake, which was centered just over 200 miles north of Baghdad, was felt across Iraq and as far away Pakistan, Lebanon, Kuwait, and Turkey. Iran sits on several major fault lines and experiences frequent earthquakes. A magnitude 6.6 temblor killed 26,000 people in the historic city of Bam in 2003. 3 The congregation of the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas, gathered Sunday for its first service since a gunman murdered 26 worshippers a week ago. The members of the small church and hundreds of others met at a baseball field about a half-mile from the church, which would have been too small to accommodate the crowd. The church's pastor, Frank Pomeroy, has vowed to start arming himself when he preaches, but said his faith was unshaken. Pomeroy, who lost his 14-year-old daughter in the mass shooting, said the surviving church members should ""not allow the lives that were lost or the families hurt lie in vain."" 4 Alabama Republican Senate nominee Roy Moore continued to mostly deny allegations from four women that he initiated inappropriate physical relationships when he was in his 30s and they were teenagers as young as 14, telling a Christian Citizen Task Force forum on Sunday that The Washington Post, which reported the accusations after speaking with 30 people who knew Moore in the late 1970s and early '80s, had printed false allegations ""for which they will be sued."" Meanwhile, four polls since Thursday show a dead heat between Moore and Democrat Doug Jones, and Senate Republicans and the White House are increasingly distancing themselves from Moore. Two GOP senators — Tim Scott (S.C.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) — said Sunday they find the accusations more credible than Moore's denials. 5 Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri said Sunday in his first TV interview since he unexpectedly announced his resignation last week that he would be returning home from Saudi Arabia ""within days."" Hariri rejected suggestions by opponents and allies alike that Saudi Arabia, which is increasingly clashing with Iran, had coerced him into resigning and accusing the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and its ally, Iran, for destabilizing Lebanon and the region. Hariri said he was free to travel ""if I wanted to,"" but that he was being careful about returning to Lebanon to avoid being assassinated like his father, former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, who was killed in a 2005 car bombing blamed on Hezbollah members. 6 Two former top U.S. intelligence officials on Sunday said Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to be manipulating President Trump with flattery. A day earlier, Trump dismissed the intelligence chiefs, former CIA Director John Brennan, and ex-National Intelligence Director James Clapper, as ""political hacks"" and questioned their agencies' shared conclusion that Russia meddled in last year's U.S. presidential election. Trump walked back his criticism on Sunday, saying that he believes that Putin really feels that Russia did not interfere in the election, but that, ""I believe very much in our intelligence agencies,"" which Trump said are ""currently led by fine people."" 7 Staff Sgt. Logan Melgar, a 34-year-old Green Beret who died in Mali in June, had discovered that two members of SEAL Team Six, who are now being investigated in his death, were stealing money from a fund used to pay local informants, The Daily Beast reported on Sunday, citing five members of the special-operations community. Melgar's wife said he had told her he had a bad feeling about two SEALs he was working with and would tell her more when he returned home. The SEALs told superiors that Melgar was drunk during hand-to-hand fighting exercises, but no drugs or alcohol were found in his body in an autopsy. Military investigators believe Melgar lost consciousness in an early morning altercation with the SEALs. 8 North Korean troops shot and injured a fellow soldier on Monday as he dashed across the heavily armed border into South Korea as the two countries remain on high alert due to tensions over the North's missile and nuclear weapons programs. South Korean soldiers found the defector about 55 yards south of the border line and took him to a hospital, where he was being treated for gunshot wounds to an elbow and shoulder. The incident occurred as the U.S. and South Korea conduct joint naval exercises involving three American aircraft carriers off South Korea's east coast. This is the first time in a decade the U.S. has used three carrier groups in the drills, in a show of the kind of force President Trump has said Americans ""hope to God we never have to use"" against Pyongyang. 9 Uber on Sunday approved SoftBank's offer to invest billions in the ride-hailing company. The Japanese conglomerate will lead a consortium of investors to buy at least 14 percent of Uber. SoftBank reportedly plans to buy about $1 billion of fresh Uber stock at the ride-hailing service's current valuation of about $68.5 billion, and purchase about $9 billion worth of existing shares from current Uber shareholders. The deal is expected to pave the way for sweeping governance changes at Uber, which has shaken up its leadership following complaints about sexual harassment and a toxic corporate culture, and a move to take the company public by 2019. 10 Longtime New York tabloid gossip columnist Liz Smith died on Sunday at her Manhattan home. She was 94. Smith chronicled the lives of the rich and famous for more than 30 years, writing her column for publications including the New York Daily News, Newsday, and finally the New York Post, where it appeared from 1995 to 2009, before it moved onto the internet in the New York Social Diary. For years, her column was syndicated and was published in up to 70 other newspapers. She occasionally got big scoops, such as Donald and Ivana Trump's 1990 split and Madonna's 1996 pregnancy, but Smith was known for a more gentle approach to gossip than the brutal, sensationalist style of many of her competitors, which led critics to accuse her of going easy on celebrities to stay in their good graces.

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/las-vegas-massacre-survivor-mother-gun-laws_us_5a163031e4b064948072ec50?utm_hp_ref=emotional-intelligence,"Senior Reporter, HuffPost More than a month after 58 people died and more than 500 were wounded in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history, the mother of one of the survivors of the Las Vegas massacre is reminding local lawmakers that part of the solution lies with them. In a gut-wrenching letter to her local representative, Illinois Rep. Ryan Spain (R-Peoria), Anne M. (as she asked to be named) described the harrowing trauma her daughter Hannah suffered following the Las Vegas tragedy. Without stronger gun laws, Anne M. warned, tens of thousands of Americans are set to suffer the same fate. “As you are gathering with your family during these holidays, I ask that you remember us and all the other families who have suffered losses due to gun violence,” she pleaded. “Reflect on the power and responsibilities that your office entails and be prepared to act for positive change when the new legislative session begins.” “Anne M.” told HuffPost her story and that of “Hannah” on the condition of anonymity. She lives in a region of Illinois that she describes as anti-gun control and is fearful for her family’s safety following the shooting. Additionally, her daughter is employed by one of the companies involved with the music festival and was not authorized to speak publicly about the incident. We’ve identified them both by the pseudonyms they used in the letter to the state lawmaker. Hannah had been preparing for the Route 91 Harvest Festival, a three-day country music fest that drew tens of thousands to the Las Vegas Strip, for days. On Oct. 1, she was working from a trailer near the stage when gunman Stephen Paddock unloaded hundreds of rounds into an unsuspecting crowd listening to Jason Aldean perform. At first, Hannah thought the popping sounds were the sound system experiencing problems. Then it dawned on her she was hearing rapid gunfire blasting overhead. Hannah barricaded the doors of her trailer, turned off the lights, computers and audio equipment. She huddled under the tables, fervently texting her colleagues to see if they were safe. Outside she heard crying and screaming as dozens lay dying. “I am safe. Many dead,” she texted her family from the trailer. Hannah stayed hidden in the trailer for about an hour, eventually making her way out of the venue with the help of law enforcement. She was later released and escorted to another hotel to rest. As morning broke in Las Vegas, she took a photo of the sunrise from her hotel room and texted her mother. “I never thought I’d live to see this day.” By the following afternoon, Hannah was on a plane back home. But once back in Illinois, she had trouble picking up her life. “In many ways I feel like every bullet that didn’t physically hit me, because none of them did, all hit me mentally and emotionally,” she told HuffPost. “If you could do a fictitious scan of my head, it would look like Swiss cheese, because they all went through me on some level.” Profoundly haunted by the killings, Hannah would come home from work and collapse in her mother’s arms, recounting the details of the shooting, over and over again. She’d complain of chest pain and had trouble breathing. Being in public became stressful, and being near strangers frightened her. The sounds of dogs barking and children laughing were too much to bear. One evening shortly after the shooting, as fireworks popped off during the halftime show of a school football game nearby, Hannah burst into tears and became panicked ― she didn’t hear fireworks, she heard gunfire, and she was instantly pulled back to her trailer at the festival hearing instead the bullets flying. Anne had to pull Hannah into the bathroom and turn on the exhaust fan, to drown out the fireworks, and hold her daughter as tight as she could. Anne, a former therapist, recognized her “bright, happy, spunky girl” was suffering from severe trauma and found her a therapist who specialized in treating post-traumatic stress disorder. While most often discussed as a disorder that affects members of the military, any person who experiences trauma can suffer from PTSD. About 7 to 8 percent of Americans will experience PTSD at some point in their lifetimes, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ National Center for PTSD. In any given year, about 8 million adults have PTSD, and it is common among survivors of mass shootings: About a third of them will experience PTSD. Watching her daughter suffer the effects of the shooting made Anne keenly aware of the trauma that tens of thousands of Americans ― gun violence survivors and the members of their families ― go through. The only way to prevent the trauma is to stop the shootings, she argues. “We can no longer deny that mass shootings are a terrifying, nearly daily part of American culture,” Anne wrote in her impassioned letter to Spain. “We have allowed assault rifles to become weapons of mass destruction in our everyday lives.” “Our schools, hospitals, concert venues and churches are now all battlefields,” Anne wrote. There are no readily available answers for Anne, Hannah, their family and the thousands of others affected by this national tragedy. Nearly 3,000 people have been shot in the weeks that followed the Las Vegas massacre, according to data collected by the Gun Violence Archive. About 800 of those victims have died. Just two weeks ago, a gunman opened fire at a church in a small town in Texas, killing 26 people and wounding 20 others. Despite numerous high-profile massacres involving firearms in recent years, from Aurora to Sandy Hook to Orlando, Congress has not passed meaningful legislation that could prevent another mass shooting. And while lawmakers briefly voiced support for a restriction on bump stocks following the Las Vegas shooting, the devices that facilitate rapid firing are still legal. Any hope for a legislative fix was dashed when the National Rifle Association issued a statement urging the Trump administration to address the matter via existing regulations and not new laws. Gun rights activists consider gun laws in Illinois to be strict. Gun owners are banned from carrying handguns that are visible to the public, and those with concealed carry permits are banned from bringing their firearms into schools, public parks and government buildings. Still, bump stocks remain legal, and the semi-automatic firearms that Paddock used during his rampage are as well. The state’s legislature has adjourned for the year without passing any new gun control legislation. Anne is trying to change that. She’s starting locally, with her state representative. “Until and unless stronger gun laws with thorough background checks are in place, our country is not safe,” Anne told Spain. “Not for my Hannah. Not for [Spain’s daughter] Eleanor. Not for any of us.” Rep. Spain told HuffPost in an email that he received Anne’s letter and found it to be “heartfelt and impactful” and that it gave him an opportunity to take time before the state’s next legislative session to find common ground on gun laws. “Out of strong respect for what her family has been through, I am looking for opportunities to work together toward addressing the scourge of mass-shootings on our society and that is what I told [Anne M.]. She asked me to take time to think about this issue and I am doing so.” Hannah hopes that, at the very least, making her story public will remind the nation of what she and the thousands of other people ― numbers that are growing ― who have been been hurt by gun violence are living through and to keep remembering it. And in doing so, perhaps Americans will decide they’ve finally had enough and fight for safer gun laws. “Nobody should have to experience this. Whether you’re 7 years old at Sandy Hook or 55 years old at a country music festival, there’s real action we can take. Somebody’s right to a gun should not be more important than anyone’s piece of mind.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how."
http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2017/11/26/tri-valley-letters-3/,"Trending: As customers of the East Bay Municipal Utility District, we are appalled and very concerned that something is not right with our meter readings. Perhaps we are feeding the salaries of upper management. Hundreds of customers from Danville and Alamo are saying that their water bills have doubled or tripled in the last five or six months. We are only two adults, our children are out of the house. Our last bill was for 1,665 gallons a day, amounting to a whopping 103,224 gallons for two months. We have a landscaped yard, but we do a lot of hand watering. I understand EBMUD uses a tier system to compute the bill amount. For instance, if we go to the top tier after a certain amount they charge $6.27 a gallon. So is it plausible that every time we flush the toilet it costs that amount? This is ridiculous, ludicrous and infuriating. California has over-the-top gas prices, sales taxes, etc. A bill of $937 for two people for two months is over the top. Some people have had bills of $1,500 or close to $2,000. They go on vacation for three weeks, and the bill goes higher. A child goes off to college, and the bill exceeds the last bill. We adhered to conservation during the drought and now we are being swindled by the utility company that apparently has not one ounce of morality or honest business practices — another corporation abusing their customers. We are all fed up. — Dianne and Steve Scheck, Alamo I became involved in the gun violence prevention movement after the Isla Vista shootings in 2014. I’m outraged to see another mass shooting in the news, this time across multiple locations in Tehama County, including an elementary school. Tragically, this is the 49th school shooting in America this year. Reports indicate that the shooting may have started as a domestic violence incident and that the gunman’s neighbors had expressed concern about threatening behavior. California is a leader in passing gun violence prevention laws like the Gun Violence Restraining Order that more people ought to know about, which can help save lives. GVRO creates a mechanism for family and household members to work with law enforcement to temporarily remove guns and prevent the purchase of new guns by individuals who pose a potential risk to themselves or others. Moms Demand Action For Gun Sense in America, The Brady Campaign and others fought hard to pass GVRO. I encourage readers to visit speakforsafety.org for more information. This law can save lives from gun violence. — Joan Kazerounian, Tri-Valley Moms Demand Action, Danville The name “Lions Club” inspires well-deserved respect for the organization’s nonsectarian philanthropy. Unfortunately, a rogue chapter has recently chosen to pursue an action that will certainly disparage the Lions Club’s good name. In 1971, the Albany Lions erected a large cross on the summit of Albany Hill. There was no opposition at the time because the land was privately owned by a Lions Club member. Several years later, the land was transferred to the city of Albany. At the same time, an easement was surreptitiously granted to the Albany Lions Club for maintenance of the cross. In recent years, opposition to this religious symbol on government land has increased. The obvious resolution of this issue is to remove the cross to private property. What has been the Lions’ response? They filed a lawsuit against the city of Albany in federal court. Shame on the Albany Lions. Certainly the vast sums this legal case will consume could be put to better use — by all parties involved. — Burt Bogardus, Danville The news that Don Trump Jr. was corresponding with WikiLeaks is not surprising. Trump Jr., like his father, radiates the aura of a slick salesman who will do anything for a buck. The fact that the editor, Julian Assange has allegedly been under investigation for espionage, computer fraud, hacking and receiving stolen sensitive data doesn’t seem to bother Junior. As I recall, the United States was working on charges against Assange as recently as last spring, but I haven’t heard anything since. Does this mean that the Trump administration has conveniently forgotten about it? Jeff Sessions does have a memory problem. I would like to say to Sessions a few words from Gen. Flynn: Lock them up. — H.T. Nelson, Danville A letter writer essentially says that men must overcome our evolutionary programming to refrain from sexual assault. But if we’re just evolved animals, why should we do this? After all, we don’t judge other animals for their sexual behavior. The only reason men shouldn’t commit sexual assault or that any of us should refrain from anything regarded as wrong is because we’re not just animals. The only sustainable explanation for why right and wrong (and human rights) exist is because we have been made by God to be rational and moral beings. It’s also why the writer’s claim that men are programmed to dominate and to get as much sex as possible is wrong. Rather, men and women have been programmed by God to regard sex as the ultimate physical expression of the love between a man and a woman in marriage. I realize many will reject this and some will regard it as ridiculous. But what you can’t do is refute it or provide any other rationale for why we are moral beings. — Christopher Andrus, Dublin The #metoo uproar isn’t a political issue. It’s about our human consciousness as a whole. I come from a time when it was normal for men to not respect women. My dad would whine about women drivers. It was normal for boys to talk about girls in degrading ways. There is no excuse for sexual assault. As animals, we guys are programmed to dominate and to want as much sex as possible. Many mammal species organize around alpha males dominating and having harems of females. That programming is in all of us, me included. But I see my choices as having consequences that I am responsible for, which is why I act more as a man and not an animal. Humans are still evolving. The most powerful lessons we learn in life are typically the most painful, and that’s why this is hurting so many. — Russ Button, Alameda Keeping the Net neutral is one of the most important issues of our time. The Internet is a hotbed of innovation, a platform for free speech and an educational tool without peer. The people we speak with and the sites we visit online influence or reflect our way of thinking. Consider then how disastrous it would be to hand over control of this to corporations, whose first and foremost interest is profit — for people to be gated and herded towards content that perhaps supports the political views that benefit that corporation best. For businesses to be shut out of the global market because they weren’t big enough to stand up to an ISP. Or for a customer to be denied access to so many of the resources that currently arm our populace with knowledge, with skills. Keeping the Internet neutral is critical. Please write to your Congress people. — Julian Tam, Alameda Get Morning Report and other email newsletters"
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/26/las-vegas-gun-shows-route-91-shooting,"Two months after 58 people died and nearly 500 were injured in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, a pillar of tourism is wobbling – maybe Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.16 BST This weekend saw the return of the Great Las Vegas Gun Show, one of the first firearms shows in the city since it saw the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. On 1 October, Stephen Paddock holed up inside the Mandalay Bay hotel with nearly 50 weapons and more than 4,000 rounds of ammunition. Shooting down on the Route 91 Harvest festival, he killed 58 people and injured 489.  On Saturday, in an off-strip convention hall, vendors sold handguns, semi-automatic rifles and ammunition to locals and tourists. Displays advertised holsters, rifle cases, tactical gear and multi-colored grips. For women, there were bedazzled concealed-carry purses and petite, lightweight guns in Tiffany blue; for the kids, camouflage bags that read: “My first rifle”. But a black fabric partition cut the convention hall by a third, shrinking a room that in recent years has been filled to the brim. In terms of attendance, the Great Las Vegas Gun Show did not appear nearly as great. “This is actually smaller than it’s been,” said Robert Fares of Silver Bullet Concealment, a company based in the city. “Just a year ago, it stretched all the way down.” Las Vegas hosts gun shows at casinos and convention centers throughout the year. Several were canceled following the Route 91 shooting. One show, Crossroads of the West, would have occurred a few weeks after Paddock’s attack, in the same convention hall as this weekend’s show. After conversations between organizers and the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, it was cancelled out of respect to the dead. Mike Zolczer has a home-based company, Polyphonic Audio, which sells custom hearing protection. Following Route 91, he said, “business has been a dead crawl, because most of my money comes from gun shows”. Like Zolczer, Silver Bullet Concealment referred to a decline in business shortly after the mass shooting. It said sales were slowly returning to normal. Midwest Arms Collector, the organizer of the Great Las Vegas Gun Show, declined to release numbers on attendance, describing it as “average”. It did not associate any spike or decline in sales with the Route 91 shooting, instead citing an overall national decrease in gun sales since Donald Trump’s election victory. Some argue that gun sales decrease under Republican presidents because gun owners do not fear increased regulation. Still, the modest crowd at the first Vegas gun show in weeks did not reflect expectations on the busiest shopping weekend of the year. Discussion of Route 91, of Paddock, of good guys versus bad guys with guns – as well as a general distrust of media – could be heard throughout the hall. “You can identify as anything you want,” said Robert Fares, a vendor. “Just don’t make me pay for it, and don’t infringe your desires upon me. If I want to own a dozen high-capacity magazines, that’s my right.” On Saturday, many pursued that right. Vendors selling assault rifles drew a stream of attendees. Women waited as their boyfriends aimed rifles toward the ceiling, peering through scopes. Among the crowd were families with kids and strollers passing tables lined with tub after tub of clips and magazines. Handwritten signs displayed the number of rounds, from five to 40. What were not clearly advertised or on display were bump stocks, the device Paddock used to make his semi-automatic weapons fire more like automatic ones. In the aftermath of the shooting, political momentum seemed to gather to ban them. But in Congress, at least, that momentum has stalled. A string of gun shows are due to be staged in Nevada over the next two months, culminating at the end of January with the daddy of them all, the Shot Show, the world’s largest, which usually attracts more than 60,000 attendees. It will be housed in the Sands Expo Center on the Las Vegas Strip, three miles north of the Mandalay Bay. Convention sales constitute a major portion of Las Vegas tourism revenue, sales at gun and firearms shows prominent among them. Since 1 October, the city has been actively combating any suggestion that it is no longer safe. Billboards on the strip, city events and commercials blaze slogans: “Vegas Strong”, “Vegas Resilient”, “Vegas Together”. Two of the canceled October gun shows were to take place in casinos. How the return of such shows to resort properties will affect tourists remains to be seen. For over a month after the shooting, the Route 91 festival site remained largely intact, still displaying banners, signage and vendor equipment, as law enforcement slowly released items from the crime scene. At the Mandalay Bay, glass now covers the windows Paddock shot out. But they are a slightly different color from the panes around them. They stand out like a scar."
https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/11/26/double-barreled-bannon-he-targets-both-mississippi-gop-senators/23288345/," JACKSON, Miss. — One Senate seat here may not be enough for Steve Bannon. If the former White House strategist gets his way, Mississippi's two long-serving establishment Republican senators won't be in office by the start of the next Congress. In regular phone calls over the past several months, Bannon has urged state Sen. Chris McDaniel to challenge Sen. Roger Wicker in a primary next year, and he also wants Gov. Phil Bryant to send himself to Washington if Sen. Thad Cochran, who is 79 and in poor health, retires before his term ends in 2020, according to people familiar with Bannon's plans. ""We conservatives in the state, we're going to go after both of those seats — one way or the other,"" McDaniel told NBC News. The prospect of both Senate seats changing hands — and moving from establishment side of the GOP to the Tea Party column — makes Mississippi a key battlefield in the intensifying Republican civil war. For Bannon, who is recruiting a small army of ""populist nationalist"" congressional candidates, it's a chance to strike one or two blows against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and the Republican elites in Washington, whom he sees as an impediment to President Donald Trump's agenda. It will also be a crucial test of Bannon's strength, along with that of allied conservative groups, in the shadow of the Alabama Senate race. Roy Moore, Bannon's preferred candidate in Alabama, defeated appointed Sen. Luther Strange in a primary, only to find himself in a surprisingly competitive general election next month against Democrat Doug Jones because of allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls several decades ago. In the short run, Bannon, the Breitbart News chief and CEO of Trump's 2016 campaign, is focused on defeating incumbent Republicans as part of an effort to oust McConnell. The idea is that new senators will vote against McConnell for leader and then incumbent senators, fearful of primary challenges, will follow suit. ""Mitch McConnell is a literal anchor tied to the hips of folks like Roger Wicker and Thad Cochran,"" said Andy Surabian, a top adviser to Bannon. ""We expect the anti-establishment wave we are seeing across the country today to hit Mississippi like a tsunami in 2018 and beyond."" Over the longer haul, Bannon is hoping to take over the GOP with conservative candidates who can carry the torch of Trumpism long after the president is out of office. Trump, however, has promised Wicker that he'll be with the incumbent in Mississippi, according to a person familiar with their conversation, just as Trump has given similar assurances to GOP Sens. Deb Fischer of Nebraska and John Barrasso of Wyoming, who also are on Bannon's target list. Mississippi has shown that it's ripe for the kind of warfare Bannon likes to wage. In 2014, McDaniel, a hero of the Tea Party movement, outran Cochran, the godfather of the state GOP, in a three-way primary before losing to him in a run-off election. The race grew so ugly — establishment Republicans accused McDaniel of race-baiting, and McDaniel claimed the election had been ""stolen"" by the establishment — that it left both sides scarred and looking for retribution. Two lawsuits filed since that election underscore the degree to which there's still bad blood in Mississippi's political circles. In 2014, McDaniel filed suit in an unsuccessful effort to overturn the election result, and conservative activists developed a hashtag — #RememberMississippi — as a shorthand for their frustrations with the party establishment in Jackson and Washington. In June, three years after McDaniel supporter Mark Mayfield committed suicide amid charges stemming from the publication of images of Cochran's wife in a nursing home, Mayfield's wife and sons filed a wrongful death suit against several Mississippi officials described as part of the Cochran ""political machine."" Mayfield had been charged with conspiracy to exploit a vulnerable adultafter a blogger captured video of Rose Cochran, who suffered from dementia, as part of an effort to cast the senator, who later married a longtime aide, as disloyal to his ailing wife. Mayfield was accused of helping the blogger locate Rose Cochran; Thad Cochran denied having an affair with the aide who became his wife in 2015 after Rose Cochran died. McDaniel said he's made a decision about whether to run against Wicker but probably won't announce it until after the Alabama race on Dec. 12. The core of McDaniel's argument would be that Wicker, who has represented Mississippi in Congress since 1995, is one of the institutional insiders who aligns with McConnell and a Washington ""swamp"" culture that maintains the status quo. A Republican electorate that was upset with the establishment in 2014 has only grown more disenchanted as Trump's agenda has stalled in Congress, McDaniel said. McConnell has taken the brunt of that frustration. ""We sensed a lot of anger (in 2014) but it pales in comparison to what we're seeing now,"" McDaniel said. ""Mitch McConnell hasn't led in a conservative fashion. … He is a part of the problem. He's not standing and being articulate in defense of our principles."" Tea Party candidates like McDaniel have become adept at harnessing the increasing lack of trust among Republicans toward Washington, which in part fueled Trump's election. ""To the extent that trust is eroding, it creates this notion that people want the outsider,"" said Julie Wronski, a political science professor at the University of Mississippi. Wicker, who ran the Senate Republican campaign committee in the 2016 election cycle, has a lot of friends in national politics. But McDaniel has some big guns, too. In addition to Bannon, he has support from Robert Mercer, a hedge-fund titan and investor in Bannon's Breitbart News, who put $50,000 into a super PAC called Remember Mississippi earlier this year. And while Wicker has almost always supported Trump's agenda — deviating only to vote for sanctions on Iran, North Korea and Russia that the White House opposed, according to FiveThirtyEight.com — McDaniel's allies point out that his six-year voting score from the Conservative Review is just 30 percent. That figure reflects Wicker's support for spending bills and debt-limit increases that kept the government operating and prevented it from defaulting, positions that were at odds with hard-line conservatives. Regardless of Wicker's record in Washington, McDaniel is ready to make the case that he's lost touch with Mississippi Republicans' values. In 2015, after a race-fueled mass shooting in a Charleston, S.C., church, Wicker said the Mississippi state flag should be put in a museum because it features a Confederate emblem in its upper left-hand corner that is offensive to the state's African-American population. Attitudes toward the flag have been slowly changing over the years, with support for it dipping below 50 percent for the first time in an October pollthat had 49 percent of Mississippians in favor of keeping it and 41 percent supporting a change. But most whites, most Republicans and most Trump supporters in the state want to preserve the flag. McDaniel said it will ""absolutely"" be a big issue if he runs against Wicker. ""The people of the state believe in the protection of history, and that includes the flag and it includes statues,"" he said. Justin Brasell, Wicker's campaign manager, said his candidate isn’t going to get caught flat-footed. He's got $3.5 million in the bank, and he's ready to match his record against McDaniel's in the state Senate, Brasell said. For Wicker, that means touting his senior positions on the Armed Services Committee and the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee in the Senate, his efforts to build the Navy — important to shipbuilders on Mississippi's Gulf Coast — and his support for farm and highway bills that help the state economy, Brasell said. He played down the importance of the flag debate, noting that Wicker offered a ""personal opinion"" without trying to overturn the will of Mississippians. ""I don't think that's what primary voters are ultimately going to make their decision about in a U.S. Senate race,"" he said. McDaniel hasn't been able to move legislation in the Mississippi Senate since his race against Cochran, which one person familiar with the dynamics of the state Capitol attributes to the power wielded by Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, a Cochran ally who presides over the state Senate. Cochran's seat isn't up until 2020. If he resigned before then, Bryant would appoint a successor to the Senate and the state would hold a special election for the remainder of Cochran's term. Cochran's health problems have led to serious maneuvering around the state capital of Jackson. McDaniel, who said Cochran ought to be allowed to ""retire in dignity,"" would like an appointment. His supporters have pushed Bryant to pick him, but Bannon wants Bryant himself to take the seat. The governor, however, doesn't want to name either McDaniel or himself, according to a person close to him. His short list would likely include Reeves, the lieutenant governor, a political rival whose appeal is in his ability to defend the seat in a special election, and Rep. Gregg Harper, who is well-liked but untested at the statewide level. Either would surely face a challenge from the Tea Party ranks. But Bryant could also tap state Sen. Michael Watson, a Tea Party favorite and close McDaniel ally, who might scare off establishment challengers. From Bryant's perspective, it's not clear whether he's better off choosing from the ranks of the establishment or the Tea Party because both appear to be at nearly equal strength in the state and he doesn't want to pick someone who would go on to lose in a special election. McDaniel, who said he's also looking at a possible race for lieutenant governor as well as potentially running against Bryant's pick to fill the seat if Cochran resigns, casts himself as the vehicle for what he calls a ""great awakening"" among conservatives. ""I'm very much an advocate of this whole drain-the-swamp idea,"" he said. ""Washington has to be cleansed."" For Bannon, Mississippi may offer a rare opportunity to do that, two seats at a time.

http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-las-vegas-survivor-dies-hit-and-run-20171126-story.html,"Roy McClure had been gone for days. Calls to his phone had gone to voice mail, his wife wrote in a Thursday Facebook post asking people to let her know if anyone had seen her husband. Denise McClure learned on the same day that Roy was killed in a hit-and-run crash days earlier, on Nov. 17, seven weeks after he survived the Oct. 1 Las Vegas massacre. Roy McClure was in Pahrump in southern Nevada, about 60 miles west of Las Vegas, the day he was killed. He had a fight with a friend and took off about 2 a.m. and was not heard from since, Denise McClure wrote on Facebook. The crash occurred at Homestead Road and Highway 160 in Pahrump, NBC affiliate KSNV reported. A spokesman for the Nevada Highway Patrol did not immediately respond to a call and email from The Washington Post, but the agency told local media that McClure was walking illegally on the highway when the crash occurred. Roy McClure left behind not only his wife, but also two sisters, Denise McClure said. The Washington Post was not able to immediately reach McClure on Sunday, but she told KSNV that her husband had been attending therapy sessions since the Route 91 Harvest festival massacre. On that day in October, a gunman on the 32nd floor hotel suite of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino rained down bullets on thousands of concertgoers. The shooter, Stephen Paddock, was found later found dead inside the suite. Nearly 60 people were killed and hundreds were injured. The massacre is the deadliest mass shooting in the country's recent history. Denise McClure said she and her husband were at the concert. As they were escaping from bullets, Roy McClure stopped along the way to help people, she told KSNV. ""Those who knew him know he had his battles but also knew he had a big heart. He was a survivor of the Route 91 shooting, instead of running away he went back in. He helped transport people to the hospital. Roy also loved helping people and would literally give the shirt off his back,"" Denise McClure wrote on Facebook. Criminal charges are pending against the driver, KSNV reported. It's unclear why the driver fled or whether alcohol was involved. ""This isn't what I wanted for him,"" Denise McClure told the TV station. ""I don't understand why he wasn't taken at the shooting, but a month later he was taken this way. I hope my husband found peace and he's safe now."" A month before Roy McClure's death, a California couple who also survived the Las Vegas shooting died outside their Southern California home in Murrieta. Dennis and Lorraine Carver were killed in a fiery crash just before 11 p.m. on Oct. 16. Dennis Carver was trying to round a curve when the 2010 Mercedes-Benz sedan he was driving veered off the roadway and into a grassy area, said Officer William Strom, a traffic officer for the California Highway Patrol. The car crashed into a metal intercom speaker. Its back struck a brick column that was part of a fence; the impact ripped the car's rear axle and ruptured the gas tank, Strom said. The car struck another brick column, rolled onto its side and caught fire. Strom said the couple died immediately. Police do not suspect foul play. The couple, who lived part-time in Henderson, Nevada, just outside Las Vegas, left behind two daughters, ages 20 and 16. CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"

https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/11/26/man-who-survived-las-vegas-massacre-killed-on-nevada-highway/23288586/," (Reuters) - A Las Vegas man who survived the Oct. 1 mass shooting at an outdoor concert in his hometown was killed this month by a hit-and-run driver while hitchhiking on a Nevada highway, a local television station reported. Roy McClellan, 52, was killed on Nov. 17 while walking on a highway in Pahrump, about 60 miles west of Las Vegas, KSNV-TV reported. McClellan and his wife, Denise McClellan, survived the attack along the Las Vegas Strip by a gunman firing from a 32nd floor Mandalay Bay hotel room onto the crowd at a country music concert.

http://www.twincities.com/2017/11/26/black-friday-sets-record-for-gun-background-checks/,"GET BREAKING NEWS IN YOUR BROWSER. CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: The FBI received more than 200,000 requests for instant gun background checks Friday, nearly a 10 percent increase from the year before and a record for a single day. That’s not an anomaly. According to the FBI, the previous two records for background checks also were set on Black Fridays. The checks, required of anyone who buys a gun from a federally licensed dealer, are a rough indicator of firearm sales. While 203,086 background checks were requested Friday, the actual number of firearms sold is likely higher, USA Today reported, because multiple firearms can be included in one transaction by a single buyer. The growth in sales comes during a national discussion over gun regulations. On Wednesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions directed the FBI and ATF to look at potential problems in the National Instant Criminal Background Check system. Sessions wants the agencies to fix problems with how the military and other federal entities report convictions that could keep someone from having a gun. The database “is critically important to protecting the American public from firearms related violence,” Sessions wrote in his memo. “It is, however, only as reliable and robust as the information that federal, state, local and tribal government entities make available to it.” The directive comes after the U.S. Air Force conceded it had never submitted the domestic-abuse conviction of Devin P. Kelley to the NICS database. Kelley purchased a Ruger AR-556 rifle with a 30-round magazine and used it to mow down a church full of parishioners in Sutherland Springs, Texas, earlier this month. It was the largest mass shooting in Texas history.Related Articles

The Las Vegas sheriff said Stephen Paddock fired more than 1,100 rounds, according to the Associated Press. Investigators found 4,000 unused rounds in his hotel suite. Gun-safety advocates routinely push for greater restrictions on gun purchases after such shootings. “As my colleagues go to sleep tonight, they need to think about whether the political support of the gun industry is worth the blood that flows endlessly onto the floors of American churches, elementary schools, movie theaters, and city streets,” Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, said after the Texas shooting. And gun-rights advocates routinely take equally strong stances on the other side of the issue. After the Newtown, Connecticut, shooting that left six educators and 20 children dead, the National Rifle Association described then-President Barack Obama’s gun-violence reduction proposals as an effort to ban millions of guns. “The main goal of the gun banners in Congress is not to make schools safer, but to ban your guns and abolish every last sacred right you have under the Second Amendment … until they reduce your freedom to ashes,” the NRA said in an alert. But consumers with strong opinions on guns don’t have to wait for the debate to play out. They can just take their wallets to gun stores – and routinely after mass shootings, they do. As The Washington Post’s Sari Horwitz and Peter Finn reported, the U.S. experienced “a record run on military-style assault weapons” in 2013, especially in the months after the Newtown shootings. But this year, one mass shooting was different. Even the NRA said there should be additional regulations on devices like Paddock’s bump stocks. Investigators should “identify any additional measures that should be taken to prevent firearms from being obtained by prohibited persons” the association’s memo says.Related Articles

Nov. 26 (UPI) -- A Nevada man who survived the Las Vegas shooting was killed in a hit-and-run car accident one month later, according to reports. Roy McClellan, 52, was walking down a highway near his home in Pahrump, Nev. on Nov. 17 when a driver in a Chevrolet Camaro struck him an reportedly didn't stop.

""I feel that he was under the influence of something or drunk and didn't want to get caught, so he bailed and left my husband laying there in the street. He doesn't deserve that."" Denise and Roy McClellan were both at the Route 91 music festival in Las Vegas on Oct. 1 when a gunman fired onto the crowd from a room at the Mandalay Bay hotel and killed 59 people in what was the largest mass shooting in recent U.S. history.

http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-guns-black-friday-20171126-story.html,"For decades, the term ""Black Friday"" has conjured up distinct images: Turkey-stuffed consumers awake at insanely early hours of the morning, bursting into big-box stores to fight over flat screen TVs. But in a muzzle flash, it seems, a new image may be replacing that stereotype. It involves a trigger and, possibly, a scope. On Friday, the FBI received 203,086 requests for instant gun background checks, according to USA Today - nearly a 10 percent increase from the year before and a new record for background checks in a single day. That's not an anomaly. According to the FBI, the previous two records for background checks were also set on the day after the federal holiday in which Americans give thanks for the year's blessings. The FBI didn't provide any analysis behind the spike, but the biggest shopping day of the year may come at a moment of worry for people who fear someone from the government may knock on their door someday and confiscate their guns. On Wednesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions directed the FBI and ATF to look at potential problems in the National Instant Criminal Background Check system (NICS). Sessions wants the agencies to fix problems with how the military and other federal entities report convictions that could keep someone from having a gun. The database ""is critically important to protecting the American public from firearms related violence,"" Sessions wrote in his memo. ""It is, however, only as reliable and robust as the information that federal, state, local and tribal government entities make available to it."" The directive comes after the U.S. Air Force conceded it had never submitted the domestic-abuse conviction of Devin P. Kelley to the NICS database. Kelley purchased a Ruger AR-556 rifle with a 30-round magazine and used it to mow down a church full of parishioners in Sutherland Springs, Texas, earlier this month. It was the largest mass shooting in Texas history. And a month before that, a man using a ""bump stock"" to make his rifles fire at a much faster rate killed 58 people and injured hundreds more in Las Vegas. The Las Vegas sheriff said Stephen Paddock fired more than 1,100 rounds, according to the Associated Press. Investigators found 4,000 unused rounds in his hotel suite. Gun-safety advocates routinely push for greater restrictions on gun purchases after such shootings. ""As my colleagues go to sleep tonight, they need to think about whether the political support of the gun industry is worth the blood that flows endlessly onto the floors of American churches, elementary schools, movie theaters, and city streets,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, said after the Texas shooting. And gun-rights advocates routinely take equally strong stances on the other side of the issue. After the Newtown, Connecticut, shooting that left six educators and 20 children dead, the National Rifle Association described then-President Barack Obama's gun-violence reduction proposals as an effort to ban millions of guns. ""The main goal of the gun banners in Congress is not to make schools safer, but to ban your guns and abolish every last sacred right you have under the Second Amendment ... until they reduce your freedom to ashes,"" the NRA said in an alert. But consumers with strong opinions on guns don't have to wait for the debate to play out. They can just take their wallets to gun stores - and routinely after mass shootings, they do. As The Washington Post's Sari Horwitz and Peter Finn reported, the U.S. experienced ""a record run on military-style assault weapons"" in 2013, especially in the months after the Newtown shootings. But this year, one mass shooting was different. Even the NRA said there should be additional regulations on devices like Paddock's bump stocks. Investigators should ""identify any additional measures that should be taken to prevent firearms from being obtained by prohibited persons"" the association's memo says. Meanwhile, it appears the FBI will have to figure out how to deal with the onslaught of background checks. According to USA Today, the agency has ""struggled to keep pace with the volume of firearm transactions and still properly maintain the databases of criminal and mental health records necessary to determine whether buyers are eligible to purchase guns."" Last year, when it processed some 27.5 million background checks, it had bring in personnel from other units.

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fbi-black-friday-gun-background-checks_us_5a1bbccce4b0d4906cafb11b?section=us_us-news,"Senior Editor, HuffPost Black Friday seems to have set another retail record this year ― for guns. The FBI told USA Today that the agency received more than 200,000 requests for background checks tied to firearm purchases on Friday ― a single-day record that’s about 17,000 higher than last year. That makes three straight years of record high gun checks on Black Friday. This year, the FBI received 203,086 background check requests for gun purchases. In 2016, it received 185,713 requests on Black Friday, up from the previous record of 185,345 set on Black Friday in 2015. The 2015 record smashed the previous single-day mark set Dec. 21, 2012, exactly one week after the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre in Connecticut. Of the 10 highest days for firearms checks, four are from the week following Sandy Hook. Mass shootings in the U.S. are becoming more common and more deadly, with three of the worst mass shootings in modern U.S. history in the past 18 months. Two of the five deadliest mass shootings in modern U.S. history ― the Las Vegas massacre in October and Sutherland Springs, Texas, mass shooting in November ― occurred within 35 days of each other. As USA Today points out, the number of background checks requests do not measure actual gun sales, since it only requires one background check for a buyer to purchase multiple firearms in a single transaction. So, the number of guns sold on Black Friday is likely higher than the number of background check requests received by the FBI. Since sale numbers are not public, NPR reports that background check requests are the best available proxy to estimate gun sales. Senior Editor, HuffPost"

Filemon Vela (D-Texas) lashed out at President Donald Trump for using Friday’s deadly mass shooting at an Egyptian mosque to keep up his push for construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. “What an idiot,” Vela tweeted Sunday in response to a Washington Post piece analyzing Trump’s suggestion that a border wall would effectively stop Muslim extremists from entering the United States. RELATED: Top 25 words that come to mind for Trump: Quinnipiac poll Vela, an outspoken Trump critic, questioned whether the president “foolishly” believed such a wall could have prevented the 9/11 attacks, as well as the wave of mass shootings plaguing the country, including the ones in Las Vegas last month and at a Texas church earlier this month. What an idiot... Does @realDonaldTrump foolishly think a border wall would have prevented 9/11, Charleston, San Bernardino, Orlando, Las Vegas, and Sutherland Springs? — US Rep. Filemon Vela (@RepFilemonVela) November 26, 2017 Some details remain unclear over Friday’s attack in Egypt, which left at least 305 dead in the Sinai region. No group has claimed responsibility, though gunmen carried the black flag of the Islamic State during the attack. Trump almost immediately used the attack to peddle his border wall and tighter immigration policies. Will be calling the President of Egypt in a short while to discuss the tragic terrorist attack, with so much loss of life. We have to get TOUGHER AND SMARTER than ever before, and we will. Need the WALL, need the BAN! God bless the people of Egypt. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 24, 2017 Throughout his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump promised his supporters “a big, beautiful wall” if elected. But in the more than 10 months since taking office, Trump has failed to make any significant progress on it. RELATED: People who might run against Trump in 2020 There’s little evidence to suggest terrorists are crossing into the U.S. using the southwest border. Only “a handful” of people with ties to Islamic terrorist groups have ever been caught attempting to enter the U.S. from there, the Post reported Saturday. In most U.S. mass shootings, the gunmen are white, male U.S. citizens. This article originally appeared on HuffPost. This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/enough-with-the-death-raffles_us_5a1d6a84e4b071403b290358?section=us_contributor,"Author, anti-nuclear activist, and former covert CIA ops officer Co-President of New Mexicans to Prevent Gun Violence In the summer of 2016, we discovered that the United Way of Otero County, New Mexico was holding a firearms raffle that would put 108 firearms into this small rural community. The prize list included a sniper rifle designed to shoot a person from a mile away as well as an AR-15 assault weapon ― the weapon used in the Sandy Hook massacre. As board members of the United Way of Santa Fe County, we urged United Way World Wide to put a stop to this firearms raffle as well as to the 13 other such raffles occurring throughout the country under the United Way brand. In 2017, we were relieved to see that United Way World Wide changed their licensing agreement to specifically not allow firearm raffles under their brand name. Unhappy with this decision, United Way of Otero County separated from United Way World Wide and became Thrive in Southern New Mexico. In 2017-2018, they will begin raffling another 108 firearms including five AR-556/5.56 AR-15 assault weapons. Western True Value Hardware is helping sponsor the raffle. The AR-556 is the same firearm that the Texas shooter used in a mass shooting where 25 churchgoers were shot and killed, many of whom were children, in Sutherland Springs, Texas. The shooter spent some time in Otero County. This where he held a gun to his ex-wife’s head on four different occasions and attempted to smuggle firearms onto the Holloman Air Force Base. After the Las Vegas mass shooting, Thrive in Southern New Mexico suspended publicizing their raffle, acknowledging that it is difficult to advertise the sale of more firearms after mass shootings. “We are trying to push them [firearms] when we can. You kind of have to walk a fine line when these things happen,” says executive director Stephanie Hale. The AR-15 has become the weapon of choice for mass shooters. And there is one simple reason — lethality. The bullet exits the muzzle at a rate three times faster than that of an average handgun and does not go directly through the body, instead it pulverizes flesh and organs as it travels along its path of bodily destruction. The loss of blood in so many areas makes survival improbable. The retail value for an AR-556 is about $799.00. That is a lot of money in rural New Mexico. The winner can turn around and legally sell the gun on any street corner in New Mexico ― no questions asked. The reason — we do not have universal background checks for the sale of guns. Thrive in Southern New Mexico expects to raise $200,000 from the ticket sales of their “Ultimate Firearms Raffle.” The work that Thrive in Southern New Mexico does is truly admirable as seen in their financial support of local charities, such as youth groups and domestic violence prevention organizations. Yet, to support these groups through the distribution of 216 firearms on the streets of their community in the past two years is unconscionable and irresponsible. It is akin to selling cigarettes to raise money for lung cancer research. Their “Ultimate Firearms Raffle,” also reflects the radical and dangerous position of normalizing the proliferation of assault weapons and firearms in our society. New Mexico is a state riddled with gun violence. In 2016, 401 people were shot and killed in New Mexico; 85 of those were children. Hundreds were injured. The CEO of the local hospital in Otero County, Jim Heckert, is on the board of Thrive in Southern New Mexico. He knows the effects gun violence has on his community. The Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center that he heads has the only wound care unit in the area. Retired Police Chief Matt Flotte, who is also on the board, is well aware of how gun violence hurts a police force. He lost an officer during a shooting in 2016. Peer-reviewed studies show that more guns do not make communities safer; more gun availability equals more gun deaths. New Mexico is the 13th worst state in the country in terms of people killed by guns. Helping local charities is a noble cause. But, let’s not do this by putting more guns on our streets. Our suggestion... next year, how about raffling off free trips to Disneyland? It’s the “happiest place on earth” and there are no guns allowed.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/28/us-guns-mass-shootings-hoax-conspiracy-theories,"After mass shootings, survivors and victims’ families face a second round of attacks online – and fighting back is ‘like trying to kill roaches with a fly swatter’ Last modified on Wed 20 Feb 2019 16.08 GMT Mike Cronk was sitting half-naked on a street corner, hands covered in blood, when the TV news reporter approached. The 48-year-old, who had used his shirt to try to plug a bullet wound in his friend’s chest, recounted in a live interview how a young man he did not know had just died in his arms. Cronk’s story of surviving the worst mass shooting in modern US history went viral, but many people online weren’t calling him a hero. On YouTube, dozens of videos, viewed by hundreds of thousands of people, claimed Cronk was an actor hired to play the part of a victim in the Las Vegas mass shooting on 1 October.  Conspiracy theorists harassed him on Facebook, sending messages like “How much did they pay you?” and “How does it feel to be part of a hoax?” The claims multiplied and soon YouTube’s algorithm began actively promoting the conspiracy theory. Two months later, Cronk’s online reputation appears damaged beyond repair. Type “Mike Cronk” into Google and YouTube, and the sites automatically suggest searches for “actor” and “fake”, leading to popular videos claiming he and his wounded friend were performers and that the Mandalay Bay tragedy that killed 58 people never happened. “It’s awful that we have to go through what we did and then you have a whole new level of attacks on you and who you are,” said Cronk, a retired teacher. “I don’t want negative stuff associated with my name, but how do we stop that?” As record-breaking mass shootings have become a ritual of life in the US, survivors and victims’ families across the country have increasingly faced an onslaught of social media abuse and viral slander. Bullying from the ugliest corners of the internet overwhelms the grief-stricken as they struggle to cope with the greatest horror they’ve ever experienced. The cycles of hoaxer harassment are now as predictable as mass shootings. And yet those with the most power to stop the spread of conspiracy theories have done little to address victims’ cries for help. Alison Parker was a television reporter who was shot dead by a disturbed former colleague during a routine morning broadcast. Her father, Andy Parker, first encountered the conspiracy theorists who believed her murder was a hoax on his YouTube page. Before the shooting, he had uploaded a selection of videos appropriate for a 62-year-old Virginia dad: kayaking footage, recordings of Alison’s dance recital, old commercials in which he appeared as a young actor in New York. Afterwards, strangers online had seized on his decades-old acting career as proof that his daughter’s August 2015 shooting had been staged and that Andy Parker had supposedly been hired to act the role of a grieving father. Commenters said he was part of a plot to trick the public into supporting gun control. “It was like a swarm of locusts,” he recalled. Andy quickly made his page private – but the hoax theorists did not go away. This spring, nearly two years after Alison’s death, as Andy’s wife, Barbara, was searching online for something related to the foundation they had set up to honor their daughter’s memory, she found something else. “The second thing that opened up on Google was a YouTube video that the foundation is just a scam for Andy Parker to make money, a complete hoax.” “I don’t care what they say about me,” Andy said, “but leave the foundation alone. Leave my daughter alone.” It didn’t take much searching for the father to find other YouTube videos. “There were pages, endless pages of stuff.” Posts about Alison’s murder that analyzed footage and photographs, asking why there was no visible blood from her being shot. Others claimed Alison was still alive, that she had had plastic surgery to change her appearance and was now living in Israel. Hoaxers said Andy’s “acting” in TV interviews was subpar. One video of the choked-up father talking about Alison had a caption floating above his forehead: “No tears!” More recently, Cori Langdon, a Las Vegas taxi driver who picked up survivors of the October massacre, became one of the prime targets for conspiracy theorists after she posted video from the scene. Her footage was stolen and republished across the internet and used as “proof” of a number of debunked claims, including the rumor that there was a second shooter. Violent threats quickly filled Langdon’s inbox and populated the comment sections on YouTube and Facebook. People called her “queen of cunts” and “one of the dumbest fucking idiots”.Others said she was “braindead”, “FAKE AS FUCK” and “fucking stupid!”, with one writing: “They should bring this cab driver in for questioning.” “I was a basket case, it was so overwhelming,” she said, recounting the first week after the shooting. One conspiracy theory surrounding Langdon was that she had been killed after the massacre as part of a cover-up. She tried to make light of it, hoping that if the trolls believed she were dead, they would leave her alone. But she recalled one friend telling her: “Somebody might try to kill you, Cori, so they can prove their conspiracy theories.” Meanwhile, Braden Matejka, who survived a gunshot to the head in Vegas, received such a high volume of online attacks and death threats from people calling him an “actor” that he had to close his Facebook account. One message said: “I hope someone truly shoots you.” Lenny Pozner, whose six-year-old son, Noah, was killed in the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in December 2012, has faced some of the most vicious abuse and threats. This year, a woman was sentenced to prison for sending him violent threats, telling him on multiple occasions that death was coming “real soon”. Rob McIntosh, who survived a gunshot to the chest in Las Vegas, said he could not figure out the motives of anonymous users online accusing victims like him of lying: “I don’t know what the driving force behind people being like that is. I don’t understand.” There is no easy way to change the mind of a conspiracy theorist. Colleen Seifert, a University of Michigan psychology professor, said people were inclined to trust content they viewed on YouTube and might be drawn to mass shooting conspiracy theories simply because the tragedies were so implausible and frightening to them. “The idea that you could be innocently going to a concert and could be shot – you don’t want to believe that’s true. You’re protecting your own feeling of security and safety.” It’s unclear how much belief in conspiracy theories has changed over time. A study based on reader letters sent to two major newspapers between 1890 and 2010 found the percentage stayed flat. But in recent years, conspiracy theories have begun to spread at much faster rates online, and many different kinds of people believe them, said Jan-Willem van Prooijen, a psychologist at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. “It was always assumed that this is just a small group of lunatics,” he said. “We now know, because of representative samples in various countries, that this is really very widespread.” One recent survey suggested that more than half of Americans believe 9/11 conspiracy theories and that more than 40% support theories about alien encounters, global warming and John F Kennedy’s assassination. There is little research on the prevalence of the “crisis actor” theory – a belief that the government or other conspirators stage mass shootings – but the hoaxes now reliably populate social media within the first 24 hours of many shooting tragedies. “It’s typically very hard to discredit a conspiracy theory,” Van Prooijen said. “Anything people say that goes against a conspiracy theory can be seen as a sign that you are a part of the conspiracy theory.” When Langdon, the Vegas taxi driver, briefly took down her viral video from Facebook so she could remove identifying information about her passengers, some conspiracy theorists said it was proof that the FBI was trying to silence her and cover up the truth. “I’m a mainstream media gal. I don’t think the government is after me,” she said. “It just makes me sick.” It can be particularly upsetting to victims of conspiracy theories to discover that intelligent people – and even their own friends – believe hoaxes. Langdon said she learned that a mutual friend was duped by the fake news that she was murdered: “It made me realize, even in my own circle of friends and people I work with, there are people with some crazy imaginations.” Van Prooijen, a widely cited scholar on the subject, said one of his best friends was a conspiracy theorist. The professor hasn’t been able to change his views. Another reason it is so hard to challenge conspiracy theories is the threats and bullying that now arise from simply speaking up. One shooting victim who was subjected to an aggressive harassment campaign did not want to do an interview for fear of inviting further abuse. Journalists and academics are often spammed with hundreds of messages when they write about the subject. Some conspiracy theorists, however, change their tone when they are no longer writing to strangers on the internet. Amy Hallas, a 44-year-old Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, woman, sent dozens of Facebook messages to the family of Braden Matejka, the Vegas victim who survived a gunshot in the head, accusing them of being liars and demanding proof of his injuries. Criticizing a GoFundMe page the family promoted to help raise funds for Matejka during his recovery, she called the family “beyond fake”, saying the victim was guilty of the “worst acting” she had ever seen. In a phone call weeks later, Hallas claimed to the Guardian that she had never attacked the family and said she was just searching for answers. Reminded that she had posted a meme on the Facebook page of Matejka’s brother that called the shooting victim a “lying cunt”, she said she didn’t remember and must have been caught up in the moment. “I do feel bad. They are people, just like everybody else. Who am I to be calling anybody any kind of names?” she said. Asked if she regrets the attacks, she said: “I 100% do, and if I could apologize to them, I would.” Andy Parker, whose daughter was murdered on live television, said he was not interested in understanding the psychology of those claiming a hoax. He said he just wanted the videos off of YouTube. His first step was calling a customer service hotline for Google, which owns YouTube. A young man from Manila, he remembered, explained how he could flag the videos to be taken down. Parker began the work, but after marking about 10 videos, he said, he had to stop. There was footage of his daughter being killed all over the internet, but Parker had never wanted to see it himself. He had changed his YouTube settings so the videos would not automatically play, but even looking at their thumbnail images was too much. “I just couldn’t do it.” The situation made him angry. Couldn’t a company as powerful as Google, he thought, provide a better way to combat conspiracy theorist harassment than asking the father of a murdered journalist to clean up YouTube himself? The internet as we know it is founded on a simple legal principle: companies like YouTube and Twitter are not legally responsible for the content shared on their websites. But the tech corporations have been forced over the years to craft their own ethical standards, defining what kind of material is prohibited. Still, the companies have not shifted far from their core objectives of maximizing engagement – prompting users to share and consume high volumes of content and enabling the instantaneous purchasing of ads without scrutiny. The resulting algorithms are a perfect match for conspiracy theorists. Some grieving parents have turned the grim task of tracking down hoax theory videos into a daily job. In 2014, Pozner, whose child was killed in the Sandy Hook massacre, founded the Honr Network, an organization dedicated to holding conspiracy theorists accountable. Hundreds of volunteers now help monitor the offensive content online. With YouTube, Pozner uses different tools to argue that videos should be taken down: invasion of privacy, harassment and, in some cases, copyright infringement. Often, it feels like he’s arguing with a robot – one that makes arbitrary decisions. Sometimes, the flagging process gets results. Other times the videos remain. The whole system, Pozner said, was frustratingly opaque. “If I’ll report something for privacy, they’ll [sometimes] say: ‘We’ve decided not to take any action on this.’ Who do you appeal to, who do you contact, who do you pick up the phone and call?” Parker talked to Pozner about his work, and Honr began flagging the Alison Parker hoax videos. But the conversation only reinforced Parker’s frustration with Google. “I am so grateful to these folks that are doing this … but the problem is, to me, we shouldn’t have to be doing this piecemeal,” Parker said. “It’s like trying to kill roaches with a fly swatter. You kill a couple and a bunch of them come back. What we’re doing is demanding that they be responsible corporate citizens.” Parker said YouTube should pay a team of humans to proactively remove content: “The burden shouldn’t be on us to prove that this content is bad … They’re not acting like a human company.” Parker finally had a call with Google executives in October to discuss the problem, and he said he was now more optimistic that the company would work closely with the Honr network to address harassment. It’s true that it might not be a huge expense for Google to hire one person to deal with Sandy Hook and similar hoax theory videos, said David Karger, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer scientist, who researches online harassment. But, he said, “would they need to hire someone else to handle all the white supremacist harassment, and someone else to handle all the gender harassment? It’s an issue of scale.” YouTube, however, has no policy against conspiracy or hoax theory videos in general. In the wake of concerns from Parker and Pozner earlier this year, it clarified internally that hoax theory videos that targeted the victims or family members of public acts of violence would count as harassment, and could be taken down. “Our hearts go out to the families who have suffered these incredibly tragic losses,” a YouTube spokesperson said in an email. “We recognize the challenging issues raised by the victims’ families, and that is why we updated the application of our harassment policy last summer. As a result, we have removed hundreds of these videos as they have been flagged to us and we will continue to do so.” Cronk, the Vegas survivor and target of “crisis actor” hoaxes, said he tried to ignore the slander and attacks and focus on moving forward. He said he felt an obligation to live his life to the fullest, considering how lucky he was to survive. “I’m not going to let it define who I am,” he said. YouTube and Google, however, appear to have other plans for him. After the Guardian sent a number of videos targeting Cronk to company spokespeople, several were removed. Some of the worst ones, however, remained on the site. “They are a business. In my mind, if people can slander people and they are allowing this kind of stuff there … they should absolutely be held responsible,” Cronk said. One video that YouTube did not remove picks apart every comment and expression in one of his first television interviews as signs of his bad acting skills. In the video, titled “Las Vegas Hero Eyewitness or Actor???”, the narrator viciously mocks Cronk for appearing to smile in the interview. “Yeah, Mike Cronk, and I’m totally sure that’s your real name too, wink wink. It was so horrific, so horrific that you had to smirk and smile on camera as you duped us with delight,” the narrator shouts. “Huh, silly boy!” Despite multiple inquiries from the Guardian over several weeks, YouTube still suggests that Mike Cronk is a “crisis actor” in its search bar. The “Eyewitness or Actor?” video, viewed by more than 15,000 people, continues to be one of the top search results."
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/14/its-time-to-end-americas-gun-violence-epidemic-help-us-change-the-conversation,"The Guardian US’s series Break the Cycle challenges the orthodoxy that gun reform is a hopeless pursuit Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.16 BST Gun violence in America follows a ritualized playbook. Shootings happen, outrage is expressed, debate ensues, preventive measures are suggested. Then the backlash begins. And nothing happens. It’s clear that the cyclical way the media covers America’s gun violence is letting politicians off the hook. Within days of each massacre, the satellite trucks pack up, the headlines fade and the brief opening for a national conversation ends.  We seem to have reached a settled view about gun violence: the politics are too difficult; it is impossible to bring meaningful reform; and a mass shooting every few weeks is becoming normal. It’s time for a different approach. The Guardian US’s Break the Cycle series aims to change the way the media covers American gun violence – and to challenge the orthodoxy that gun reform is a hopeless pursuit. We are asking our readers to support the series by making a contribution. We want to take issue with the vested interests who distort the terms of the debate for their own benefit. We want to spotlight progress that has been made, and offer possible solutions. We recognise the challenges in changing the terms of the debate – but that is precisely the role of an organization like the Guardian. The series began with a story about 10 recent victories in gun violence prevention, as well as a profile of what it’s like for survivors of previous mass shootings to watch the coverage of a new one. To accept that America’s gun violence is an intractable problem is an insult the memory of all of those who have died from gun violence.Research suggests that while Americans support the second amendment right to bear arms, large majorities are also open to considering some measures of control. Partisan agendas are often out of step with shifts in public opinion that are happening on the ground. Our commitment is to report, over a sustained period, what works to prevent violence. Our coverage will be guided by research and evidence. It will acknowledge that there is much that is wrong with the polarised coverage – on both sides. Dismissing gun owners as paranoid or irrational is one of the fundamental errors of the current debate. If we want to save lives, we need to recognize that gun owners and gun rights advocates are important partners. But saving lives is not just a question of how to deal with the grotesque eruptions of mass shootings. More than 36,000 people die from gunshot wounds in America each year – and more than 20,000 of those are suicides. To drive change, we must also examine domestic violence, accidental killings, and the disproportionate burden of gun violence on communities of color. “This isn’t a guns situation,” the president said, after a gunman with a long history of violent behavior killed men, women, and children with a military-style rifle at a church on a Sunday morning in rural Texas. Except that it is. Gun violence is uniquely an American disease. The scale of gun ownership and deaths are unrivaled in any other developed country in the world. Millions of Americans want to do something about gun violence and we want to show them what’s possible, and what’s working. Caren Teves, mother of Alex, one of the victims of the Aurora movie theatre killings in 2012, says in our opening piece in this series that the sheer horror of mass shootings is a barrier to Americans endorsing political change. “A lot of people don’t want to grasp it, because it’s that awful.” But if, after mass shootings 20 years ago, “we all stood up and said, ‘enough is enough,’ Alex would still be alive. He’d still be here.” Politicians have taken to insisting after mass shootings that “now is not the time” to talk about reform. Tell that to Caren Teves. Help us break the cycle and change how we talk about gun violence in America."
http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/501088984/0/phoenix/nation~Air-Force-Lapse-in-Texas-mass-shooting-case-was-part-of-pattern/," WASHINGTON — The Air Force said Tuesday that its failure to report the criminal history of the former airman who massacred 26 people at a Texas church in early November was “not an isolated incident,” suggesting it was part of a pattern of reporting lapses. In a written statement on progress in its investigation, the Air Force blamed gaps in “training and compliance measures” for the lapse involving Devin P. Kelley, who had been convicted of assaulting his then-wife and stepson in 2012. The fingerprint card and the report on the outcome of his court martial were not submitted to the FBI by Air Force personnel at Kelley’s base in New Mexico. If reported, this information should have stopped him from buying weapons. Kelley was sentenced to 12 months in confinement and given a bad conduct discharge. He left the Air Force in 2014. The Air Force inspector general is undertaking an in-depth review of the service’s compliance with long-standing requirements to report certain criminal history information to the FBI for inclusion in databases used to conduct background checks of gun buyers. It is part of a broader Pentagon-wide review of compliance with these requirements. Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson has previously acknowledged that Kelley’s criminal history should have been reported to the FBI but was not. The Air Force has reported and corrected several dozen records since the review began and is reviewing approximately 60,000 cases involving serious offenses over the 15-year period to ensure full compliance. In its statement Tuesday, the Air Force said its review, which is not yet complete, found that the reporting failure in the Kelley case was by Office of Special Investigation officials and Air Force security force personnel at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. “The review also found the error in the Kelley case was not an isolated incident and similar reporting lapses occurred at other locations,” it said. “Although policies and procedures requiring reporting were in place, training and compliance measures were lacking.” The Air Force said it has made changes designed to prevent such failures in the future. For example, it is now requiring that leaders up the chain of command verify that criminal history reporting requirements have been met in every case. In the Kelley case, the failure to submit the required information to the FBI was not caught by higher-ups because no such verification was required. Additional training on these procedures is being conducted now. Also, the Office of Special Investigations will require physical verification, in the form of a printout or screenshot, from the FBI’s National Crime Information Center that it received and accurately entered the criminal history information in its database. Thus, the Air Force will verify that its information was received by the FBI, not just that it was sent. The Air Force is not alone is recognizing such reporting failures. The Army chief of staff, Gen. Mark Milley, said in recent days that his service failed in a “significant amount” of cases to alert the FBI to soldiers’ criminal history. “It’s not just an Air Force problem,” Milley said. “This is a problem across all the services where we have gaps in reporting criminal activity of people in service.” CONTRIBUTING: Jim Michaels"

http://people.com/crime/family-who-lost-8-relatives-in-texas-church-shooting-files-lawsuit-against-u-s-government/,"A couple who lost eight relatives in the Texas church massacre in Sutherland Springs has filed a civil lawsuit against the United States government, alleging the shooter should never have been able to purchase the guns he used to kill 26 people on Nov. 5. PEOPLE confirms the filing, which states the Air Force failed to enter the killer’s name in the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s database after he pleaded guilty to domestic assault five years ago. The shooter — 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley — served at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, working in logistics readiness. He was stationed there from 2010 until he was discharged in 2014, following a 2012 court-martial after admitting to assaulting his spouse and their child, an Air Force spokeswoman previously told PEOPLE. • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage? Click here to get breaking crime news, ongoing trial coverage and details of intriguing unsolved cases in the True Crime Newsletter. Joe “Papa Joe” Holcombe and his wife, Claryce, have filed the lawsuit against the U.S. government, claiming negligence. They lost their son, Bryan Holcombe, in the mass shooting. Also killed were Bryan’s wife, Karla, his son, Marc, and Marc’s toddler daughter, Noah, as well as Bryan’s daughter-in-law, Crystal, and three of Crystal’s kids from a prior marriage, Greg, Emily and Megan. The suit says that if the Air Force had entered the shooter’s name in the database, it would have prevented the shooter from obtaining firearms. “Under a 1996 law preventing spouse and child abusers from possessing firearms, the service’s Office of Special Investigations should have entered that conviction into an FBI database,” says the family’s lawyer, Rob Ammons, in a statement obtained by PEOPLE. • For more compelling True Crime coverage, follow our Crime magazine on Flipboard. “The office didn’t, the Air Force has admitted,” the statement continues. “What’s more, the acts Kelley pleaded guilty to — breaking his baby stepson’s skull and hitting and kicking his then-wife — were punishable by imprisonment of more than a year. That qualifies them as felonies, which must be entered into the database.” RELATED VIDEO: At Least 26 Dead, Including Children, After Shooter Opens Fire on Texas Church Service The suit does not specify damages being sought, but the statement from Ammons says the Holcombes “are committed to making sure no other family has to suffer such a devastating preventable loss.” According to the shooter’s 2012 court-martial plea bargain, obtained by PEOPLE, he had a charge for pointing an unloaded gun at his wife dismissed. The Air Force spokeswoman told PEOPLE the shooter received a bad conduct discharge and 12 months’ confinement as well as a reduction in rank. An Air Force spokeswoman tells PEOPLE the branch does not comment on pending litigation. "
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/28/us-air-force-gun-background-checks-texas-shooting,"Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.15 BST An investigation into the US air force’s failure to report criminal records to the nation’s gun background check system has already found “several dozen” records that should have been submitted and were not. The investigation comes after the mass shooting at a Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, which left 26 people dead. The day after the murder the air force announced that the shooter should have been barred from legal gun ownership because of a 2012 conviction for abusing his wife and stepson.  The air force had failed to submit the records of Devin Kelley’s domestic violence record to the national background check system, allowing Kelley to go on to purchase multiple guns, despite his history of violence, an air force spokesperson said. Nearly a month into an investigation of these reporting errors, the air force has announced that “the error in the Kelley case was not an isolated incident and similar reporting lapses occurred at other locations”. Air force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said on Tuesday: “Although policies and procedures requiring reporting were in place, training and compliance measures were lacking.” The United States, which recognizes gun ownership as a constitutional right, allows citizens to buy guns from licensed dealers after a quick check to make sure they have not been listed in the national database of Americans disqualified from legally owning guns. The failure to report the correct disqualifying criminal or mental health records to the background check system has been a systemic problem for years, with at least three high-profile mass shooters getting weapons legally because of a breakdown in reporting or locating records. The full scope of the air force’s failure to report domestic violence records and other disqualifying convictions to the gun-buying background check system is still unknown. The air force “is reviewing approximately 60,000 cases involving serious offenses over the 15-year period to ensure full compliance,” spokesman Mark Graff said. But he could not clarify if the “several dozen” records that had failed to be reported were found after reviewing just a few hundred cases, or many thousand. The investigation is “ongoing” and “will be completed over the next several months,” he said. The defense department is also investigating whether records from other branches of the military have been submitted appropriately. While federal agencies are already required by law to submit criminal records to the gun background check system, a bipartisan group of legislators has introduced new federal legislation to make sure that the US military follows the law, including introducing new requirements for public disclosure about record submissions, and financial penalties for officials whose agencies do not comply with the law. “The failures are so stark here, and the danger to the public is so stark, so I think there’s clearly a need for some dramatic action,” Lindsay Nichols, the federal policy director at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said when the legislation was introduced earlier this month. “If the air force failed to report somebody, and instead of resulting in the deaths of 26 people in a church, it resulted in the death of one person on the streets of Chicago, it probably would not have sparked the same national conversation,” she said. “I don’t know if we’d even know about it.” There are more than 11,000 firearm homicides each year in the US, according to official estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)."

http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2017/11/29/president-trumps-triple-feature-another-brutal-wake-up-call-for-muslims/,"Trending: Raza Ahmad awoke Wednesday morning, which takes a certain amount of courage when you’re a Muslim in Donald Trump’s dumbed-down America. Shock — the news was unsettling. “I think it’s one of the very bad things to wake up to,” said Ahmad, assistant director of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community in Silicon Valley. Related Articles

Trump had retweeted three insidious videos, all purporting to show Muslims engaging in cruel and gratuitously provocative behavior. We won’t be linking them here. But the titles speak for themselves: “Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!” “Muslim Destroys a Statue of Virgin Mary!” “Islamist mob pushes teenage boy off roof and beats him to death!” Coming soon: “Man who was once polite to a Muslim shoots puppies out of a cannon!” Trump’s triple feature landed with a thud. It was a win-win for the president in that it sent hordes of decent-minded citizens of the world into frothing fits of denunciations, expending energy that could have been better spent raging against the Grinchian tax bill oozing through Congress. The videos were the handiwork of British First, an extremist political group that could be Trump’s brother from another oligarch. Their aim, and Trump’s aim in sharing their videos, is to other-ize segments of society. Muslims are a favorite Trump target, as Ahmad is reminded every morning when he wakes up in a world in which a social media post can have serious widespread repercussions. “These tweets are deeply concerning and problematic,” Ahmad said. “The first (video) portrayed a Muslim boy fighting with a Dutch boy. They were both Dutch. That’s false information. In the second one, a Muslim person was shown breaking a statue of the Virgin Mary. The Holy Quran reveres Mary as the greatest woman who ever lived. The third is a tragic video of someone throwing a boy off a roof. “They risk the safety of millions of Muslims,” Ahmad said of the videos. “They also risk advancing white supremacy. Sentiment against Muslims is at an all-time high.” Trump clearly wields the biggest megaphone in any debate by virtue of his office. But Muslims are trying to push back with informational campaigns of their own. One, formed in the aftermath of the 2015 San Bernardino mass shooting, is called True Islam. “Through that campaign, we are educating,” said Ahmad, who emigrated from Pakistan and works in computer science for a research company. “We’ve had several campaigns for blood drives, one on 9/11 at Ground Zero. We’ve donated thousands of units of blood. We are doing humanitarian services. We’re working actively in the Houston floods.” They have Coffee, Cake & True Islam events across the country. They get to know the local school boards. They’re not above standing in “any busy public spot” with a sign reading, “I’m Muslim. Don’t be afraid to ask me anything.” “This is something that is in our interest as a nation and a country,” Ahmad said. “We want to be free to express our beliefs and our religion. This is the right time to do these things. If we don’t do it now, when will we do it?” Ahmad likes Silicon Valley and its diversity. “We haven’t faced any problems here,” he said. But he fears what might happen if the drumbeat of anti-Muslim sentiment causes people to lose hope and take matters into their own hands. “People in increasing numbers in our religion have been targeted,” he said. “It’s been shown very clearly that social injustice leads to radicalization. Today it’s Muslims. Who knows, it could be Jews tomorrow. If we start cleansing out other minorities, it could be a great threat to America.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters"

""We have never sought war with North Korea, and still today we do not seek it,"" ambassador Nikki Haley said at an emergency UN Security Council meeting. ""If war does come, it will be because of continued acts of aggression like we witnessed yesterday."" ""And if war comes, make no mistake, the North Korean regime will be utterly destroyed,"" Haley said. ""The nations of the world have it within their power to further isolate, diminish and, God willing, reverse the dangerous course of the North Korean regime."" RELATED: Nikki Haley through the years North Korea on Tuesday fired what appeared to be a new type of ICBM. North Korean state television claimed was a nuclear-capable missile that was ""significantly more"" powerful than missiles in previous tests, the Associated Press reported. It is the third ICBM test conducted by North Korea, which has also carried out six past nuclear tests. In all, the North Koreans have test-fired rockets 18 times since Donald Trump took office in January. U.S. military officials said that the missile tested Tuesday appears to be a new variant. Haley on Wednesday also called on all countries to cut off ties to North Korea, and pushed China to cease oil supply to the regime — saying, ""China can do this on its own, or we can take the oil situation into our own hands."" Related: North Korea missile went 10 times higher than space station Haley's comments about the destruction of North Korea’s regime in the event of war mirrors language used by President Trump earlier this year, when he warned that North Korea would ""be met with fire, fury and frankly power the likes of which this world has never seen before” if it continued to threaten the United States. Trump in his first address before the United Nations in September said ""The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea."" The U.N. Security Council in September approved new sanctions against Pyongyang as punishment for North Korean missile tests and that country's sixth nuclear test, which was carried out on Sept. 3. China, North Korea’s ally and main trading partner, in late Septemberannounced it would limit energy supplies to North Korea and stop buying its textiles. Related: Trump puts North Korea back on state sponsor of terrorism list China's deputy permanent representative to the UN, Wu Haitao, said Wednesday that China “expresses its great concern and opposition” over North Korea’s latest missile test, and called on the country to obey UN sanctions banning tests and cease provocations. He stressed the importance of reducing tension on the Korean peninsula through diplomatic and political means ""while emphasizing that people's livelihood and humanitarian assistance efforts in [North Korea] should not be negatively impacted."" Russia's representative to UN, Vassily Nebenzia, accused the United States and its allies of escalating tensions with Pyongyang through military maneuvers. ""We believe this time should have been used as a time to establish direct contacts with Pyongyang rather than further escalating tensions,"" Nebenzia said. Trump on Wednesday said on Twitter that he spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about the North Korean missile launch, and vowed: ""Additional major sanctions will be imposed on North Korea today.

http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/nov/30/nation-brief/,"Police kill gunman firing down on street RENO, Nev. — A gunman took a woman hostage and opened fire on a downtown Reno street from the eighth floor of a condominium, stirring fears of a massacre like the one in Las Vegas until he was fatally shot by police, authorities said Wednesday. The unidentified gunman, believed to be in his 20s, apparently knew the female hostage, who was not hurt. No one else was seriously injured in the Tuesday night incident. The gunfire came two months after the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, when 58 people were killed and hundreds of others were wounded when a gunman opened fire from the 32nd floor of a Las Vegas hotel-casino. But the streets in Reno were mostly empty on the cold weeknight when the gunfire began shortly before 7 p.m. Police Chief Jason Soto said Wednesday that there was no indication the gunman had planned the attack. “Preliminary information shows that this was an isolated incident and it does not appear that this was a pre-planned attack on our community,” Soto said in a statement. Jailed rancher declines release offer LAS VEGAS — A federal judge on Wednesday offered to release a rancher and states’ rights figure from custody during his trial on charges involving an armed standoff that stopped a government cattle roundup three years ago in Nevada. But Cliven Bundy refused to leave jail while others are still behind bars awaiting trial in the case. Bundy, 71, didn’t state his reason in court. But his wife, Carol Bundy, noted in a courthouse hallway that two other sons, Mel and David Bundy, are approaching two years in federal detention. “It’s not over. It’s not done,” she said. Defense attorney Bret Whipple told reporters that Cliven Bundy is a “very principled man.” The family patriarch could have joined son Ammon Bundy and co-defendant Ryan Payne in being freed during the trial. U.S. District Judge Gloria Navarro said they can be released today to house arrest with GPS monitoring at the homes of Bundy family friends. Navarro did not say why she reversed her previous detention ruling. Gun at job leads to serial-killing arrest TAMPA, Fla. — The suspect in a string of four slayings that terrorized a Tampa neighborhood was arrested after he took a loaded gun to his job at a McDonald’s and asked a co-worker to hold it, authorities said. McDonald’s workers reported the gun to police officer Randi Whitney, who was doing paperwork at the fast-food restaurant, setting off an investigation that linked Howell Emanuel Donaldson, 24, to the crimes, in part by using location data from his cellphone, authorities said. On Wednesday, Donaldson was charged with four counts of first-degree murder. The arrest overnight was a relief for Seminole Heights, a community on edge over an apparent serial killer who targeted three people near bus stops after dusk beginning Oct. 9. Police had earlier released black-and-white surveillance video of a man in a hoodie as a possible suspect, and by Halloween the fear was so great that police escorted children as they went trick-or-treating. The fourth killing happened this month. In addition to matching shell casings found at the shootings, authorities said location data from Donaldson’s cellphone put him at the scene of at least three of the killings. Donaldson did not live in the neighborhood where the shootings occurred and said he was unfamiliar with it. Russia-tied reporters barred at Capitol WASHINGTON — Broadcast reporters for Russian state-funded TV channel RT will no longer be able to report daily from the U.S. Capitol. The executive committee of the Congressional Radio and Television Correspondents’ Galleries, a group that governs Capitol Hill access for broadcast journalists, voted to withdraw RT’s credentials after the company complied earlier this month with a U.S. demand that it register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The law applies to people or companies disseminating information in the U.S. on behalf of foreign governments, political parties and other “foreign principals.” C-SPAN’s Craig Caplan, the chairman of that committee, wrote that gallery rules “state clearly that news credentials may not be issued to any applicant employed by ‘any foreign government or representative thereof.’” RT did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

http://www.ibtimes.com/piers-morgan-thinks-trump-owes-theresa-may-apology-endorsing-islamophobe-fascists-2621861,"British journalist Piers Morgan said late Wednesday that President Donald Trump ""owes"" U.K.'s Prime Minister Theresa May an apology and not a lecture for endorsing ""the most extreme bunch of Islamophobe fascists in Britain."" Morgan's tweet came hours after Trump attacked May for criticizing his retweets of anti-Muslim videos posted by the deputy leader of a British far-right group.   Trump is yet to respond to Morgan's comments, and the television personality said he hopes the president makes a ""U-turn,"" just the way he did when Morgan made a similar criticism about his lifting of a ban on importing elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia.  “Theresa@theresamay, don’t focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom. We are doing just fine!” Trump tweeted Wednesday evening in response to May calling him ""wrong"" for retweeting three videos about alleged Islamist violence. However, the “@theresamay” Twitter handle that Trump targeted did not belong to the British prime minister, but to a woman called Theresa Scrivener. Minutes later Trump deleted and reposted the tweet, this time with the correct handle. On Wednesday, Trump retweeted three videos posted by far-right group Britain First's deputy leader Jayda Fransen. One video claimed to show a Muslim man destroying a statue of the Virgin Mary, another showed a “Muslim migrant” beating up a “Dutch boy on crutches,” and a third seemed to show Muslim men pushing a boy off a building. “Britain First seeks to divide communities through their use of hateful narratives which peddle lies and stoke tensions. They cause anxiety to law-abiding people,"" a spokesman for the Downing Street said. “British people overwhelmingly reject the prejudiced rhetoric of the far right which is the antithesis of the values that this country represents - decency, tolerance and respect,"" he said, adding: “It is wrong for the President to have done this.” Trump's tweet triggered outrageous reactions in Britain, including from Brendan Cox, the husband of lawmaker Jo Cox who was murdered in 2016 by a far-right extremist. ""You have a mass shooting every single day in your country, your murder rate is many times that of the UK, your healthcare system is a disgrace, you can't pass anything through a Congress that you control. I would focus on that,"" Cox tweeted."

Sadiq Khan, mayor of the British capital, led calls to stop any official visit from President Trump after he reposted anti-Muslim videos from a far-right group in the U.K. Khan said that Trump had “used Twitter to promote a vile, extremist group that exists solely to sow division and hatred in our country” when he reposted videos from a leader of the party Britain First purporting to show Muslims attacking people. Trump’s support for the group, whose name was shouted before the assassination of a Labour lawmaker last year, renewed debate over a proposed visit from the commander-in-chief. “After this latest incident, it is increasingly clear that any official visit at all from President Trump to Britain would not be welcomed,” Khan said. Khan, the first Muslim mayor of a major Western city, has previously become a target for Trump and his son Donald Trump Jr., with the pair singling him out for criticism as London recovered from terrorist attacks. He added Thursday that “many Brits who love America and Americans will see this as a betrayal of the special relationship between our two countries.” Plans for the president to hop across the pond, where he is deeply unpopular have been continuously delayed but are expected to go forward next year. Reports last month said that a proposed State Visit that would include meeting with Queen Elizabeth II had been downgraded to a “working visit” with less ceremony. It is not clear how Trump’s trumpeting of Britain First’s Jayda Fransen, who has been convicted of harassing a Muslim woman and faces another charge over a threatening speech, will burn what is left of the bridge between the two countries. Fallout from the tweets reached all the way to 10 Downing Street, with Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May saying that Trump was wrong to have shone the spotlight on the far-right. Trump responded, originally by targeting a different Theresa May on Twitter before correcting himself, and said “don’t focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom. We are doing just fine!” Distaste at the American leader throwing his weight into British politics prompted defense of the prime minister even from her political opponents. Brendan Cox, whose Labour lawmaker wife Jo Cox was killed by an assassin shouting “Britain First” last year, rebuked Trump almost immediately after the tweets and added more criticism as his actions became a wedge between two allies. “You have a mass shooting every single day in your country, your murder rate is many times that of the UK, your healthcare system is a disgrace, you can’t pass anything through a congress that you control. I would focus on that,” he posted on Twitter Thursday. This content is not available due to your privacy preferences. This content is not available due to your privacy preferences."

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/487194348/0/usatoday-lifetopstories~Still-reeling-from-Las-Vegas-shooting-country-music-gathers-in-Nashville-to-heal/,"NASHVILLE — Roughly 120 people from Nashville’s country music community were on the ground at the Route 91 Harvest festival in Las Vegas on Oct. 1 when a gunman opened fire on the crowd during Jason Aldean's headlining set, according to an industry estimate. As they returned home, the music industry rallied around the artists, crew members and executives who survived the largest mass shooting in modern United States history, which left 58 dead and more than 600 wounded. The Nashville contingent escaped the gunfire physically unscathed, which Tatum Hauck Allsep, executive director of the Music Health Alliance, calls a miracle. But the emotional toll on Nashville’s survivors has been immense. In the ensuing weeks, there has been a massive need for trauma therapy, Allsep said. As the shooting unfolded, husbands texted wives what they believed were their parting words of love. Crew members saw carnage typically only witnessed by soldiers on the battlefield. More: CMA apologizes, lifts media restrictions at CMA Awards The response from Music Row has been substantial. Music and health care non-profit groups have combined their resources. Counseling centers provided trauma therapists. For those who could not pay or whose insurance doesn’t include therapy, money was raised to cover the bills. Now, as country music prepares for its biggest night — this week’s CMA Awards — the shooting also has presented a more existential challenge — one with which Music Row is still grappling. Country music has mastered the art of selling fans a good time. But the Las Vegas massacre has left a dark cloud over the parking lot party atmosphere. It's a good bet that the nationally televised show, hosted by country superstars Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley, will include a tribute to those killed and injured in Las Vegas. CMA Chief Executive Sarah Trahern said the show, while upbeat, will contain ""several poignant and memorable moments for us to reflect on the past year.” “Even though a month has passed, the shock of the tragedy in Vegas is still top of mind in our community,"" said Trahern. ""What many of our colleagues and fans experienced will long be remembered together as we try to understand and heal.” Shockwaves from the shooting continue to reverberate across the industry. Singer Justin Moore, for instance, hired a security guard for the first time in his career. ""It definitely feels different,"" he said. ""I told (my wife) for the last couple of years that it concerned me that we were sitting ducks on stage. If somebody were to have ill intentions, it wouldn't be that difficult. It sickens me that it came true, and not only did that come true, but it came true for the audience."" More: CMA warns media to avoid questions about Vegas shooting, gun rights or politics The country genre is unique in that with its own trade associations and its own award shows, it has become its own community. When members of that community are endangered, the family instinctively pulls tighter, said artist manager Martha Earls with EFG Management. ""There was no one in the country community who was not directly or indirectly impacted by the shooting in Vegas,"" she said. ""I also believe that strong bond of community is what will help us collectively heal from this tragedy and move forward even stronger.” In the days that followed the shooting, Nashville non-profit groups rallied together. MusiCares, Musicians On Call, the Music Health Alliance and Porter’s Call were among the groups that offered therapy or support for those affected. BMI hosted a gathering just a few days after the shooting that included a panel of specialists for those impacted. BMI executive Jody Williams said the goal was to immediately provide resources, especially therapy to whoever needed it. “They didn’t want to wait two weeks to do it. They wanted to go ahead and show the community their support,” Williams said. Allsep, leader of the Music Health Alliance, said the shooting impacted more than just those who were in attendance. Spouses have had an especially difficult time as their partners have returned to the road as artists continued their tours, Allsep said. More: Eric Church: 2 empty seats at Grand Ole Opry were for Las Vegas shooting victims High Valley's Curtis Rempel said his wife, Miranda, always worried when he left home to play shows, but now her fears have been amplified. High Valley played Route 91 Harvest before the shooting. ""It will take a long time for her,"" he said.  ""Now, she thinks about it all the time."" Ben Vaughn, president at Warner/Chappell Nashville, said the shooting has made an already closely knit country music community even closer. “We are a family,” Vaughn said of Nashville’s music industry. “We are not a bunch of companies that compete with each other at no cost. We definitely compete, but at the end of the day we’re family. At the end of the day, everybody pulls together and it’s not even a question. They just do.” And as the days have passed, the country music industry has returned to doing what it does best: making music. More: Las Vegas shooting: Country music world unites for their 'family' ""If you're going to be scared to go to a show because people get shot at shows, then you should be scared to go to church because people get shot in churches and you should definitely be scared to go to airports because people get shot in airports,"" said Brad Rempel, the other half of High Valley. Vaughn said he is already hearing music from Warner/Chappell writers inspired by the Las Vegas tragedy. It reminded him of the time after 9/11 when he was working with Alan Jackson and first heard his song Where Were You When the World Stopped Turning? Veronica Marmolejo works in the Nashville music industry handling corporate sponsorships and VIP packages for companies that underwrite tours. She was right outside the Route 91 festival gate when the shooting started. Marmolejo makes her living working at concerts and she wondered how difficult it would be to return to “work,” which are music venues across the country. Her first concert since the tragedy wasn’t for work, but to see her favorite band needtobreathe perform in Nashville. Marmolejo had debated whether to go. But music, she said, has served as a spiritual healer. She said she believes the country music community can help the nation process the Las Vegas shooting by simply continuing to put on concerts and create music, as it plans to do at Wednesday's award show. “I honestly believe that music heals,” she said. “Music is love.” Follow Nate Rau and Cindy Watts on Twitter: @tnnaterau and @CindyNWatts"

The couple, who met while being employed as EMTs by Care Ambulance Service in Orange, were on a date at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival in Las Vegas on Oct. 1. As the first shots rang out, Jackson was hit in the arm, and his girlfriend took shrapnel in the back. Jackson’s first instinct was to lay on top of Muttram to protect her.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/30/chronicling-homelessness-newsletter-outside-in-america,"Ed Gold has had several series published by the BBC, but he can’t afford a home – so he sleeps outside as he travels the globe for his work Last modified on Mon 17 Sep 2018 13.02 BST Ed Gold, a British photographer, is currently living in central Australia, in an Aboriginal community amid an expanse of heat-baked red earth and whirls of waving grass. But he is not spending much time photographing: instead he is keeping himself afloat by refueling cars and planes and working in a store. Despite having had numerous series published by the BBC on subjects ranging from the Afghan war to a day in the life of a Polish nurse, Gold, 48, is homeless and, much of the time, penniless. He has lived on the streets while working on shoots in Alaska, Vancouver and Haida Gwaii, an archipelago off British Columbia. When he’s back in the UK, he sleeps in doorways or in tents pitched behind his motorbike. The brutal economic realities of photojournalism leave him “in a situation where I’m poverty-stricken, but I’m not going to give up”, he said by phone recently.  As employers increasingly offer temporary contracts and minimal benefits instead of traditional full-time roles, the security of many occupations has been eroded. Labor experts define such jobs as “precarious employment”. Adjunct teaching positions are a prime example, as we revealed recently. Facing shrinking newsroom budgets and the devaluing of their profession, photojournalists like Gold are also confronted by difficulties. He knows he can’t go on like this forever. He has a heart murmur and says he’s almost a decade overdue for a heart valve replacement. “I’m already starting to feel the symptoms of it, which is increased tiredness” and severe double vision, he said. Sometimes mere subsistence is a struggle. “I never eat properly,” he said. Yet Gold thinks in grander terms. “How many other people are doing this?” he said. “I’m giving people a voice who don’t normally have a voice, and that’s what’s the most important thing to me.” Follow me on Twitter for our latest stories: @alastairgee.

In October, the Guardian film-maker Adithya Sambamurthy saw a side of Las Vegas that is unimaginable to those visiting the city’s spangled, cacophonous casinos. He ventured into the storm-drain tunnels beneath the city and met some of the 300 homeless people estimated to be living there, in the silent darkness. Sambamurthy was told a moving story that never made it into the film we ran recently. When the horrific mass shooting that claimed 58 lives near the Mandalay Bay hotel began, a Swat team went to an entrance to the tunnels. “They were just yelling: ‘Get up, get out or you’re gonna die,’” a man named Joel said. He and others were brought out into the daylight. It was like an “apocalypse”, he said. Another tunnel-dweller, Dan, was aboveground when the shooting started, and heard gunfire. “It was like it wasn’t even Vegas at that moment,” he said. Although the streets were blockaded, he managed to get back home – he knew a secret route, he said. “If you know the tunnel system, you can get around wherever you want to get to,” he confided. One of the most appalling aspects of homelessness in America is the refusal by cities to provide toilets for those living outside, forcing them to relieve themselves in circumstances that would be deemed intolerable in a refugee camp. As we’ve written, conditions on Skid Row in Los Angeles are some kind of nadir: at night there are only nine toilets for almost 2,000 people sleeping on the street. There, at least, a small shift is on the horizon. On Monday, the Skid Row Community Improvement Coalition is unveiling a cheery, temporary hygiene center with toilets and showers. Initially, it will only be open during the daytime, but in the near future it plans to expand to nights. “There is no negotiation when it comes to basic needs,” said an activist who is known in the community as Louise Mbella “Sinai” (Frenchy). “People may say: ‘Oh, this hygiene center will bring more homeless.’ Well, it doesn’t matter whether there are homeless or no homeless – it is our duty as a society to provide clean public toilets and showers to those who do not even have a roof over their head. That should not even be a debate.” Do you have an experience of homelessness to share with the Guardian? Get in touch"

Guy will honor victims of the Oct. 2017 Las Vegas shooting, and families who have lost an infant, on the field this weekend during the NFL's My Cause, My Cleats initiative. (AP Photo/Steven Senne)  Steven Senne FOXBOROUGH — New England Patriots defensive end Lawrence Guy is familiar with trials on the football field. During his seven-year NFL career, the 27-year-old bounced around four other teams before landing in New England as a free agent this offseason. But his football journey has also intersected with a pair of life-altering tragedies. Last year Guy was is his second full season with the Baltimore Ravens when he and his wife lost a baby to a miscarriage during the fifth month of pregnancy. Then, last month he was blindsided again by news that his hometown of Las Vegas was the site of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. On Sunday, Guy will honor the 59 killed and more than 500 injured in the Vegas attack during the NFL’s My Cause, My Cleats initiative. He’s also wearing a cleat for Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep, an organization that helped him and his wife heal from the loss of their unborn child. Guy is one of 14 Patriots who will be wearing specialized cleats in the second year of the NFL-wide event, aimed at highlighting the various organizations players want to bring awareness to. After the games, fans can bid on the one-of-a-kind cleats, with all proceeds going back to players’ various charities. Guy said the Vegas shooting still haunts him. “It hit home. I had family at the concert. I had family that were staying at the hotel that week,” he said. “It just hurts. ... You think about the families that are there enjoying themselves that got hit with the horrible news that night or that morning. It’s gonna constantly affect me, and affect the families that were involved in that.” The centerpiece of Guy’s Las Vegas cleat is a reimagined representation of the city’s iconic red, white and blue “Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas” sign. In the depiction Guy will be wearing on his right foot, “Welcome” has been replaced by “Unity.” The rest of the sign reads: “Forever Vegas Strong.” At the bottom is “10-1-17,” the date of the shooting. The left cleat he will be wearing is just as meaningful. Guy and his wife, Andrea, had been married less than a year when she became pregnant. Guy was in the middle of offseason workouts when she had just passed the five-month mark. That’s when she suffered a miscarriage. “We didn’t know about the organization at that time — we kept it silent. We were dealing with it our own way at home,” he recalled. “It’s one of those stigmas that you want to keep to yourself. You don’t want to share.” Connecting with Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep helped them see that they weren’t alone and that there was an outlet to help them cope. Guy and his wife have since gotten matching wrist tattoos of angel wings and halo for the daughter they named Estelle. “There are resources out there to help you heal from that process,” Guy said. As he trudges forward off the field, Guy is also making the most of his latest opportunity on it. Since signing a four-year $13.4 million deal this offseason, Guy has been one of the most consistent players on New England’s battered defensive line. He’s started 10 of 11 games this season, making 21 tackles. Coach Bill Belichick praised Guy after the Patriots’ win over Miami. Defensive coordinator Matt Patricia said he’s improved throughout the season. “He’s got great energy about him,” Patricia said. “He’s smart, he learns, he studies the game, he’s got a lot of insight, too, from a player that’s been able to do this for a couple years.” It’s why Guy said he’s never allowed himself to be too discouraged despite his multiple stops around the league. “Never that. You can’t give up on your dream,” he said. “There’s ups and downs in this business. ... I’m not that person that’s gonna give up. I put my mind to it and said I’m gonna continue to fight for what I believe in.” It’s also why Guy said he wouldn’t change anything about his personal journey — both tragedies and triumphs. “The person I am today is because of what I went through. I’d have been a whole different person if I didn’t go through it,” he said. “That’s one of those questions ‘Can you change things in your life that made you who you are?’ You can’t. Because you don’t know who you are until certain things happen. Things happened that made me who I am today and I’m grateful that I am the person I am.” NORTHAMPTON — On Friday, Smith College became the latest elite college to eliminate loans as part of its undergraduate financial aid packages...

Former Chicago Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo is set to hit the free agent market for the first time in his 11-year MLB career once the World Series concludes. No matter how good or bad your team is, you always want to see them beat their biggest rivals. This did not happen all too often in 2021 for the Chicago Cubs. McLeod, whose contract is up at the end of the month, “declined an offer to remain with the Cubs.” Just one week after the Chicago Cubs tabbed Carter Hawkins to be their next general manager, the team is reportedly on the verge of bringing in somebody who will be Hawkins' right-hand man. The Chicago Cubs have been very vocal about having money to spend this year, but they have not been very forthcoming with the plan of action. After introducing Until we see how the free agent market develops (which will be even more complicated than normal due to the expiring CBA and looming negotiations over February 18, 2004. We learned Greg Maddux was signing with the Chicago Cubs after spending the previous 11 years with the Atlanta Braves. Maddux was returning to the team he began his Hall of Fame career with, and to a fanbase that was devastated to see him leave after the 1992 season. Look. Maybe I’m wrong, but I don’t see the Chicago Cubs ponying up the $300+ million it’s going to take to lock up Carlos Correa or Corey Seager this winter. Going into the offseason the Chicago Cubs find themselves with a lot of work to do. With so many holes to fill and an owner who doesn’t seem keen on spending big this offseason, finding little ways to improve and add depth to the roster seems to be the plan. For all the recent talk coming from the Chicago Cubs about ‘spending intelligently’, there’s a corresponding report that can give us all at least a little bit of hope when it comes to the upcoming offseason and the possibility the team pursues some of the premier free agents. Kyle Schwarber became a fan favorite with the Chicago Cubs because of his heroics in the 2016 World Series and his monstrous home runs during his time in Chicago. It’s enough to drive you batty, trying to ferret out what baseball executives mean when they talk – and the Chicago Cubs brass is no exception. They don’t With the offseason drawing closer and the Chicago Cubs seemingly poised to be spenders, there are plenty of upgrades Jed Hoyer will be making in the coming months. Although the Chicago Cubs did not come even remotely close to making it to the dance after an emotional roller coaster of a season, their fingerprints are all over the MLB postseason. In a shocking turn of events, The New York Yankees announced early Tuesday they have extended manager Aaron Boone for three years, with a fourth year club option for 2025. Bush has been Chicago’s assistant GM since December 2006, and briefly served as the interim GM in between Jim Hendry’s firing in August 2011 and Theo Epstein’s hiring in the 2011-12 offseason. The holidays are here! And with shipping rates and times escalating, you need to start shopping for the Chicago Cubs fans in your life. If you’re like me, the sleigh bells are about to start ringing. While we all wish the Chicago Cubs were one marquee starting pitcher away from becoming a legitimate contender next year, that’s definitely not the case. Welcome to the future. Amidst the stress, emotions and drama surrounding the Chicago Cubs – there is a silver lining in all of it. That begins with understanding the breakdown of the organization’s minor league affiliates and the young talent hoping to be part of the next great Cubs team. In the midst of a wild October, the Chicago Cubs finally concluded their search for a new general manager, with Jed Hoyer hiring Carter Hawkins from Cleveland. If the Chicago Cubs choose not to spend this winter, it certainly isn’t because the funds aren’t available. Even if ownership balks at the idea at returning to pre-pandemic spending, Jed Hoyer will still have north of $100 million to spend this winter. Carter Hawkins was formally introduced as the Cubs' new general manager on Monday, stepping into a position that had been open since Jed Hoyer was promoted to president of baseball operations almost a year ago. Having gone out of his way to promise that the club will be active in free agency, Ricketts will surely push the front office to spend to some degree. Hawkins spent the last 14 seasons with Cleveland, including the last five as the assistant general manager. When the Chicago Cubs inked starting pitcher Kyle Hendricks to a four-year extension a couple of seasons ago, the organization thought it was locking up an elite starting pitcher. Conor McGregor threw out an amazingly horrible first pitch prior to the Chicago Cubs-Minnesota Twins game at Wrigley Field on Tuesday night, and he was trolled all over social media for the wild toss. Conor McGregor is going viral for the brutal ceremonial first pitch he threw out on Tuesday night. This apparently came about because of Evan Longoria, who taped the letter on as a joke and didn’t expect Belt to keep it on. The Boston Red Sox aren't the only MLB club dealing with COVID-19 issues as the start of the fall months approaches. Get the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams.

From inside a 32nd-floor suite at the Mandalay Bay Hotel, a male gunman fired below into the audience of the Route 91 Harvest Festival, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more before shooting himself dead. It marked the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Dion appeared in a video recorded in October at one of her concerts in Caesars Palace's Colosseum, saying, ""We dedicate tonight's show to all the victims and their families and to the first responders and to the doctors and nurses who are working around the clock to save lives. And to so many heroes who did whatever they could to help complete strangers at a time of desperate needs."" All proceeds from the concert are set to go to the Vegas Shooting Victims Fund. Dion had also donated the proceeds from her own show to the shooting survivors. The singer appears in a prerecorded videotaped message that paid tribute to the victims of the Oct. 1, 2017 shooting in Las Vegas. It was filmed at one of her concerts in the city that took place days after the tragedy. The group performed ""Motownphilly"" and an a capella version of ""It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday."" ""Today, more than ever, I am proud to be from this city. Music shows that there is nothing that should divide us. Tonight, we are one. We are Vegas Strong,"" the frontman told the crowd. The band played songs such as ""Whatever It Takes"" and ""Believer"" before initiating a moment of silence to honor the victims of the Oct. 1, 2017 Las Vegas shooting. At the end of their set, the crowd stood to sing along with ""On Top of the World"" and ""Radioactive."" The veteran Vegas performer introduces a videotaped appearance by Elton John. Artists from the Mystère show pose for a photo. The Las Vegas native and Washington Nationals 2015 National League MVP thanked the first responders and the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and hospital staff. In November, Dion had appeared in person at a smaller Vegas Strong Benefit Concert at the OMNIA Nightclub in Caesars Palace, where she joined DJ Steve Aoki to perform a special version of her hit ballad ""My Heart Will Go On."" Jason Aldean also appeared at Friday's Vegas Strong Benefit Concert via videotaped message. He told the crowd, ""Be louder than the bad guys,"" according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. He said he couldn't be there in person because his wife is due to give birth, the outlet reported. Brittany Aldean  welcomed their first child, a boy, that night. Aldean is one of the survivors of the shooting, which took place while the country star was performing onstage at the Route 91 Harvest music festival. Aldean was unhurt. At the Vegas Strong Benefit Concert on Friday, Imagine Dragons and The Killers performed onstage separately and also performed Elvis Presley's ""Viva Las Vegas"" together along with other acts, marking the first time the bands, who both formed in Las Vegas, have shared a stage. ""Today, more than ever, I am proud to be from this city,"" Imagine Dragons frontman Dan Reynolds said. ""Music shows that there is nothing that should divide us. Tonight, we are one. We are Vegas Strong."" The Killers performed ""Be Still"" while the names of the people killed in the shooting were displayed on the screen. The band closed the show with hits such as ""When You Were Young"" and ""Somebody Told Me."" ""There's enough love in this room tonight to light up Las Vegas,"" singer Brandon Flowers said. There were also live performances from the likes of Penn & Teller, David Copperfield, Blue Man Group, Cirque du Soleil and Boyz II Men, who told the crowd, ""This show is a testament to how strong Las Vegas really is."" ""It is best to use our talent to lift people's spirits and put a smile on their face,"" Wayne Newton said onstage, before introducing Elton John, who addressed the audience via video and performed ""Your Song"" and ""Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me,"" while the crowd joined in.

By John Woodrow Cox | Washington Post LAS VEGAS — The varsity cheerleaders had just finished practice when Natalia Baca stepped out into the school parking lot and spotted a tall, dark-haired teenager holding a bouquet of multicolored sunflowers. “Will you go to homecoming with me?” he said as she approached with her identical twin, Gianna, who had helped orchestrate the moment. Natalia pressed both hands against her cheeks and grinned, because no one had ever asked her to the dance before. “Yes,” Natalia answered, already imagining what she would look like in her open-back, iridescent white dress that flashed shades of pink and blue in the sunlight. They hugged and talked for a few minutes before she and Gianna had to go. The seniors, age 17, were running late for a country music concert. The Las Vegas sun had long faded beneath a distant mountain range on that first day in October, so the twins hurried back inside Faith Lutheran High to change clothes. Jason Aldean, Natalia’s favorite singer, was scheduled to perform the final set at that weekend’s Route 91 Harvest festival. Reading this on your phone?

It was a Sunday, a school night, so most people in the crowd of 22,000 would be adults, but some kids would be there, too, including 10 students from Faith, a private Christian academy in an affluent community of gated neighborhoods nine miles west of the Strip. And in that evening’s earliest moments, before the gunman high above them pulled the trigger, the twins and their classmates were eager for the week ahead — first the music, then the homecoming dress-up days, the silly lip-sync competition, the pep rally, the football game and, at last, on Saturday, the dance. About the time Natalia said yes in the parking lot, Faith juniors Shae Turner and Delaney Sylvester settled in 50 yards from the stage, right of the catwalk, on the side nearest Las Vegas Boulevard and the Mandalay Bay Resort. The morning before, Shae had posted a photo to Instagram from Friday night. In it, the two girls each posed with one hand positioned on a hip so their purple festival bracelets, that weekend’s status symbol, would be in view. The best friends, both in brown cowboy boots, stood with their backs to the neon-lit stage, eyes bright and smiles radiant. They’d each turned 17 just weeks before. Beneath the image, Shae wrote a caption: “country music makes us happy #route91.” For seven months, she had looked forward to this weekend. “Happy early Birthday present,” her mom had texted March 3 with an image of the ticket confirmation. “OMG I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!” Shae wrote back, with four heart emoji. “I’m freaking out… like on the verge of tears thank you!” The girls planned for weeks what they would wear to the festival and during homecoming week. Shae — the daughter of two FBI agents who had inherited her parents’ attention to detail – narrowed her Route 91 outfit options to seven before she texted photos to Delaney and they cut it down to three. They went to Forever 21 in a mall on the Strip to pick up yellow skirts and shirts for the school’s “Color Day” — “Nobody owns yellow,” Shae, the junior class treasurer, had unsuccessfully argued to her fellow student council members. At Delaney’s prodding, Shae picked a pair of four-inch floral Steve Madden heels for the dance that, by the time they headed to the register, she adored. For the festival weekend, Shae’s mom, Elena Turner, rented a room and stayed with the girls through Sunday morning at the Delano hotel, next to Mandalay Bay, so they wouldn’t have to drive home after each evening’s performances. In the lobby, before they headed to Route 91’s opening night, Elena gave them one last reminder. “If there’s an active shooter in the crowd,” she began, and Shae knew what came next. She’d been hearing that speech from her parents, who had met during their FBI training, for at least five years, ever since a movie theater massacre in Aurora, Colo., left 12 people dead. “Run until you can’t run,” Elena continued. “Hide until you can’t hide. Fight until you can’t fight.” Her daughter smiled. “Mom, don’t worry,” Shae said. “Everything will be fine.” Marie Langer’s mother, Susan, assumed everything would be fine, too. It was, after all, a country music festival, filled with people who’d come to take a break from their problems, not start any. Her daughter, also a Faith junior, had raved all weekend about how friendly the other concertgoers were. Determined to see Aldean up close, Marie had valeted her 2016 white Ford Mustang at Mandalay Bay at 2:30 that Sunday afternoon and walked over to the festival site a half-hour before the first band went on the main stage. She and a classmate, Summer Stadtlander, both 16, were so giddy that, on their way, they’d skipped together up Las Vegas Boulevard. Summer had texted Marie that morning, saying she’d just listened to “so much jason aldean and I’m so excited now.” “ME TOO,” Marie responded. Then: “IM EXCITED TO BE FRONT ROW.” Then: “AND TOUCH HIM.” Marie, an accomplished equestrian show jumper, had twice traveled to Europe and was a veteran of superstar concerts – Rihanna, Drake, Nicki Minaj – but something about Aldean’s simple, Georgia-bred twang always made her feel good. She had followed his tour schedule for two years, hoping to hear him in person, before her chance finally came that Sunday. The 15-acre venue was mostly empty when the girls arrived, giving them their choice of places to stand along a railing that lined the catwalk. “Should we go on the right side today?” Marie asked, but Summer suggested they stick with the left, near where the friends had stood both previous nights. They normally did homework on Sundays but wanted no distractions on this one. Before they got there, Marie had already finished her American Revolution reading guides and Summer her Algebra II assignment. At 4:50 p.m., Marie — whose fingernails were painted paisley and plaid, because that was the most country design she could think of — sent her mom a photo of a guitar pick she’d caught when a member of the Josh Abbott Band tossed it out. Not long after, a stagehand gave her a copy of Big & Rich’s set list. “Oh my gosh,” Marie shrieked, bouncing up and down. At 7:51, her mom texted to ask who was playing. “Waiting for Jake Owen then Jason aldean,” Marie responded. “Be safe. We luv u tons.” “Luv u.” At 9:30, her mom sent a final message: “Call house phone uf emergency. Cell phone going off.” Then the lights went dark and the crowd roared as Marie pointed her phone’s camera to record Aldean’s entrance. His introduction video, a collage of mud, pickups and cowboy hats, appeared on a massive screen behind the stage. “The suspense right now is insane,” Marie told a girl standing next to her. In the crowd behind them, about 30 yards back and to the right, Natalia felt the same. She’d gotten a ticket for Sunday just hours earlier, delighting her not only because of Aldean but because Gianna would be there, too. She and her twin did almost everything together. It had been that way from the beginning, when the girls were born eight weeks premature and began their lives fighting to keep them. They’d never spent more than 48 hours apart. Now the sisters were sharing the first music festival they’d gone to without a parent, and Aldean was on stage, crooning about people tougher than they look. “They ain’t seen the blood, sweat and tears it took to live their dreams,” Natalia sang along as she danced with friends, and Gianna, a dozen feet away, did the same with her boyfriend. About 15 minutes into the set, a few others in their group told Natalia that they were heading to the bathrooms, in the back of the venue, and asked if she needed to go, too. She did, but refused to miss a single song. “I’ll just wait,” she said. “It’s okay.” She stayed, swaying and laughing until 10:05 p.m., when the sound of pops from somewhere faraway cut through the music. “Did you hear that?” she asked a friend. Maybe, she thought, someone had set off fireworks. Natalia peered up above the stage and into the night sky, searching for bursts of light. All she saw was darkness. — “Get down!” someone in the crowd shouted as Natalia watched Aldean rush offstage amid a second barrage. She dropped to her knees and covered her head. A friend, Kaitlyn Burton, 19, huddled alongside, clutching Natalia’s hands. “What’s happening?” Natalia asked, unaware that, just in front of where she was hunkered, a half dozen people had already collapsed to the turf, struck by bullets fired from Mandalay Bay’s 32nd floor, 400 yards away. Natalia looked up, trembling as she searched for Gianna in the chaotic,howling mass of bodies crouched and crawling around her. Her twin was nowhere in sight. “God, please help us,” she prayed, but now the wails grew louder, and the crackle drew closer. Then, suddenly, what felt like a steel medicine ball slammed into her right shoulder blade, striking with such force that she was shoved to the left, losing her grip on Kaitlyn’s hand. Natalia’s back stung, as though it had been lit ablaze. “Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!” she cried. The impact jolted her friend, too. Even before Kaitlyn saw the blood, she knew what that meant. “Natalia’s been shot,” she yelled at her boyfriend, Riley Van Buskirk, who until then had remained standing, frozen in shock. He stared down at the hole in Natalia’s back, then stripped off his long-sleeved denim Wrangler shirt and wrapped it diagonally around her chest and back, hoping it would apply enough pressure to slow the bleeding. As he helped her up, Riley felt the cracked bones along Natalia’s shoulders grind against each other. He feared what the bullet had done inside her. Overwhelmed, Natalia couldn’t process what was happening — the words that Kaitlyn had spoken or the burn now spreading from her back to her chest. And as she staggered to her feet, Natalia still didn’t see Gianna. Had her twin been shot, too? Then came more gunfire. “Run!” Kaitlyn hollered. At that moment, Shae, the daughter of the FBI agents, was already sprinting with her friend Delaney toward a row of outdoor beer vendors. When they reached them, the girls dove to the ground, cowering just beneath a purple billboard that overlooked Las Vegas Boulevard. “LIVE MUSIC,” it advertised, with an arrow pointing back toward the ongoing massacre behind them. Shae, who suspected it was gunfire as soon as she heard it, had immediately grabbed her friend’s arm and begun pushing through the crowd. She decided that fleeing toward the venue’s rear or east-side exits, along with thousands of other people, would leave the girls too exposed. Instead, Shae headed toward the nearest cover on the venue’s western edge. Now, with bullets spraying overhead, they were trapped. Shae pressed her cellphone against her ear. “Mom,” she said, “someone is shooting into the crowd.” “Are you sure?” asked Elena, who was in her bedroom, about to go to sleep. “Yes, I’m sure.” Then, what sounded to Elena’s trained ear like machine-gun fire exploded through the phone’s speaker. Stay calm, her mom told her. Stay calm. Elena, voice quavering, asked whether they could make it to Shae’s car, parked over the fence and across the street at Mandalay Bay. No, Shae said, because she thought the shots might be coming from that direction. The girls knew they had to make a choice: Stay put and risk a gunman finding them, or move and risk being sniped out in the open. Hands clutched, each promised to stay with the other, before Delaney, in a pause between salvos, suggested they keep going. The beer vendors were arranged in a semicircle that jutted out into the venue, so between bursts, they crept farther along, terrified of running into the end of a barrel around every bend. When they reached the far side, the girls realized that they were, again, trapped. A gate along the fence in front of them remained shut, and behind them, in the festival’s center, was nothing but uncovered space. “We can’t get out,” Shae told her mom. “There’s no exit.” Another blast of gunshots erupted. They looked for somewhere to hide, but this time, the space beneath the nearest canopy was already full. They couldn’t get in. The girls were exposed. “What do we even do?” asked Delaney, who’d begun to cry. Like our Facebook page for more conversation and news coverage from the Bay Area and beyond. It was then that a bald man who looked to be in his late 40s scrambled over, blanketing their bodies with his own. “Stay down,” the stranger said, as he placed his hand on Delaney’s head, pressing the American flag on her camouflage baseball cap against the pavement. And when that volley had subsided and the man had left, Delaney glanced back toward the fence. “Shae,” she said, “a gate opened up.” Up next to the stage, Marie and Summer, the other pair of Faith juniors, stood from where they’d ducked behind the catwalk, opposite Mandalay Bay, and darted toward an east exit. The girls, who’d both taken videos of the chaos by then, didn’t understand the moment’s gravity until they saw — sprawled across a bloodied landscape of plastic cups, crushed beer cans and trampled cowboy hats — the wounded and the dead. Marie’s eyes stayed on her cellphone as they rushed past. She didn’t have her home number saved, and as she tried to dial it, her hands wouldn’t stop shaking. “Marie, what’s wrong?” answered her mother, Susan. “There’s a shooting. There’s a shooting. Shooter, shooter,” she blurted, barely able to pronounce the words. “You have to stop. What are you saying?” Susan asked. Still on the phone with her mom, she and Summer escaped the venue and hurried across Giles Street, where they reached the edge of a church parking lot enclosed by a seven-foot-high wrought-iron fence. “What do we do?” the 16-year-olds askeda pair of police officers on the other side, strapping on what looked like riot gear. “You need to get over here right now,” one of them said. Marie set her phone down on the fence’s brick base, then put her cowboy boot on the edge and hiked up her floor-length lime-green dress. She and Summer gripped the metal bars and pulled themselves up and over, bruising the backs of their legs on spikes that lined the top. The girls leapt into the parking lot. Marie reached back for her cell. “My phone’s at 4 percent,” she told her mom. “I have to go.” Across the road, on the festival grounds, Riley and Kaitlyn had just helped Natalia into a white medical tent where the injured were being brought for treatment. She slumped onto a plastic chair. A passing medic asked how she was doing. OK, Natalia said, even though she wasn’t. For years, the teenager had wanted to be a nurse, to help people who were worse off than she was. And there they were, screaming and staggering all around her. Go to the others, she told the medic. A man sitting next to Natalia was pressing his palms together, as if in prayer, because the fingers on one of his hands had been blown off. She recognized a guy she’d known for years lying on a cot nearby. He’d been shot in the stomach. “I need help,” he said, and Riley called out for it, but no one came, because everyone needed help. On the pavement, where blood had begun to pool, Natalia saw a man to her right with a bullet wound on the back of his neck. She watched a small group crowd around him, pressing over and over on his chest. He didn’t move. “We lost him,” she heard someone say, and they left him alone. Now Natalia began to feel lightheaded, and Kaitlyn noticed her lips turning purple. “You need to stay with me,” her friend said. A medic suggested Natalia might need sugar. Riley grabbed her a Coke, and she sipped on it, struggling to keep her eyes open. Then the police arrived and, with the tent filling, they ordered anyone who wasn’t hurt to leave. Before she did, Kaitlyn leaned down, pressed both hands against her friend’s face and reminded Natalia of her twin. “Think about Gianna,” she pleaded. “She’s been with you her entire life. She couldn’t do anything without you.” The gunfire sounded louder – closer – than before, and now Marie was trembling, sobbing, hyperventilating. She and Summer had inched down the fence line and taken refuge with six or seven others behind a dark Ford pickup near the church parking lot’s entrance. The police continued to order people in their direction, north up Giles Street, which left both girls convinced that a gunman was on foot, making his way toward them. A short, blond woman held them both in her arms, trying to calm Marie. “What’s your name?” she asked. “Where do you go to school?” Marie, though, could barely speak. Out in the road, pickup after pickup pulled up as victims were piled into the beds. “Where’s the nearest hospital?” the girls heard people yell. The injured who didn’t reach the trucks were brought to paramedics gathering behind the 16-year-olds in the parking lot. “Honey, don’t look over there,” the woman told them. “Don’t do that to yourself.” A group brought over another woman, who was wearing only pants and a blood-soaked bra. Her face ashen, she didn’t say a word. “Her husband was shot,” one of the men explained. The relentless sights of carnage only intensified Marie’s fear that here, huddled behind a truck, her life could end. She peered back down the road, still waiting for a man with a rifle to appear in the night. One block west, in the pyramid-shaped Luxor on the other side of the festival grounds, Shae and Delaney hid in a bathroom, worried about the same thing. Shae’s parents were in their car, speeding toward the Strip, but they had remained on the phone with her. Their siren blaring in the background, she could hear them coordinating with other investigators already responding to the rampage. “If it’s a male shooter, he’s not going to go into the women’s restroom,” Shae’s dad had told her, so when they raced into the Luxor, the girls found one on the first floor and locked themselves in a handicapped stall. Shae sat with her back against the wall, leaning down to watch the door. A woman burst through, shrieking. Shae’s heart pounded. Had someone chased the woman there? Was the shooter in the hotel? She waited, hoping a man’s feet wouldn’t follow. None did, but she feared that the woman’s hysterics could draw a gunman’s attention. “Should I try to calm her down?” she asked her dad. “You can try,” he said. Shae opened the stall door and told the woman, who had been separated from a sister and a friend, that her parents worked for the FBI. The best thing for all of them to do, Shae said, was to stay calm. The woman stopped screaming. “It’s going to be okay,” Shae said, and the teenager hoped that was true. Back in the white tent, a medic, hands quivering, struggled unsuccessfully to insert an IV into Natalia’s right arm. Her friends were gone, but still lingering in her mind were Kaitlyn’s last words about Gianna, her missing twin. The girls looked so much alike that, for years, most people could only tell them apart by the scar on Natalia’s knee from a bicycle accident. “Mirror images,” their parents called them, because Natalia was right-handed and Gianna was left-handed. Her sister had to be all right, Natalia thought. She had to be. Then a man in shorts, a white T-shirt and a reversed baseball cap walked up. Dean McAuley, a 46-year-old firefighter down from Washington state for the festival, had just helped carry a young woman about Natalia’s age into the tent, but the pulse he’d detected when he found her on the ground had already disappeared. McAuley couldn’t bring her back. Maybe, though, he could do something for Natalia. He took a torn piece of blue shirt and tied it around her forearm, revealing a vein for the IV. He asked where she’d been shot. On her back shoulder, she told him. McAuley searched for an exit wound but couldn’t find one. His stomach knotted. The risk of severe internal bleeding, McAuley knew, was enormous. He checked her heartbeat and felt it racing. Her body was compensating for the shock, he suspected, but what would happen when that wore off? Ten minutes – that’s how long McAuley thought he had to save her life. “I’ll be right back,” he said. “Keep your eyes on me.” The firefighter found someone coordinating care in the tent. Just outside, McAuley was told, ambulances had gathered to take people to the hospital. He returned to Natalia and asked if she could stand. Yes, she said. He held her hand with one of his and her IV bag with the other. “There will be an ambulance waiting for us,” he told Natalia. When they got outside, none remained. The sound of gunshots had subsided by then, but McAuley could still hear frantic chatter blaring over first responders’ radios. “Active shooter.” “Multiple shooters.” He helped Natalia shuffle across Giles Street and into the same parking lot where Marie and Summer were sheltering. McAuley lowered her onto a lawn chair behind a white SUV. “What can I do for you?” he asked, taking a knee in front of her. “I want to call my parents,” Natalia said. He dialed. Her dad, Mike Baca, picked up. McAuley explained who he was and that he was with his daughter, who had been shot. “Is she alive?” Mike asked. McAuley gave her the phone. She said she couldn’t feel her legs. “Just breathe,” Mike told her, before he and his wife headed for their car. After hanging up, McAuley saw an older man jogging toward an Audi parked behind them. Reluctantly, he agreed to take them to a hospital. McAuley helped Natalia inside. He ordered the driver to turn on his hazard lights, find an ambulance and chase it. The man did, blowing through red lights along the way. In the back seat, Natalia told McAuley that her left arm had gone numb. She was struggling to breathe. “Do you have dogs?” he asked. Natalia said she had two, Kosmo and Vdara, both Boston terriers. He took out his phone and showed her a picture of Molly, his 100-pound Great Pyrenees. McAuley’s other hand moved to her wrist. At any second, he knew, Natalia’s pulse could plummet. He scrolled through photos of his wife and 5-year-old son. “You have a beautiful family,” she said. He asked about hers. Did she have any siblings? A twin, she said, who’d also been at the concert. “Do you know where she is?” “No,” Natalia said. At last, they pulled up to Sunrise Hospital. McAuley found a wheelchair and eased her into it, and then began pushing it up a driveway toward the trauma bay. They could already hear the moans. “Close your eyes,” he told her. “Don’t look around.” Natalia stared down, and on the ground she saw an American flag bandanna, spotted with blood. Nearing the brightly lit entrance, Natalia raised her head. She saw doctors and nurses desperately trying to triage maimed, wailing arrivals being unloaded along the curb. She saw bodies in the beds of pickup trucks. “Please help,” came the cries. “Please help.” McAuley wheeled her past the sliding doors and through a wide corridor that staff members later called “the sea of blood.” She’d been shot in the back, McAuley explained to a nurse. She had no exit wound, he said, but appeared to be stable, at least for now. He looked at Natalia. “You’ll be fine,” McAuley said. “I’ll see you later.” She forced a smile. “Thank you,” she told him, before the firefighter ran back outside to help others. A nurse changed her IV and wrote something in marker – vital signs, she thought – on her forehead. “It’s really hard to breathe,” she said, but in a hospital that would treat 199 patients from the festival that night, nobody had time to care for her yet. One victim after another sped by atop gurneys, their wheels streaking a tile floor that had transformed from beige to red. The air smelled of iron. “Watch out. Watch out,” she heard. “Cardiac arrest,” she heard. Natalia thought about her sister. It was in this hospital where their lives had begun. Where Gianna had been born first, crying, and Natalia had come out a minute later, making no noise at all. Where the doctors had been forced to resuscitate her because she wasn’t breathing. Where the girls had gone home, together, after just four days in recovery, stronger than anyone expected. Natalia closed her eyes. “Talia!” she heard a voice call. She looked up, and there, atop another gurney, was her twin. “What happened?” asked Gianna, her left thigh bleeding from a bullet that had passed straight through it. Natalia motioned to her shoulder. “I love you,” Gianna said. “I love you,” her sister responded. — The Monday morning sunlight leaked through the shades and into hospital room 272, where Natalia had spent the night in intensive care. A brace was wrapped around her neck, and on her face, a clear tube fed oxygen into both nostrils. Hours earlier, another tube that drained air and blood seeping from her punctured lung had been shoved between two ribs as Natalia, screaming, clenched a nurse’s hand. The bullet, she would learn, had traveled the distance of four football fields, pierced her right shoulder blade and fragmented. Slivers of metal had scattered throughout her chest cavity, slitting the lung, but missing her arteries, her trachea, her heart. A larger chunk of shrapnel, however, had veered to the left after impact, burrowing beneath her skin and over her spine before it struck Natalia’s opposite shoulder blade, fracturing that one, too. A change in the bullet’s trajectory of just centimeters might have killed her, but here she was with her sister, who was lying on a recliner nearby, gauze wrapped around her left thigh. Now Natalia just wanted to sleep, so she closed her eyes. Then came a sound so clear in her mind that, for a moment, she swore it had to be real: gunshots. Before he killed himself in Room 32135 at Mandalay Bay, Stephen Paddock fired more than 1,100 rounds, injuring at least 450 people for reasons that remain unknown. But the wounds from the worst mass shooting in modern American history weren’t only physical. Among the most traumatized was Marie. Even after she and Summer left the church parking lot and made it to the safety of their homes, Marie couldn’t shake a debilitating sense of dread. Too distraught to sleep alone, she asked her mother to lie in bed with her until morning. At 7:15, the 16-year-old’s phone buzzed with a text from Summer, who had just learned about the enormity of what they survived: “Omfg 50+ dead. I can’t believe this.” “Oh my god summer. I woke up crying so many times,” Marie texted back, unable to imagine going to school that day. But Shae, who’d gotten home at 4 a.m., had never considered not going. She knew her parents would work on the investigation all day, and she didn’t want to stay home alone. She’d be fine, Shae told herself. She put on leggings beneath a pink nightgown, because it was “Pajama Day” at Faith, and headed to school, where she walked into her first class and approached her British literature teacher. “I don’t have my homework because it’s in my car,” Shae said, explaining that it was still parked at the crime scene. “I’m really surprised that you’re even here,” her teacher replied.

Sign Up Shae joined her classmates in the high school gym for an impromptu assembly. “It’s not the ideal way to start homecoming week,” Dan Buikema, Faith’s guidance director, told the 1,100 students, who listened in silence. He updated them on Natalia and Gianna but said he knew the massacre’s impact on Faith would extend well beyond the twins. The school was still trying to determine the number of students who had attended the concert, eventually counting 10. The youngest, an eighth-grader, had tripped on a body while fleeing with her mother and was left covered in blood. There were at least 17 more Faith students who had family or nonschool friends at the festival, and several were close to someone hurt or killed. “We’ve seen this kind of stuff happen around the world,” Buikema continued. “We’ve not seen this happen in our community.” Their community was Summerlin, a 35-square-mile collection of palm-tree-lined golf courses, $600,000-plus homes and augustly named neighborhoods: Reverence and the Summit, Affinity and Chardonnay. “The Summerlin Bubble,” people sometimes called it, and at the center was Faith, one of Nevada’s most highly regarded schools. At nearly $12,000 a year, Faith Lutheran Middle School and High School offered sixth- to 12th-graders the opportunity to pursue an array of interests, from programming drones to producing films to climbing rock faces. Its campus of red-brick buildings, which included two gymnasiums and a 772-seat performing arts center, looked like a university. Every 2017 graduate, the school advertised, had gone on to attend college. Faith didn’t try to shelter its students from people who were suffering – groups traveled on mission trips every year – but they knew that theirs was a world of privilege and comfort. Now, in the gym, a teacher played guitar, leading the assembly in a hymn. “All the earth rejoice. He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide,” sang students sitting on the bleachers around Shae, who wanted to join but just couldn’t get the words out. It struck Shae in her next class that, somehow, she’d never cleaned the scrapes on her knees from the night before. She went to the nurse’s office, raising her nightgown and leggings to wipe away bits of asphalt embedded in her shins. Marie pulled into Faith’s parking lot Tuesday morning and saw what she’d seen every morning for years: other kids, walking, talking, laughing. She began to sob. Marie used to be one of them, she thought, doing and saying normal things, believing everything was okay. But now nothing felt OK. Marie hurried to her first class, AP English, and immediately had to leave. “I don’t know if I can do this,” Marie texted her mother. A day earlier, the teenager had spent hours at home watching news coverage of the shooting on TV. In her next class, the teacher, who hadn’t been told that Marie was at the festival, asked whether she could stay after school to take a test she’d missed. Suddenly, Marie was stricken with the sense that everything she’d cared about most – grades, the SAT, admittance into a top-tier college with an equestrian program – didn’t matter. “No,” she said. “I can’t take it after school.” Later, in a hallway, she and Summer talked about what was happening to them. “It feels so weird walking around,” Marie said. “It feels like we’re different,” Summer said. Nothing left the girls more convinced of that than how they reacted to noises. The roar of a motorcycle sent Summer sprinting to her front door. “What’s wrong?” her mother asked. “I don’t know,” Summer responded. Marie couldn’t stand a classmate zipping an eraser stick in and out, and in her living room on Tuesday night, the sound of a slamming door terrified her. Marie’s ears rang. She shrieked. Her mother, Susan, rushed in from the kitchen. For 15 minutes, she watched her daughter weep. Later that evening, Marie noticed someone parked across the street in their cul-de-sac. She checked every lock and closed every shutter. She set the alarm. When she got up to her bedroom, though, Marie realized her phone charger was still downstairs. She woke up her mom. “I need you to come with me,” Marie said. When they walked back down, the car was gone. She didn’t understand. If it had pulled away, she would have heard it. Marie insisted she had seen someone. But now came a more unsettling possibility. Maybe, Marie thought, it had all been in her mind. Shae sat on the ground outside her class, considering the right words to say as a camera was positioned in front of her. She’d been asked to describe her experience for a video the school planned to show during that week’s chapel services. Shae wore a long-sleeve plaid shirt and her hair in braided pigtails because it was Faith’s “Wilderness Explorer Day” in honor of the Disney movie “Up,” the theme for homecoming. “I know that I got out of that situation because God was with us, and I definitely know that He’s still with me now,” she said in the interview. “I have moments in the day that I really just feel a struggle, and I just feel like I can’t – like I just want to hole up in myself and not deal with any of it, but I know that I can’t do that.” Shae had never not dealt with things. She was an honor-roll regular and editor in chief of the Crusader Chronicle, Faith’s student newspaper. In third grade, her mother recalled, Shae came home one day complaining that the other kids didn’t take their assignments seriously enough. She labored to stay composed all week and tried to help Delaney, who’d hidden with her in the Luxor restroom, do the same. When she was asked to write a first-person account for the Chronicle about their escape, Shae gave it this headline: “I’m not a victim, I’m a survivor.” She couldn’t bear to watch, though, when a teacher played a TV interview with Natalia and Gianna in class that included clips of the bloodshed. As Shae looked down at her desk, she noticed classmates staring. “Shae, stop reliving it,” whispered a friend sitting next to her. In a chapel service, when a student yelled at the speaker, she clutched the arms on her chair and sat up, panicked. “I need to get out of here,” Shae thought, before a friend told her that it was part of the presentation. She left school early one afternoon to be with her mother, who had worked on the investigation most of the week but wanted to take Shae to get a manicure. Elena sat on their couch, and Shae laid her head on her mom’s lap for a few minutes before they headed to the nail salon. “How are you?” Elena asked in the car. “Everyone keeps telling me that I’m so strong,” she said, “but I just don’t feel strong right now.” Elena told her there was nothing wrong with that, and then they went inside the salon and Shae got her fingernails painted periwinkle blue to match a homecoming dress she no longer wanted to wear. It was Friday morning, the beginning of Natalia’s fifth day in the hospital, and a doctor had just pulled the chest tube out from between her ribs. All week, she and Gianna had been the focus of unrelenting attention. The twins had done interviews on “Good Morning America” and “Inside Edition.” They’d heard from producers for “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” and “Dr. Phil.” ABC’s “20/20” had even flown Dean McAuley, the firefighter who had helped Natalia get to the hospital, back from Seattle to orchestrate an emotional on-camera reunion between the two. Amid all of it — the hundreds of messages on Facebook, the stream of well-wishers, the repeated questions about what it felt like to witness and face death — the twins remained unflinchingly positive. The online conspiracy theorists fixated on their smiles, insisting it was evidence that their stories weren’t true. But Natalia had been that way — “#keepsmiling,” she’d written next to a photo of herself in the hospital — since she was little. Her outlook was born of a compassion so deep that when she returned from a ninth-grade mission trip to Mexico, she announced to her parents that she wanted to become a traveling nurse, move to Africa and treat victims of Ebola. Twenty-two hours after being shot, still in the intensive care unit, Natalia wrote on Instagram: “I am so blessed to be alive at this moment of time.” Now, though, on Friday, the last of the TV cameras had left, and with them went the distractions. Natalia finally had time to consider what she might miss during her last homecoming weekend before graduation. With the chest tube out, she had only one question for her doctor: “Can I go to the football game tonight?” Two hours later, her sister rolled on an electric scooter through a tunnel of pompom-shaking cheerleaders and into the gymnasium, where hundreds of students gathered for a pep rally stood to applaud. “We would like to dedicate this assembly and the rest of our cheer season to Gianna and Natalia Baca,” a girl announced on a microphone. Then the cheer team performed, and the lip sync competition began. The freshmen went first, followed by the sophomores and juniors and, at last, the seniors. Between songs, the narrators recounted highlights of “our Faith Lutheran adventure”: the first dances and dates, cars and crushes. Natalia knew the entire lip-sync routine and had so looked forward to performing with her classmates one more time, to hitting her mark as the seniors romped to the final song, “We’re All in This Together.” Instead, she watched on FaceTime from her hospital room, blowing into a deep-breathing device, hoping that her lung wouldn’t collapse so that, maybe, she could make the football game. — The prayer had been said and the moment of silence had been held, and now, between the stadium’s bleachers, teenagers lining a pathway held up their phones, ready to record. Faith’s high school principal, Scott Fogo, waved up at the public-address booth and then pointed at who was behind him: Gianna, driving her scooter, and Natalia, less than five hours removed from the hospital, in a wheelchair being pushed by their dad. “Ladies and gentlemen, will you direct your attention to the 35-yard line,” the announcer said over the loudspeaker, his voice rising. “Welcome back Natalia and Gianna Baca.” The crowd stood and clapped as Faith’s cheerleaders surrounded the girls. “We love you, Bacas!” they chanted in unison. The principal, eyes watery, watched from a few feet away. He wore a maroon T-shirt that on the front showed an image of the girls above the hashtag #BacaStrong and on the back included a verse from 2 Corinthians about God’s comfort in times of trouble. Fogo, bald, bespectacled and known among students for his reassuring hugs, had given out more of them that week than any other in his career. He and his staff had done all they could think of – bringing in comfort dogs, calling traumatized students at home when they missed classes, prepping teachers for the inevitable questions and breakdowns, arranging for three counselors to attend the dance, just in case. “I don’t know what I say to my kid,” parents had told Fogo, so he helped set up a meeting for them with a Harvard-trained psychiatrist. He had even researched the aftermath of the Columbine High School rampage and discovered that a student who’d witnessed the violence hanged himself a year later. By Friday, he and Faith’s counselors had already begun to work on a plan for the months ahead, when they knew things would return to normal for many in the community but might not — then, or ever — for at least 10 of their kids. Fogo waited as Natalia’s dad parked her wheelchair next to Gianna. The twins faced the cheer team they co-captained, and in front of Natalia were the personalized black boxes that the girls stood on during games. Neatly stacked on top of hers was a megaphone and two gold pompoms. “Natalia,” it read. “Varsity Cheer 2018.” A tear tumbled down her cheek, and when the local TV journalists noticed it, they crept closer and pointed their lenses. Then out came the microphones, and back came her smile. “I haven’t seen a big crowd in, like, a week, so it was very overwhelming,” she told the reporters. “This school is family to me, so I didn’t want to miss it.” They backed away, and she eased out of the wheelchair. “Go, Crusaders! Go!” her teammates shouted. She leaned against the fence behind her, lightly bouncing one foot to the rhythm and tapping her hands together. Natalia knew she would never cheer at another football game. “Go, Crusaders. Go,” she mouthed in silence as her smile disappeared. Beyond the end zone, Shae and Delaney had just come into the stadium, both wearing #BacaStrong shirts. They walked toward the far side of the field to watch friends on the dance team, the two of them holding hands, just as the girls had done five nights earlier when they fled the concert. “I just don’t want to lose her in the crowd,” Delaney said. A dark-haired classmate in a polo shirt stopped to give Shae a hug. He’d heard she was at the festival. “That’s crazy. You’re okay, though, right?” the teen asked Shae, who, to him, looked no different. “Yeah,” she said and nodded, because the real answer was too hard to explain. Shae and Delaney spotted Summer. She’d come without Marie, who had finally made it through a day of classes but decided not to attend the game or any of the homecoming weekend activities. The girls compared how they were feeling. “I’m actually good today because I didn’t go to school,” Summer said. Delaney thought she’d made progress, too. “I only cried once,” she said. “Guys, I took off my bracelet,” Summer told them, referring to the purple Route 91 Harvest band. “I need to take mine off,” Shae responded. “I’m leaving it on,” Delaney said. “Even for tomorrow?” Summer asked, referring to the dance. “It’s kind of a constant reminder.” “It’s just like a — I’m lucky. I was lucky,” Delaney said. “It doesn’t make me sad anymore.” Shae, glancing down at her left wrist, said nothing. Natalia limped over the curb onto the sidewalk, and as the fading sunlight cut through the palm trees on Saturday evening, her iridescent white dress flashed shades of pink and blue, just as she’d imagined. But Natalia, one hand holding Gianna’s and the other squeezing her phone, didn’t seem to notice. It was just past 5 p.m., and they were waiting on the sprawling lawn outside the JW Marriott to get their homecoming photos taken, along with dozens of other Faith teens. Two local stylists had done their hair free at home, and a friend had bought them flats, because neither twin could stand in heels. The sisters had already decided to skip the dance. “There’s loud music. I don’t want to go,” Natalia had told her mom, and Gianna agreed. Still, both girls wanted pictures. Now Natalia checked her phone for the third time. Parker, the teen who’d asked her to homecoming, was running late. “Where’s your date?” asked Gianna’s boyfriend. “He’s coming at 5:30,” she said, but at 5:30, he still hadn’t arrived. Another parent walked over to say hello. “Both of you are here?” she said to the girls, surprised. “Where are your dates?” “Parker’s coming,” Natalia said. She checked her phone again. “He’s got 2 minutes,” someone announced at 5:43. One minute later, he made it. She grinned, and they shared a gentle embrace. He slipped a white rose corsage on her left wrist, and she held the matching boutonniere up to his navy blue lapel. “I’m just going to act like I’m doing it,” she said, laughing. Now they needed to get a portrait, so she motioned for him to shiftto her left. “I can move this arm,” Natalia said. From the camera’s view, she looked like any other girl, hair curled, eyelashes long, makeup pristine. The dress’s open back, though, revealed a patch of ivory bandages, the only evidence that the bones in her shoulders were fractured, that her chest was littered with bullet fragments. Parker put his arm around her, smiling as he searched for a spot to rest his hand. They posed with Gianna and her boyfriend and, later, a few other classmates. Then Natalia hugged her date goodbye and shuffled toward an awaiting truck. “Six o’clock. Take your pill,” a family friend said, because it was time for her painkiller. The woman helped her into the back seat, and 51 minutes after it began, Natalia’s homecoming ended. Across town, Shae was at Delaney’s house, struggling to find the right expression for their pictures. None of them felt quite right. “What’s wrong with us?” Shae asked, especially frustrated because 2016’s homecoming had cemented their friendship. Both had just come out of serious relationships and bonded over silly, finger-on-their-chin poses and a long night on the dance floor. When Brevin, the boy taking Shae, arrived, the girls got into the back of his family’s Ford Mustang. With their dates up front, Shae and Delaney took selfies together, and the night finally started to feel the way it was supposed to. The four of them had gone out in the same car, with the top down, on the night Brevin asked Shae to the dance. On the way, the girls had begged him to play country music, and he’d refused, and they’d all laughed about it ever since. Now, on the way to homecoming, he asked if they wanted to hear country music. Not tonight, the girls told him. They pulled up to the school and spotted Fogo, who was welcoming students. Shae and Delaney walked straight to the principal and hugged him, together. At a table in the cafeteria, the girls ate chicken and salad with their dates and talked about the decorations inside the gym. Shae had helped set up everything until midnight Friday and then again Saturday morning. “Wait till you see it,” she told Delaney. “It’s really pretty.” Shae had worried all week that she and her classmates wouldn’t enjoy the dance, but she’d invested so much of herself to make sure they did – covering the bleachers in black tarp, assembling light towers wrapped in linen, putting together a gazebo threaded in faux ivy around the dessert table, painting a miniature house that looked just like the one that floats away in the movie “Up.” On their way out of the cafeteria, the girls ran into Summer and exchanged hugs and compliments about their dresses. “I’m just going to warn you guys, there are a lot of balloons in there,” said Shae, who knew that, a day earlier, one had popped just as Delaney walked into the gym and she’d ducked to cover her head. But her best friend was too excited to worry about that, so Shae, Delaney and their dates headed across the courtyard. Reading this on your iPhone or iPad?

The rap song “Crank That (Soulja Boy)” thudded from the speakers as they walked through the gym’s double doors, where hundreds of students were bouncing in the dark beneath white ceiling drapes. The four of them passed white-clothed tables decorated with white rose petals and Mason jars filled with white lights that looked like fireflies. They sat on a bench along the side of the gym, and Shae took off her floral Steve Madden heels. Hand in hand, the girls approached the dance floor, maneuvering along the edge, outside the scrum. They found friends near the front, below the DJ booth, and began to dance. “Stanky Legg” came on, and the students roared. Delaney, beaming, let go of Shae’s hand. The bass boomed louder. The crowd grew larger. Shae felt her chest tighten. “I’ll be back,” she told a friend standing next to her. “Are you okay?” he asked. “Yeah, I just need a minute,” she said, slipping away before Delaney could notice. Shae went to the principal. “It’s a little overwhelming,” she said, and he told her to take a break if she needed to. Shae picked up her phone and rushed toward the doors, fleeing beneath an arch of rainbow-colored balloons on her way out. On the far side of the courtyard, she stood barefoot along the edge of the sidewalk, her pink toenails buried in the grass. A string of lights between two poles hung overhead, illuminating the scrapes on her legs that still hadn’t healed. She called her dad. “I just can’t have fun,” Shae told him, her voice faltering. “I want to, but I can’t.” When he’d finished assuring her that it was going to be okay and they’d hung up, she stepped away from the light. Then Shae sat down and wept. Natalia finished her strawberry ice cream with gummy bears and watched an episode of “Grey’s Anatomy” before she headed to her bedroom. Crumpled in the corner was the poster Parker had brought to the school parking lot when he asked her to the dance, just before she and Gianna left for Route 91. “HOMECOMING,” it read. He’d gone that evening without her. She lay down and closed her eyes. Natalia normally slept in complete darkness but couldn’t do that anymore, so she left the door open and the lights above her mirror on. As she began to fall asleep, Natalia knew what was coming. A sound so clear that, each night, she had to tell herself it wasn’t real: gunshots. Get Morning Report and other email newsletters"

The message: Mass casualty event in Wilson County. Potentially 30 victims, maybe more. Spencer, 28, quickly pulled out her cell phone and typed the name of the county into the search engine. She had only been working in Texas for four years and sometimes struggled to recall neighboring counties. She didn’t know at the time that the shooting at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs had already become the deadliest in Texas history.

As staff at University Hospital prepared to receive patients from the mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, their training kicked in. As time has passed they have reflected on the events of the day. Nine victims were taken to University Hospital in Northwest San Antonio, which is 50 miles away from the rural community of 600 people. Spencer was the charge nurse that Sunday in early November. She was tasked with overseeing operations in the emergency room, coordinating with first responders and mobilizing her team in the trauma bay. “Unfortunately, when you get this page, there’s no sugarcoating it,” Spencer said. “You just got to tell it direct how it is — this is our plan. This is what we’re going to do. This is how we’re going to attack it."" The Level 1 trauma center had successfully completed a mass casualty drill six months earlier, but most of the staff had never treated victims from a mass shooting. Within moments, the pace sharpened for a hospital that is accustomed to more quiet Sunday rhythms. Nurses and emergency technicians raced to discharge patients and clear up bed space. Surgeons, physicians, residents, medical students and other staff poured into the trauma bay, bringing with them extra stretchers and supplies. Radiology, pharmacy and the blood bank staffers stood on the room’s edge, waiting for the first patients to arrive.

She darted past the growing crowd of hospital employees and medical supplies. As she walked, she stuck her head into different rooms and stopped at each nursing station to make sure everyone was ready and knew their marching orders. No “lookers” were allowed in Spencer’s emergency room. “If you did not need to be there, you did not need to be there,” Spencer said. “Everyone had a role to play in my trauma bay.” At 12:45 p.m., University Hospital got its first patient — a 5-year-old boy. His arms and legs were tied with tourniquets to stop the bleeding. His femur was broken, bullet fragments were buried in his abdomen and a blood vessel in his arm had been severed. The boy was confused, struggling to understand where he was and what happened. Eight other patients, three children and five adults, would arrive within the next hour. Many were bleeding from multiple gunshot wounds. Others had bullet fragments lodged in their bodies. One child had been trampled. Previously: Texas church shooting: Community gathers to mourn at first funerals for victims More: Texas church shooting: 8 members of one family killed A 7-year-old girl, among the last to be evaluated by the staff, arrived with severe abdominal injuries. “She was very unstable,” said Dr. Ronald Stewart, director of trauma at the hospital, who rushed to help with the girl’s surgery after coordinating the arrival of patients. “When I went to the operating room, it was clear that the probability of her survival was low, but we have patients who survive all of the time with a low probability of survival, so I think we were focused on doing everything we could to fix her problems.” Twenty-five Texans, including a pregnant woman, never made it to a hospital that Sunday. They had gathered for worship at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs when a gunman opened fire on the families inside. “We knew pretty much from the beginning it was a church shooting,” said Dr. Lillian Liao, director of the pediatric trauma and burn program at University Hospital. “The minute they said church, I knew that it was not just going to be adults,” Liao said. As one of two Level 1 trauma centers in South Texas, the hospital received the most victims from the church, including all the injured children. Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston, the other Level 1 trauma center in San Antonio, received eight. The USA TODAY NETWORK spoke with more than a dozen doctors, nurses and officials at both hospitals in the days and weeks following the Sutherland Springs church shooting. Victims arrived at University Hospital in waves after the shooting. They were delivered in ambulances and emergency helicopters. Stewart was in charge of assessing the incoming patients and directing their care. The people with the most critical injuries were taken directly to the operating room.

With each call about an incoming patient, Spencer ran to the trauma bay and shouted out the available details: gender, estimated age and a description of injuries. Spencer imagined the scene would have appeared chaotic to an outside observer. ""But it was controlled chaos,"" she said. Some patients who arrived were conscious and able to communicate, but they were often confused and slightly disoriented. Nizar Alyassin, a 23-year-old emergency room technician, tried to comfort them as he assessed their injuries. “My name is Nizar. We’re here to help you,” he said to a 6-year-old girl. “Now you’re safe.” Alyassin, who has worked less than two years at the hospital and is applying to medical school to study emergency medicine, tried to stay focused on his young patient. He recalled feeling angry and confused by the number of children who had been shot in the church. “At that moment, we had to put all our emotions aside and to take care of those patients first,” he said, “make sure we were the first voice of comfort.” In another part of the hospital, Liao tended to the boy with ties on his arms and legs. Her surgical team rushed him down the hallway and into an industrial-sized elevator that would carry them upstairs to an operating room. “Most of us, our training is that something has to be done and you become a missile,” Liao said. “When someone hits launch, you have one goal and that goal is to take care of whichever patient you’re assigned and then all of the other things from a personal or emotional standpoint get compartmentalized until much later.” Liao worked for hours to repair the severed blood vessel in the boy's arm. Another doctor treated his abdominal injuries. When they finished, Liao left the boy with an orthopedic surgeon who was tending to his broken leg and went to check on other pediatric patients. The first operating room she peered into had a child in stable condition. The surgeons appeared to have everything under control. Then, she walked into the room with the 7-year-old girl. Stewart was at the center of the crowded room. He was leaning over the girl. Liao, who had studied trauma surgery under Stewart, moved quickly to help her longtime mentor. About 30 other surgeons, nurses and staff gathered around the table, doing what they could to stop the girl's bleeding. “When you have that many anesthesiologists working, you know that patient is sick,” Liao said. On the east side of San Antonio, the trauma team at Brooke Army Medical Center was also busy treating eight victims from the church. Connally Memorial Medical Center in nearby Floresville treated three churchgoers with less severe injuries after transferring four critical patients to University Hospital. University Hospital and Brooke Army Medical Center staff completed a joint mass casualty drill earlier this year. The drill posed a hypothetical scenario that 60 people had been shot and needed care. More: Texas shooting: How to help victims of Sutherland Springs More: In Texas shooting town, there's always been one constant: church At the time, Army Col. (Dr.) Kurt Edwards, chief of trauma at Brooke Army Medical Center, thought the number was “ludicrous.” He never imagined the casualties count from a mass shooting would be so high. When they completed the exercise, the freshest example was when a gunman shot 12 Dallas police officers, killing five. The shooting at the Harvest Music Festival in Las Vegas, the deadliest mass killing in modern American history, wouldn’t happen until October. But staff from both hospitals did the drill, preparing for a reality each hoped would never arrive. When it did, they were anxious, but ready. After receiving notification of the shooting in Sutherland Springs, Brooke Army Medical Center prepared 10 operating rooms and called in 30 surgeons and physicians from various departments to help. The patients came in two waves and were taken immediately to the operating room or treated in the trauma bay. All of the victims survived. “That day, was it chaos? I didn’t think so,” Edwards said. “I have way more than I need. It gets to be a bigger deal when you don’t have enough.” Edwards, who has completed seven deployments to combat zones, described 10 wounded soldiers he treated with limited resources as part of an Army Forward Surgical Team. This time, Edwards said he worked with an abundance of staff and supplies, but he pointed to a key difference. “I’ve taken care of the same kind of injuries in combat that we had to see here, but these are volunteers wearing body armor and they get shot like this,” Edwards said. “To have to take care of civilians who are sitting in church? Old ladies? I don’t know where we’ve gone as a society that it’s gone like that.” The trauma teams at University Hospital worked at a frantic pace for nearly six hours. When Liao checked in on the 7-year-old girl, Stewart asked her to scrub in and take the lead so he could speak with the girl’s father and relatives. By then, the surgical team had exhausted nearly all treatment options. “When you have a patient on the table — it doesn’t matter if it’s a kid or an elderly person or a young person who is dying in front of you — it’s hard not to think about the fact that they’re going to die,” Liao said. “You then have to step back and run through all of the steps, to be sure that there’s nothing else I can do for this person.” Sometimes those efforts are not enough. After hours of surgery, unit after unit of blood and multiple resuscitation attempts, there was nothing else hospital staff could do. Seven-year-old Emily Garcia was the only person from the church to die at a hospital. “I was the one who pronounced her,” Liao said. “I pronounced her and then I helped the team close her and get prepared for some of the other things that have to happen when a patient expires in the operating room.” Spencer, the charge nurse, was sent to the waiting room to find the girl’s family. She knew what color shirt the father was wearing and she had spoken earlier with her relatives about another family member being treated at the hospital. The girl’s mother and sister had died at the church. After locating the father, she directed him upstairs. Spencer invited other family members to join him, so he wouldn’t be alone. “I think he knew,” Spencer said. Stewart, who had been dutifully updating the family during the girl’s operation, delivered the news. “To try to explain to a family whose child was normal at breakfast that now they’re no longer here, is the thing that I hate the most,” Stewart said. “I think it’s one of the hardest things to do. I will do everything possible not to do that.” Spencer returned to her lunch at 5:30 p.m., retrieving her now cold chicken stir-fry from the microwave where it sat untouched all afternoon. She only had a few moments to eat before heading back to the floor. By the time a shift change rolled around that night, the trauma team had treated another six patients from unrelated emergencies around San Antonio. Spencer climbed into her car to head home to her 6-month-old daughter close to 9 p.m. It was then that she finally took a breath “I felt like a zombie,” she said. “Emotionally drained and physically exhausted.” When Alyassin, the emergency room technician, got home from the hospital on Sunday night, he thought about his 10-year-old brother and the children who he treated in the trauma bay. It had been a long day, but Alyassin was thankful he had the chance to help. “I’m proud to have been there,” he said. “I’m proud to do what I do. I would not have wanted to be anywhere else that Sunday afternoon.” A month has passed since the shooting, but Stewart said he still thinks of the 7-year-old girl. When she appears in his head, he doesn’t try to dismiss the thoughts but instead puts them in the context of his “uplifting vision” for the trauma care offered by University Hospital. Her memory inspires him to improve the trauma system in the future. He’s avoided news coverage of the shooting and the profiles of victims from Sutherland Springs. He doesn’t need help remembering. “My grandmother taught me to forgive and forget,” Stewart said. “Surgeons forgive and remember. So, I remember. I will remember.” Follow Madlin Mekelburg on Twitter: @madlinbmek"

http://observer.com/2017/12/gabrielle-giffords-targets-republicans-with-gun-reform-campaign/,"Former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords is challenging Republican incumbents with a six-figure ad buy. Financed by the advocate’s gun safety group, Giffords, the ads pressure representatives to vote against the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act. Slated to appear before the House this week, the bill requires states allowing concealed weapons to recognize concealed carry permits issued in other states.
“In the wake of our country’s worst mass shooting, Congress came up with its most dangerous idea yet: nearly anyone with a hidden loaded gun would be allowed into your community. No background check? No training? No questions asked,” says a female narrator over images of police officers and firearms. “Will Jason Lewis side with law enforcement, or the gun lobby?”
Politico reports that the television ads target Congressmen Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-N.J.) and Jason Lewis (R-Minn.). Additional online ads focus on Representatives Steve Knight (R-Calif.), Ed Royce (R-Calif.), Miami Waters (R-Calif.), Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), and Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.)
“The ads call on voters to speak up about this dangerous bill and call on their leaders put the safety of communities before the interests of the gun industry,” Giffords’ executive director Peter Ambler told Politico.
After surviving an assassination attempt while meeting with constituents in Tucson in 2011, Giffords became a leading advocate against gun violence. The former congresswoman consolidated her activism and gun reform movements into Giffords in 2016. “In the wake of our country’s worst mass shooting, Congress came up with its most dangerous idea yet: nearly anyone with a hidden loaded gun would be allowed into your community.

https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/05/youtube-offensive-videos-journalists-moderators,"As harmful material continues to appear on sites like YouTube and Facebook, companies rely on journalists and citizens to flag it – and the system is failing Last modified on Tue 5 Dec 2017 14.31 GMT The viral YouTube videos featured screaming children being tortured, conspiracy theorists taunting mass shooting victims and webcam footage of young girls in revealing clothing. The disturbing clips drew millions of views and, up until recently, were continuing to spread on the site. Then, hours after reporters highlighted them to YouTube, asking for comment, the videos disappeared.  The removal of the harmful footage illustrated a dark pattern in Silicon Valley and a common feature of some of the biggest tech scandals of 2017: journalists have become the de facto moderators for the most powerful social media corporations, exposing offensive content that the companies themselves have failed to detect. In the face of increasing recognition that Facebook, Google, Twitter and others have had detrimental impacts on society – whether enabling harassment and violence, spreading misinformation or threatening core functions of democracy – the companies have largely resisted fundamental changes that would reduce the damage. On the contrary, Silicon Valley has stuck to its foundational belief that tech firms are ultimately not accountable for the content on their platforms. They have outsourced social responsibility to journalists, watchdogs and other citizens, who have increasingly taken on the role of unpaid moderators – flagging abusive, dangerous and illegal material, which the sites then remove in the face of bad publicity. By many measures, it’s a system that is failing. “They’ve been quite content to let the general public or conventional news media do their work for them,” said Jane Kirtley, professor of media ethics and law at the University of Minnesota, who has criticized Facebook’s impact on journalism. The philosophy, she said, was: “‘Maximize our presence and our money, and if something goes wrong, we will ask for forgiveness.’” On a weekly basis, reporters discover glaring flaws and alarming content, launching a predictable cycle of takedowns, apologies and vague promises to re-evaluate. Often, the companies’ arbitrary enforcement efforts and inadequate algorithms have failed to reject the abusive material, even though it violated official policies and standards. YouTube, for example, had allowed a wide range of videos and “verified” channels featuring child exploitation to flourish, in some cases enabling violent content to slip past the site’s YouTube Kids safety filter. Dozens of channels and thousands of videos were recently removed from the Google-owned site only because of revelations reported in BuzzFeed, the New York Times and a viral essay on Medium. Some families of mass shooting victims have also spent countless hours trying to get YouTube to remove harassing videos from conspiracy theorists. They’ve described an emotionally taxing and often unsuccessful process of flagging the footage. But when the Guardian recently sent YouTube 10 such videos, the site removed half of them for violating “policy on harassment and bullying” within hours of an email inquiry. YouTube also changed its search algorithm to promote more reputable news sources after a day of negative news coverage surrounding offensive video content attacking victims of the Las Vegas mass shooting. On Monday, YouTube said that it would hire thousands of new moderators next year in an effort to fight child abuse content in the same way the site has tackled violent extremist videos. With more than 10,000 moderators total across Google, the company said it would still continue to rely heavily on machine learning to identify problematic content. Facebook, too, has repeatedly been forced to reverse course and publicly apologize after embarrassing or unethical decisions by algorithms or internal moderators (who have said they are overburdened and underpaid). ProPublica reported this month that Facebook was allowing housing advertisements to illegally exclude users by race. That’s despite the fact that Facebook previously said it had instituted a “machine learning” system to spot and block discriminatory ads. The tech company said in a statement that this was a “failure in our enforcement” and that it was, once again, adopting new safeguards and undergoing a policy review. Facebook, Google and Twitter were all also forced to change policies this year after reporters revealed that users could buy ads targeted to offensive categories, such as people who consider themselves “Jew haters”. “They are concerned about getting as many eyeballs on to as many advertisements as is humanly possible,” said Don Heider, founder of the Center for Digital Ethics and Policy. “That doesn’t always bode well for what the results are going to be.” Facebook and Twitter have both faced intense backlash for allowing abuse and false news to flourish while simultaneously shutting down accounts and posts featuring legitimate news and exposing wrongdoing. For affected users, sometimes the best way to get action is to tell a journalist. Facebook reinstated a Chechen independence activist group this year after the Guardian inquired about its decision to shut down the page for “terrorist activity”. Reporters’ inquiries also forced the site to admit that it had erred when it censored posts from a Rohingya group opposing Myanmar’s military, which has been accused of ethnic cleansing. There are no easy solutions to moderation given the scale and complexity of the content, but experts said the companies should invest significantly more resources into staff with journalism and ethics backgrounds. Facebook’s fact-checking efforts – which have been unsuccessful, according to some insiders – should involve a large team of full-time journalists structured like a newsroom, said Kirtley: “They have to start acting like a news operation.” Reem Suleiman, campaigner with SumOfUs, a not-for-profit organization that has criticized Facebook for having a “racially biased” moderation system, argued that the companies should be more transparent, release internal data and explain how their algorithms work: “Without the work of journalists chasing down some of this information, we’re just completely left in the dark.” Claire Wardle, research fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard, said the platforms were starting to develop more robust specialist teams doing moderation work. Still, she said, it was “shocking” that Twitter would not have detected propaganda accounts that a group of BuzzFeed reporters without access to internal data was able to uncover. “The cynical side of me thinks they are not looking, because they don’t want to find it,” she said. A Twitter representative touted its machine learning technology and said it detected and blocks 450,000 suspicious logins each day. The statement also praised the work of the media, saying: “We welcome reporting that identifies Twitter accounts that may violate our terms of service, and appreciate that many journalists themselves use Twitter to identify and expose such disinformation in real time.” A Facebook representative noted that the company was hiring thousands of people to review content and will have 7,500 total by the end of the year. That team works to evaluate whether content violates “community standards”, the representative noted, adding, “We aren’t the arbiters of truth.”"
http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-met-glanton-concealed-carry-illinois-20171204-story.html,"We are accustomed to the crocodile tears shed in Washington every time there is a mass shooting. Politicians who actually have the power to bring about change like to talk about healing, the power of prayer and the need for Americans to come together after a violent rampage. But their solemn faces are merely masks. When memories of the tragedy begin to fade, too many politicians return to their perches in the palms of the National Rifle Association and wait for their next assignment. Then, like hired assassins, they set out on a mission to pass new laws that can only result in more bloodshed. This time, the NRA orders came barely two months after Stephen Paddock slaughtered 58 people and injured more than 500 on the Las Vegas Strip in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Paddock owned more than 40 guns of varying sizes and calibers when he went on his deadly rampage in October. In Nevada, gun owners can carry their weapons openly. Paddock would have needed a permit to carry a concealed handgun in the state, but in Nevada it would have been easy for him to get one. It would, however, have been illegal for him to bring even a single handgun into Illinois. Now, the lawmakers’ mission, as directed by the NRA, is to make it easier for gunmen to carry their weapons all over the country. Lawmakers are expected to vote this week on federal legislation that would allow anyone who has a concealed carry permit from another state to walk into a restaurant on Michigan Avenue with a handgun tucked in his or her belt. Sounds pretty scary, doesn’t it? But that’s what could happen if the NRA gets its way — and there is no reason to think House Republicans won’t fall into line. The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017 would take precedence over laws in states such as Illinois, California and New York that allow only those who have obtained a concealed carry permit in that state to legally carry firearms within state lines. One thing we learned from the Las Vegas shooting is that state concealed carry laws are not equal. Nevada, for example, has some of the most lax concealed carry laws in the nation. In that state, almost anyone who is at least 21 and who does not have a felony record is eligible to obtain a concealed carry permit. While gun buyers nationwide must undergo a federal background check, it is much easier in some states for bad people to slip through the cracks. Illinois has gone to great lengths to make sure that only law-abiding citizens with no history of mental illness or substance abuse can legally carry a weapon. And anyone who wants to legally carry a concealed handgun must undergo 16 hours of training in how to use it. Gun carriers also must submit to fingerprinting and possess a firearm owner’s identification card, which offers a second level of background checks through the Illinois State Police. Illinois also bars anyone who has been convicted of misdemeanor domestic battery or is under an order of protection from obtaining a firearm. These are commonsense laws that every state should have in place. But the NRA has waged a yearslong campaign to get rid of as many regulations as possible. Most states have cowered to the pressure. Now Congress is stepping in to force the stragglers into line. Following the Las Vegas shooting, House Speaker Paul Ryan called the carnage “an evil tragedy that horrifies us all.” He ordered flags over the U.S. Capitol to half-staff and issued a statement to the people of Las Vegas and families of the victims. He said, “ The whole country stands united in our shock, in our condolences, and in our prayers.” That sentiment was short-lived. At the end of the statement, he should have added, “Unless it interferes with the NRA’s agenda.” dglanton@chicagotribune.com Twitter @dahleeng RELATED CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"

Bernandino Gawala “Nandie” Bolatete faces charges of knowingly receiving and possessing a silencer without registering it as required by federal law, according to the authorities. At a Monday press conference, Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said Bolatete, “had expressed a strong anti-Islamic sentiment” and “had weaponry to carry out the attack.” A criminal complaint released by authorities said Bolatete had been under investigation since October, when a tipster notified authorities of the alleged plot. Authorities said they immediately devised a plan to protect the mosque and to have an undercover officer befriend Bolatete, a Jacksonville resident. “Due to many safeguards we had in place during this investigation, at no time were … any of the members of (the center) at risk,” FBI Special Agent in Charge Charles Spencer said Monday. Bolatete was arrested Friday after buying a silencer from the undercover officer. The suspect could face more charges, officials said. The complaint contains chilling excerpts of comments allegedly made by Bolatete during extensive recorded conversations and text messages. According to police, he told the undercover officer that his health was declining due to kidney problems and he wanted to “shoot up” a mosque before he died. “I just want to give these freaking people a taste of their own medicine … they are the ones who are always doing these shootings,” Bolatete wrote in a Nov. 14 text message, authorities said. According to the FBI, Bolatete said he planned to carry out the attack at the Islamic Center of Northeast Florida on St. Johns Bluff Road. Bolatete told the undercover officer he owned several guns, including an AR-15 rifle, police said. He also allegedly had planned the attack down to where he intended to start shooting – from inside the mosque’s tower. “It will be great,” Bolatete told the undercover officer, according to the criminal complaint. At another point in the conversation, Bolatete allegedly said he was prepared to die during the attack. “I’m not thinking of getting caught … I’ll die there in that area,” he said, according to police. “They’ll be some sort of suicide thing … suicide by police.” The suspect also allegedly confessed to killing a police officer in the Philippines after an argument about a parking spot. The date and validity of that alleged incident is not yet known. A bond hearing is set for Bolatete Tuesday afternoon at the federal courthouse in Jacksonville. A former co-worker of Bolatete told News4Jax that she was shocked to learn of his arrest. “He’s a sweet old man who wouldn’t hurt a fly,” she said, adding that she’d never heard him say anything derogatory about Muslims. Bolatete works at a liquor store, his brother, Pete Bolatete, told the television station. “He is a gun aficionado. He likes to collect guns,” the brother said. “Really, we talk about what we are going to do when we retire and go back to the Phillipines. Talking about, maybe starting a gun club.” Tips? Feedback?

http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-john-conyers-son-20171205-story.html,"WASHINGTON — The son of Rep. John Conyers Jr. - the embattled congressman who announced his sudden retirement Tuesday - may be headed for his father's seat, carrying on a decades-long political dynasty in Michigan. Conyers, D-Mich., resigned Tuesday amid allegations of sexual harassment; in doing so, the erstwhile dean of the House endorsed his eldest son, John Conyers III, to take his place representing Michigan's 13th Congressional District, which includes Detroit. The younger Conyers has been one of his father's fiercest defenders as the 88-year-old faced increasing pressure from Democratic leaders to step aside when a growing number of female former aides accused him of mistreatment and unwanted advances. ""It's very unfortunate to see him fight so long for so many people and to automatically have the allegations assumed to be true,"" John Conyers III told reporters last week, according to NBC affiliate WDIV. ""And of course, with sexual assault, women are to be believed. But in this instance, he has no history of this. ""And I think that if we're not going to make [Sen.] Al Franken resign when we have evidence of him groping a woman while she was asleep . . . it's disconcerting to me to see the way my father is being treated after he's given so much to this country, not just for black people but for people alike."" Of his father, he added: ""He fights for everyone."" Here's what we know about John Conyers III. He lacks political experience. Conyers is 27 and from Detroit. He attended Morehouse College as well as New York University, according to his contributor bio on HuffPost. That bio, whose details The Washington Post has not yet confirmed, identifies Conyers as ""a partner at Detroit's first minority run hedge fund"" and ""a seasoned multi-discipline consultant who has provided fundraising and social media services to both political and business clients."" It also says he served as an intern in the Department of Community Outreach in the Israeli Embassy in Washington. ""John is committed to melding community engagement, entertainment and politics,"" the bio states. He caused public headaches for his father in 2010. In 2010, MLive.com reported that John Conyers III was cited for speeding in his father's Cadillac Escalade - or rather, the government-leased vehicle his father used as a member of Congress. There were also reports that year that the younger Conyers had driven the vehicle to a rap concert and that it was broken into, according to MLive.com. The then-20-year-old reported to police that two laptops had been stolen from the Cadillac, along with tens of thousands of dollars worth of concert tickets. After the incident, the elder Conyers apologized. Conyers resigns from Congress amid harassment allegations, endorses son to succeed him ""I have just learned about the inappropriate use of a congressional vehicle by my son over the Thanksgiving holiday,"" he said in a statement at the time, according MLive.com. ""I am sorry it happened and will make sure that it does not happen again."" The Detroit Free Press reported that the congressman said he reimbursed the Treasury Department more than $5,600 for his son's unofficial use of taxpayer money. A photo on social media at the time showed his son in a Cadillac with a bottle of French champagne, according to an MLive.com article. The story's headline: ""The fabulous online life of John Conyers III, or why his family needs to do damage control immediately."" He's an opinionated writer. In a HuffPost op-ed, under the headline ""Orange Watergate: The Inevitable Impeachment of the 45th President,"" Conyers wrote that the ""reactionary and cavalier nature of the president will ultimately be his down fall.

ABC proved its network has a ""fake news"" problem, after false reports about a former Trump advisor led to a correspondent's suspension. The incident reflected on ABC as a whole because it took the network so long to acknowledge and correct the error, according to MRC Vice President of Business and Culture Dan Gainor. He said it should also leave people wondering “how can you trust anything” from ABC. ABC Chief Investigative Correspondent Brian Ross incorrectly reported on Dec. 1, that former national security advisor Michael Flynn was prepared to testify that Donald Trump asked him to contact Russians. If that were true, it would have been a bombshell revelation. But ABC got it wrong. So wrong, it suspended Ross for four weeks without pay beginning Dec. 2. In reality, Trump made that request after he had already won the election. It took ABC a full day to admit the claim needed “correction,” not just “clarification.” “It’s not just what he did that was wrong, it’s ABC’s editorial process that let it get through, it’s ABC’s reluctance to call it an error that needed correction,” Gainor said on the Dec. 4, Fox Business’ After the Bell, “At that point if you’re an investor, you’re wondering, ‘how can you can trust anything that ABC’s putting out?’”    Ross’ report was especially egregious given his personal history of false reporting, After the Bell co-host Melissa Francis suggested. She cited Ross’ 2012 report that falsely accused a Tea Party member of being the responsible for the movie theater mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado. Gainor had another example, citing ABC’s “pink slime” controversy which began in 2012. ABC’s reporting about Beef Products Inc resulted in a lawsuit and a huge settlement in the company’s favor. The Walt Disney Company, owner of ABC, reportedly paid out at least $177 million in settlement fees to the beef company in August 2017. A lawyer representing the beef company told The New York Times the settlement was much larger, and that Disney’s insurers “are paying the rest.” The mission of the Media Research Center is to create a media culture in America where

https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/12/05/69-year-old-man-accused-of-plotting-mass-shooting-at-florida-isl/23298183/," Authorities have arrested a 69-year-old man who they say was planning a mass shooting at an Islamic center in Jacksonville, Florida. Bernandino Gawala ""Nandie"" Bolatete faces charges of knowingly receiving and possessing a silencer without registering it as required by federal law, according to the authorities. At a Monday press conference, Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said Bolatete, ""had expressed a strong anti-Islamic sentiment"" and ""had weaponry to carry out the attack."" A criminal complaint released by authorities said Bolatete had been under investigation since October, when a tipster notified authorities of the alleged plot. Authorities said they immediately devised a plan to protect the mosque and to have an undercover officer befriend Bolatete, a Jacksonville resident. ""Due to many safeguards we had in place during this investigation, at no time were ... any of the members of (the center) at risk,"" FBI Special Agent in Charge Charles Spencer said Monday. Bolatete was arrested Friday after buying a silencer from the undercover officer. The suspect could face more charges, officials said. (FBI) The complaint contains chilling excerpts of comments allegedly made by Bolatete during extensive recorded conversations and text messages. According to police, he told the undercover officer that his health was declining due to kidney problems and he wanted to ""shoot up"" a mosque before he died. ""I just want to give these freaking people a taste of their own medicine ... they are the ones who are always doing these shootings,"" Bolatete wrote in a Nov. 14 text message, authorities said. According to the FBI, Bolatete said he planned to carry out the attack at the Islamic Center of Northeast Florida on St. Johns Bluff Road. Bolatete told the undercover officer he owned several guns, including an AR-15 rifle, police said. He also allegedly had planned the attack down to where he intended to start shooting – from inside the mosque's tower. ""It will be great,"" Bolatete told the undercover officer, according to the criminal complaint. At another point in the conversation, Bolatete allegedly said he was prepared to die during the attack. ""I'm not thinking of getting caught ... I'll die there in that area,"" he said, according to police. ""They'll be some sort of suicide thing ... suicide by police."" The suspect also allegedly confessed to killing a police officer in the Philippines after an argument about a parking spot. The date and validity of that alleged incident is not yet known. A bond hearing is set for Bolatete Tuesday afternoon at the federal courthouse in Jacksonville. A former co-worker of Bolatete told News4Jax that she was shocked to learn of his arrest. ""He's a sweet old man who wouldn't hurt a fly,"" she said, adding that she'd never heard him say anything derogatory about Muslims. Bolatete works at a liquor store, his brother, Pete Bolatete, told the television station. ""He is a gun aficionado. He likes to collect guns,"" the brother said. ""Really, we talk about what we are going to do when we retire and go back to the Phillipines. Talking about, maybe starting a gun club."" Tips? Feedback?

http://rssfeeds.indystar.com/~/489069410/0/indystar/letterstotheeditor~Letters-Mass-shootings-will-continue-to-claim-lives-in-US/,"I am so tired of the endless talk on the news after a mass shooting. Who was the shooter? Why did he do it? What can we learn to prevent this kind of person from getting their hands on a weapon like this (assault rifle, pistol with a large magazine, etc.)? Here are the answers: They are almost all males, mostly young, with some grievance against a lover, family, fellow workers, other races, certain religions, or just his status in life, and some have a history of mental illness. He may claim to act because of the tenets of some group, but not have any organizational ties. There are millions people like him all over the world. Only a very few will decide to act violently on their grievance or frustration. But just as with predicting which uranium atom will split, there is no way to pick out which one ahead of time, with one exception. He will almost always live in the United States. Only here is exists easy access to the means to act out mass murder. Elsewhere, a few people may be killed with less lethal weapons, but not crowds. The frequency of these acts in this country is increasing. There is no reason to think it will decrease. Not until society decides that what some men wrote 200 years ago, when firearms could be fired about three times a minute, does not rule out stringent restrictions on weapons intended for the battlefield in civilian hands. No one needs such a weapon to protect them. We can all live without them. Hundreds of us will die through no fault of our own as long as we insist on living with them the way we do now. Stephen R. Dunlop, MD Indianapolis Logging would destroy Yellowwood State Forest's ecosystem The state’s plans to log the Yellowwood State Forest have been criticized by people who want the forest to be left alone, as a common resource for the public to enjoy, a concept that conflicts with the thinking of professional foresters. Foresters are trained to selectively harvest trees from forests. They assure us that taking some trees out does not harm the forest, but just makes room for a new generation. But what they are cutting is a forest ecosystem, which is a far more complex entity than a bunch of trees, because each of the components of an ecosystem interact with the others.In one of his essays, Wendell Berry described an ecologically sound woodland as one in which there is a wide “diversity of the species and ages of the plants from the lowliest flowers and shrubs to the tallest trees.” In such a forest, you hear songbirds, which are there because there are plenty of places to nest and feed. If you don’t hear the birds, you are destroying the forest ecosystem.Do foresters listen for the birds? Pascal de Caprariis Morgantown Hoosiers have the moral obligation to limit carbon footprints Thank you, IndyStar, for the recent series on solar, Senate Bill 309 and the power of coporate lobbying. As a citizen seriously concerned about our environment and the compelling need for clean energy I have found it very frustrating to interest our state legislature in these issues. We were fortunate to be able to invest in solar for our home in Carmel just last spring, and to now experience the sun producing much of our electricity. With net metering and the federal tax credit our payback will be anywhere from six to 10 years, depending on how much electric rates rise. Even with the terrible SB 309 it would be worth it for folks to invest in solar within the next five years. It is also gratifying knowing that I am reducing my carbon footprint and helping mitigate climate change. I recently attended a seminar presented by the Purdue Climate Research Center and sponsored by the Carmel Green Initiative. I was struck by how much climate change is already affecting Indiana. One projection stood out: the last few decades Indiana has averaged 17 days of 90 degrees or higher over a calendar year; by 2050 it will average 71 days of 90 degrees or higher. This is based on the current rate of carbon emissions being put dumped into our atmosphere. It seems to me we have a moral responsibility to limit our carbon footprint wherever possible for the sake of our planet and future generations. Our state government needs to get on board with this and work for its citizens and not the utilities. Encouraging renewable energy and energy efficiency will not only help our environment it will help develop good jobs. SB 309, as your article pointed out, will put a damper on the fastest growing part of our economy. Thank you again for an excellent series on solar! Dennis Shock Carmel "

While the depressive SVOD original series seems to focus mainly on the central character’s woes, the show’s writers do a great job at peppering in current socio-political topics. Since mass shootings have unfortunately become a global issue, it makes sense to analyze what the episode got right (or wrong) about how we respond to these tragic events. The film that Princess Carolyn was preparing to market prior to the fictional mass shooting was titled Ms. Taken, which stars Courtney Portnoy and features an action scene that is essentially a mall shootout. The film’s producer is informed of the tragic event and calls for an emergency board meeting. One thing that the episode blatantly does is dehumanize the media and entertainment industry. While the room full of industry heads panic and try to brainstorm a way to market the film in light of the event, Portnoy makes sure to say “…of course my thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families.” The rest of the room quickly agrees and makes sure to repeat her “thoughts and prayers” comment, which they continue to do throughout the episode. One could say that this was a dig at our celebrities who are often quick to take to social media to offer their condolences. It is not our place to say whether their concerns are sincere, but from a PR standpoint, it’s certainly the appropriate action. While still in the boardroom, the group receives notifications about two more mass shootings that occur, which was a show of how unfortunately common these events have become. Princess Carolyn then comes up with the idea of having journalist Diane Nguyen take the pro-gun side to help bolster positive attention towards the upcoming film. The reluctant Diane spends some time with Courtney who is successful in piquing her interest in carrying a gun. In typical fashion, Diane embarks on a tirade about how women should carry guns to stay safe. Her stance attracts a ton of media attention, which goes as far as to infer that if a woman were to shoot an unarmed person, politicians would immediately work to ban the use of firearms by women. This was clearly a dig at how our society and media tends to profile a terrorist simply by their gender or looks. Is the episode right about how we’ve approached mass shootings around the world? Was the show insensitive in their approach or just realistic? Is it wrong for us to spread hate and push our own personal agendas after such tragic events? Well, of course. There are certainly better ways we can all respond to these tragic events, starting with how we respond to the media and position ourselves on social platforms. While more of a personal dramedy, at the very least Bojack Horseman did a great job at presenting a touchy subject and making us take a look at how we respond to them as a society.

http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/11/20/sell-your-tesla-stock-marvell-gets-in-the-chips-with-cavium-deal/,"Trending: Sell Your Tesla?: That’s the opinion of JP Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman, who on Monday reiterated his underweight rating — the equivalent of “sell” — on the electric carmaker, on the grounds that Tesla could see more production and financial issues related to its much ballyhooed Model 3. The car’s widespread release has already been delayed for months due to production line matters. Unlike traditional automakers that can spread the costs of developing electric and hybrid cars across multiple vehicle models and traditional gasoline-powered cars, Brinkman said Tesla’s high-priced vehicles may take longer to provide the company with consistent profit margins to match the cars’ sticker prices. Brinkman also maintained his $185-a-share target price on Tesla’s stock — around 40 percent less than Tesla shares’ Monday closing price of $308.74 a share. No Turkey, Just Chips: While a lot of companies in the Bay Area are known for closing up shop, or at least taking it easy during Thanksgiving week, Marvell Technology decided to go on a little buying binge before the Black Friday deals kick in. Marvell said it would pay $6 billion to acquire fellow chipmaker Cavium, of San Jose, to boost up its presence in the market for semiconductors used in wireless communications, security and the automotive industry. Apple vs. FBI, Round 2?: Could Apple be about to get into it, again, with the FBI over an iPhone used in a mass shooting? The FBI has served Apple with a warrant to get information from the iPhone used by the shooter who killed 26 people and injured 20 more at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas on Nov. 5. Apple says it offered to help the FBI with any legal requests it had, but that the bureau didn’t take the company up on the offer to open the iPhone by using Touch ID without a passcode within 48 hours. The Way To San Jose…: Will cost you more than 200,000 bucks. Actually, you will need a household income of $216,181, to be exact, in order to afford what is considered to be a median-priced house in the San Jose metro area, according to a new report from the mortgage information website HSH.com.

              since At least 26 people were killed in a mass shooting at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on Sunday. Identities of the victims have not been released, but the church's pastor Frank Pomeroy confirmed to ABC News that his 14-year-old daughter was among those who died. The pastor's wife Sherri Pomeroy told NBC News that she and her husband were out of town when the shooting took place, but their daughter was inside the church. Frank Pomeroy described his daughter, Annabelle Renee Pomeroy, as ""one very beautiful, special child."" Local authorities said a man walked into the church while service was underway and opened fire. One witness said she heard at least 20 shots. The suspect was reportedly shot and killed after a brief police chase. Authorities have not confirmed whether the suspect killed himself or was brought down by officers. Officials said the victims of the shooting ranged in age from 5 to 72. A spokesman for University Hospital in San Antonio said the hospital has received nine patients from the shooting, four of whom are children.

        Brianna Sacks Last updated on November 5, 2017, at 7:59 p.m. ET Posted on November 5, 2017, at 2:39 p.m. ET At least 26 are dead after a gunman opened fire during a Sunday service at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, making it the deadliest shooting in the state's history. At 11:20 a.m., a man dressed in all black and tactical gear started firing at the small church, officials said at a press conference. He then crossed to the right side of the building, still firing, before going inside and killing 23 people and injuring dozens more. When he left the building, ""a local resident grabbed his rifle and engaged that suspect,"" said Freeman Martin, regional director of the Texas Department of Public Safety. Officials did not immediately release the suspect's name, saying only that he was a young white male, maybe in his early twenties. However, multiple media outlets identified the gunman as 26-year-old Devin P. Kelley, who was found dead inside his vehicle after it veered off the road while being pursued by authorities. Twenty-three people died inside the church, two people were killed outside, and one person died from their injuries after being transported from the scene, Martin said. The victims' ages range from 5 to 72 years old. ""There's a lot of work to be done,"" Martin said. ""We are only hours into this investigation, which is going to take significant amounts of time."" ""We have the church, we have outside the church. We have where the suspect vehicle was located. We have been following up on the suspect and where he's from, his residence,"" the director said. Officials cautioned that the death toll could rise. ""We ask for God's comfort, for God's guidance, and for God's healing, for all those who are suffering,"" Gov. Gregg Abbott said at the press conference. I ask for every mom and dad at home tonight that you put your arm around your kid and give your kid a big hug and let them know how much you love them."" Sandy Ward, whose four grandchildren and daughter-in-law were inside the church, told MSNBC News that her son saw ""bodies on top of bodies."" ""They were having to move the bodies to see if anybody underneath was alive or breathing or anything,"" she said. Ward told the outlet that one of her granddaughters, a 7-year-old named Emily, was ""not going to make it."" Her 5-year-old grandson was shot four times and ""has been in surgery for several hours.""

He told ABC News that ""she was one very beautiful, special child."" Pomeroy and his wife, Sherri, were not at the church when the shooting occurred, according to CNN and NBC News. The CEO of Connally Memorial Medical Center, a nearby hospital, told BuzzFeed News the hospital had received eight shooting victims on Sunday, four of whom were transferred out to University Hospital in San Antonio. The four who remained at Connally Memorial were in stable condition — three of them have been discharged, he said. A staff member at the University Hospital in San Antonio said he could not provide any information. Residents of the small town have been gathering outside the church and at a nearby community center, anxiously awaiting any news about friends and family members. Families in tears wait to see if their family and friends are safe. Praying for the safety of all those involved. Regina Rodriguez, in pink, is here to check on her father who she believes was in the church. She fears he is dead. A spokesperson for the FBI's San Antonio field office, Michelle Lee, confirmed to BuzzFeed News that the agency is assisting local law enforcement in Sutherland Springs. ""We are responding to provide assistance, and there have been reports of multiple injuries and fatalities. We don't have those numbers yet,"" said Lee. Texas Gov.

https://www.inquisitr.com/4612676/jelani-maraj-brother-of-nicky-minaj-convicted-of-sexually-assaulting-a-child-under-13-years-old/,"On November 9, 38-year-old Jelani Maraj, brother of rapper Nicki Minaj, was found guilty of multiple crimes related to the sexual assault of a child under 13 years old. A Nassau County jury handed down guilty verdicts on the charges of endangering the welfare of a child and predatory sexual assault on a child younger than 13 on Thursday, after more-than-a-month-long trial. When he is sentenced next month, PEOPLE reports that he could be spending 25 years to life behind bars. Over the course of his lengthy trial, Jelani Maraj denied the allegations against him, and his legal defense team claimed that the claims against him were nothing more than a hoax concocted to extort money from his famous (and famously wealthy) sister, Nicki Minaj. According to Maraj's defense lawyers, the family of the young victim in the case were seeking $25 million in ""hush money."" According to the case presented by Nassau County prosecutors, Jelani Maraj began sexually abusing his child victim when she was just 11 years old. Between April and November of 2015, the prosecution claimed that Maraj raped the young girl repeatedly while her mother was at work. The victim, now 14 years old, testified under oath that during the period of her abuse, Maraj referred to her as ""his puppet"" and told her that she had ""no say"" regarding what he did to her. The young sexual assault survivor added that Nicki Minaj's brother went so far as to physically assault her if she attempted to refuse his sexual attacks and warned her that his sexual abuse was to be kept a secret.  At that time, the older brother of rapper Nicki Minaj allegedly warned the little boy that if he told about what he saw, he would be taken away from his mother.  Nicki Minaj has opted not to comment on the allegations against her older brother and has continued to remain silent following his conviction on the charges of endangering the welfare of a child and predatory sexual assault on a child younger than 13. Shortly after his 2015 arrest, however, Minaj did share a family photo featuring her brother and a praising caption on social media. [Featured Image by Nassau County Police Department]"

http://www.sfgate.com/nation/article/News-of-the-Day-From-Across-the-Nation-12372685.php,"1 Las Vegas shooting: Attorneys who filed one of the first lawsuits after the Oct. 1 mass shooting that killed 58 concertgoers and left hundreds injured on the Las Vegas Strip are filing four more cases on behalf of more than 450 claimants. This time, they’re suing in Los Angeles — not in Nevada — against companies including Mandalay Bay resort and concert venue owner MGM Resorts International. Houston-based lawyer Chad Pinkerton said Monday many of the plaintiffs live in California, and they’re seeking a court and jury that won’t be swayed by the influence of a casino that’s the largest employer in Nevada. MGM Resorts says it won’t litigate the lawsuits in the press. In statements, the company has blamed the massacre on the gunman, Stephen Paddock. 2 Ex-officer sentenced: 
                  A white former police officer in Oklahoma was sentenced Monday to 15 years in prison for the fatal off-duty shooting of his daughter’s black boyfriend, after four trials spanning nearly a year including three that resulted in hung juries. Former Tulsa officer Shannon Kepler was convicted last month of first-degree manslaughter in the 2014 slaying of 19-year-old Jeremey Lake. Kepler, who retired from the force after he was charged, told investigators that Lake was armed and that he shot him in self-defense. Police never found a weapon at the scene. A single black juror was seated for each of Kepler’s four trials, and civil rights activists accused Kepler’s lawyers of purposely trying to exclude potential black candidates, a charge they denied. 3 Haitian immigrants: The Trump administration said Monday it is ending a temporary residency permit program that has allowed almost 60,000 citizens from Haiti to live and work in the United States since a 2010 powerful earthquake shook the Caribbean nation. The Homeland Security Department said conditions in Haiti have improved significantly, so the benefit will be extended one last time — until July 2019 — to give Haitians time to prepare to return home. Advocates and members of Congress from both parties had asked the Trump administration for an 18-month extension of the program, known as Temporary Protected Status. Advocates for Haitians criticized the decision, arguing the conditions in the island nation haven’t improved nearly enough for Haitians to be deported. 4 Sexual harassment: 
                  PBS says it is immediately halting distribution of Charlie Rose’s interview program and CBS News suspended him following a Washington Post report of eight women who accused the veteran newsman of multiple unwanted sexual advances and inappropriate behavior. The women, three of whom spoke on the record, accused Rose of groping them, walking naked in front of them and relating an erotic dream. Rose told the Post that he was “deeply embarrassed” and apologized for his behavior. 5 Helicopter crash: A medical helicopter crashed in rural Arkansas, killing all three people on board. The Arkansas Department of Emergency Management said the copter went down Sunday night near DeWitt, about 60 miles southeast of Little Rock. Officials said the crew was flying from Pine Bluff to Helena Regional Medical Center in Helena-West Helena. Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Lynn Lunsford said no patients were on board. FAA investigators were heading to the crash site, and the National Transportation Safety Board is also investigating. Chronicle News Services"

Police said Randolph was asked to leave a service at the Greater Sunrise Missionary Baptist Church Sunday, after which he waited in the street outside with a gun.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/11/07/democrats-to-try-forcing-vote-on-bill-establishing-select-panel-on-gun-violence/,"This article is more than 1 year old Two days after a mass shooting at a Texas church, Democratic lawmakers failed Tuesday to force a vote on legislation establishing a select committee on preventing gun violence. The proposal is among more than 30 pieces of legislation introduced by Democrats this year to combat gun violence and bolster federal funding to research and assist people with mental illness and the effects of gun violence. Of those bills, just four have Republican sponsors, according to a document compiled by Democratic aides and shared with The Washington Post. Congress hasn’t sorted out what to do about bump stocks. The Texas shooting isn’t likely to jump-start debate, either. The measure that Democrats failed to advance Tuesday was introduced by Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), who leads a Democratic working group on gun violence established after the 2012 mass shooting at a Connecticut elementary school. The bill would establish a 12-member committee divided evenly between Republicans and Democrats to study the causes of mass shootings, look at ways to revamp the gun background-check system, research how mentally ill people obtain firearms and explore ways to keep domestic abusers from buying firearms. “You know how many special committees they’ve created to chase Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama around that don’t have any bearing on saving lives of the people we represent?” Thompson said in an interview Monday, referring to Republicans. “A select committee can determine how we can take steps to enhance gun-violence prevention, but they won’t even do that.” Thompson’s bill is sponsored by 158 other Democrats and no Republicans. During scheduled votes on other bills, Democrats used procedural motions to try to introduce the bill on the floor and get a vote. It failed overwhelmingly. But the development is likely to spark fresh Democratic attacks on Republicans for blocking such legislation — amid polling that shows a majority of Americans want Congress to take some action on gun violence. While most Americans do not support restricting gun ownership for law-abiding citizens, polls show most support expanding the national background-check system and banning firearms sales to stalkers or violent criminals. The push to pass new legislation follows bolder steps taken by Democrats last year. Shortly before the July Fourth recess, a band of Democratic lawmakers camped out on the House floor demanding up-or-down votes on gun-control legislation, an ultimately futile move that earned a strong rebuke from House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.). Thompson said Monday that he doesn’t expect colleagues to take similar steps in the wake of the most recent shootings. But he dismissed as “intellectually dishonest” claims by President Trump and GOP lawmakers that the best response to the shooting would be to focus on issues surrounding mental health. “This is the same president that is trying to get rid of the mental-health funding,” Thompson said. Trump’s proposed budget would slash funding for mental-health treatment and research programs funded through the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services, among others. If Republicans are serious about addressing mental-health issues, Thompson said, they should restore an Obama-era regulation that would have blocked mentally ill individuals receiving Social Security benefits from being able to purchase firearms. Instead, Republicans voted to repeal that policy this year. Concerns about how gun-control laws are enforced came to light Monday as the Air Force acknowledged that it failed to follow policies for alerting federal law enforcement about Devin Kelley’s violent past, enabling the former service member, who killed at least 26 churchgoers Sunday in Sutherland Springs, Tex., to obtain firearms before the shooting rampage. Kelley should have been barred from purchasing firearms and body armor, because of his domestic-violence conviction in 2014 while serving at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. Kelley was sentenced to a year in prison and kicked out of the military with a bad-conduct discharge after two counts of domestic abuse against his wife and a child, according to Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek. The Air Force says it failed to follow procedures, allowing Texas church shooter to obtain firearms Ryan said Tuesday that the Air Force’s oversight will earn congressional scrutiny. “This man should not have had a gun. . . . How did this slip through the cracks? . . . How did he slip through the system and get a gun?” Ryan said in his first public comments on the shooting. Ryan added his “deep sorrow” for the victims, saying, “There should be no more safe place from the evils of the world than a house of worship.” Also Monday, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) announced that his panel would soon hold a hearing on “bump stocks,” a device used to make some semiautomatic weapons fire like automatic weapons. The device was found on some firearms used in the mass shooting last month in Las Vegas that was the deadliest in modern U.S. history. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is reviewing whether it can reverse an Obama-era ruling that legalized bump stocks or whether Congress would have to enact legislation. ATF officials are set to brief members of the House Judiciary Committee on their review this week. Mike DeBonis contributed to this report.

http://nypost.com/2017/11/06/va-secretary-texas-church-shooter-is-no-veteran-to-me/,"Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin has condemned the actions of Texas church shooter Devin Kelley — saying he does not consider the former US airman to be a veteran, but rather an “evil person” and a “criminal.” Speaking at a National Press Club event in Washington on Monday, Shulkin noted how the 26-year-old was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his then-wife and stepson and then thrown in a military prison for 12 months and discharged for bad conduct in 2014. “In my opinion, I do not consider him a veteran,” Shulkin said. “That would give him much more respect than he deserves. He is a criminal. He was convicted … and does not deserve to have the same title as the men and women who served this country honorably.” Kelley killed 26 people on Sunday and wounded 20 more during his mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs. He later took his own life after being shot at and pursued by two local residents. Many people, including President Trump, have argued that Sunday’s massacre was the result of Kelley being mentally ill. Shulkin said Monday that the young man would not have had access to shrinks or mental health doctors on account of his controversial status with the Air Force. “Those dishonorable discharged have violated the law, have violated our morals and ethics, and I do not believe deserve the types of services and benefits and VA would not be providing those benefits,” he explained. “This is not a person who has ever been treated in the VA system and would not be eligible for those benefits.” Shulkin went on to say, though, that it’s still early to tell if Kelley was actually suffering from a mental illness at the time of the shooting. “Unfortunately, in this world there are people that are evil and there are people that are criminal,” he said. “And you don’t always know the reason why, but I certainly believe that he was an evil person.” Share Selection"

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/uproxx/features/~3/vOuPrks-V0M/,"Following the mass shooting that killed dozens at a Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, authorities have learned a lot about suspected shooter Devin Patrick Kelley and his past. Kelley, like many other mass shooters, had a history of domestic violence, which led to a court martial and his bad conduct discharge from the Air Force after a conviction. To make matters worse, after a clerical error, the Air Force didn’t enter Kelley’s information into a federal database, which meant that he wouldn’t have been flagged when purchasing a firearm. Now, the Pentagon is investigating just how that clerical error happened. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis announced Tuesday that the department’s watchdog was looking into the circumstances of the Air Force’s failure to report Kelley’s conviction to the FBI’s National Criminal Information Center database. The DoD needs “find out what’s going on,” Mattis said. In a development that isn’t going to please Mattis and makes the Air Force look even worse, outlets are also reporting that Kelley allegedly escaped from a behavioral health center in New Mexico after being referred there by the Air Force due to his threats against Air Force officers and attempts to sneak weapons onto a base. In February, President Trump signed a bill removing certain people with mental health issues from the national background check database. While this has no bearing on the present case, it doesn’t bode well for the future. (Via Associated Press & NBC Houston)"
https://www.bustle.com/p/gun-background-checks-on-black-friday-broke-last-years-record-by-over-17000-requests-5552159,"News  Big screen televisions, video game consoles, and the latest craze in kids' toys are popular purchases for eager Black Friday shoppers. But the biggest day for holiday shopping is also reportedly a big day for rifle, shotgun, and handgun sales. In fact, Nov. 24, which fell just weeks after 26 people were killed in a shooting at a Texas church, saw the FBI receive more than 200,000 requests for gun background checks. That means Black Friday 2017 set a new record for the number of gun background checks demanded in a single day, USA Today reported. The FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) received 203,086 requests for background checks this past Friday alone, as Black Friday shoppers rushed to snap up firearms amid a flurry of deals. The number represents a significant jump from the previous single-day record of 185,713 requests for background checks. That record was reportedly set last year on Black Friday. And in 2015, the FBI received 185,345 background check requests, surpassing the previous single-day record of 117,170 set on Dec. 21, 2012, according to Fortune. But what's behind the boost in sales? While President Donald Trump's pro-gun stance earned him an early endorsement from the National Rifle Association, it's also reportedly caused a decline in firearms sales as potential buyers cease to fear a federal crackdown on gun sales or gun control efforts. According to CNN, firearms dealers were hoping that rebates and deep discounts would lure in customers on Black Friday and boost recently slagging sales. Two of the industry's biggest manufactures, Remington Arms Company and Browning Arms Company, offered cash rebates of up to $200 on shotguns and $100 on rifles this year, the cable news network reported. Cabela's, a specialty retailer for outdoor recreation sports such as hunting and shooting, rolled out 14 days of rifle, handgun, and ammunition deals in an effort to drum up sales. And if the new record for single-day gun background checks set Friday is any indication, those retailers' efforts appear to have worked. However, sales and slashed prices may not be the only thing drawing in firearms customers this year. According to a 2015 report by TIME magazine, recent mass shootings may also play a key role. ""Spikes in gun sales regularly occur following mass shootings, often over concerns of increased gun regulation or because people are looking for increased protection,"" TIME reported. A total of 26 people were killed Nov. 5 when a gunman opened fire on people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. State officials have said it was the largest mass shooting in Texas' history. Reports that the shooter, a court-martialed Air Force veteran, cleared a background check enabling him to buy his weapon have spurred renewed debate about gun control. In fact, just days before Black Friday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced he'd ordered a complete review of the database used by the FBI to conduct background checks on gun buyers. The purpose of the review is to determine why necessary information was not being properly reported to the NICS database. A background check on the Texas church shooter, for instance, should have prevented him from being able to purchase a firearm due to his court martial. While background checks are a requirement for any gun purchase made through a federally-licensed firearm dealer, they can't necessarily estimate the number of firearms actually sold. That's because a buyer looking to purchase multiple firearms in a single purchase only has to submit to one background check. In other words, the number of firearms sold on Black Friday this year could be significantly higher than the 203,086 requests for gun background checks. Choose an edition:"
http://www.ibtimes.com/alex-jones-suggests-las-vegas-mass-shooting-was-fake-2620411,"American Radio show host and conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones, in the Nov. 27 edition of “The Alex Jones Show” has claimed that the Las Vegas shooting was as phony as former President Barack Obama’s birth certificate. Jones was speaking to a caller on the show when he described the Las Vegas massacre to be fake. Read the transcript of the call here which was obtained from Media Matters for America. ALEX JONES (HOST): Well I know the FBI went and picked up the caller you heard earlier when he talked about it being an Islamic attack and there were shootings all over town and helicopters being used. And the FBI showed up and drugged the guy and then declared national security. He’s had to leave the country just over that, so do you think they’d be having the FBI at his house in two hours after he called in about that if it was just a rumor? No, they don’t want that discussed. So Vegas is as phony as a three dollar bill or as Obama’s birth certificate. CALLER: Wow. JONES: Isn’t that crazy? CALLER: That is so crazy, so many people died -- JONES: They had the Saudi military was having a convention there that week. CALLER: Yeah, because I remember the most I’ve heard is what you’ve gone over and the other guy that had some so much research into all the planes that had changed where they were -- JONES: Sure, well the FBI showed up and they told him, they said, “You talk about that again, we’re going to put you in prison because that’s classified information.” Even though he’d figured it out himself. The fact is the government, the military all know. They’ve been ordered not talk about it because it’s all part of this deal that Trump’s got with the Saudis. We’ll see if that’s really the case, but that was an Islamic terror attack from all the evidence we have. Jones also tweeted on his official page on Nov. 28 asking people to cast their votes for ""Fake News Awards"". In the list of options that the listeners could choose from, Las Vegas mass shooting was also included. Jones also ensured his listeners that he would announce the results on the Nov. 28 edition of the show. Check out his tweet here.  Jones, from Dallas, Texas, over the years has been at the center of a lot of controversies. Whether it is promoting Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting conspiracy theories or his opposing views towards gun control. Jones has gone as far as to blame the U.S. government for being involved in the Oklahoma City bombing, 9/11 attacks and the filming of fake moon landings in order to hide NASA’s technology. Jones describes himself as a libertarian and paleoconservative while others describe him as conservative, right-wing, alt-right and far right. New York magazine has also described Jones as ""America's leading conspiracy theorist"", while the Southern Poverty Law Center describes him as ""the most prolific conspiracy theorist in contemporary America""."

(Click here if you’re having trouble viewing this photo gallery or videos on a mobile device.) By John Woodrow Cox | Washington Post LAS VEGAS — The varsity cheerleaders had just finished practice when Natalia Baca stepped out into the school parking lot and spotted a tall, dark-haired teenager holding a bouquet of multicolored sunflowers. “Will you go to homecoming with me?” he said as she approached with her identical twin, Gianna, who had helped orchestrate the moment. Natalia pressed both hands against her cheeks and grinned, because no one had ever asked her to the dance before. “Yes,” Natalia answered, already imagining what she would look like in her open-back, iridescent white dress that flashed shades of pink and blue in the sunlight. They hugged and talked for a few minutes before she and Gianna had to go. The seniors, age 17, were running late for a country music concert. The Las Vegas sun had long faded beneath a distant mountain range on that first day in October, so the twins hurried back inside Faith Lutheran High to change clothes. Jason Aldean, Natalia’s favorite singer, was scheduled to perform the final set at that weekend’s Route 91 Harvest festival. Reading this on your phone?

It was a Sunday, a school night, so most people in the crowd of 22,000 would be adults, but some kids would be there, too, including 10 students from Faith, a private Christian academy in an affluent community of gated neighborhoods nine miles west of the Strip. And in that evening’s earliest moments, before the gunman high above them pulled the trigger, the twins and their classmates were eager for the week ahead — first the music, then the homecoming dress-up days, the silly lip-sync competition, the pep rally, the football game and, at last, on Saturday, the dance. About the time Natalia said yes in the parking lot, Faith juniors Shae Turner and Delaney Sylvester settled in 50 yards from the stage, right of the catwalk, on the side nearest Las Vegas Boulevard and the Mandalay Bay Resort. The morning before, Shae had posted a photo to Instagram from Friday night. In it, the two girls each posed with one hand positioned on a hip so their purple festival bracelets, that weekend’s status symbol, would be in view. The best friends, both in brown cowboy boots, stood with their backs to the neon-lit stage, eyes bright and smiles radiant. They’d each turned 17 just weeks before. Beneath the image, Shae wrote a caption: “country music makes us happy #route91.” For seven months, she had looked forward to this weekend. “Happy early Birthday present,” her mom had texted March 3 with an image of the ticket confirmation. “OMG I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!” Shae wrote back, with four heart emoji. “I’m freaking out… like on the verge of tears thank you!” The girls planned for weeks what they would wear to the festival and during homecoming week. Shae — the daughter of two FBI agents who had inherited her parents’ attention to detail – narrowed her Route 91 outfit options to seven before she texted photos to Delaney and they cut it down to three. They went to Forever 21 in a mall on the Strip to pick up yellow skirts and shirts for the school’s “Color Day” — “Nobody owns yellow,” Shae, the junior class treasurer, had unsuccessfully argued to her fellow student council members. At Delaney’s prodding, Shae picked a pair of four-inch floral Steve Madden heels for the dance that, by the time they headed to the register, she adored. For the festival weekend, Shae’s mom, Elena Turner, rented a room and stayed with the girls through Sunday morning at the Delano hotel, next to Mandalay Bay, so they wouldn’t have to drive home after each evening’s performances. In the lobby, before they headed to Route 91’s opening night, Elena gave them one last reminder. “If there’s an active shooter in the crowd,” she began, and Shae knew what came next. She’d been hearing that speech from her parents, who had met during their FBI training, for at least five years, ever since a movie theater massacre in Aurora, Colo., left 12 people dead. “Run until you can’t run,” Elena continued. “Hide until you can’t hide. Fight until you can’t fight.” Her daughter smiled. “Mom, don’t worry,” Shae said. “Everything will be fine.” Marie Langer’s mother, Susan, assumed everything would be fine, too. It was, after all, a country music festival, filled with people who’d come to take a break from their problems, not start any. Her daughter, also a Faith junior, had raved all weekend about how friendly the other concertgoers were. Determined to see Aldean up close, Marie had valeted her 2016 white Ford Mustang at Mandalay Bay at 2:30 that Sunday afternoon and walked over to the festival site a half-hour before the first band went on the main stage. She and a classmate, Summer Stadtlander, both 16, were so giddy that, on their way, they’d skipped together up Las Vegas Boulevard. Summer had texted Marie that morning, saying she’d just listened to “so much jason aldean and I’m so excited now.” “ME TOO,” Marie responded. Then: “IM EXCITED TO BE FRONT ROW.” Then: “AND TOUCH HIM.” Marie, an accomplished equestrian show jumper, had twice traveled to Europe and was a veteran of superstar concerts – Rihanna, Drake, Nicki Minaj – but something about Aldean’s simple, Georgia-bred twang always made her feel good. She had followed his tour schedule for two years, hoping to hear him in person, before her chance finally came that Sunday. The 15-acre venue was mostly empty when the girls arrived, giving them their choice of places to stand along a railing that lined the catwalk. “Should we go on the right side today?” Marie asked, but Summer suggested they stick with the left, near where the friends had stood both previous nights. They normally did homework on Sundays but wanted no distractions on this one. Before they got there, Marie had already finished her American Revolution reading guides and Summer her Algebra II assignment. At 4:50 p.m., Marie — whose fingernails were painted paisley and plaid, because that was the most country design she could think of — sent her mom a photo of a guitar pick she’d caught when a member of the Josh Abbott Band tossed it out. Not long after, a stagehand gave her a copy of Big & Rich’s set list. “Oh my gosh,” Marie shrieked, bouncing up and down. At 7:51, her mom texted to ask who was playing. “Waiting for Jake Owen then Jason aldean,” Marie responded. “Be safe. We luv u tons.” “Luv u.” At 9:30, her mom sent a final message: “Call house phone uf emergency. Cell phone going off.” Then the lights went dark and the crowd roared as Marie pointed her phone’s camera to record Aldean’s entrance. His introduction video, a collage of mud, pickups and cowboy hats, appeared on a massive screen behind the stage. “The suspense right now is insane,” Marie told a girl standing next to her. In the crowd behind them, about 30 yards back and to the right, Natalia felt the same. She’d gotten a ticket for Sunday just hours earlier, delighting her not only because of Aldean but because Gianna would be there, too. She and her twin did almost everything together. It had been that way from the beginning, when the girls were born eight weeks premature and began their lives fighting to keep them. They’d never spent more than 48 hours apart. Now the sisters were sharing the first music festival they’d gone to without a parent, and Aldean was on stage, crooning about people tougher than they look. “They ain’t seen the blood, sweat and tears it took to live their dreams,” Natalia sang along as she danced with friends, and Gianna, a dozen feet away, did the same with her boyfriend. About 15 minutes into the set, a few others in their group told Natalia that they were heading to the bathrooms, in the back of the venue, and asked if she needed to go, too. She did, but refused to miss a single song. “I’ll just wait,” she said. “It’s okay.” She stayed, swaying and laughing until 10:05 p.m., when the sound of pops from somewhere faraway cut through the music. “Did you hear that?” she asked a friend. Maybe, she thought, someone had set off fireworks. Natalia peered up above the stage and into the night sky, searching for bursts of light. All she saw was darkness. — “Get down!” someone in the crowd shouted as Natalia watched Aldean rush offstage amid a second barrage. She dropped to her knees and covered her head. A friend, Kaitlyn Burton, 19, huddled alongside, clutching Natalia’s hands. “What’s happening?” Natalia asked, unaware that, just in front of where she was hunkered, a half dozen people had already collapsed to the turf, struck by bullets fired from Mandalay Bay’s 32nd floor, 400 yards away. Natalia looked up, trembling as she searched for Gianna in the chaotic,howling mass of bodies crouched and crawling around her. Her twin was nowhere in sight. “God, please help us,” she prayed, but now the wails grew louder, and the crackle drew closer. Then, suddenly, what felt like a steel medicine ball slammed into her right shoulder blade, striking with such force that she was shoved to the left, losing her grip on Kaitlyn’s hand. Natalia’s back stung, as though it had been lit ablaze. “Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!” she cried. The impact jolted her friend, too. Even before Kaitlyn saw the blood, she knew what that meant. “Natalia’s been shot,” she yelled at her boyfriend, Riley Van Buskirk, who until then had remained standing, frozen in shock. He stared down at the hole in Natalia’s back, then stripped off his long-sleeved denim Wrangler shirt and wrapped it diagonally around her chest and back, hoping it would apply enough pressure to slow the bleeding. As he helped her up, Riley felt the cracked bones along Natalia’s shoulders grind against each other. He feared what the bullet had done inside her. Overwhelmed, Natalia couldn’t process what was happening — the words that Kaitlyn had spoken or the burn now spreading from her back to her chest. And as she staggered to her feet, Natalia still didn’t see Gianna. Had her twin been shot, too? Then came more gunfire. “Run!” Kaitlyn hollered. At that moment, Shae, the daughter of the FBI agents, was already sprinting with her friend Delaney toward a row of outdoor beer vendors. When they reached them, the girls dove to the ground, cowering just beneath a purple billboard that overlooked Las Vegas Boulevard. “LIVE MUSIC,” it advertised, with an arrow pointing back toward the ongoing massacre behind them. Shae, who suspected it was gunfire as soon as she heard it, had immediately grabbed her friend’s arm and begun pushing through the crowd. She decided that fleeing toward the venue’s rear or east-side exits, along with thousands of other people, would leave the girls too exposed. Instead, Shae headed toward the nearest cover on the venue’s western edge. Now, with bullets spraying overhead, they were trapped. Shae pressed her cellphone against her ear. “Mom,” she said, “someone is shooting into the crowd.” “Are you sure?” asked Elena, who was in her bedroom, about to go to sleep. “Yes, I’m sure.” Then, what sounded to Elena’s trained ear like machine-gun fire exploded through the phone’s speaker. Stay calm, her mom told her. Stay calm. Elena, voice quavering, asked whether they could make it to Shae’s car, parked over the fence and across the street at Mandalay Bay. No, Shae said, because she thought the shots might be coming from that direction. The girls knew they had to make a choice: Stay put and risk a gunman finding them, or move and risk being sniped out in the open. Hands clutched, each promised to stay with the other, before Delaney, in a pause between salvos, suggested they keep going. The beer vendors were arranged in a semicircle that jutted out into the venue, so between bursts, they crept farther along, terrified of running into the end of a barrel around every bend. When they reached the far side, the girls realized that they were, again, trapped. A gate along the fence in front of them remained shut, and behind them, in the festival’s center, was nothing but uncovered space. “We can’t get out,” Shae told her mom. “There’s no exit.” Another blast of gunshots erupted. They looked for somewhere to hide, but this time, the space beneath the nearest canopy was already full. They couldn’t get in. The girls were exposed. “What do we even do?” asked Delaney, who’d begun to cry. Like our Facebook page for more conversation and news coverage from the Bay Area and beyond. It was then that a bald man who looked to be in his late 40s scrambled over, blanketing their bodies with his own. “Stay down,” the stranger said, as he placed his hand on Delaney’s head, pressing the American flag on her camouflage baseball cap against the pavement. And when that volley had subsided and the man had left, Delaney glanced back toward the fence. “Shae,” she said, “a gate opened up.” Up next to the stage, Marie and Summer, the other pair of Faith juniors, stood from where they’d ducked behind the catwalk, opposite Mandalay Bay, and darted toward an east exit. The girls, who’d both taken videos of the chaos by then, didn’t understand the moment’s gravity until they saw — sprawled across a bloodied landscape of plastic cups, crushed beer cans and trampled cowboy hats — the wounded and the dead. Marie’s eyes stayed on her cellphone as they rushed past. She didn’t have her home number saved, and as she tried to dial it, her hands wouldn’t stop shaking. “Marie, what’s wrong?” answered her mother, Susan. “There’s a shooting. There’s a shooting. Shooter, shooter,” she blurted, barely able to pronounce the words. “You have to stop. What are you saying?” Susan asked. Still on the phone with her mom, she and Summer escaped the venue and hurried across Giles Street, where they reached the edge of a church parking lot enclosed by a seven-foot-high wrought-iron fence. “What do we do?” the 16-year-olds askeda pair of police officers on the other side, strapping on what looked like riot gear. “You need to get over here right now,” one of them said. Marie set her phone down on the fence’s brick base, then put her cowboy boot on the edge and hiked up her floor-length lime-green dress. She and Summer gripped the metal bars and pulled themselves up and over, bruising the backs of their legs on spikes that lined the top. The girls leapt into the parking lot. Marie reached back for her cell. “My phone’s at 4 percent,” she told her mom. “I have to go.” Across the road, on the festival grounds, Riley and Kaitlyn had just helped Natalia into a white medical tent where the injured were being brought for treatment. She slumped onto a plastic chair. A passing medic asked how she was doing. OK, Natalia said, even though she wasn’t. For years, the teenager had wanted to be a nurse, to help people who were worse off than she was. And there they were, screaming and staggering all around her. Go to the others, she told the medic. A man sitting next to Natalia was pressing his palms together, as if in prayer, because the fingers on one of his hands had been blown off. She recognized a guy she’d known for years lying on a cot nearby. He’d been shot in the stomach. “I need help,” he said, and Riley called out for it, but no one came, because everyone needed help. On the pavement, where blood had begun to pool, Natalia saw a man to her right with a bullet wound on the back of his neck. She watched a small group crowd around him, pressing over and over on his chest. He didn’t move. “We lost him,” she heard someone say, and they left him alone. Now Natalia began to feel lightheaded, and Kaitlyn noticed her lips turning purple. “You need to stay with me,” her friend said. A medic suggested Natalia might need sugar. Riley grabbed her a Coke, and she sipped on it, struggling to keep her eyes open. Then the police arrived and, with the tent filling, they ordered anyone who wasn’t hurt to leave. Before she did, Kaitlyn leaned down, pressed both hands against her friend’s face and reminded Natalia of her twin. “Think about Gianna,” she pleaded. “She’s been with you her entire life. She couldn’t do anything without you.” The gunfire sounded louder – closer – than before, and now Marie was trembling, sobbing, hyperventilating. She and Summer had inched down the fence line and taken refuge with six or seven others behind a dark Ford pickup near the church parking lot’s entrance. The police continued to order people in their direction, north up Giles Street, which left both girls convinced that a gunman was on foot, making his way toward them. A short, blond woman held them both in her arms, trying to calm Marie. “What’s your name?” she asked. “Where do you go to school?” Marie, though, could barely speak. Out in the road, pickup after pickup pulled up as victims were piled into the beds. “Where’s the nearest hospital?” the girls heard people yell. The injured who didn’t reach the trucks were brought to paramedics gathering behind the 16-year-olds in the parking lot. “Honey, don’t look over there,” the woman told them. “Don’t do that to yourself.” A group brought over another woman, who was wearing only pants and a blood-soaked bra. Her face ashen, she didn’t say a word. “Her husband was shot,” one of the men explained. The relentless sights of carnage only intensified Marie’s fear that here, huddled behind a truck, her life could end. She peered back down the road, still waiting for a man with a rifle to appear in the night. One block west, in the pyramid-shaped Luxor on the other side of the festival grounds, Shae and Delaney hid in a bathroom, worried about the same thing. Shae’s parents were in their car, speeding toward the Strip, but they had remained on the phone with her. Their siren blaring in the background, she could hear them coordinating with other investigators already responding to the rampage. “If it’s a male shooter, he’s not going to go into the women’s restroom,” Shae’s dad had told her, so when they raced into the Luxor, the girls found one on the first floor and locked themselves in a handicapped stall. Shae sat with her back against the wall, leaning down to watch the door. A woman burst through, shrieking. Shae’s heart pounded. Had someone chased the woman there? Was the shooter in the hotel? She waited, hoping a man’s feet wouldn’t follow. None did, but she feared that the woman’s hysterics could draw a gunman’s attention. “Should I try to calm her down?” she asked her dad. “You can try,” he said. Shae opened the stall door and told the woman, who had been separated from a sister and a friend, that her parents worked for the FBI. The best thing for all of them to do, Shae said, was to stay calm. The woman stopped screaming. “It’s going to be okay,” Shae said, and the teenager hoped that was true. Back in the white tent, a medic, hands quivering, struggled unsuccessfully to insert an IV into Natalia’s right arm. Her friends were gone, but still lingering in her mind were Kaitlyn’s last words about Gianna, her missing twin. The girls looked so much alike that, for years, most people could only tell them apart by the scar on Natalia’s knee from a bicycle accident. “Mirror images,” their parents called them, because Natalia was right-handed and Gianna was left-handed. Her sister had to be all right, Natalia thought. She had to be. Then a man in shorts, a white T-shirt and a reversed baseball cap walked up. Dean McAuley, a 46-year-old firefighter down from Washington state for the festival, had just helped carry a young woman about Natalia’s age into the tent, but the pulse he’d detected when he found her on the ground had already disappeared. McAuley couldn’t bring her back. Maybe, though, he could do something for Natalia. He took a torn piece of blue shirt and tied it around her forearm, revealing a vein for the IV. He asked where she’d been shot. On her back shoulder, she told him. McAuley searched for an exit wound but couldn’t find one. His stomach knotted. The risk of severe internal bleeding, McAuley knew, was enormous. He checked her heartbeat and felt it racing. Her body was compensating for the shock, he suspected, but what would happen when that wore off? Ten minutes – that’s how long McAuley thought he had to save her life. “I’ll be right back,” he said. “Keep your eyes on me.” The firefighter found someone coordinating care in the tent. Just outside, McAuley was told, ambulances had gathered to take people to the hospital. He returned to Natalia and asked if she could stand. Yes, she said. He held her hand with one of his and her IV bag with the other. “There will be an ambulance waiting for us,” he told Natalia. When they got outside, none remained. The sound of gunshots had subsided by then, but McAuley could still hear frantic chatter blaring over first responders’ radios. “Active shooter.” “Multiple shooters.” He helped Natalia shuffle across Giles Street and into the same parking lot where Marie and Summer were sheltering. McAuley lowered her onto a lawn chair behind a white SUV. “What can I do for you?” he asked, taking a knee in front of her. “I want to call my parents,” Natalia said. He dialed. Her dad, Mike Baca, picked up. McAuley explained who he was and that he was with his daughter, who had been shot. “Is she alive?” Mike asked. McAuley gave her the phone. She said she couldn’t feel her legs. “Just breathe,” Mike told her, before he and his wife headed for their car. After hanging up, McAuley saw an older man jogging toward an Audi parked behind them. Reluctantly, he agreed to take them to a hospital. McAuley helped Natalia inside. He ordered the driver to turn on his hazard lights, find an ambulance and chase it. The man did, blowing through red lights along the way. In the back seat, Natalia told McAuley that her left arm had gone numb. She was struggling to breathe. “Do you have dogs?” he asked. Natalia said she had two, Kosmo and Vdara, both Boston terriers. He took out his phone and showed her a picture of Molly, his 100-pound Great Pyrenees. McAuley’s other hand moved to her wrist. At any second, he knew, Natalia’s pulse could plummet. He scrolled through photos of his wife and 5-year-old son. “You have a beautiful family,” she said. He asked about hers. Did she have any siblings? A twin, she said, who’d also been at the concert. “Do you know where she is?” “No,” Natalia said. At last, they pulled up to Sunrise Hospital. McAuley found a wheelchair and eased her into it, and then began pushing it up a driveway toward the trauma bay. They could already hear the moans. “Close your eyes,” he told her. “Don’t look around.” Natalia stared down, and on the ground she saw an American flag bandanna, spotted with blood. Nearing the brightly lit entrance, Natalia raised her head. She saw doctors and nurses desperately trying to triage maimed, wailing arrivals being unloaded along the curb. She saw bodies in the beds of pickup trucks. “Please help,” came the cries. “Please help.” McAuley wheeled her past the sliding doors and through a wide corridor that staff members later called “the sea of blood.” She’d been shot in the back, McAuley explained to a nurse. She had no exit wound, he said, but appeared to be stable, at least for now. He looked at Natalia. “You’ll be fine,” McAuley said. “I’ll see you later.” She forced a smile. “Thank you,” she told him, before the firefighter ran back outside to help others. A nurse changed her IV and wrote something in marker – vital signs, she thought – on her forehead. “It’s really hard to breathe,” she said, but in a hospital that would treat 199 patients from the festival that night, nobody had time to care for her yet. One victim after another sped by atop gurneys, their wheels streaking a tile floor that had transformed from beige to red. The air smelled of iron. “Watch out. Watch out,” she heard. “Cardiac arrest,” she heard. Natalia thought about her sister. It was in this hospital where their lives had begun. Where Gianna had been born first, crying, and Natalia had come out a minute later, making no noise at all. Where the doctors had been forced to resuscitate her because she wasn’t breathing. Where the girls had gone home, together, after just four days in recovery, stronger than anyone expected. Natalia closed her eyes. “Talia!” she heard a voice call. She looked up, and there, atop another gurney, was her twin. “What happened?” asked Gianna, her left thigh bleeding from a bullet that had passed straight through it. Natalia motioned to her shoulder. “I love you,” Gianna said. “I love you,” her sister responded. — The Monday morning sunlight leaked through the shades and into hospital room 272, where Natalia had spent the night in intensive care. A brace was wrapped around her neck, and on her face, a clear tube fed oxygen into both nostrils. Hours earlier, another tube that drained air and blood seeping from her punctured lung had been shoved between two ribs as Natalia, screaming, clenched a nurse’s hand. The bullet, she would learn, had traveled the distance of four football fields, pierced her right shoulder blade and fragmented. Slivers of metal had scattered throughout her chest cavity, slitting the lung, but missing her arteries, her trachea, her heart. A larger chunk of shrapnel, however, had veered to the left after impact, burrowing beneath her skin and over her spine before it struck Natalia’s opposite shoulder blade, fracturing that one, too. A change in the bullet’s trajectory of just centimeters might have killed her, but here she was with her sister, who was lying on a recliner nearby, gauze wrapped around her left thigh. Now Natalia just wanted to sleep, so she closed her eyes. Then came a sound so clear in her mind that, for a moment, she swore it had to be real: gunshots. Before he killed himself in Room 32135 at Mandalay Bay, Stephen Paddock fired more than 1,100 rounds, injuring at least 450 people for reasons that remain unknown. But the wounds from the worst mass shooting in modern American history weren’t only physical. Among the most traumatized was Marie. Even after she and Summer left the church parking lot and made it to the safety of their homes, Marie couldn’t shake a debilitating sense of dread. Too distraught to sleep alone, she asked her mother to lie in bed with her until morning. At 7:15, the 16-year-old’s phone buzzed with a text from Summer, who had just learned about the enormity of what they survived: “Omfg 50+ dead. I can’t believe this.” “Oh my god summer. I woke up crying so many times,” Marie texted back, unable to imagine going to school that day. But Shae, who’d gotten home at 4 a.m., had never considered not going. She knew her parents would work on the investigation all day, and she didn’t want to stay home alone. She’d be fine, Shae told herself. She put on leggings beneath a pink nightgown, because it was “Pajama Day” at Faith, and headed to school, where she walked into her first class and approached her British literature teacher. “I don’t have my homework because it’s in my car,” Shae said, explaining that it was still parked at the crime scene. “I’m really surprised that you’re even here,” her teacher replied.

Sign Up Shae joined her classmates in the high school gym for an impromptu assembly. “It’s not the ideal way to start homecoming week,” Dan Buikema, Faith’s guidance director, told the 1,100 students, who listened in silence. He updated them on Natalia and Gianna but said he knew the massacre’s impact on Faith would extend well beyond the twins. The school was still trying to determine the number of students who had attended the concert, eventually counting 10. The youngest, an eighth-grader, had tripped on a body while fleeing with her mother and was left covered in blood. There were at least 17 more Faith students who had family or nonschool friends at the festival, and several were close to someone hurt or killed. “We’ve seen this kind of stuff happen around the world,” Buikema continued. “We’ve not seen this happen in our community.” Their community was Summerlin, a 35-square-mile collection of palm-tree-lined golf courses, $600,000-plus homes and augustly named neighborhoods: Reverence and the Summit, Affinity and Chardonnay. “The Summerlin Bubble,” people sometimes called it, and at the center was Faith, one of Nevada’s most highly regarded schools. At nearly $12,000 a year, Faith Lutheran Middle School and High School offered sixth- to 12th-graders the opportunity to pursue an array of interests, from programming drones to producing films to climbing rock faces. Its campus of red-brick buildings, which included two gymnasiums and a 772-seat performing arts center, looked like a university. Every 2017 graduate, the school advertised, had gone on to attend college. Faith didn’t try to shelter its students from people who were suffering – groups traveled on mission trips every year – but they knew that theirs was a world of privilege and comfort. Now, in the gym, a teacher played guitar, leading the assembly in a hymn. “All the earth rejoice. He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide,” sang students sitting on the bleachers around Shae, who wanted to join but just couldn’t get the words out. It struck Shae in her next class that, somehow, she’d never cleaned the scrapes on her knees from the night before. She went to the nurse’s office, raising her nightgown and leggings to wipe away bits of asphalt embedded in her shins. Marie pulled into Faith’s parking lot Tuesday morning and saw what she’d seen every morning for years: other kids, walking, talking, laughing. She began to sob. Marie used to be one of them, she thought, doing and saying normal things, believing everything was okay. But now nothing felt OK. Marie hurried to her first class, AP English, and immediately had to leave. “I don’t know if I can do this,” Marie texted her mother. A day earlier, the teenager had spent hours at home watching news coverage of the shooting on TV. In her next class, the teacher, who hadn’t been told that Marie was at the festival, asked whether she could stay after school to take a test she’d missed. Suddenly, Marie was stricken with the sense that everything she’d cared about most – grades, the SAT, admittance into a top-tier college with an equestrian program – didn’t matter. “No,” she said. “I can’t take it after school.” Later, in a hallway, she and Summer talked about what was happening to them. “It feels so weird walking around,” Marie said. “It feels like we’re different,” Summer said. Nothing left the girls more convinced of that than how they reacted to noises. The roar of a motorcycle sent Summer sprinting to her front door. “What’s wrong?” her mother asked. “I don’t know,” Summer responded. Marie couldn’t stand a classmate zipping an eraser stick in and out, and in her living room on Tuesday night, the sound of a slamming door terrified her. Marie’s ears rang. She shrieked. Her mother, Susan, rushed in from the kitchen. For 15 minutes, she watched her daughter weep. Later that evening, Marie noticed someone parked across the street in their cul-de-sac. She checked every lock and closed every shutter. She set the alarm. When she got up to her bedroom, though, Marie realized her phone charger was still downstairs. She woke up her mom. “I need you to come with me,” Marie said. When they walked back down, the car was gone. She didn’t understand. If it had pulled away, she would have heard it. Marie insisted she had seen someone. But now came a more unsettling possibility. Maybe, Marie thought, it had all been in her mind. Shae sat on the ground outside her class, considering the right words to say as a camera was positioned in front of her. She’d been asked to describe her experience for a video the school planned to show during that week’s chapel services. Shae wore a long-sleeve plaid shirt and her hair in braided pigtails because it was Faith’s “Wilderness Explorer Day” in honor of the Disney movie “Up,” the theme for homecoming. “I know that I got out of that situation because God was with us, and I definitely know that He’s still with me now,” she said in the interview. “I have moments in the day that I really just feel a struggle, and I just feel like I can’t – like I just want to hole up in myself and not deal with any of it, but I know that I can’t do that.” Shae had never not dealt with things. She was an honor-roll regular and editor in chief of the Crusader Chronicle, Faith’s student newspaper. In third grade, her mother recalled, Shae came home one day complaining that the other kids didn’t take their assignments seriously enough. She labored to stay composed all week and tried to help Delaney, who’d hidden with her in the Luxor restroom, do the same. When she was asked to write a first-person account for the Chronicle about their escape, Shae gave it this headline: “I’m not a victim, I’m a survivor.” She couldn’t bear to watch, though, when a teacher played a TV interview with Natalia and Gianna in class that included clips of the bloodshed. As Shae looked down at her desk, she noticed classmates staring. “Shae, stop reliving it,” whispered a friend sitting next to her. In a chapel service, when a student yelled at the speaker, she clutched the arms on her chair and sat up, panicked. “I need to get out of here,” Shae thought, before a friend told her that it was part of the presentation. She left school early one afternoon to be with her mother, who had worked on the investigation most of the week but wanted to take Shae to get a manicure. Elena sat on their couch, and Shae laid her head on her mom’s lap for a few minutes before they headed to the nail salon. “How are you?” Elena asked in the car. “Everyone keeps telling me that I’m so strong,” she said, “but I just don’t feel strong right now.” Elena told her there was nothing wrong with that, and then they went inside the salon and Shae got her fingernails painted periwinkle blue to match a homecoming dress she no longer wanted to wear. It was Friday morning, the beginning of Natalia’s fifth day in the hospital, and a doctor had just pulled the chest tube out from between her ribs. All week, she and Gianna had been the focus of unrelenting attention. The twins had done interviews on “Good Morning America” and “Inside Edition.” They’d heard from producers for “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” and “Dr. Phil.” ABC’s “20/20” had even flown Dean McAuley, the firefighter who had helped Natalia get to the hospital, back from Seattle to orchestrate an emotional on-camera reunion between the two. Amid all of it — the hundreds of messages on Facebook, the stream of well-wishers, the repeated questions about what it felt like to witness and face death — the twins remained unflinchingly positive. The online conspiracy theorists fixated on their smiles, insisting it was evidence that their stories weren’t true. But Natalia had been that way — “#keepsmiling,” she’d written next to a photo of herself in the hospital — since she was little. Her outlook was born of a compassion so deep that when she returned from a ninth-grade mission trip to Mexico, she announced to her parents that she wanted to become a traveling nurse, move to Africa and treat victims of Ebola. Twenty-two hours after being shot, still in the intensive care unit, Natalia wrote on Instagram: “I am so blessed to be alive at this moment of time.” Now, though, on Friday, the last of the TV cameras had left, and with them went the distractions. Natalia finally had time to consider what she might miss during her last homecoming weekend before graduation. With the chest tube out, she had only one question for her doctor: “Can I go to the football game tonight?” Two hours later, her sister rolled on an electric scooter through a tunnel of pompom-shaking cheerleaders and into the gymnasium, where hundreds of students gathered for a pep rally stood to applaud. “We would like to dedicate this assembly and the rest of our cheer season to Gianna and Natalia Baca,” a girl announced on a microphone. Then the cheer team performed, and the lip sync competition began. The freshmen went first, followed by the sophomores and juniors and, at last, the seniors. Between songs, the narrators recounted highlights of “our Faith Lutheran adventure”: the first dances and dates, cars and crushes. Natalia knew the entire lip-sync routine and had so looked forward to performing with her classmates one more time, to hitting her mark as the seniors romped to the final song, “We’re All in This Together.” Instead, she watched on FaceTime from her hospital room, blowing into a deep-breathing device, hoping that her lung wouldn’t collapse so that, maybe, she could make the football game. — The prayer had been said and the moment of silence had been held, and now, between the stadium’s bleachers, teenagers lining a pathway held up their phones, ready to record. Faith’s high school principal, Scott Fogo, waved up at the public-address booth and then pointed at who was behind him: Gianna, driving her scooter, and Natalia, less than five hours removed from the hospital, in a wheelchair being pushed by their dad. “Ladies and gentlemen, will you direct your attention to the 35-yard line,” the announcer said over the loudspeaker, his voice rising. “Welcome back Natalia and Gianna Baca.” The crowd stood and clapped as Faith’s cheerleaders surrounded the girls. “We love you, Bacas!” they chanted in unison. The principal, eyes watery, watched from a few feet away. He wore a maroon T-shirt that on the front showed an image of the girls above the hashtag #BacaStrong and on the back included a verse from 2 Corinthians about God’s comfort in times of trouble. Fogo, bald, bespectacled and known among students for his reassuring hugs, had given out more of them that week than any other in his career. He and his staff had done all they could think of – bringing in comfort dogs, calling traumatized students at home when they missed classes, prepping teachers for the inevitable questions and breakdowns, arranging for three counselors to attend the dance, just in case. “I don’t know what I say to my kid,” parents had told Fogo, so he helped set up a meeting for them with a Harvard-trained psychiatrist. He had even researched the aftermath of the Columbine High School rampage and discovered that a student who’d witnessed the violence hanged himself a year later. By Friday, he and Faith’s counselors had already begun to work on a plan for the months ahead, when they knew things would return to normal for many in the community but might not — then, or ever — for at least 10 of their kids. Fogo waited as Natalia’s dad parked her wheelchair next to Gianna. The twins faced the cheer team they co-captained, and in front of Natalia were the personalized black boxes that the girls stood on during games. Neatly stacked on top of hers was a megaphone and two gold pompoms. “Natalia,” it read. “Varsity Cheer 2018.” A tear tumbled down her cheek, and when the local TV journalists noticed it, they crept closer and pointed their lenses. Then out came the microphones, and back came her smile. “I haven’t seen a big crowd in, like, a week, so it was very overwhelming,” she told the reporters. “This school is family to me, so I didn’t want to miss it.” They backed away, and she eased out of the wheelchair. “Go, Crusaders! Go!” her teammates shouted. She leaned against the fence behind her, lightly bouncing one foot to the rhythm and tapping her hands together. Natalia knew she would never cheer at another football game. “Go, Crusaders. Go,” she mouthed in silence as her smile disappeared. Beyond the end zone, Shae and Delaney had just come into the stadium, both wearing #BacaStrong shirts. They walked toward the far side of the field to watch friends on the dance team, the two of them holding hands, just as the girls had done five nights earlier when they fled the concert. “I just don’t want to lose her in the crowd,” Delaney said. A dark-haired classmate in a polo shirt stopped to give Shae a hug. He’d heard she was at the festival. “That’s crazy. You’re okay, though, right?” the teen asked Shae, who, to him, looked no different. “Yeah,” she said and nodded, because the real answer was too hard to explain. Shae and Delaney spotted Summer. She’d come without Marie, who had finally made it through a day of classes but decided not to attend the game or any of the homecoming weekend activities. The girls compared how they were feeling. “I’m actually good today because I didn’t go to school,” Summer said. Delaney thought she’d made progress, too. “I only cried once,” she said. “Guys, I took off my bracelet,” Summer told them, referring to the purple Route 91 Harvest band. “I need to take mine off,” Shae responded. “I’m leaving it on,” Delaney said. “Even for tomorrow?” Summer asked, referring to the dance. “It’s kind of a constant reminder.” “It’s just like a — I’m lucky. I was lucky,” Delaney said. “It doesn’t make me sad anymore.” Shae, glancing down at her left wrist, said nothing. Natalia limped over the curb onto the sidewalk, and as the fading sunlight cut through the palm trees on Saturday evening, her iridescent white dress flashed shades of pink and blue, just as she’d imagined. But Natalia, one hand holding Gianna’s and the other squeezing her phone, didn’t seem to notice. It was just past 5 p.m., and they were waiting on the sprawling lawn outside the JW Marriott to get their homecoming photos taken, along with dozens of other Faith teens. Two local stylists had done their hair free at home, and a friend had bought them flats, because neither twin could stand in heels. The sisters had already decided to skip the dance. “There’s loud music. I don’t want to go,” Natalia had told her mom, and Gianna agreed. Still, both girls wanted pictures. Now Natalia checked her phone for the third time. Parker, the teen who’d asked her to homecoming, was running late. “Where’s your date?” asked Gianna’s boyfriend. “He’s coming at 5:30,” she said, but at 5:30, he still hadn’t arrived. Another parent walked over to say hello. “Both of you are here?” she said to the girls, surprised. “Where are your dates?” “Parker’s coming,” Natalia said. She checked her phone again. “He’s got 2 minutes,” someone announced at 5:43. One minute later, he made it. She grinned, and they shared a gentle embrace. He slipped a white rose corsage on her left wrist, and she held the matching boutonniere up to his navy blue lapel. “I’m just going to act like I’m doing it,” she said, laughing. Now they needed to get a portrait, so she motioned for him to shiftto her left. “I can move this arm,” Natalia said. From the camera’s view, she looked like any other girl, hair curled, eyelashes long, makeup pristine. The dress’s open back, though, revealed a patch of ivory bandages, the only evidence that the bones in her shoulders were fractured, that her chest was littered with bullet fragments. Parker put his arm around her, smiling as he searched for a spot to rest his hand. They posed with Gianna and her boyfriend and, later, a few other classmates. Then Natalia hugged her date goodbye and shuffled toward an awaiting truck. “Six o’clock. Take your pill,” a family friend said, because it was time for her painkiller. The woman helped her into the back seat, and 51 minutes after it began, Natalia’s homecoming ended. Across town, Shae was at Delaney’s house, struggling to find the right expression for their pictures. None of them felt quite right. “What’s wrong with us?” Shae asked, especially frustrated because 2016’s homecoming had cemented their friendship. Both had just come out of serious relationships and bonded over silly, finger-on-their-chin poses and a long night on the dance floor. When Brevin, the boy taking Shae, arrived, the girls got into the back of his family’s Ford Mustang. With their dates up front, Shae and Delaney took selfies together, and the night finally started to feel the way it was supposed to. The four of them had gone out in the same car, with the top down, on the night Brevin asked Shae to the dance. On the way, the girls had begged him to play country music, and he’d refused, and they’d all laughed about it ever since. Now, on the way to homecoming, he asked if they wanted to hear country music. Not tonight, the girls told him. They pulled up to the school and spotted Fogo, who was welcoming students. Shae and Delaney walked straight to the principal and hugged him, together. At a table in the cafeteria, the girls ate chicken and salad with their dates and talked about the decorations inside the gym. Shae had helped set up everything until midnight Friday and then again Saturday morning. “Wait till you see it,” she told Delaney. “It’s really pretty.” Shae had worried all week that she and her classmates wouldn’t enjoy the dance, but she’d invested so much of herself to make sure they did – covering the bleachers in black tarp, assembling light towers wrapped in linen, putting together a gazebo threaded in faux ivy around the dessert table, painting a miniature house that looked just like the one that floats away in the movie “Up.” On their way out of the cafeteria, the girls ran into Summer and exchanged hugs and compliments about their dresses. “I’m just going to warn you guys, there are a lot of balloons in there,” said Shae, who knew that, a day earlier, one had popped just as Delaney walked into the gym and she’d ducked to cover her head. But her best friend was too excited to worry about that, so Shae, Delaney and their dates headed across the courtyard. Reading this on your iPhone or iPad?

The rap song “Crank That (Soulja Boy)” thudded from the speakers as they walked through the gym’s double doors, where hundreds of students were bouncing in the dark beneath white ceiling drapes. The four of them passed white-clothed tables decorated with white rose petals and Mason jars filled with white lights that looked like fireflies. They sat on a bench along the side of the gym, and Shae took off her floral Steve Madden heels. Hand in hand, the girls approached the dance floor, maneuvering along the edge, outside the scrum. They found friends near the front, below the DJ booth, and began to dance. “Stanky Legg” came on, and the students roared. Delaney, beaming, let go of Shae’s hand. The bass boomed louder. The crowd grew larger. Shae felt her chest tighten. “I’ll be back,” she told a friend standing next to her. “Are you okay?” he asked. “Yeah, I just need a minute,” she said, slipping away before Delaney could notice. Shae went to the principal. “It’s a little overwhelming,” she said, and he told her to take a break if she needed to. Shae picked up her phone and rushed toward the doors, fleeing beneath an arch of rainbow-colored balloons on her way out. On the far side of the courtyard, she stood barefoot along the edge of the sidewalk, her pink toenails buried in the grass. A string of lights between two poles hung overhead, illuminating the scrapes on her legs that still hadn’t healed. She called her dad. “I just can’t have fun,” Shae told him, her voice faltering. “I want to, but I can’t.” When he’d finished assuring her that it was going to be okay and they’d hung up, she stepped away from the light. Then Shae sat down and wept. Natalia finished her strawberry ice cream with gummy bears and watched an episode of “Grey’s Anatomy” before she headed to her bedroom. Crumpled in the corner was the poster Parker had brought to the school parking lot when he asked her to the dance, just before she and Gianna left for Route 91. “HOMECOMING,” it read. He’d gone that evening without her. She lay down and closed her eyes. Natalia normally slept in complete darkness but couldn’t do that anymore, so she left the door open and the lights above her mirror on. As she began to fall asleep, Natalia knew what was coming. A sound so clear that, each night, she had to tell herself it wasn’t real: gunshots. Get Morning Report and other email newsletters"

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/492811522/0/news-opinion~Domestic-violence-is-a-tragedy-Itaposs-not-a-predictor-of-mass-murder/,"The gun-pointing has predictably shifted to finger-pointing since the Texas church shooting in which 25 parishioners were killed, including a pregnant woman whose unborn baby also died, and many others were wounded. Could this atrocity have been prevented by better follow-through on the gunman’s history of violence, which included abuse of his ex-wife and stepson? The horrific nature of this crime gave advocates for various causes the opportunity to push their well-meaning agendas. The gunman’s violent past was especially telling for experts on domestic violence. More: Will concealed carry stop next Sutherland Springs slaughter in gun-toting Texas? More: The day of the Sutherland Springs massacre, I went to buy a gun. I got a lesson instead. Appearing on the PBS NewsHour the day after the shooting, Deborah Epstein, co-director of the Domestic Violence Clinic at the Georgetown University Law Center, claimed there is a strong correlation between domestic violence and mass shootings.  “If you look at all the mass shootings that have occurred on U.S. soil,” said Epstein, “the vast majority of them have been committed by people who have perpetrated domestic violence against an intimate partner, a series of intimate partners, or are in the process of dealing with domestic violence.” In a one-week follow-up story about the church shooting, a headline in the San Antonio Express-News read, “Are mass killings and domestic violence linked? It depends who you ask.” You'd think such a determination would be a matter of fact, not opinion. Unfortunately, in the media version of the children’s game of telephone, the message is easily misinterpreted as it gets repeated from one news source to another. “There is an obvious link between mass shootings and domestic violence,” suggested Susan Higginbotham, executive director of the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence. She at least cited her evidence: “A study last year by Everytown for Gun Safety, which used FBI data and media reports to analyze mass shootings from January 2009 to December 2016, showed that 54% of the perpetrators of these horrific mass killings had a history of domestic or family violence.” Higginbotham was only partially correct, misconstruing the most important point. The Everytown study did indeed find that 54% of mass shootings involved intimate partners or family members as victims. In this majority, however, the domestic violence was the mass shooting of family members, and not necessarily a history of previous domestic violence. Everytown’s case summaries of 156 shootings from 2009 through 2016 (in which four or more victims are killed), reveal 85 incidents in which a gunman murdered at least some current or former intimate partners or family members. Of these, 41% were preceded by other acts of domestic violence. Among the entire pool of mass shootings, only 25% revealed any indication of prior domestic violence. Even if a majority of mass shootings were preceded by violence against intimate partners or family, that still would hardly serve as a reliable predictor of mass murder. There are, unfortunately, at least 10 million incidents of domestic violence every year, according to estimates reported by the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. By contrast, there are, on average, about 22 mass shootings annually with at least four fatalities. Were we to predict mass murder on this basis of domestic violence, we would be wrong well more than 99% of the time. More: Chris Matthews: RFK came around to pushing gun control. We should too. POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media To be very clear, domestic violence is a serious concern. It causes significant emotional and physical pain, and sometimes escalates to murder. It should never be ignored or taken lightly. We need to do whatever possible through prevention strategies in terms of socializing children and intervention efforts, including arrest and gun confiscation, when it does occur. This is the right thing to do, but let’s get straight concerning why. There are at least 10 million reasons to elevate our vigilance in responding to domestic violence. We shouldn’t need an occasional mass killing in which the assailant had been charged with spousal or family abuse to motivate us. I applaud the efforts of those dedicated folks who have made domestic violence prevention the focal point of their careers.

http://www.ocregister.com/2017/11/27/australian-police-allege-man-planned-new-years-eve-attack/,"Trending: By ROD McGUIRK CANBERRA, Australia — Australian police have arrested a man accused of planning a mass shooting for New Year’s Eve in a crowded Melbourne square, officials said on Tuesday. The 20-year-old Australian-born citizen with Somali parents was trying to obtain an automatic rifle to attack the downtown Federation Square in Australia’s second largest city, Victoria State Police Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton said. Thousands of revelers pack the square each year on New Year’s Eve. The man, who was not named, downloaded instructions from an al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula website on how to launch a terrorist attack and how to use guns, Patton said. Patton described the suspect as “a person who’s expressed an intention to try and kill as many people as he could through shooting them.” He said authorities have eliminated the threat of the attack, saying “the risk that was posed by this person has been removed.” Justice Minister Michael Keenan said police arrested four extremist last December over a similar plot to attack Federal Square and other public places in Melbourne over the Christmas-New Year period. Keenan urged the public to continue with their usual routines over the period and expect to see a heavy police presence. “The aim of these terrorists is to foster fear and intimidation, but Australians should be able to go about their business secure in the understanding that the government has worked very closely with law enforcement and other security agencies to keep them safe,” Keenan told reporters. Counter-terrorism police had been monitoring the latest suspect, a known extremist and a sympathizer of the Islamic State group, this year and detained him as he met with people in an attempt to acquire a gun, Patton said. Australia has strict gun laws and automatic weapons are banned from private ownership. The man is the 74th suspect arrested in Australia in 31 counter-terrorism investigations since Australia’s terrorism threat level was elevated to “probable” in September 2014. The plot was the 14th that police say they had disrupted since the terrorist threat level was raised. Five plots have been executed. Police expect he will appear in a Melbourne court late on Tuesday or Wednesday on charges of preparing to commit a terrorist attack and collecting documents to facilitate a terrorist act. People convicted of those crimes in Australia face a maximum penalty of life in prison. Search warrants were issued on Monday at a home in a suburb where the suspect lived with his parents and siblings, at a relative’s address in another suburb and at a computer business where he once had a part-time job.

Officials issued an all-clear around 5:10 p.m after reports of shots fired near a nursing home in Floresville at about 4:15.pm.
Advertisement The Texas Rangers, Texas Department of Public Safety and FBI were searching near the Cotes Medical Building but didn't say if an arrest was made. Law enforcement said the gun involved appeared to be a pistol, but it was unclear how many rounds were fired. The man reportedly fled the area and officials launched a search.

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/493224992/0/phoenix/nation~California-shooter-built-his-own-illegal-guns-officials-say/,"RANCHO TEHAMA RESERVE, Calif. — Two of the guns used in the Tehama County mass shooting on Tuesday were homemade, while the other two were not registered to the shooter, officials said. There was also a restraining order issued issued in February that prohibited the shooter from owning guns. The two homemade AR-15 type semiautomatic rifles were made from parts the shooter, Kevin Janson Neal, purchased, said Phil Johnston, Tehama County’s assistant sheriff. “These firearms were manufactured illegally, we believe, by him at his home,” Johnston said Wednesday. “So they (the guns) were obtained in an illegal manner, not through a legal process. They are not registered.” More: California mass shooting suspect killed wife, hid body day before rampage, officials say Previously: Gunman kills at least 4, wounds 10, in Northern California More: Texas shooter allowed to buy weapons after Air Force failed to flag him In addition to the two rifles sheriff’s deputies found during the shooting investigation, Johnston said the 44-year-old also had two handguns that were not registered to him. Neal went on a shooting rampage Tuesday morning, killing four people and wounding 10 others, including at least two children. No children were killed, even though Neal apparently rammed the gate of Rancho Tehama Elementary School and fired numerous shots at buildings. Neal was killed during a shootout with deputies while he was trying to flee in a stolen vehicle. Sheriff’s officials believe Neal’s wife was killed Monday and her body was stuffed in a hole in the floor of their home. Follow Damon Arthur on Twitter: @damonarthur_RS "
http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/11/06/police-reveal-possible-motive-behind-texas-church-massacre/,"Authorities on Monday revealed that they had reason to believe that Sunday's mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, carried out by Devin Kelley, stemmed from a domestic dispute.  According to CBS News, law enforcement revealed that the church massacre wasn't perpetrated because of religious beliefs or racial divides. Freeman Martin, Texas Department of Public Safety regional director, told reporters during a Monday press conference that Kelley sent threatening text messages to his mother-in-law — who attended services at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs. ""We wanted to get that out there that this was not racially motivated, it wasn't over religious beliefs,"" Martin said. ""There was a domestic situation going on within the family-in-laws.""  He added, ""It’s a senseless crime, but we can tell you that there was a domestic situation going on within this. He had expressed anger toward his mother-in-law."" Police were not clear as to what about the texts led them to conclude that Kelley's alleged anti-religious beliefs did not play a role, or why they were so certain on this front.   In another development, authorities also believe that Kelley fatally shot himself after a high-speed pursuit. Martin also revealed that Kelley, who was wounded by a Good Samaritan outside of the church, had phoned his father during the chase, telling him that he wasn't going to make it.

http://rssfeeds.jsonline.com/~/488793326/0/milwaukee/home~FBI-has-Devin-Kelleyaposs-cell-phone-But-it-canapost-unlock-it-obscuring-clues-to-Texas-shooter/,"SAN FRANCISCO – A simple iPhone passcode may be stopping the FBI from more fully understanding the shooter behind Sunday’s deadly church killing, possibly exacerbated by a gap between when murder suspect Devin Kelley last used the phone and when authorities started trying to unlock it.  The FBI has Kelley’s iPhone, retrieved after he shot a congregation in Sutherland Springs, Tex., killing 25 people before he was killed. A search warrant allowing investigators access has been executed. The phone was flown to FBI headquarters in Quantico, Va., for analysis but so far a forensics team has been unable to unlock the phone. Their efforts — if prolonged — could resurface a fight between law enforcement, tech companies and privacy advocates over whether the government should get a back-door key to unlocking widely used consumer devices. The FBI has argued it needs to be able to override the phones' encryption to uncover criminals' tracks. Tech companies, including iPhone-maker Apple, have countered doing so would make all individuals more vulnerable to hackers. Authorities may have had more than one way to get beyond the personal passcode. Versions starting with iPhone 5S and later, but not the new X, use Touch ID. This fingerprint sensor would have allowed the investigators to access the phone using his fingerprints, but only for a short period of time after his last use.  “We are working very hard to get into the phone,” Christopher Combs, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s San Antonio bureau, said during a news briefing on Tuesday. “It could be tomorrow, it could be a week, it could be a month.” A law enforcement official, who is not authorized to comment publicly, said Wednesday that authorities were still trying to access the contents of the iPhone.  Apple said Wednesday afternoon that no one at the FBI or any other law enforcement agency had reached out to Apple for technical assistance with the phone. The timing of any such requests is critical.Touch ID allows the owner to set a fingerprint to open the device. However, Touch ID stops working if the phone hasn’t been unlocked for more than 48 hours — at that point the user must type in the passcode, according to Apple’s website. Too many unsuccessful attempts to unlock a passcode can lock down a phone permanently. If the phone had been set up to accept a fingerprint, the FBI could have used Kelley’s finger to open the phone during that 48 hour window, if he had recently unlocked it. Apple’s Touch ID feature can be engaged with a dead person’s finger. More: Texas church shooting: Who is Devin Kelley? More: Neighbor ran to aid Texas shooting victims after shooter Devin Kelley fled More: Devin Kelley's troubled past included divorce, domestic battery, and time in the brig Law enforcement officials argue that access to suspects' cell phones is often a crucial component of investigations — but one that's frequently blocked by security technology. The FBI has been able to retrieve data from fewer than half the mobile phones it has tried to access over the last 11 months, director Christopher Wray said last month at a speech at the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference in Philadelphia. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance has warned that inaccessible devices have thwarted some of the office’s most serious investigations, including murder and sex crimes. Vance is expected to disclose a new count of locked devices later this month. Last year, the district attorney reported that 423 Apple iPhones and iPads had been seized since October 2014 and have been inaccessible to investigators because of default encryption. “Approximately 10% of our warrant-proof devices pertain to homicide or attempted murder cases, and 9% to sex crimes,” Vance said last year. “With over 96% of all smartphones worldwide operated by Apple and Google, and with devices running older operating systems rapidly aging out, the trend is only poised to continue,” the district attorney said. “In other words, the risks associated with warrant-proof encryption remain, and are growing.”       The issue came to a very public head last year when Apple and the Department of Justice spent 43 days locked in a legal battle over an order from a federal magistrate in California that the company must help the FBI try to get into an iPhone used by San Bernardino gunman Syed Rizwan Farook. Apple v FBI timeline: 43 days that rocked tech At issue was a feature on the iPhone 5C Farook had been issued by his employer that  would lock investigators out if they made 10 unsuccessful tries to determine the correct password. The FBI demanded that Apple help it disable the locking program, which Apple refused to do on the grounds that creating software to do so would result in something that could potentially unlock any iPhone. “The FBI may use different words to describe this tool, but make no mistake: Building a version of iOS that bypasses security in this way would undeniably create a backdoor. And while the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case, there is no way to guarantee such control,” Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote in a public blog post on Feb. 16, 2016. In the end, the FBI paid an estimated $1.3 million to an unnamed company to build a tool that allowed it to break into the phone, and withdrew its case against Apple. Left unresolved was whether Apple could have been forced to create such a tool for the FBI. USA TODAY, together with the Associated Press and the news site Vice, sued to discover the name of the outside party that helped crack the phone, but a judge said the agency could keep the identity secret. Privacy advocates and civil liberties groups argue that giving police the ability to break into locked phones represents too great a threat to privacy. Last year the United Nations' human rights chief warned that the creation of cyber tools to do so risked unlocking a Pandora's Box. ""This is not just about one case and one IT company in one country. It will have tremendous ramifications for the future of individuals’ security in a digital world which is increasingly inextricably meshed with the actual world we live in,"" Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement in March 2016. In a show of unity rarely seen in the tech industry, more than 30 companies — Google, Facebook, Microsoft, AT&T, Yahoo, Amazon, Twitter, Intel, Cisco Systems and others — filed amicus briefs in support of Apple in its opposition to cracking an iPhone linked to the San Bernardino killings. It is a formidable front in an industry often fractured by internecine product wars. "

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/489235980/0/usatodaycomwashington-topstories~Fact-check-Trump-recycles-flawed-gun-talking-point/,"President Trump has once again misused the example of Chicago to make a case against gun regulations. Despite what the president claims, Chicago does not have “the strongest gun laws in our nation.” It once did, but the laws that gave it that distinction have since been rescinded. And a spike in homicides occurred after those laws were changed. Trump also called Chicago “a disaster.” That’s an opinion, but it’s worth noting that other cities – some with less stringent gun laws – have higher rates of gun violence. Experts also warn against cherry-picking cities to score political points, as examples can be found to fit arguments on either side. They also note that Chicago, which has stricter laws than most cities, is bordered by states that have relatively lax gun laws. And there is some evidence that most of the guns confiscated from crimes in Chicago come from out of state. Finally, as we have written before, there is no evidence that gun control laws result in higher murder rates. In fact, studies suggest the opposite: States with a higher number of firearm restrictions have lower firearm deaths. But there is only an association between gun control laws and firearm deaths, not a causal relationship, studies show. Trump’s latest comment about Chicago gun crime came when he was asked if he would consider any gun control policies in the wake of the mass shooting at a Texas church on Nov. 5. “I mean, you look at the city with the strongest gun laws in our nation, is Chicago, and Chicago is a disaster,” Trump said during a press conference in Korea on Nov. 7. “It’s a total disaster.” This is a longstanding talking point for Trump, who tweeted in July 2014: The most stringent gun laws in the U.S. happen to be in Chicago - and look what is happening there! Trump made the same point during the third presidential debate, saying: “In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city. ”  White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders made a similar claim during a press briefing on Oct. 2 after the Las Vegas mass shooting. “I think if you look to Chicago, where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year, they have the strictest gun laws in the country,” Sanders said. “That certainly hasn’t helped there.” Here are some facts about gun violence in Chicago and what they say, and don’t say, about the role of gun control. Chicago used to have what some considered to be the toughest gun laws in the country. But not anymore. In 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Chicago’s handgun ban. In the year before the court’s ruling, Chicago’s murder rate in 2009 was 16.1. The city with the highest murder rate that year was New Orleans at 51.7 murders for every 100,000 people. And in 2013, Chicago also abolished its requirement that gun owners register their weapons. The move was made to come into compliance with the state’s court-mandated concealed carry law. “Chicago does have strong municipal laws, but we wouldn’t say it has the strongest gun laws in the country, because the strongest regulations in Chicago have been largely implemented by entire states, including New York and California,” Hannah Shearer, a staff attorney and Second Amendment litigation director at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, told us via email. “In contrast, the state of Illinois has significantly weaker laws than New York and California, including a shall-issue concealed carry permit system.” The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence gave a B+ grade to Illinois in its latest “Gun Law State Scorecard.” Seven states had a higher grade. It’s true that the total number of murders in Chicago spiked in 2016. The number of murders recorded that year — 764 — was nearly 58 percent higher than in 2015. In raw numbers, that was higher than any other major city in the U.S., according to data from the Major Cities Chiefs Association. But the murder rate in Chicago wasn’t the highest. The per-capita murder rate in Chicago – the number of homicides per 100,000 residents – was 27.9 in 2016. That’s half the rate recorded by St. Louis, at 59.3, which saw 188 murders in 2016. Among major cities, Chicago’s rate was eighth highest in 2016. (Ninety-three percent of the murders in the city that year involved firearms.) And again, those high tallies in 2016 came after Chicago did away with its gun registry and ban on handguns. It should also be noted that the number of homicides in Chicago is trending down so far this year. According to the Sun-Times, there were 580 homicides in the first 10 months of 2017, down 10 percent from the 644 homicides recorded during the same period in 2016. Shootings and homicides in Chicago “are still high by urban American standards right now, but the trend appears to be downward,” John Pfaff, a professor of law at Fordham Law School, told us via email. “There’s still two months in the year, but that pushes back against the ‘disaster’ story.” Shearer also notes that “Chicago is vulnerable to guns coming in from neighboring states. A few states bordering Chicago, such as Indiana, have extremely weak gun laws.” A 2017 gun trace report from the Chicago Police Department found that since 2013 the “overwhelming majority” of recovered “crime guns” that were traceable “were originally purchased outside of the city limits and brought into Chicago.” And the majority were from other states. Pfaff added the caveat that police could only trace 12,500 of the 28,000 guns seized during the study period, so the origin of most guns could not be determined. Still, the report suggests that many of the guns used in Chicago crimes come from outside the city — watering down the effectiveness that any local gun laws might have. And so experts warn it would be unwise to draw definitive conclusions, as the president did, about the effectiveness of gun control efforts in Chicago. “That is a silly argument,” David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, told us via email. “That would be similar to someone arguing that pest control doesn’t work with an example where only one kitchen is treated in an apartment complex filled with cockroaches. Chicago is surrounded by easy places for criminals to get guns. &mldr There are lots of places where gun control (and pest control) has a much better chance to work and does work.” As for the president’s implication that stricter gun laws either don’t work or lead to higher rates of homicide, studies suggest that’s not the case. In fact, they show an association, but not a proven causal relationship, between strict gun laws and lower rates of gun violence. According to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence scorecard, seven states graded as having the strongest gun laws also were among those with the lowest gun death rates. And as we have written before (on several occasions), several studies have shown that states with a higher number of firearm restrictions have lower firearm deaths. But there is only an association between gun control laws and firearm deaths, not a causal relationship, studies show. In other words, the studies do not prove that the stricter laws are responsible for lower homicide rates. It’s misleading for Trump to cite Chicago as evidence that gun control laws don’t reduce gun violence. Chicago no longer has “the strongest gun laws in our nation,” and it doesn’t have nearly the highest homicide rate among major cities. Most traceable guns recovered from crimes also come from outside the city limits.

http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/11/07/the-latest-trump-gun-control-may-have-caused-more-deaths/,"Trending: SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas (AP) — In a story Nov. 7 about the mass shooting at a Texas church, The Associated Press misspelled a victim’s first name and reported the wrong age of her husband. She was Therese Rodriguez, not Theresa Rodriguez, and her husband, Richard Rodriguez, was 64, not 51. A corrected version of the story is below: Latest: Retired couple originally from Michigan among dead One of several married couples killed in the Texas church shooting was originally from Michigan SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas (AP) — The Latest on the church shooting in Texas (all times local): 6:50 p.m. One of several married couples killed in the Texas church shooting was originally from Michigan. Robert and Shani Corrigan got married the summer after graduating from high school in Michigan. His sister says they moved around during his three decades in the Air Force and first learned about the tiny town of Sutherland Springs, Texas, when he was stationed in San Antonio. His sister, Sharon Corrigan, says the couple bought a home in a nearby town, and when Robert Corrigan retired, he and his wife put down roots. She says a big part of their lives was First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs. The Corrigans were among the more than two dozen victims killed Sunday when a gunman opened fire inside the small church. The rampage marked the worst mass shooting in Texas history. The rampage killed several members of at least two extended families, many of them children. About 20 other church goers were wounded. ___ 4:45 p.m. Authorities in the hometown of the gunman who massacred worshippers at a Texas church are looking into whether they mishandled a sexual assault investigation of him four years ago. Records released by the Comal County sheriff’s office include a June 2013 report of an alleged sexual assault that lists Devin Patrick Kelley as the suspect. The report says deputies were sent around midnight on June 17, 2013, to the New Braunfels, Texas, home of Kelley’s family. Comal County Sheriff Mark Reynolds told The Associated Press Tuesday that it appears sheriff’s deputies investigated the case for three months after being called to Kelley’s home, but stopped investigating after they believed Kelley had left Texas and moved to Colorado. The local district attorney says the case was never presented to her. ___ 3:45 p.m. Doctors at one of the hospitals that received people injured in the Texas church shooting said their eight patients, who included children, were calm and brave. Dr. Kenneth Kingdon, noting that any trauma patient will be in shock, told a news conference Tuesday that the patients brought to Connally Memorial Medical Center in Floresville were “a little scared” but calm. He says, “They were all very cooperative and amazingly brave, considering the situation they’d been in.” More than two dozen were killed and about 20 were injured Sunday when a gunman opened fire at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, located about 13 miles from Floresville. Four of Connally’s eight patients were transferred to a San Antonio hospital. Three were treated and released from Connally and one remained Tuesday in stable condition. Kingdon said that in general, the victims had multiple gunshot wounds. Dr. Preston Morehead said staff members knew many of the patients already as friends or friends of family or because they were also patients at practices outside the emergency department. ___ 3:30 p.m. Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt says the pastor of the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs told him the man who massacred worshippers had attended the church’s Fall Festival on Halloween night and his behavior did not raise any alarms. Tackitt did not say if the pastor provided any details on that visit, such as what the shooter was doing, whether he wore a costume, or anything else that stood out. Tackitt told reporters Tuesday: “The pastor told me he was here at the festival Halloween night, saw him in the crowd.” Tackitt says the pastor told him Devin Kelley had attended services at the church before. Kelley opened fire in the church Sunday, killing 26. ___ 3 p.m. A man who says he’s the uncle of the gunman who killed more than two dozen in a Texas church is calling his nephew a “coward.” Dave Ivey appeared in an interview Monday with North West Digital News, a YouTube channel based in Washington state. Ivey says he hadn’t seen Devin Kelley in person for years, but that he maintained contact through Facebook. Ivey says he attempted to contact Kelley hours before the Sunday shooting after seeing a troubling Facebook post on Kelley’s page that said “he wasn’t thinking correctly and his head hurt.” Ivey says he private messaged Kelley, asking if he was OK, but didn’t hear back. Ivey identified himself as Kelley’s uncle on Facebook and in the interview. Kelley’s mother’s maiden name is Ivey, and the survivors listed in an obituary for Kelley’s maternal grandfather include a Dave Ivey of Longview, Washington. ___ 2:45 p.m. Authorities say that their tally of those killed in Sunday’s shooting at a Texas church includes an unborn baby. Texas Department of Public Safety officials confirmed Tuesday that their count of 26 victims included the unborn baby of Crystal Holcombe, who was killed along with three of her children. Authorities had previously said the age of the victims ranged from 18 months to 77 years. Crystal’s husband, John Holcombe, was injured in the shooting. The inclusion of the unborn child means nine of the 26 victims killed were members of the Holcombe family. Authorities have not officially released any names of victims, saying they were waiting for the medical examiner to confirm their findings. ___ 2:35 p.m. The Air Force says federal privacy laws prohibit it from commenting on a police report that the former airman who opened fire at a Texas church had escaped from a New Mexico mental health facility in 2012. Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek cited privacy regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which she said apply even though the former airman, Devin P. Kelley, died after the church attack, apparently from a self-inflicted gunshot. An El Paso, Texas, police report also says that Kelley made death threats against superior officers. Stefanek said the Air Force was looking into that report. ___ 2:15 p.m. A dozen Texas church shooting victims remain in hospitals two days after a gunman opened fire at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, killing 26. Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio on Tuesday afternoon reported having seven patients — five adults and two children. Spokeswoman Elaine Sanchez says their conditions range from fair to critical. Officials with University Health System in San Antonio say they have four church shooting patients — two adults and two children. Spokesman Don Finley says the conditions range from serious to critical. Megan Posey with Connally Memorial Medical Center in Floresville, about 10 miles from Sutherland Springs, reported one patient Tuesday was in stable condition. Authorities say the gunman fatally shot himself following a chase. ___ 1:35 p.m. A 2012 police report says that the Texas church gunman had made death threats against his military superiors and had been caught trying to sneak firearms onto an Air Force base in New Mexico where he had been stationed. The information was contained in a police incident report after Devin Kelley briefly escaped in June 2012 from a mental health facility in New Mexico where he had been committed. KVIA television in El Paso first reported about the escape. It was also reported by KPRC. Police in El Paso, Texas, where Kelley was caught after the escape, said in the report that an official of the mental health facility told them that Kelley “was a danger to himself and others.” The report says that Kelley had already been caught sneaking firearms onto Holloman Air Force base. It also says that he “was attempting to carry out death threats that (Kelley) had made on his military chain of command.” Kelley opened fire in a Baptist church Sunday, killing 26. ___ This version of the Latest corrects the 1:35 p.m. item to say that KVIA-TV in El Paso was the first to report about the escape, not KPRC. ___ 1:30 p.m. The gunman who attacked worshippers at a Texas church, killing more than two dozen, was in a mental health facility in New Mexico and briefly escaped in 2012. An El Paso, Texas, police incident report says Devin Patrick Kelley was stationed at Holloman Air Force Base when he was caught trying to bring firearms onto the base. The report obtained by KPRC-TV in Houston also says Kelley, 21 at the time, had made death threats against superior officers. He was committed to a mental health facility in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, but at some point escaped and was later found by police at a bus station in downtown El Paso in June 2012. ___ 12:05 p.m. Investigators say the FBI is trying to get into the cellphone that belonged to the man who fatally opened fire inside a small Texas church. Christopher Combs is the special agent in charge of the FBI’s San Antonio division. He said during a news conference Tuesday that the phone was flown to an FBI lab for analysis, but that agents have yet to access it. Combs declined to release the make or model of the phone. Combs was joined by other law enforcement officers who are investigating the Sunday shooting at the First Baptist Church in the tiny town of Sutherland Springs. The rampage left 26 victims dead and wounded about 20 others. Texas Department of Public Safety Regional Director Freeman Martin says 10 victims remain hospitalized Tuesday in critical condition. Martin says there are about 50 people in the congregation, adding that “there were very few that were here that were uninjured.” ___ 10:50 a.m. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis says he has directed the Pentagon’s watchdog to examine the circumstances of the Air Force’s failure to report the Texas church shooter’s domestic violence conviction to the FBI. Mattis says we have to “find out what’s going on.” Under Pentagon rules, convictions of military personnel in crimes like assault should be shared with the FBI for its National Criminal Information Center database. Devin Patrick Kelley, the gunman in Sunday’s attack, was convicted of assault against his wife and stepson in an Air Force court-martial in 2012. Mattis says the Pentagon must make certain it’s got “the right direction.” And he says he must “define what the problem is.” Mattis says: “If the problem is we didn’t put something out, we’ll correct that.” ___ 10:35 a.m. House Speaker Paul Ryan says he has questions for the Air Force about how the gunman at a Texas church obtained a gun. Devin Patrick Kelley had a history of domestic violence but was able to buy weapons because the Air Force did not submit his criminal history to the FBI as required by military rules. Ryan on Tuesday echoed other lawmakers — Republicans and Democrats — who want to know why there was a breakdown in the system that allowed Kelley to legally purchase a weapon. Ryan told reporters at a weekly news conference on Tuesday that he wants to know how Kelley slipped through the cracks. The shooting left 26 victims dead. ___ 10:05 a.m. Pope Francis has sent a telegram to the archbishop of San Antonio expressing his condolences for the deadly shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs. The telegram was sent Tuesday by the Vatican’s secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, who said the pope was “deeply grieved by news of the loss of life and grave injuries caused by the act of senseless violence.” The shooting Sunday left 26 victims dead. The pontiff sent condolences to “the families of the victims and the wounded, to the members of the congregation and the entire local community.” Francis also offered prayers “to console all who mourn and to grant them the spiritual strength that triumphs over violence and hatred by the power of forgiveness, hope and reconciling love.” ___ 10 a.m. Officials say at least five people injured in the South Texas church shooting are still being treated at hospitals. Spokeswoman Megan Posey says one patient remains listed in stable condition Tuesday at Connally Memorial Medical Center in Floresville, Texas. Two adults and two children who were hurt in the gunfire at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs on Sunday are still hospitalized at the University Health System in San Antonio. Spokesman Don Finley says their conditions range from serious to critical. Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio hasn’t responded to a request for details on patients being treated there. Authorities say Devin Patrick Kelley fired at least 450 rounds in the attack Sunday that left 26 dead. Sutherland Springs is about 35 miles (55 kilometers) southeast of San Antonio. ___ 9:30 a.m. A Texas couple who attended Sunday’s service where more than two dozen worshippers were fatally shot says the gunman appeared to target babies who cried and others who screamed or made noise. Roseanne Solis and her husband Joaquin Ramirez told KSAT-TV in San Antonio on Monday that people fell to the ground after the man sprayed gunfire from outside First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs. Authorities have identified the gunman as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley. Solis says there was a moment of silence before Kelley yelled, “Everybody die!” and then another round of gunfire began. Ramirez says after entering the church, Kelley first shot those in charge of the camera and audio of the service. He then moved down the center aisle toward those on the church dais. Solis was treated for a gunshot wound to the shoulder. ___ 8:30 a.m. The sister of a man who attended Sunday’s service at the South Texas church where 26 were killed says her brother and his wife were among those who died in the gunfire. Evangelina Santos told Univision on Monday that 64-year-old Richard Rodriguez and his wife Therese died in the shooting at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs. Santos says she was hoping they “were only hurt, not dead,” but authorities confirmed about 11 p.m. Sunday that her family members had died. She says her brother was a retired railroad worker who was often the center of attention. Authorities say 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley fired at least 450 rounds before two armed men confronted and chased him. Kelley was shot by his pursuers and authorities say a self-inflicted gunshot wound killed him. ___ 3:30 a.m. President Donald Trump says stricter gun control measures might have led to additional casualties during a mass shooting at a South Texas church. Trump said at a Tuesday news conference in South Korea that, “If you did what you’re suggesting, there would have been no difference three days ago and you might not have had that very brave person who happens to have a gun or a rifle in his trunk.” He had been asked whether he would support “extreme vetting” for gun purchases similar to the “extreme vetting” he’s called for of people entering the country. Trump says if that a neighboring good Samaritan hadn’t had a gun, “instead of having 26 dead, you would have had hundreds more dead.” Authorities say Devin Patrick Kelley fired at least 450 rounds of ammunition at worshippers in Sunday’s attack at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs. ___ 12:20 a.m. The gunman who opened fire in a small town Texas church was able to buy weapons because the Air Force did not submit his criminal history to the FBI as required by military rules. The Air Force acknowledged Monday that if the past offenses by Devin Patrick Kelley had been properly shared, they would have prevented him from buying a gun. In 2014, Kelley was formally ousted from the Air Force for a 2012 assault on his ex-wife in which he choked her and struck her son hard enough to fracture his skull. Authorities say Kelley fired at least 450 rounds of ammunition at worshippers in Sunday’s attack at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs. Get Morning Report and other email newsletters"
http://www.ibtimes.com/isis-sympathizer-planning-new-years-eve-mass-shooting-charged-australian-police-2620543,"A man who was reportedly planning a mass shooting in the Federation Square, Melbourne on New Year's Eve, was arrested by Australian police Monday. Ali Khalif Shire Ali, 20, from Werribee, Victoria, was arrested on Synnot Street on Melbourne's outskirts by officials of Victoria police, the Australian Federal police and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) around 3 p.m. local time Monday (11 p.m. EST Sunday). Ali appeared before the Melbourne Magistrates' Court, where he was charged with preparing to commit a terrorist attack and collecting documents to facilitate a terrorist act. According to 9News, given the seriousness of the charges filed against Ali, he could be facing life imprisonment. Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton said that Ali, an Australian citizen with Somalian parents,  made their list of “persons of high interest” after they discovered he was trying get an automatic rifle to ""shoot and kill as many people as he could"" around Federation Square, one of the most popular spots in Melbourne to bring in the New year. The police had kept a close eye on Ali’s actions between the months of March and June and found that the college student downloaded instructions from an al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula website on how to launch a terrorist attack and how to use guns. Patton said Ali, a known extremist and a sympathizer of the Islamic State group, had been having face-to-face meetings about getting a gun. ""We were monitoring this person. He has been subject to our active investigation and at no stage did he access a firearm — albeit that was his intention,"" Patton said. ""This is a person who would become particularly energized, for a lack of a better word, when overseas events occurred and would express a great deal of interest in committing an attack himself,” Patton added, ABC News reported. The suspect was placed under the federal custody after a search warrant was issued Monday for his home, where he lived with his parents and siblings. Additional search warrants were issued for the suspect’s relative's home and at a computer business where he once had a part-time job. Patton described the suspect as ""a person who's expressed an intention to try and kill as many people as he could through shooting them."" He added that arrest made by the authorities was to remove “the risk that was posed by this person.” As the end of the year celebrations near, Australian Justice Minister Michael Keenan has told the public to expect increased police presence. Nevertheless, he said that people can go about their daily business uninterrupted. ""The aim of these terrorists is to foster fear and intimidation, but Australians should be able to go about their business secure in the understanding that the government has worked very closely with law enforcement and other security agencies to keep them safe,"" Keenan told reporters, New York Daily News reported. This is not the first time that the counter-terrorism unit of Australian police has arrested a suspect over terror threats around the Christmas-New Year’s time. Keenan added that in December 2016, the police had taken four extremist in custody over a similar plot to attack Federal Square and other public places in Melbourne. Ali is the 74th suspect arrested in Australia since the country’s terrorism threat level was elevated to ""probable"" in September 2014. Since then, 31 counter-terrorism investigations have been conducted and 14 terrorism plots have been thwarted successfully by the anti-terrorism unit."

http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/corrine-brown-asks-for-mercy,"Hoping to avoid prison, former Florida Rep. Corrine Brownasked for mercy during her sentencing hearing Thursday. Brown also asked that U.S. District Judge Timothy Corrigan consider her years of public service, the Florida Times-Union reported. “I am 71 years old. I just had a birthday,” she said. “I humbly ask for your mercy and compassion.” Brown was found guilty of conspiracy involving a bogus charity used as a personal slush fund, concealing income on financial filings and filing false tax returns in May. The disgraced former Democratic congresswoman previously tried delaying her sentencing hearing, citing health reasons and being displaced because of Hurricane Irma. Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas provided testimony via telephone for Brown, calling her “a loving person,” First Coast News reported. Jackson Lee also said Brown was loved by the military veterans community and had assisted after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. “That shows a character of giving to others unselfishly,” Jackson Lee said of Brown. [Murkowski Tax Vote Contingent on Stabilizing the Individual Market] Brown’s attorney James Smith said she helped remove racial barriers and recalled a conversation with a woman who compared Brown to Martin Luther King Jr. “She truly is a legend,” he said. But because Brown refused to admit guilt, prosecutors said that she should face between five and nine years in prison. “She ran for office to be a leader of American democracy while she stole money in a multitude of ways,” Assistant U.S. Attorney A. Tysen Duva said. Duva also cited Brown saying the government targeted her as a black woman and her suggestion that the Justice Department could have used the energy it spent prosecuting her to stop the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub last year in Orlando. “I wonder if any of her character witnesses will address this. Why will you support someone who says this nonsense,” Duva said. Smith responded by saying Brown regretted her comments about the shooting and while there is no evidence Brown was targeted for her race, women her age remember a time when black women were targeted. Corrigan is set to sentence Brown on Dec. 4. During the hearing, Corrigan said he would try to give Brown a fair sentence. “Ironically, when judges impose sentence, our job is not to be judgmental. Our job is to be an instrument of the law and reflect the mores and values … that we agree to,” he said. “And that is a very complicated stew.”"

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/493363520/0/usatodaycomnation-topstories~Rancho-Tehama-Why-do-mass-shooters-target-children-strangers/,"REDDING, Calif. — For most, it's a question that defies reason: Why does someone like the suspect in Tuesday's Rancho Tehama rampage try to kill everyone in sight, even strangers and children? Psychologists interviewed by the Record Searchlight Wednesday said the shooter likely is either trying — as will an animal — to recapture dominance or honor through violence; or is subscribing to extremist ideology that justifies the violence, or is so paranoid that the person thinks everyone is conspiring against him. ""You are becoming life or death,"" said Arie Kruglanski, distinguished psychology professor at the University of Maryland, College Park. ""That is a way of, in some strange way, asserting your dominance and importance. And these people are probably desperate for that kind of feeling."" More: California shooter built his own illegal guns, officials say More: California mass shooting suspect killed wife, hid body day before rampage, officials say Investigators haven't figured out whether that's what motivated the Rancho Tehama shooter, identified by police as 44-year-old Kevin Janson Neal. They say Neal shot his wife Monday, then targeted people at random throughout the tiny community southwest of Red Bluff on Tuesday, killing four more of them and injuring 10, including children. Most shooters don't have a history of serious mental illness, and — as in Neal's case — studies have found more than half of their rampages start with a domestic incident, said J. Reid Meloy, a forensic psychologist and consultant for the FBI. ""Their actual lives are swimming in misery,"" he said. ""This is a final statement."" For some mass killers, feelings of injustice from those personal or workplace spats are so severe that it warps their sense of rational thought. That means seemingly random victims may actually be part of a ""paranoid pseudo-community,"" a group that can include strangers and even children because the suspect sees conspiracy everywhere, Meloy said. ""There’s an active belief that there are other people conspiring against them, and that tends to feed the anger and feed the suspicions and hyper-vigilance,"" he said. ""From the outside, it looks like these strangers are randomly selected. But from inside the paranoid perspective, they are a part of this community of conspirators ... That could involve just opportunistic victims that are out on the street."" More: 'Guns don't kill people; men and boys kill people,' experts say More: Sutherland Springs: Mass shooters often have domestic violence trait More: 3 mass shootings in the past 17 months have been among the nation's bloodiest Targeting children may also tie back to the dominance theory, and it's possible the children weren't targeted themselves but to make their parents suffer, Kruglanski said ""He wanted to hurt other people, and therefore assert his great power,"" Kruglanski said. ""And what can hurt other people more than killing their children?"" Another theory about children: If Neal was deeply unhappy, he could have just been bitter that kids are usually carefree. ""In contrast to the happiness of the children, he may feel particularly unhappy and humiliated,"" Kruglanski said. ""And, 'I’m going to show them that I am the power the make them unhappy.'"" Still, Richard Cooter, chair of The George Washington University's forensic psychology program, said each case is different, and you can't necessarily inject logic into a deranged mind. ""You can't logically figure it out,"" he said. ""Clearly, little kids in the school have nothing to do with this. And so at that point, it’s just sort of generalized rage."" Cooter said it's possible Neal killing his wife made him realize he would be going to prison, so he figured he may as well die — but get his revenge on a society perceived as unfair first. ""You can probably assume that, whatever it was, it got out of control, and at the time that it was really out of control, that he just decided to go out in a blaze of glory,"" Cooter said. Kruglanski believes America's ""cultural narrative"" around guns can foster the feelings that mass shooters dwell on. ""In our culture, where guns are used for self-protection, self-protection is a way of disallowing others to humiliate you, to take your property, to divest you of your rights,"" he said. ""Self-protection is more than self-protection: It’s assertion of your honor and, in our country, unfortunately, we have this idea that guns are for protection, for honor, for significance. And I think that adds fuel to the rage and to the sense of empowerment that guns will bring you."" How do we make the violence stop? Preventing mass killings with a profile is challenging, Cooter said. ""There are a lot of people who have grievances, who are loners, who will never hurt anybody. And so if you said, 'There’s your profile,' you’d end up ... identifying all sorts of people who will never be dangerous to anybody,"" he said. Another problem: Meloy said people with mental illnesses that cause paranoia can be treated with medications, but there's no such remedy for someone whose ingrained world-view is behind it, like in those with paranoid personality disorder. ""For the individuals who are paranoid, they often present great difficulties for law enforcement because they will engage in behaviors that will (warrant) law enforcement attention, but then confirm their paranoid beliefs,"" he said. ""They’re very, very difficult cases for law enforcement to manage."" Tehama County authorities have already said as much about Neal, whom they had on their radar as ""not law enforcement-friendly."" ""It appears that there were a lot of warning behaviors in this particular case,"" Meloy said. ""Fundamentally, the mass murderers cannot be predicted specifically, but there are steps that can be taken to prevent them ... (including) a concerted effort to both involve law enforcement as well as involve mental health professionals in individuals that raise concern in people’s minds.""

http://www.indiewire.com/2017/11/american-horror-story-cult-finale-review-season-7-episode-11-ahs-cult-recap-spoilers-1201897366/,"Ben Travers Nov 14, 2017 11:03 pm @BenTTravers Sarah Paulson in “American Horror Story: Cult” Frank Ockenfels/FX [Editor’s Note: The following review contains spoilers for “American Horror Story: Cult,” Season 7, Episode 11, “Great Again” — the season finale.] As one cult comes to an end, another begins. So goes “American Horror Story: Cult,” the ambitious seventh season of Ryan Murphy’s acclaimed horror franchise. After spending an entire season examining a Trump stand-in’s reign of terror, the ending ominously hinted at a new king — well, a new queen. Ally (Sarah Paulson) took down Kai (Evan Peters), stole his senate seat, and began her own quest for greater power — with the help of “some very special, very powerful friends who are going to bring about the better world we were talking about.” Made clear when she dons her green hood, Ally is referring to the radical feminist cult inspired by Valerie Solanas’ (Lena Dunham) “SCUM Manifesto.” It appears the newly elected senator is ready to unleash the female rage first cultivated by Solanas, later resurrected by Bebe Babbit (Frances Conroy) in the present day, and eventually abandoned by her puppet-gone-rogue, Kai. As the acronym implies — SCUM stands for “Society for Cutting Up Men” — Ally is ready to claim her vengeance on the world that wronged her and all other women. Kai was first, but his cult of fear has been replaced by one that’s ready to kill all men in order to install a female-led society.  Speaking as a white man, well, that actually sounds about right. Go for it. But aside from the radical vision for the future, the actual ending left a lot to be desired. For one, the twist ending — that Kai’s plan to kill Ally was actually part of Ally’s plan to kill Kai — was as predictable and problematic as the rest of “American Horror Story.” Never once did it seem like Ally wasn’t one step ahead, leading to an overall lack of suspense, and the idea that she convinced a prison guard to have sex with Kai for God knows how long in order to dupe him into escaping is the kind of soapy trademark lunacy that powers much of the series’ conceits. A lot of the episode clearly sounds good on paper, from the flash-forward intro that pretends to promise a safe ending for Kai, to the actual ending where Ally ushers in an era where the future is exclusively female. It’s in the obvious, flare-less execution and muddled overall message that leads to a shrugging agreement instead of a fist-pumping, wide-eyed agreement.  Let’s see how we got there: The finale begins with Kai in prison. As manipulative and lethal as ever, Kai has quickly amassed a small army in Mississippi’s maximum security prison, but it’s unclear how he got there. So we flash back to 11 months earlier as Kai plans for The Night of 100 Tates, his slightly adjusted master plan (1000 Tates proved too ambitious) to murder over eight dozen pregnant women in the name of Sharon Tate and the Manson family members who murdered her.  Before the fateful onslaught begins, Ally tells Kai a harsh truth regarding his horrific murder of sister Winter (Billie Lourd) in the previous episode. Ally tells Kai he killed the wrong person: Winter didn’t betray him. Some random member of Kai’s posse did (R.I.P. Speedwagon). This sends Kai into a mournful turmoil, but he rallies at Ally’s urging… …until the FBI shows up. Ally, it turns out, has been working as an informant since she joined Kai’s cult. Agents came to see her after she was institutionalized (following the shooting in Episode 6) and gave her immunity for whatever she had to do in order to expose Kai’s criminal organization. That’s a much-needed legal excuse for how she escaped jail time for all those murders, especially when the raid ends. Ally is elevated to hero status as “the woman who escaped a cult but lost her wife,” and she makes a bid for the vacant Michigan Senate seat. Seeing this on TV spurs Kai to escape, and thus Ally’s master plan to come together. As Kai waves a gun in her face, interrupting a debate with the other candidate in order to scream “get me a sandwich” at Ally, he pulls the trigger on an empty chamber. The gun given to him by the duplicitous security guard doesn’t go off, but Beverly’s (Adina Porter) does.  “There is something more dangerous in this world than a humiliated man — a nasty woman,” Ally says, right before Beverly pulls the trigger and kills Kai. From there, Ally wins the election and unveils her membership in the aforementioned cult of SCUM. That idea is one of many intriguing concepts tossed around during Season 7, and “AHS: Cult” did a decent job juggling its many themes centered around women being manipulated, used, and trampled on by men. Its historical references, often weirdly altered to fit the series’ narrative, were a bit rushed and thus ineffectively melodramatic, but Solanas’ rage very nearly fueled the cascade of killings that came after her one-episode appearance. The finale’s closing message may not be as incendiary as intended — whether it’s meant to be daunting or satirical, the latter being the historically accepted intention of Solanas’ manifesto — but “Cult” managed to engage in a topical conversation throughout the season. Often dulled by a convoluted plot and violence that was either too tame or unimaginatively blunt, this is far from the razor’s edge of socio-political commentary. “The cult continues, and we’re all in one or another” is hardly a revolutionary message, but the show still managed to remind us of what’s been happening to women for so, so long. Whether it’s what’s been going on in the real world or the show, a vengeful misandrist takeover feels as justifiable as ever right now.

Bryan Holcombe was walking up to the pulpit on Sunday, preparing to lead the audience in worship, when a gunman began to spray bullets at the congregation. Holcombe, an associate pastor for the church, was killed in the gunfire, his parents, Joe and Claryce Holcombe, said in an interview with The Washington Post. Bryan Holcombe’s wife of about four decades, Karla Holcombe, was also in church Sunday. She died too, said Joe Holcombe. Bryan and Karla had a son, Marc Daniel Holcombe, 36. He too was killed, Joe Holcombe said. Marc Daniel had an infant daughter, named Noah Holcombe, who, according to Joe, was a year old. She is dead too. Another son of Bryan and Karla, John Holcombe, is alive, said Joe. But his wife Crystal Holcombe is dead. Crystal Holcombe was pregnant. She and the unborn child were both killed. Crystal had five children. Three of them, Emily, Megan and Greg, died. She had been at church with her husband, John, who thankfully survived along with two of her children. That’s eight members of the extended Holcombe family dead, in addition to the unborn child. All at once, Joe and Claryce Holcombe lost children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and a future great grandchild. The act of violence that wiped out generations of their loved ones took place in the space that mattered to them most: their church. The Holcombes were among the 26 people authorities say died in Sunday’s mass shooting, the worst in Texas history. As the morning stretched to afternoon and evening, friends and family members in South Texas posted on Facebook, asking if anyone had heard from their loved ones. Joe and Claryce Holcombe first heard about the shooting an hour after it happened, through a phone call from a member of the church they attend, a different Baptist church in nearby Floresville, Texas. “He said there was a big shooting and he didn’t say much more than that,” Joe Holcombe, 86, said. Then, in a conversation with the church’s head pastor, they started to hear the wrenching news. “Bryan and Karla?” Joe Holcombe asked the church’s pastor. “They’re both in heaven,” the pastor responded. As the day went on, they would learn of the others. John Holcombe, who teaches Sunday school and runs the audio for Sunday services at First Baptist Church, was struck with shrapnel in his leg, he told Joe and Claryce Holcombe by phone later that day. His daughter remained hospitalized Sunday night, though mostly for observation, Joe Holcombe said. She was injured when another person fell on her, Claryce Holcombe said. Their grandparents described them as “fantastic” parents, and a “happy family.” Crystal Holcombe home-schooled her five children and was heavily involved in the church, like the rest of the family. On Facebook, she reported proudly of her children’s successes in competitions for their local 4H, and wrote about a recent bake sale in which the girls participated, benefiting families affected by Hurricane Harvey. Her husband, John, posted frequently about his lesson plans for Sunday school. For this week’s lesson, he planned to focus on Exodus 16, he wrote in a Facebook post. It describes how God provided the Israelites with food as they traveled for 40 days in the desert, “Manna from Heaven.” Bryan Holcombe was filling in Sunday for the church’s lead pastor, who was out of town when the shooting happened. And according to his parents, the associate pastor has been involved in church work ever since he was young. “We knew when he was born, that he was going to be a preacher,” Joe Holcombe, his father, told The Post. “His first word was God.” His first sentence? “See the light.” On Facebook, Bryan Holcombe is shown hoisting his grandchildren on his shoulders, dressing up in costumes for church events, and playing his ukulele. He would often play the instrument and sing for prison inmates, a relative told the Associated Press. “Grandkids, it doesn’t get any better!” Bryan Holcombe wrote on Facebook on one photo of his many grandchildren. “I’ll wake up at night and, in prayer, thank God for each of them . . . it takes a while:-)” He and his wife Karla lived near his parents, between Floresville and Sutherland Springs. He ran a business on his parents’ farm, making tarps for cattle trailers, Joe Holcombe said. Bryan and Karla Holcombe were high school sweethearts. One day, their high school was selling roses, offering to deliver them to the classrooms of admirers. So Bryan Holcombe delivered a rose to each and every one of Karla’s classes that day. “He thought she was cute, and she was,” Joe Holcombe said. Karla Holcombe had the “gift of hospitality,” her mother-in-law said. She had planned on hosting the family’s Thanksgiving. Joe and Claryce Holcombe, who are both retired teachers, hosted a group of nearby pastors and churchgoers at their home on Sunday as they waited for details about the deceased. They prayed together. “It’s of course going to be difficult,” Joe Holcombe said about the days ahead. But, he said, “we are Christians, we have read the book. We know the ending, and it’s good.” “They’re in heaven,” he added. “And they’re a lot better off than we are.” The shooting at First Baptist Church shattered scores of other families in this rural, tightknit community. Frank Pomeroy, the pastor of First Baptist Church, told ABC News that he did not attend the church service but that his teenage daughter, Annabelle Pomeroy, 14, was killed. “She was very quiet, shy, always smiling, and helpful to all,” Cynthia Rangel, 50, a resident of Stockdale, said of Annabelle Pomeroy. Rangel, a local emergency medical technician, said she knew three individuals who were hospitalized after the shooting and were undergoing surgery. “This just all seems like it’s not real.” As Michael Ward pulled wounded congregants out of the church, he searched for his nephew, three nieces and his sister-in-law, the San Antonio Express-News reported. “My nephew was outside with four bullets in him,” he said of Rylind Ward, 5. “And Rhianna, the bullet broke her glasses, and broke ’em off, and she said she hid underneath the pew and didn’t get hit,” he said of his 9-year-old niece. Sandy Ward told MSNBC that her 5-year-old grandson was in surgery, and her 7-year-old granddaughter was killed. She waited at the hospital Sunday with her son. “He’s a wreck, of course, as you can imagine,” Ward told MSNBC. “I’m just in shock.” “I’m numb,” she added. “My whole body’s just numb.” Joe and Claryce Holcombe said they’re still coming to terms with what happened. The shooter, Joe Holcombe said, is “being rewarded right now for what he did, and for all of eternity.” But, Claryce added, “we need to pray for his family, because they’re going through a terrible time, too.” “God will see us through,” Joe Holcombe said. “We’ll all be together soon.”   Get Morning Report and other email newsletters"

(Mark Mulligan/Houston Chronicle via AP)  By Eli Rosenberg,Alex Horton and Mark Berman |The Washington Post NEW BRAUNFELS – Texas – Authorities worked on multiple fronts Tuesday seeking a fuller portrait of the gunman who left at least 26 people dead at a Texas church and how a breakdown in military protocols failed to flag a domestic violence conviction that should have blocked him from buying firearms.

Even as tiny Sutherland Springs began funerals and mourning that touch nearly every family, more chilling details emerged of how the black-clad attacker, Devin P. Kelley, methodically tried to take as many victims as possible as he stalked the pews. David Brown, whose mother Farida survived the carnage, said she described Kelley taking aim at churchgoers on Sunday as they tried to flee and then walking “up and down the aisle” firing at people cowering or wounded on the ground in the church, about 35 miles south of Kelley’s home in New Braunfels. The gunman fired four shots into the torso of the woman on Farida Brown’s left, her son said. “With every shot, she was crying,” Brown said of the woman. “She was just staring at my mom while she tried to comfort her.” As he fired rounds into the woman, Brown held her hand, telling her she was heading to heaven. Farida Brown had sustained shots to her legs, but expected she would be the next target of the gunman. “Then she thought that it was her turn,” David Brown told The Washington Post. “She just started praying.” What triggered Kelley’s rampage remains unclear. A regional director for the Texas Department of Public Safety, Freeman Martin, has said only that it appeared to stem from a domestic situation and was not racially or religiously motivated. But it has brought sharp attention to the deep-rooted gun culture in parts of rural Texas and how many believe that open access to weapons and greater citizen vigilance is the best deterrent to gun violence. Such views are deeply at odds with those calling for stricter gun controls in the United States. Reading this on your phone?

President Donald Trump staked out a position Tuesday squarely on one side, asserting that tougher gun laws would not have stopped the mass shooting in Sutherland Springs. Speaking in Seoul, Trump further claimed “hundreds more” may have died had another man not been able to “neutralize” the alleged killer with a gun of his own. Asked during a news conference here whether he would support “extreme vetting” on guns – the same phrase Trump has used to encourage deep scrutiny into visa applications – he said “it would have made no difference three days ago.” Trump praised as a “hero” a local man, Stephen Willeford, who exchanged fire with Kelley outside the church. Police found Kelley dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after a high-speed car chase. How Kelley obtained the weapons also has become a source of a separate investigation. The Air Force on Monday says it failed to follow policies for alerting federal law enforcement about Kelley’s violent past when he served at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. Kelley should have been barred from purchasing firearms and body armor because of his domestic violence conviction in 2014. Kelley was sentenced to a year in prison and kicked out of the military with a bad conduct discharge following two counts of domestic abuse against his wife and a child, according to Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek. “Initial information indicates that Kelley’s domestic violence offense was not entered into the National Criminal Information Center database,” Stefanek said in a statement released Monday. Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson and Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein have directed an investigation of Kelley’s case and “relevant policies and procedures,” she said. Kelley purchased two weapons from a gun retailer, Academy Sports, after clearing federal background checks this year and in 2016. It remains unclear whether those were the same weapons used in Sunday’s massacre, but his ability to purchase guns at all highlights the Air Force’s failure to follow Pentagon guidelines for ensuring certain violent offenses are reported to the FBI. Police and court records in three states paint the picture of a young former U.S. airman with a sometimes violent private life. In briefings Monday, local officials – who emphasized that the investigation is ongoing – said that at least one of Kelley’s relatives attended First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, and that the shooting was proceeded by a “domestic situation.” Kelley graduated from New Braunfels High School in 2009, a spokeswoman for the school district said. His senior photo was the only image of him in the yearbook. “We are shocked to hear that a graduate of our lone high school is allegedly responsible for this tragedy,” read a statement from spokeswoman Rebecca Villarreal. “This senseless act of violence is something that is hard to understand and has definitely shaken our community. We grieve with those that suffered a loss and offer our deepest condolences.” Like our Facebook page for more conversation and news coverage from San Jose, the Bay Area and beyond. According to court-martial documents released Monday evening by the Air Force, Kelley was found guilty of domestic violence. Prosecutors alleged that on June 21, 2011, and April 27, 2012, he unlawfully struck, choked, kicked and pulled the hair of his wife and struck her young child “with a force likely to produce death or grievous bodily harm.” Court records in nearby Alamogordo, New Mexico, show that in May 2012, Tessa K. Kelley filed for divorce from her husband, who she said was in jail at the time. After his prison sentence, Kelley was reduced in rank and released from the military with a bad-conduct discharge in 2014. The military sentence raises key questions for investigators about how Kelley obtained his weapons. Officials said they recovered at least four guns from Kelley’s vehicle, but also said that Kelley had sought and failed to obtain a permit allowing him to carry a concealed weapon. Officials with the Air Force said Monday that his conviction – which should have prevented him from purchasing weapons – had not been properly flagged for the FBI and that they would launch an internal investigation. In August 2014, Kelley was charged with a misdemeanor count of mistreatment, neglect or cruelty to animals in nearby El Paso County, Colorado, where he lived at one point, records show. Sheriff’s deputies responded to a call about a man who was punching a dog, police records indicate. Four witnesses told deputies that they saw a man matching Kelley’s description yelling at and chasing a white-and-brown husky. “The suspect then started beating on the dog with both fists, punching it in the head and chest,” a deputy wrote in the incident report. “He could hear the suspect yelling at the dog and while he was striking it, the dog was yelping and whining. The suspect then picked up the dog by the neck into the air and threw it onto the ground and then drug him away to lot 60.” Kelley was charged with animal cruelty and the dog was transferred to the Humane Society for a full medical evaluation. This summer, Kelley worked briefly as an unarmed night security guard at a Schlitterbahn water park in New Braunfels, the company said. He passed a Texas Department of Public Safety criminal background check before beginning work there, a spokeswoman said, though she added that Kelley was fired in July – as the season was reaching its peak – because he was “not a good fit.” He was also able to pass a background check that allowed him to work for HEB, a Texas grocery chain, in New Braunfels. Company spokeswoman Dya Campos said he worked there for two months in 2013 and quit; she was unsure of his position there. Records indicate that Kelley lived for some period on a property valued at about $800,000 owned by his parents in New Braunfels. The secluded home sits on 28 acres of wooded farmland, separated from the nearest main road by a long private driveway. Neighbors told local news media that Kelley lived in a barn behind the 3,700-square-foot home with his current wife and 2-year-old son. They said the family had lived there for more than a decade. Dave Ivey, who identified himself as Kelley’s uncle, apologized to the shooting victims in an interview with NBC News. “I never in a million years could have believed Devin could be capable of this kind of thing,” Ivey said. “My family will suffer because of his coward actions.” Mark Moravitz, who lives across the street from the Kelley family, also said he frequently heard gunfire coming from the property, often at 10 or 11 p.m. “We hear a lot of gunfire,” he told KSAT, “but we’re out in the country.” A Facebook page bearing Kelley’s name showed a photo of a Ruger assault-style rifle – the kind of weapon police say was used in the shooting. The page was taken down on Sunday. Former high school classmates of Kelley took to their own Facebook pages in shock, describing him as a social outcast whom some had blocked or deleted from their social networking because he sent inappropriate or aggressive messages. “I was close with Devin Kelley from middle school through high school . . . and I had always known there was something off about him,” Courtney Kleiber wrote on Facebook. “He use to be happy at one point, normal, your average kid,” she wrote. “Over the years we all saw him change into something that he wasn’t. To be completely honest, I’m really not surprised this happened, and I don’t think anyone who knew him is very surprised either.”  —  Horton and Berman reported from Washington.

The sales occurred in 2016 and 2017, respectively, and in both cases were approved through the National Instant Criminal Background Check system, a store representative said in a statement. The store is cooperating with authorities in their investigation. The legal purchases were made despite Kelley's bad conduct discharge from the Air Force in 2012, which followed a domestic violence conviction. Devin Patrick Kelley went on to use one of those weapons to shoot and kill 26 people at a Sutherland Springs church on Sunday. Twenty more were wounded.

He had bought a total of four, one a year, between 2014 and 2017, officials said Monday morning. Two were purchased in Colorado and two in Texas, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. He did not have a license-to-carry permit, officials said.

http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-rahm-emanuel-mom-birthday-20171109-story.html,"Welcome to Clout Street: Morning Spin, our weekday feature to catch you up with what's going on in government and politics from Chicago to Springfield. Subscribe here. Mayor Rahm Emanuel typically doesn't like it when reporters bring up his family members, but after Wednesday's City Council meeting, he put his mom front and center. The mayor started his postgame presser with a request of broadcasters. ""You all have to do me one favor today. I'm going to start, because this is one thing I can do that neither one of my brothers can do. Mom, if you're watching, happy birthday. ... Happy birthday, thank you for everything you've done for us and continue to do."" Later, Emanuel noted his mother, Marsha, had turned 85. ""She's deaf, but she can only hear if you didn't call."" As it turns out, that call to wish Mom a happy birthday came at a pivotal point during the City Council meeting. Chance the Rapper took to the microphone during the public comment portion of the meeting, but Emanuel, who normally runs the show, had stepped out of the room. The rap artist noticed. ""It's cool,"" he said, before asking that aldermen vote against the mayor's measure to spend $10 million toward a new $95 million police training center on the West Side. Asked about the comments, Emanuel said he wasn't snubbing Chance, and praised him for his work on behalf of the arts and his decision to speak up Wednesday. ""It's not when he spoke that I stepped out. I stepped out beforehand. It was actually to call my mother,"" Emanuel said. ""And I had not called her in the morning, because we had the morning meetings. ... Don't ever be late calling a Jewish mother on her birthday."" *Mayor Emanuel will tour the Chicago Blackhawks' future practice rink, MB Ice Arena. *Gov. Bruce Rauner will attend an Illinois National Guard deployment. *The Illinois Senate will meet and will get the same sexual harassment training the House did on Wednesday. *Several state senators will hold a Capitol news conference to announce the formation of a women's caucus. The group includes Sens. Heather Steans, D-Chicago; Karen McConnaughay R-St. Charles; and Toi Hutchinson, D-Chicago Heights. An advisory said the group will promote legislation that addresses women's issues. *'Should I even hug you?': Sexual harassment has gone from a topic that wasn't talked about at the Capitol to one that is now the subject of awkward jokes. Since allegations of rampant sexual harassment have surfaced in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal in Hollywood, compliments at the Capitol are doled out with a caveat, and hugs come with a disclaimer that the hugger isn't trying to offend. ""I've noticed people being more reserved in their interactions, particularly with women colleagues, almost to the point of farce, like making jokes about 'Should I even hug you?' "" said state Rep. Will Guzzardi, D-Chicago. ""I am glad it's on people's minds, I am glad people are thinking twice before they touch people,"" Guzzardi said. ""My worry is that when this isn't under the bright lights, that people will just revert to their old ways of doing things."" (Monique Garcia) *Democratic challenge to Durkin emerges: House Republican leader Jim Durkin of Western Springs already faces a potential primary challenge, and now a Democratic candidate for the general election also has surfaced. Elyse Hoffenberg says she will run in Durkin's southwest suburban district. She is an attorney, a school board member and a commissioner on the LaGrange village fire and police board. On the Republican side, Durkin is facing a possible March primary challenge from Burr Ridge Village President Mickey Straub. In a statement, Hoffenberg accused Durkin of encouraging lawmakers ""to blindly follow"" Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner's agenda to ""enrich big corporations at the expense of middle-class families."" ""It's time for a leader who understands that this seat doesn't belong to Bruce Rauner or his wealthy friends. It belongs to the people of the 82nd District,"" she said. (Rick Pearson) *Illinois Democrats sign onto assault weapons ban: After Sunday morning's mass shooting in Texas, Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth joined 20 other Democratic senators to sign onto a bill to ban military-style assault weapons. It's not likely to be considered by a Republican-controlled Congress. But the measure would prohibit the sale, manufacture, transfer and importation of 205 assault weapons named in the bill, though owners of existing weapons could keep them, the lawmakers said. The bill also would ban so-called ""bump stocks,"" such as those found on weapons in the hotel room of the assailant in last month's Las Vegas massacre. The devices let semi-automatic weapons fire at fully automatic rates. ""I don't want my daughter to have to grow up in a country that won't protect her from firearm violence,"" said Duckworth, whose only child will be 3 years old later this month. ""We owe it to the countless and growing number of firearm violence victims to take action, not just deliver thoughts and prayers."" Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the lead sponsor, said the proposal was introduced so that after every mass shooting with a military-style assault weapon, ""the American people will know that a tool to reduce these massacres is sitting in the Senate, ready for debate and a vote."" Congress in 1994 passed a 10-year ban on assault weapons, but it lapsed in 2004. (Katherine Skiba) *Quick spins: News organizations aren't supposed to cheerlead, but there was ABC-Ch. 7 Chicago's Facebook account getting out the virtual pom poms, posting: ""GO CHANCE!! Chance the Rapper took on Chicago's City Council this morning."" ... Cook County Chief Judge Timothy Evans is a veteran Chicago politician dating to the Council Wars. So it should be no surprise that he made sure to be in the photo as former President Barack Obama left the room Wednesday after being spared sitting on a jury. ... Democratic candidate for governor J.B. Pritzker announced the endorsement of state Sen. Andy Manar on Wednesday. *Emanuel: Allow taxis to charge surge prices, require same background checks as Uber, Lyft drivers. *Chance the Rapper asks Chicago aldermen not to fund $95 million cop training academy. They advance the plan anyway. *Lawmakers get sexual harassment prevention training: If you wouldn't say it in front of grandma, don't. *Obama reports for jury duty at Daley Center but is dismissed a short time later. Then he speaks at previously scheduled Michael Sacks event. *Detainees regularly expose themselves to female public defenders, suit alleges. *City officials rip Burke idea to fine pedestrians using phones in intersections. *City selling $1 vacant lots to develop affordable housing. *Dart moves to fire jail guard for family leave misuse. *Close friendships could lead to sharper memory, study says. *Chicago Brauhaus closing in December, says owner. *Major investors sue Outcome Health, alleging firm committed fraud to secure $487.5M investment. *Track Illinois campaign contributions in real time here and here. *Tuesday's election shows suburban problems for Trump. *Hatch says election results complicate GOP tax plans. *AT&T, Time Warner under pressure to sell CNN. *Puerto Rico reports increase in deaths after storm.

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/487883004/0/usatodaycomnation-topstories~Churches-look-to-tighten-security-even-arm-congregants-after-Texas-shooting/,"In 2007, the unthinkable happened at New Life Church in Colorado Springs. A gunman opened fire outside the church, just as its midday service had dismissed. His bullets hit several members of the same family as they left, wounding David Works and killing his two teenage daughters, Rachel and Stephanie. More than 600 people were on the church campus when Matthew Murray — a 24-year-old man armed with an assault rifle, two pistols and enough ammunition to kill 100 people — made his way inside the building, church pastor Brady Boyd remembered. “I know there’s a great theological debate about what Jesus would do,” he said. “I just know firsthand for me, on the day the shooting happened on our campus, we lost two very good, sweet, young teenage girls, and that was awful and horrific, but we could have very well lost 100 people that day.” Boyd believes that didn’t happen because Murray ran into Jeanne Assam, a former police officer and member of the church security team who was legally carrying a pistol. Assam returned fire, ending the attack that had started 12 hours earlier, when the gunman had shot and killed several others at a nearby mission center. The memories of that day came flooding back for Boyd when he learned of the mass shooting Sunday that left 26 people dead and tens more wounded at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, described as the deadliest attack on a church in modern American history. Boyd said he had just moderated a discussion with Kay Warren of Saddleback Church about mental health during this weekend’s services. He was showing Warren the church’s memorial — a space for healing and reflection that includes a park bench and two spruce trees — when someone approached with the news from Texas. “We stopped and mourned and were so sad yesterday to hear the news. It was devastating to us. It brings back a lot of painful memories for us,” he said. Reflecting on the attack on his church 10 years ago in a blog post Monday morning, the pastor wrote, “The sad reality is that every church should have a strategy to protect its members when they gather.” More: Why AR-15 style rifles are common among mass shootings More: The man who took down the Texas church gunman More: Texas church shooting: 8 members of one family killed More: Trump: Tighter gun control could have meant 'hundreds more deaths' in Texas Across the country, many churches and other places of worship are considering security measures as mass shootings have become a tragically familiar narrative in the United States. In the last five years alone, gunmen have taken lives not only at churches such as New Life, First Baptist and Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., but also a mosque, Jewish center and Sikh temple. On Sunday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton suggested on Fox News that churchgoers carry concealed weapons. He was echoed by Rev. Robert Jeffress of First Baptist Church of Dallas, also on Fox News, who insisted that if a gunman opened fire at his church, “they may get one shot off or two shots off, but that’s it, and that’s the last thing they’ll ever do in this life.” That’s because as many as half his church members carry concealed weapons into church with them on a given Sunday, Jeffress estimated. “This is the world we’re living in. We need to do everything we can to keep our parishioners safe,” he said. Also in the Lone Star State, Rev. Jack Graham, pastor of Prestonwood Baptist Church in Plano, Texas, tweeted that his church was planning security training for church leaders. In Texas, a licensed gun owner can take a gun to church unless the church has said otherwise, according to the National Rifle Association’s Institute for Legislative Action. But gun laws vary from state to state, as does guidance on guns in churches from denomination to denomination and church to church. And few Americans were in favor of guns in churches in a 2012 PRRI survey: More than three-quarters of respondents (76%) said concealed weapons should not be allowed in houses of worship. The Council on American-Islamic Relations has compiled resources about mosque safety and the Sikh Coalition recently launched a security initiative. In the past few years, the Anti-Defamation League, founded to combat anti-Semitism and other bigotries, has been sharing what it has learned with other religious and community groups, according to Elise Jarvis, the ADL’s associate director, law enforcement outreach and communal security. “Unfortunately, the reality of the Jewish community is we are targets,” Jarvis said. “It’s something we’ve been dealing with for decades.” Jarvis suggested places of worship build relationships with law enforcement so their first call to police isn’t a 911 call, and officers understand the community. She also suggested they pay close attention to who attends their services and other events, something that can be as simple as greeting people at the door, and having plans in place for different emergencies. Boyd, the pastor at New Life, said he knows not all are comfortable with the idea of guns in church. Most crimes can be deterred by a uniformed police presence — hiring an off-duty police officer or recruiting a volunteer officer who attends the church, he said. Quickly after the shooting on its campus, Boyd said, New Life made the decision to talk openly about what had happened, something he encourages for other churches facing tragedy, like in Sutherland Springs. The church brought in counselors to talk with church members. Even a decade later, he says he talks about it from the pulpit. It’s going to take a long time for members of First Baptist Church to feel “normal” again, he said. But, he added, “our faith tells us when the enemy means us harm, our God can turn it for good, and so we’ve seen that happen at New Life.”"

Voices without faces read aloud verses from the scripture. ""For everyone who believes in him shall have eternal life,"" says one in a simple recording on a loop over a public address system. That's what several dozen residents of Sutherland Springs and nearby communities saw and heard when the church that witnessed a horrific mass killing was opened for short, solemn tours. The tours, which included ones for reporters and photographers, came just before sundown Sunday, one week after 25 people, including a pregnant woman whose unborn child was killed, were gunned down in a rampage that has left this tiny rural Texas community numb with grief. Short video from inside #SutherlandSprings church. It's cleaned up. Recorded scripture reading in background pic.twitter.com/4VsmhzbyCv ""We had some amazing people come and pull off a miracle to basically rebuild this sanctuary,"" Associate Pastor Mark Collins said at the broken church's front door. Church officials, who earlier had suggested the nearly 100-year-old building would come down, said no decision has been made on whether to demolish it or to give it new life. Either way, Collins said, services will be held inside the building next Sunday. That sanctuary showed to the public was stripped of any outward sign of violence. Blood-stained carpet was gone and the concrete floor painted white. Pews where worshipers were slain were taken out. The white chairs with the names of the victims painted on them were arranged to show where the fallen had taken their final breaths. More: One week later: Texas church members gather for first Sunday service after mass shooting More: Texas church shooting: Community gathers to mourn at first funerals for victims Donna Tumlinson counts herself among those who believe her church is far more than just a building. “The people of First Baptist are so open and so giving,” said Tumlinson, who with five members of her family came back to Sutherland Springs on Sunday, the day their church would open its doors for the first time since a gunman took 25 lives in a matter of minutes. “They give to their community, they give to people who are hungry,” she added. “They just give.” At a community-wide service nearby earlier in the day, Pastor Frank Pomeroy, whose teenage daughter was among the dead, acknowledged the unusual decision to reopen what he called a place of peace and reflection that had been violated with unspeakable bloodshed. For Pomeroy, erasing the visible signs of destruction demonstrated the resolve that comes with faith. He said he knows that despite the grief, loss, anger and emptiness that scarred the Sutherland Springs landscape in the hours after the attack, evil has not conquered the community he has pastored for 15 years. Holding a Bible inside a giant tent where about 1,000 people of a variety of faiths came to show support, Pomeroy said no doubt has crept into his mind that in the end, human goodness will triumph. ""I know this,"" he said, holding the Bible high with his left hand, ""because I've read to the end of the book.""

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/488627158/0/usatoday-newstopstories~Texas-law-requires-unborn-child-of-shooting-victim-to-be-counted/,"The youngest victim of the mass shooting at a church in Texas wasn’t even born yet. A state law passed in 2003 requires that the fetus Crystal Holcombe was carrying when she was fatally shot Sunday along with other worshippers at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs be counted like the other victims, who authorities say numbered 26 and ranged in age up to 77. Holcombe was four months pregnant. This and other laws that grant full rights to the unborn form some of the newest terrain in U.S. law and are highly controversial. They frequently divide abortion rights and anti-abortion activists, with the first group saying they can be used to criminalize pregnant women while the second group says they are intended to prevent domestic violence and increase penalties for abuse. Texas was among the first states to enact a feticide law in 2003. If Devin Kelley had not died after the shooting, the law would have required he be charged with the murder of Holcombe’s unborn child. At least 38 states have fetal homicide laws, including Nevada, California, Virginia, Florida, Arizona and Colorado, all of which have been the site of mass shootings. In addition to Texas, 22 states have enacted feticide laws that apply to the earliest stages of pregnancy, including conception. More: Churches look to tighten security, even arm congregants, after Texas shooting More: These are the lives we lost in the Texas church shooting More: Gunman shouted 'everybody die,' fired at crying children None of these laws apply to women who have legal abortions. However, opponents of feticide laws say they are more often used to prosecute women whose drug use or other illegal behavior results in the termination of a pregnancy than men who abuse pregnant women. The first feticide laws were triggered by the murder of Laci Peterson by her husband, Scott Peterson, in California in 2002. Like Crystal Holcombe, Laci Peterson was eight months pregnant at the time of her death. Murder, usually related to domestic violence, is a leading cause of death for pregnant women in the U.S., according to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association."

#ThoughtsAndPrayers lit up Twitter again Monday, the latest salvo in the country’s political culture wars as politicians face a growing backlash for using the expression after mass shootings instead of taking action on gun control. Even those outside the Beltway endured the thoughts and prayers wrath. “Gotta be honest,” tweeted LA-based actor Brad Everett Young. “I wasn’t expecting to wake up this morning to read death threats towards me for saying #ThoughtsAndPrayers were w/ #Texas.” Gotta be honest. I wasn't expecting to wake up this morning to read death threat towards me for saying my #ThoughtsAndPrayers were w/ #Texas pic.twitter.com/kRZFwhKxI0 — Brad Everett Young (@BradEYoung) November 6, 2017  House Speaker Paul Ryan opened the floodgates Sunday when he only tweeted half of the phrase: “Reports out of Texas are devastating.The people of Sutherland Springs need our prayers right now.” Reports out of Texas are devastating. The people of Sutherland Springs need our prayers right now. — Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) November 5, 2017  Like many critics, Democratic National Committee black caucus member Khary Penebaker, from Ryan’s home state of Wisconsin, tweeted back: “You are paid a 6-figure salary to take action, not for your #ThoughtsAndPrayers.” You are paid a 6-figure salary to take action, not for your #ThoughtsAndPrayers. Is it still #TooSoon?Go ask the NRA & get back to us https://t.co/X5v5XgXZm6 — Khary Penebaker (@kharyp) November 5, 2017  After a sniper in Las Vegas killed 58 people last month and injured more than 500 others with an arsenal of modified semi-automatic rifles, gun control activists began criticizing politicians for what they saw as hollow platitudes. “It’s becoming code for doing nothing,” said Barbara O’Connor, Sacramento State’s director of the Institute for the Study of Politics and Media, who grew up Catholic in Texas and learned how to shoot a gun when she was 6. “Because you can’t figure out what to do, you’re going to pray — and I think we are beyond that.” The phrase has become so politically charged, it spawned an online video game after the Orlando nightclub shootings last year. “America faces an epidemic of mass shootings,” the game says. “It’s up to you to stop them… with the power of your thoughts and prayers.” But after clicking the start button, no matter how quickly you press T for thoughts and P for prayers — and no matter how often the screen urges you to “think more” or “pray harder,” the number of lives saved stays the same: 0. Is nothing sacred in the moments after a national tragedy? some asked. “As well-intentioned Americans pray for their countrymen who were just gunned down while worshiping God, gun control advocates are bashing them for their expression of faith,” wrote Fox News columnist Jeremy Hunt. The Rev. Dorian Llywelyn, a Jesuit priest and executive director of Santa Clara University’s Ignatian Center, says that in the Jesuit tradition, deeds should trump words. “I certainly sense the frustration because it can be a meaningless cliche when people say ‘thoughts and prayers.’ In a situation like this, action is certainly needed,'” Llywelyn said Monday. “Prayer is not supposed to be a cop out. When we say thoughts and prayers, what we’re actually saying is please help us to know how we should respond to this situation.” In the Central Valley town of Manteca, Pastor Mark Williams of First Missionary Baptist Church, says there’s plenty of hypocrisy in Washington of politicians saying things they don’t mean, including “thoughts and prayers.” But if it comes from a faith-filled Christian like Vice President Mike Pence, for instance, those words have more credibility, he said. Besides, praying is about all you can do, Williams said, after a tragedy like the one at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, where 26 worshipers were killed and another 20 wounded. “When it comes to these mass shootings, nobody’s going to stop it. Legislation is not going to stop it. Nobody’s going to be able to outlaw crime. We’ve tried over the last 200-plus years,” said Williams, 34, a Second Amendment supporter who served in the military. “These situations are going to happen. That’s why you have to trust in God. It is right what happened? No. Is it preventable? I don’t know.” Some Democrats whose efforts to tighten gun laws have failed in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives tried to express both prayers and action. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a San Francisco Democrat,  paid her condolences with prayers, but added something else: “We have a solemn obligation to the victims of Sutherland Springs, Las Vegas, Orlando, Newtown and the many tragic shootings that occur each day to respond not only with prayer and unwavering love, but with action.” With every mass shooting, traffic spikes on the Thoughts and Prayers video game, said co-creator Chris Baker, who works in advertising in New York City. “Just like it went viral after Las Vegas, now we’re seeing a bunch of traffic,” Baker, 34, said Monday. “It’s more of a social commentary than gun commentary. Everyone right now is saying we need to have a conversation about gun control, but ultimately, given the political structure, it wouldn’t get anywhere anyway.” “No matter what you do in the game you can never score higher than 0″ in the number of lives saved. Some 2 million people have played, Baker said, and “the players probably collectively have sent well over 50 million thoughts and prayers.” So, given this latest divide, how is the average person supposed to express grief without getting swept up in the political battle words de jour? We decided to “Ask Amy,” the syndicated columnist. It was her birthday on Monday, and on her Facebook page, she said all she wanted was “common sense gun laws to protect innocent American citizens from senseless tragedies and traumatic violence.” In an email to this news organization Monday, Amy Dickinson said that in this social media age, it’s difficult to know how to properly express yourself. “I don’t think ‘thoughts and prayers’ has become meaningless, but it has definitely become a cliche,” Dickinson said. “Back before social media, you could just share your thoughts and expressions within your circle. But now we are all facing the true fact that there are in fact limited ways to express someone’s trenchant, sincere thoughts. And there is some pressure to weigh in on everything in a quasi-public way, otherwise you could be accused of remaining silent.” That leaves most of us, she said, with “thoughts and prayers, thoughts and prayers.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters"
http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/486778976/0/usatodaycomnation-topstories~Vigil-honors-Sutherland-Springs-church-shooting-victims/,"SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas — People crowded outside the post office across the street from the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs Sunday evening for a prayer vigil for those affected by the shooting Sunday. Led by Stephen Curry of Le Vernia United Methodist Church and Mike Gonzales of Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, people sang and prayed, candles in hand. Gov. Greg Abbott was among those grieving for those lost in what the governor earlier described as the largest mass shooting in state history. At least 26 churchgoers — including several children — were killed and least 10 more were wounded, law enforcement officials said. Among the mourners at the vigil Sunday night was Mackenzie Hanner, 18, who has attended the church all her life. It was her intention to go to church this Sunday as well, but as fate would have it, she overslept. “I was gonna go, but I woke up like &mldr10 minutes after it happened,” she said. “My mom woke me up this morning yelling at me to call people and make sure everyone was OK.” She said the people in the congregation are close. “I see everyone there as my family, so it feels like I lost family,” Hanner said. Debbie Jones, 55, was also at the vigil. Her friend was in the service this morning. She still doesn’t know if  she made it out unharmed. “We’re just devastated,” Jones said. “We’re just waiting.” Some people who were gathered expressed shock that the rampage would happen in such a small Texas town. Others recognized such acts could happen anywhere. Mario Cavazos, 53, who was also at the vigil, thinks he might have seen the shooter as he made his way from a nearby gas station to the church. He described a man garbed in black cross the street from the Valero to the church. He said he didn’t think much of it and went home — about a block away from the church — and soon heard gunshots. “I told my wife, those are not firecrackers because there are like 15 shots, and then they paused and then they did it again,” he said. The killer, pursued by a good Samaritan with a gun, was found fatally shot a short time later in a neighboring Texas county, said a law enforcement official who is not authorized to comment publicly. Authorities did not immediately identify a motive for the attack, and they did not officially identify the gunman. But two law enforcement officials who were not authorized to comment publicly identified the gunman as Devin Kelley, 26, of nearby Comal County, Texas.

Kimmel, the late-night comic, announced the first of three Kmart specials Tuesday night on his ABC talk show. It's one of many integrations that the show has done with various brands. The online-only deals kicked off with a 49-inch Polaroid TV that will be on sale for $350 instead of the usual $550. And Kmart loyalty program members will also get back points worth $200 after they make the purchase.  The show will announce two more specials on Nov. 14 and Nov. 21 that will also offer loyalty points along with a discount. Bluelight Specials became a staple of Kmart stores in their heyday. Starting in 1965, a voice over a store's public-address system would announce a deep discount on an item and shoppers would be directed to the bargain by a flashing blue light, like the one atop police cars.

The tie-in with the popular late night show is a unique way to woo shoppers at a time when retailers are battling for attention and dollars during the months that are the most critical and lucrative for the retail industry.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/11/06/gregg-popovich-on-texas-shooting-talking-about-basketball-is-probably-pretty-inappropriate-after-win/,"This article is more than 1 year old Not long before the Spurs played Phoenix on Sunday, a mass shooting at a church 33 miles from San Antonio left 26 people dead. After the game, Coach Gregg Popovich was in no mood to talk to reporters. The Spurs held a moment of silence for the First Baptist Church victims, one of the deadliest mass shootings in modern American history, and, after a 112-95 victory, Popovich briefly addressed the media, saying it was “inappropriate” to talk about something as frivolous as basketball. “We won a basketball game, but considering what’s going on today, it’s pretty meaningless,” he said. “When you think about the tragedy those families are suffering, it’s just inconceivable and impossible to put your head around. “So I think talking about basketball tonight is probably pretty inappropriate. So you guys have a good night.” The victory was a milestone for Popovich, who moved past Phil Jackson and into sixth place on the all-time wins list with 1,156.

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/490070910/0/usatoday-newstopstories~Florida-school-selling-bulletproof-panels-for-studentsapos-backpacks/,"A private school in Miami, Florida, is offering parents an unusual item: A bulletproof panel for their student's backpack. Florida Christian School's website lists the ballistic panel for $120. The school began offering the panel, designed to turn a backpack into a shield, in the wake of the Sutherland Springs shooting last weekend, the fifth deadliest mass shooting in the nation’s history. The nondenominational K-12 school has never had a shooting incident, but a school security official says they would rather be safe than sorry. ""It’s just a tool,"" George Gulla, head of school security told the Miami Herald. ""I’d rather be prepared for the worst than be stuck after saying 'Wow, I wish we would’ve done that.' ""We thought, yeah, let’s offer it to anyone who wants it. It’s not required. But if it gives you extra peace of mind&mldr"" The slim inserts from Applied Fiber Concepts weigh less than one pound. The company is owned by Alex Cejas, who has two children who attend Florida Christian. ""While books and stuff in your backpack may stop a bullet, they’re not designed to,"" Cejas told the Herald. ""I wouldn’t bet my life on it."" The binder-sized piece of armor can withstand bullets from a .44 Magnum and a .357 SIG, according to the Herald. However, bullets from a rifle would require a heavier piece of armor. When your schools sell bullet proof school bags, it’s probably time to have a think about your gun laws https://t.co/yILf6kW9jT This is not the first bulletproof school product to hit the market. Cejas has been in the industry for 25 years and says the bullet resistant school supply industry spiked after the Columbine shooting in 1999, where two high school teens killed 11 other students. The founder of the popular body armor company Bullet Blocker told Marketplace that sales jumped from 20 backpacks a week to around 10,000 following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, where a gunman killed 20 students and six staff members. The company started developing bulletproof accessories, including briefcases, folders and binders, after the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007 that left 32 people dead. School security expert Kenneth Trump thinks ballistic armor for students is not the answer. ""Focus on fundamentals and get back to the basics,"" Trump told NPR. ""There is a security product for every possible need that your budget will buy. The question is, is that the best use of limited resources?” However, Florida Christian School thinks the option should be available to parents, in addition to other safeguards like sound-enabled surveillance cameras, active shooter drills and uniformed security guards patrolling the campus. Bulletproof inserts are ""out of the norm, but what is the norm?"" Gulla added. Here's how some are responding to the news: Unreal.Kit kids out in 120$ bullet-proof backpack pads at school. Sure!Gun control. No way! https://t.co/udajHZY04C While you're inserting a bulletproof pad into your 5 yr old's Princess/Pokémon backpack...ask yourself if that isn't the least bit messed up https://t.co/hb3ms9yfRS Struggling to decide on the worst bit of this.After some thought, I think it may be ""selling"" https://t.co/fWcSzXnqps "
http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-ott-stars-and-strings-1110-story.html,"As a Murfreesboro, Tenn.-raised teenager with massive musical ambition, Chris Young was willing to play music for whoever would listen. Sometimes that didn’t make for the most ideal performance venues. “I used to play the patio of a Mexican restaurant for four hours for tips,” the country chart-topping singer recalls with a laugh. The silver lining of such brutal gigs? Young could strip his songs down to their essence. After all, it was just the singer and an acoustic guitar. “You can really let the songs stand out there for themselves that way,” he says. Young will soon be able to relive his salad days: He and a lineup of top-tier country artists, including Darius Rucker, Brad Paisley, Lady Antebellum and Kelsea Ballerini, touch down in Chicago for Wednesday’s Stars and Strings, an annual acoustic country music concert that showcases country songs at their most raw, intimate and vulnerable. Now in its third year, the CBS Radio-sponsored event donates a percentage of its proceeds to Folds of Honor, a charitable organization that provides educational support to spouses and children of America’s fallen and wounded soldiers. “I love doing this stuff,” says Rucker, who recently released his fifth country album, “When Was the Last Time.” “You really know what a great song is when you can sit there with a guitar and maybe a mandolin or a fiddle and play it that way and still move people. Then you know you’ve got a great song.” Lady Antebellum, which typically writes its music with only an acoustic guitar and its three members’ vocals, is particularly drawn to the stripped-back format, says band member Dave Haywood. “One of our greatest joys is being able to share stories and interact with the crowd and play more casually,” Haywood says. “To be able to return to that format is honestly such a joy.” Haywood says the trio has “been begging our management to let us do a theater tour for like five years now. Being able to be in a room with no set list, go off-the-cuff is just great.” CBS Radio’s Vice President of Country Programming Tim Roberts says Stars and Strings was principally born out of the country community’s long-held ties with the military. Nashville, he notes, responded in turn: “To be honest we have more artists approaching us than we have room for in one show. We probably could do a week of shows,” he says with a laugh. “There’s so many people that want to get involved.” Many of the artists participating do in fact have direct ties to the military. For Young, whose sister and brother-in-law are both in the Marine Corps, helping raise money for Folds of Honor “is something that’s very close to my heart.” It’s why says he’s long made a point throughout his career of playing for soldiers stationed abroad in countries such as Iraq and South Korea. The event is also a chance for the country music community to unite, something Rucker says has never been more essential. In the wake of the deadliest modern mass shooting in the United States at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas on Oct.1 that killed 58 and left more than 500 injured, “the importance of this show has gone up exponentially,” Rucker notes. “Let’s show the world how strong we are together.” Adds Young, who toured this summer with Jason Aldean and was therefore present in Las Vegas during the shooting, “It’s a very therapeutic thing to get back onstage. Music is something that can heal.” As Rucker notes, simply seeing some of the biggest names in country unite for a good cause is a sign that those who lost their lives in Vegas will never be forgotten. “I can’t wait for that show,” Rucker says of Stars and Strings. “We’re going to be out there playing for all those folks who lost their lives and got injured and playing for the music we all love and the industry we all are a part of.” Haywood says Stars and Strings, for the artists onstage, is also about enjoying playing music as a community. “These environments allow for some spontaneity and collaboration,” he says. “I’m sure at some point in time somebody is going to be running out during someone else’s set to sing a harmony or backing vocals or cut up and do some back and forth. That’s what’s fun. “It’ll feel like a living room backstage,” the Lady Antebellum singer adds, “and hopefully it’ll feel like one onstage as well.” Dan Hyman is a freelance writer. onthetown@chicagotribune.com Twitter @chitribent CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"
http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/493224992/0/usatoday-newstopstories~California-shooter-built-his-own-illegal-guns-officials-say/,"RANCHO TEHAMA RESERVE, Calif. — Two of the guns used in the Tehama County mass shooting on Tuesday were homemade, while the other two were not registered to the shooter, officials said. There was also a restraining order issued issued in February that prohibited the shooter from owning guns. The two homemade AR-15 type semiautomatic rifles were made from parts the shooter, Kevin Janson Neal, purchased, said Phil Johnston, Tehama County’s assistant sheriff. “These firearms were manufactured illegally, we believe, by him at his home,” Johnston said Wednesday. “So they (the guns) were obtained in an illegal manner, not through a legal process. They are not registered.” More: California mass shooting suspect killed wife, hid body day before rampage, officials say Previously: Gunman kills at least 4, wounds 10, in Northern California More: Texas shooter allowed to buy weapons after Air Force failed to flag him In addition to the two rifles sheriff’s deputies found during the shooting investigation, Johnston said the 44-year-old also had two handguns that were not registered to him. Neal went on a shooting rampage Tuesday morning, killing four people and wounding 10 others, including at least two children. No children were killed, even though Neal apparently rammed the gate of Rancho Tehama Elementary School and fired numerous shots at buildings. Neal was killed during a shootout with deputies while he was trying to flee in a stolen vehicle. Sheriff’s officials believe Neal’s wife was killed Monday and her body was stuffed in a hole in the floor of their home. Follow Damon Arthur on Twitter: @damonarthur_RS "

Murphy, a Democrat and vocal advocate for gun control, blasted lawmakers for failing to pass laws that could prevent tragedies like Sunday's Texas rampage. ""It is uniquely and tragically American,"" said Murphy in a statement. ""As long as our nation chooses to flood the county with dangerous weapons and consciously let those weapons fall into the hands of dangerous people, these killings will not abate."" Can you sleep tonight, colleagues, when the price of gun lobby goodwill is this - blood soaked church and school floors, city streets? On Sunday, a gunman opened fire inside a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, killing 26, not including the gunman. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said 12 to 14 of the victims were children, and 20 more people were hospitalized. Texas church shooting: What we know now In his statement, Murphy questioned how lawmakers can claim to respect human life while ""choosing fealty"" to gunmakers over gun control measures favored by constituents. ""The terrifying fact is that no one is safe so long as Congress chooses to do absolutely nothing in the face of this epidemic,"" said Murphy. ""The time is now for Congress to shed its cowardly cover and do something."" Murphy has advocated for gun control since 2012, following the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in his home state that left 20 children and six faculty members dead in Newtown. Last month, Murphy ripped Congress for inaction following the mass shooting in Las Vegas that killed 59.

Palo Alto When our country was founded, life for many was nasty, brutish and short. Women died in childbirth and many children didn’t reach adulthood. Life expectancy was less than 50. Due to the efforts of scientists, money from governments and foundations and countless individuals, our lives are much improved. But, costs have grown and many people have become rich exploiting these health care developments. Health care may have been a limited concern when our Constitution was written, but it now contributes immensely to our lives and our pursuit of happiness. Most of us will need significant health care interventions at some point in our lives. If the Constitution were written today, the Second Amendment would likely read: “A well regulated Health Care System, being necessary to the well-being of a free State, the right of the people to obtain health care, shall not be infringed.” Robert Downs
Saratoga For years, the middle class in California had no problem voting for tax increases on the top 1 percent on their fellow Californian brethren.  Because these same middle class Californians are actually upper middle class when compared to the rest of the nation, the Senate tax proposal to eliminate state and local property tax deductions has them lobbying our Congressmen to fight these eliminations. What happened to “paying their fair share?”  Does not feel so good when the shoe is on the other foot. Peter Lee
San Jose If the Republican tax plan proposed in the Senate becomes law, my family will have to pay higher taxes.  I would pay without complaining too much if our money went to support programs such as improved health care, K-12 education, scientific research, national parks, infrastructure (not border walls),  and many other programs.  I am appalled that our money would go instead to allowing corporations to pay less taxes and giving the ultra rich significant tax cuts. Those cuts would be permanent. The cuts that would help some members of the middle class would be temporary. The final insult is removing the individual mandate: a move that would lead to fewer people having health insurance and to more expensive insurance. As the deficit would rise, our economy would probably falter.  What a terrible plan. Sarah Krajewski
Mountain View  It seems that there is no place in the Mid-Peninsula for RV residents to stay anymore, and this is a sad state of affairs. These are real people trying to do there best. Let’s show some empathy. Instead of officials simply stating “you can’t stay here, move along,” a more humane policy would be to tell the RV residents where they can stay. The Mercury News reports that many are local blue collar workers, and/or have school age children attending local schools, so it seems mean and selfish for the well-to-do to not allow them to simply live. I can think of several locations that could be potential living sites, that would not involve setting up in front of someone’s house or a busy commercial establishment. I understand that there are probably regulations requiring that running water, toilets and other amenities be provided, but let’s get real rather than hiding behind such expectations: these people are just trying to eek out a living. Lighten up on RV residents. Let’s provide guidance and minimal services, rather than rigid enforcement. Joe Urbassik

One Goh, who was sentenced to life in prison for the killings, is a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic whose delusions led him to believe that the administration and staff at Oikos University were conspiring against him, alienating him from his fellow classmates and covertly having him bugged and followed. Goh told police he went to the Oikos campus in East Oakland that day to confront a specific administrator and, if she didn’t refund him the $6,000 he believed he was due, he was going to kill her and himself. When Goh discovered the administrator wasn’t on campus, he kidnapped university receptionist Katleen Ping, 24, at gunpoint and brought her to the classroom occupied by his former teacher and classmates, where he started shooting. Where: Cal State Fullerton When: July 12, 1976 What: Custodian Edward Charles Allaway used a semi-automatic rifle to kill seven people and injure two others in the school library’s first-floor lobby and at the building’s Instructional Media Center (IMC) in the basement. Fleeing to a nearby hotel where his former wife worked, he called police to say: “I went berserk at Cal State Fullerton, and I committed some terrible act. I’d appreciate it if you people would come down and pick me up. I’m unarmed, and I’m giving myself up to you.” Allaway was later diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and found insane by a judge after being convicted by a jury.

The attack played out on several floors before Ferri committed suicide as San Francisco Police closed in. Eight people were killed in the attack, and six others were injured. Where: East Oakland When: Dec. 8, 1986 What: David Esco “Moochie” Welch burst into a home and shot six people, including his 16-year-old ex-girlfriend and two toddlers, in their heads as they slept. Two others, including a 3-month-old boy, were wounded in the shooting. Welch was upset over a breakup with his 16-year-old girlfriend, Dellane Mabrey, when he killed her and five of her relatives and friends, then ran and hid in a house on nearby 103rd Avenue with a female accomplice. … Welch (who was 28 at the time of the shooting) wanted the teen back and bitterly resented the girl’s mother, Barbara Mabrey, 37, because she did not want him near her daughter, according to relatives at the time.

http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/11/15/14-lawsuits-filed-on-behalf-of-vegas-shooting-victims/,"Trending: By Michael Tarm | Associated Press CHICAGO — Legal action following the mass shooting at a Las Vegas concert is picking up with lawsuits filed Wednesday on behalf of 14 concertgoers, including some who were shot or injured trying to escape and one woman who is so traumatized that she has since mistaken the sound of rain for gunshots. The hotel-casino from where Stephen Paddock fired, concert organizers and the makers and sellers of a bump stock gun accessory that enabled him to fire rapidly are named as defendants. The court filings argue that they all share blame for the worst mass shooting in recent U.S. history. Get This Day in History delivered to your inbox for free on weekdays. The 14 civil complaints, filed together in state court in Las Vegas, follow at least three others filed since Paddock opened fire Oct. 1 from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds of others. The lawsuit seeks unspecific compensation for both “physical and mental injuries.” The challenge for mass-shooting lawsuits is clearing a high legal bar to prove someone other than the shooter bears any responsibility. Such litigation typically drags for years and can end with victims and their families receiving little to nothing. One of those suing, Elisha Seng, described in a phone interview haunting images she can’t dispel — of bullets thudding around her on the concert grounds and of turning to see a young woman covered in blood after being shot, clutching her throat and falling forward. “I don’t sleep at night and, when I do, I have nightmares,” said the 46-year-old from Bartlett, Illinois, just outside Chicago. Recently, as heavy rain began to fall outside overnight, she jumped up from her bed. “I thought it was gunshots.” Seng, who wasn’t physically injured, returned to work as a sales representative, but said she quickly tires from her lack of sleep. Going to concert or sports halls can prompt flashbacks. She recently attended a Chicago Blackhawks game and found herself nervously calculating the best escape routes should someone open fire. A Chicago law firm helped to prepare the filings, which include several plaintiffs from the Chicago area. Victims named in the suits also include a California man, Anthony Crisci, who was rushed to a hospital with a gunshot wound in a truck crowded with dead and injured. Among deficiencies at the concert venue were poorly marked exits, Wednesday’s filings say. And the hotel, it says, should have had gunfire-location devices that pinpoint where shots are coming from. The 64-year-old Paddock, who killed himself just before his room was stormed, is also named in a bid to seize assets from his estate. Paddock was able to use VIP status conferred on him as a high-stakes gambler to stockpile more than 20 rifles in his hotel suite, including by using exclusive access to a service elevator over days, the filings sat. They argue what should have been routine checks of Paddock’s bags and his room would have revealed his growing arsenal. The filings name a leading bump stock maker, Texas-based Slide Fire Solutions, as a defendant. A lead attorney, Chicago-based Antonio Romanucci, said it wasn’t yet clear which manufacturer, wholesaler or retailer made and sold the specific bump stock that Paddock used, but that the idea was to hold “the entire supply chain” responsible. Messages seeking comment from Slide Fire weren’t returned. A Wednesday statement from MGM Resorts International, the parent company of Mandalay Bay, called the shooting “a meticulously planned, evil … act,” adding it would respond to any allegations only through “the appropriate legal channels.” Live Nation, a concert organizer named, said in a statement it can’t comment on pending litigation, adding the company remains “heartbroken for the victims.” Bump stocks were originally created ostensibly to make it easier for people with disabilities to shoot. But the filings allege that Slide Fire geared its marketing to regular gun owners who wanted their semi-automatic rifles to mimic fully automatic weapons. Civil cases in mass shootings are becoming increasingly common. Romanucci has also filed a lawsuit on behalf of victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting that killed 49 people last year in Orlando, Florida. It alleges, among other things, that a security firm that once employed gunman Omar Mateen knew Mateen was mentally unstable and had threatened violence, and should have alerted authorities. Mateen was killed in a shootout with police. The 2007 Virginia Tech campus shooting in which Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people illustrated the difficulties posed by such lawsuits. In 2013, the Virginia Supreme Court overturned a jury verdict siding with parents of two victims who claimed the state was negligent. A statement from the state attorney general’s office at the time said the reversal showed what it had argued during years of litigation: “Cho was the lone person responsible for this tragedy.” Cho killed himself after his rampage. Seng said she joined the civil case to force better security at concerts and at hotels. She said she can’t fathom how a hotel-casino that devotes so many resources to catching gamblers that cheat didn’t notice Paddock bringing in high-powered weapons over a number of days. “They can catch a person counting cards,” she said. “But they can’t catch someone carrying bags of guns.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters"

His appearance was unexpected because of the past family troubles, but people who saw him there thought it was a sign he was turning a corner. ""And they thought, 'oh this is good. This is progress,'"" said Tambria Read, a longtime resident of Sutherland Springs who is good friends with Kelley's mother-in-law, the woman Kelley is said to have been targeting on Sunday but was not at church that morning. RELATED: Sutherland Springs shooter allegedly escaped from mental health facility in 2012 The mother-in-law, Michelle Shields told Read she was so excited to see Kelley there voluntarily with her grandchildren. Read said people in the church and the community saw a potential to help Kelley. ""This church is very loving, nonjudgmental and if he had had concerns or issues and spoken with the clergy -- they're nonjudgmental,"" Read said in an interview just two blocks from where Kelley killed 26 and wounded at least another 20 people including children as young as 18 months old. ""They would have helped him deal with his issues and helped him try to get focused."" On the church's Facebook page, more than 40 photos from the event show children in costumes playing games. ""Everything is free!"" a post promoting the event days earlier showed. ""Bring your kids and join us for this fun evening!"" RELATED: Remembering victims of the Sutherland Springs church shooting Read said Danielle Shields, the shooter's wife had worked at the church for years. While there was trouble in the family Read said she's not sure exactly what was going on. ""You keep your family business to yourself,"" Read said. ""She probably told Pastor Frank Pomeroy, she probably discussed that with him."" Police on Monday night confirmed that there was conflict within the family but would not provide further details. Kelley altered the lives of people in Sutherland Springs forever when on Sunday, dressed in tactical gear, the former U.S. Air Force member open fire on unsuspecting worshippers. RELATED: YouTube videos show what a normal Sunday looked like for tragedy-stricken Sutherland Springs church Survivors of the shooting told a San Antonio television station that they played dead and huddled on the ground as Kelley fired. ""Everybody started screaming, yelling,"" Joanne Solis told KSAT-TV. ""Everybody got down, under wherever they could hide."" Kelley had a history of violence, public records show. In 2012 he was court martialed for abusing this then-wife Tessa Kelley and his infant stepson, whom he admitted to beating so hard it fractured the boy's skull.

              since Former President Barack Obama offered condolences after the mass shooting at a Sutherland Springs, Texas, church left at least 26 people dead on Sunday. ""We grieve with all the families in Sutherland Springs harmed by this act of hatred, and we’ll stand with the survivors as they recover,"" Obama tweeted Sunday evening. ""May God also grant all of us the wisdom to ask what concrete steps we can take to reduce the violence and weaponry in our midst,"" he added. Obama's remarks were a departure from those of President Donald Trump, who called the shooting an ""act of evil,"" without delving into any discussion about gun violence in particular, which has increasingly become the focus of some lawmakers in the wake of deadly mass shootings in the US. While in office, Obama frequently used his remarks on mass shootings to ask lawmakers and citizens to reevaluate their positions on gun control. Calls to take a more meaningful look at current gun laws grew loudest after the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history last month, where nearly 60 people were killed at an outdoor music festival in Las Vegas — and before that, at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, where 49 people died in July last year. Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut railed against his congressional colleagues in a fiery statement on Sunday: ""No one is safe so long as Congress chooses to do precisely nothing,"" Murphy said. He continued: ""The paralysis you feel right now – the impotent helplessness that washes over you as news of another mass slaughter scrolls across the television screen – isn’t real,"" Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, said in the statement. ""It's a fiction created and methodically cultivated by the gun lobby, designed to assure that no laws are passed to make America safer, because those laws would cut into their profits."" ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and families of today’s murderous attack in Sutherland Springs, Texas. This horrible act of evil occurred as the victims and their families were in their place of sacred worship. We cannot put into words the pain and grief we all feel, and we cannot begin to imagine the suffering of those who lost the ones they loved. Our hearts are broken. But in dark times such as these, Americans do what we do best: we pull together. We join hands. We lock arms. And through the tears and the sadness, we stand strong. My Administration is providing its full support to the state and local authorities investigating this horrible crime. I have spoken with Governor Abbott, and we offer our thanks to the first responders who ultimately stopped the suspect and rendered immediate and lifesaving aid to the victims of this shooting. I will continue to follow developments closely. All of America is praying to God to help the wounded and the families – we will never leave their side."" For you For you"

        Scaachi Koul Posted on November 28, 2017, at 10:36 a.m. ET Like almost everything Amy Sedaris is involved in, the Greenwich Village studio space where she wrote material for her new truTV show At Home With Amy Sedaris is pleasantly deranged. There’s a side table shaped like a big red mushroom and a “room divider” constructed from green pantyhose hanging from the top of the kitchen window. On the fireplace mantle, which has fake, pink rose bunting draped over it, is a small ashtray filled with knitted cigarette butts. It’s precisely the setting you might expect for a home entertaining show that begins its holiday special episode with Sedaris in an elegant updo and red lipstick — very Suzy Homemaker — and ends with her being attacked by a cursed nutcracker doll named Colonel Nutley. (The nutcracker then goes on to supposedly kill actor Neil Patrick Harris, who is never seen or heard from, in a six-minute scene that ends with Sedaris covered in blood, missing a tooth, and drinking bitterly in her trashed — but still very adorable and twee! — living room.) Amy Sedaris in Strangers with Candy, 2005. When I arrived to interview her in early November, Sedaris was striding around the studio in red stilettos, a polka-dot skirt, and a white sweater covered in pearls. She offered me a homemade stuffed mushroom before settling into one of the two plush, floral armchairs in the living room. “Good vibes over here,” she said, her head propped up on her little fist while an ambulance siren wailed outside her window. In person (and out of costume) Sedaris is all sparkling green eyes, bouncy blond hair, and intense eye contact, hardly the walking overbite she portrayed in Strangers with Candy. But at 56, Sedaris has made a long, successful (though under-the-radar) career out of playing unhinged lunatics. Maybe you’ve seen her as the über-rich, divorced, and desperate Mimi Kanasis in Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, or heard her voice in the animated series BoJack Horseman as the uptight, high-achieving Hollywood agent and anthropomorphic cat Princess Carolyn. She’s appeared as a nightmare apartment broker on Broad City and once did cartwheels in a glittering green onesie on The Colbert Report. Her biggest, weirdest, and, until now, only starring TV role was in Strangers with Candy, a satire of after-school specials that ran on Comedy Central for three seasons (and produced one movie), in which Sedaris played an adult woman who returns to high school after dropping out and becoming a drug addict. The common denominator throughout these disparate roles is Sedaris’s manic energy and her total disregard for reality. At Home With Amy Sedaris, Sedaris's latest project, is an expansion of an oeuvre that mixes discomfort and queasiness with Sedaris’s signature charm and unceasing positivity. The show, which premiered at the end of October on truTV, is a cross between sketch comedy and how-to guide for hosting. Tonally, it’s like if Twin Peaks were on TLC. Each 24-minute episode features three or four segments loosely based around the ideas of hosting, crafting, and cooking. (They also include discussions of death, depression, poverty, and shellfish-based cocktails.) It’s derangement under the guise of wholesome entertainment. A still from At Home With Amy Sedaris. “I like going back to that kind of entertaining rather than trying to talk about prescription drugs or alcoholism or incest. We did that with Strangers,” Sedaris said. “It’s still messed up a little bit, but I wanted that wholesome feel to it. That’s challenging.” It’s also the kind of show that could have only come from Sedaris’s brain, where everything is saturated in candy colors and seemingly unmoored from any particular era or moment in time. This is arguably true of Sedaris as well. She isn’t on Twitter; her studio doesn’t have a phone or a television or a visible laptop; she only recently got a cell phone, or a “cellular,” as she calls it. “I was best man at Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux’s wedding,” she said. (Theroux, who makes an appearance in one episode of At Home, is a close friend.) “I went to LA and I had to get Uber because I don’t drive, and I was forced to get a phone. I don’t even know my number. Even when the phone rings, I panic.” In a world where politics has now fully dominated the social discourse, and in which so many celebrities have been consistently and personally disappointing, Sedaris’s work offers a surrealist reprieve from all things “topical” and plunges the viewer into a world where, delightfully and briefly, nothing really matters. It’s the kind of comedy that isn’t guided by pop culture or current events. Instead, she creates a space that’s highly detailed and specific, where everything is about organized chaos. If you want to disengage from the world right now, a visit to her universe might be just what you need. Sedaris and brother David Sedaris at his apartment in 1997. Amy Sedaris grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina, the fourth of six children: Lisa, David, Gretchen, Amy, Tiffany, and Paul. In interviews, Sedaris seldom opens up about her upbringing or personal life, opting to share minor and often bizarre blips of information instead, such as the fact that her outfits are made by her friend and seamstress Mary Adams, who has nine and a half fingers. Or she veers into fiction, mentioning how upset she is that her imaginary boyfriend Ricky was murdered on their way to the hospital for “a cyst on one of his obliques.” Her online presence is limited to an Instagram account largely populated by retro ads, reposts from other people, and decor suggestions. As a result, most of what we know about Sedaris as a person is from her brother, the writer David Sedaris, author of Me Talk Pretty One Day and Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim. Energetic, goofy, endearing Amy shows up in almost all of his childhood stories. In a 1998 episode of This American Life, David recounted how Amy wore a fat suit home as a response to her father’s insistence that his daughters be thin. “She is by far the most attractive member of my family, yet she spent most of her life admiring skin diseases and praying for a hump,” David remembered. “‘It’s not fair that I can’t grow a beard,’ she’ll say, gluing a pebble-sized wart to the size of her nose … She can’t see any benefit to being herself.” She and David were frequent collaborators, first as children when they played together (Amy told me they hosted a fake cooking show called The Rex and Germalina Show), and later in the ‘90s when they published plays together under the moniker the Talent Family. Those included Stitches, about a disfigured teen who becomes a television star, and Incident at Cobbler’s Knob, about witches and warlocks and a gay beaver. “He’s the best,” Amy said of her brother. “No one works as hard as he does.” David now lives in London, while Amy has been in New York since 1993. Before she came to New York, Sedaris joined Chicago’s Second City in 1992, alongside Paul Dinello (who would later work with her on Strangers and At Home), Stephen Colbert (a Strangers costar), and Chris Farley. “We both went to the training center at Second City. I went to go see her show, and even though it was 12 people, it was essentially a one-woman show,” Dinello told me. “She was just a force in that show. Her character work was already so mature. I couldn’t believe it.” In 1999, she got her big break in Strangers with Candy. The Comedy Central show was developed by Dinello, Colbert, and Mitch Rouse, also a friend of Sedaris’s from Second City. It was inspired by the 1970 documentary short The Trip Back, about a former drug addict and sex worker who tries to warn a group of high school students away from the life she led. Sedaris plays Jerri Blank, a woman who dropped out of school and ran away from home to become “a boozer, a user, and a loser.” After she gets out of prison, she decides to clean up her act and return to the exact place where she left her previous life: high school. Every episode was A Very Special one, but no lessons were ever really learned. Nothing about the show anchored it in the existing universe; no one dressed in a way that indicated what decade it was; no action was ever really followed by consequences. Every episode ended with dancing. Sedaris described the creative process of making Strangers as comfortably isolated. “Nobody was around. We were in the woods making each other laugh,” she told me. In 2015, she told Esquire, “The funny thing is Comedy Central never really got behind it, but that’s what made the show work.” (Never exactly a ratings hit, the show was canceled in 2000.) “You really had to look hard to find it, you know? People felt like they discovered it and I think that’s important. That’s what makes it such a cult show.” Sedaris with Stephen Colbert (left) and Paul Dinello (right) on Strangers with Candy. The same may be true of Sedaris herself. She is a low-profile but influential figure in comedy, an inspiration for writers and actors like Julie Klausner and Billy Eichner who has always been on the periphery of mainstream success. Strangers was canceled in 2000, but in 2005, Dinello, Colbert, and Sedaris wrote and starred in a prequel film, produced in part by Worldwide Pants, David Letterman’s production company. (Sedaris was a beloved guest on Letterman’s Late Night, often appearing with nothing to promote.) The show had always featured some famous guest stars (Winona Ryder, Paul Rudd, Janeane Garofalo), but the movie — with cameos from people like Sarah Jessica Parker, Matthew Broderick, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Allison Janney — marked a noticeable shift in access to high-profile collaborators. It was the first clear evidence of Sedaris’s industry cache: What other weirdo character actor could get Chris Pratt to spend $3,000 in travel and accommodations just for the chance to play her love interest? On Sedaris’s birthday last year, Sarah Jessica Parker posted nine Instagram photos celebrating her existence. Strangers solidified Sedaris as a voice for unrooted absurdist comedy that doesn’t require context or known pop culture references to work. She is frequently compared to Maria Bamford, whose Netflix show Lady Dynamite is a fictionalized, surreal rendering of Bamford’s return to LA after a mental health breakdown. But the key difference between the two women and their work is that while Bamford takes direct inspiration from her own life, Sedaris is always looking to hide or morph herself into someone else. Even when she’s technically playing herself as Your Host, Amy, it’s still not really about her. Talking to her in her studio, she’s more present and slightly more serious; on TV, she’s talking about how the best gifts are edible and then biting into a vanilla candle as if it’s a carrot. At Home With Amy Sedaris At Home has been a decade in the making, a project Sedaris always wanted to work on. It was inspired by a childhood favorite TV series: At Home With Peggy Mann. “Growing up in North Carolina, this woman here had a local hospitality show,” Sedaris told me, holding a framed photo of Mann in her studio. “She would do cooking and crafting, and she would have local people on to talk about their businesses. It was very boring and I was obsessed with Peggy Mann. I liked the idea of pretending you had a show happening in your home.” She shrugs slightly, saying of her Peggy Mann approach to television, “It’s probably not for everybody. But it’s kind of mindless, isn't it? All the inspiration from it, from growing up, from Galloping Gourmet and Frugal Gourmet and Lawrence Welk and Ernie Kovacs and Julia Child and Two Fat Ladies and Mister Rogers. All of that is what this show is.” You might assume that At Home is just a comedy series masquerading as a show about home decor or cooking; after all, it includes advice on how to hide that you’ve sliced off the tips of your fingers by covering them with empty peanut shells. (Cheap!) But Sedaris insists that it’s more than satire. “All those crafts I do, I’m really trying to do those crafts,” she said. “I’m in the moment and I’m sincere.” Dinello confirmed that Sedaris takes an interest in real-life entertaining. “She’s a really good cook and she’s good at putting interesting people together,” he said. But, almost predictably, there’s a hidden catch. “It’s not a free ticket. A lot of times you’re asked to do something like fix a shelf or get her DVR working or paint a wall.” When we met, Sedaris told me she had someone coming over for dinner that night, actually; she needed some light bulbs changed. Even with all this inspiration, however, Sedaris couldn’t get the show off the ground. Dinello has been working with Sedaris for decades — they’ve been talking about At Home for 15 years at least. Every time they got close to selling the show, Sedaris would pull back. She ended up going to a therapist to get help with two things she was struggling with: First, the 2013 death of her sister Tiffany, and second, why she was stalling on the show. (She also went to a woman who talks to the dead to get closure on her sister’s death. “I think I was so vulnerable and so open to the information that next day, I got shingles,” she said. “First thing I thought was, Ugh, get me a shingles commercial.”) It was only in the last few years that Sedaris felt ready to move forward with the project. “It wasn’t entirely clear what [the show] was at that time, but it was clear that it was a passion project for her — she and Paul had a strong point of view of what they wanted to do,” said Marissa Ronca, executive vice president and head of programming at truTV. The network, which is owned by Turner Broadcasting, originally launched as Court TV and specialized in documentaries and legal drama series. Later, it was revamped to focus on reality television, and two years ago pivoted again — to comedy. (A promotional spot from last year features an actor getting crushed to death by the truTV logo.) Sedaris and Paul Dinello in 2005. Ronca says At Home fits in with what the network is trying to do with its comedy slate at large: Provide a platform for creator-driven shows that only a specific writer or actor could pull off, like Billy on the Street or The Chris Gethard Show, which are both very much shaped by the personalities and sensibilities of their creators. It’s clear that no one other than Sedaris (and Dinello) could create something like At Home, which was developed as an offshoot of Sedaris’s very specific and visually stimulating world. Sedaris said visual details are so crucial to her in part because of a former neighbor of hers in Chicago who was deaf. “My whole life changed because the way she saw things was so interesting,” she said. “I used to go home and watch Strangers with Candy with the volume down to see if a deaf person could still laugh at this show.” The set is based off Sedaris's real Manhattan apartment. “I was obsessed with it,” she said of designing the set. “Fringe and tassel and rickrack.” According to truTV, the show has been a success. Since its Oct. 23 premiere, its audience has grown 52% among people aged 18 to 49. Nearly a quarter of those are new viewers to the network. “There’s a lot of people out there doing really timely political comedy right now that I love and I appreciate,” Ronca said. But, she added, “Sometimes at night, you just want to be wildly entertained and watch something that’s clever and funny and isn’t screaming back at you from the TV. What [Sedaris] offers comedically is an oasis from all the other madness going on in the world.” Sedaris and Paul Giamatti in At Home With Amy Sedaris. At Home is apolitical, but not in a way that feels willfully ignorant or withholding — see Jimmy Fallon playfully neglecting to talk to Donald Trump about his racist comments, or Taylor Swift refusing to make a clear statement of who exactly she voted for last year. Instead, the show lets viewers temporarily live in a completely different dimension. “She’s not shepherded by popular culture,” Dinello said. “You’ll seldom see a cell phone or computer on our shows, or specific references to modern or to current events.” But even though At Home transpires mainly within an alternate universe, there are occasional moments that resonate here on Planet Earth. In the first episode of the show, Paul Giamatti plays an important businessman who sexually harasses Sedaris over the course of a nautically themed dinner party. “That was written and shot long before the Weinstein scandal broke, and I had concerns about it and even thought about maybe cutting it,” Dinello said. “I didn’t want us to come across as flip. Amy’s [character] is usually in control, which sort of protects us.” When At Home does descend into the truly dark and disturbing, Sedaris somehow makes it okay to laugh, by cheerfully persevering through uncomfortable scenarios. In “Gift Giving,” Randy Fingerling (Nick Kroll, in an awful long wig and black turtleneck) comes over to help Sedaris bake a cake. While she tries to fill an angel food bundt cake with ice cream, Kroll lights candles, plays romantic music, sits directly behind her (Sedaris reminds Kroll, and us, “I do have a knife,” her eyes flicking back up to the camera), and fingers the cake while moaning. The segment ends when he mutters, “I’m gonna fucking come.” The segment is uncomfortable, a commentary on how unsafe it can feel to be a woman, but it doesn’t feel heavy or anxiety-laden the way a lot of satire often can be. Sedaris is so at ease, so ready to laugh instead of cry, and so happy living in an alternate reality. It’s infectious, this darkness cloaked in cooking segments and crafting suggestions, and a successful integration of a real-world problem into a segment about how to improve an angel food cake. Sedaris and Nick Kroll in At Home With Amy Sedaris. “It’s funny to create a show during this time,” Sedaris said. “So many bad things were happening, and we’re over here trying to write something funny.” Being funny right now (in this economy?!) is hard to pull off: Play too ignorant and you end up seeming glib and unfeeling; play too world-weary and you might come off as a huge drag. Sedaris is one of the few performers who can strike the right balance. Her entire public persona has been rooted in ignoring the whims of the world in a way that feels comforting, rather than condescending and privileged. I watched the first episode of At Home the afternoon the first New York Times story about the Harvey Weinstein sexual assault allegations broke. This was a few days after the mass shooting in Las Vegas, which was two weeks after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, which came on the heels of the hurricanes in Texas and Florida, which happened around one of the times that President Trump raised the possibility of nuclear war with North Korea. In a segment called “Crafting Corner,” Sedaris told viewers she was going to make “Potato Ships,” a baked potato with a wooden skewer mast, a cheese slice sail, a construction paper flag, and a mushroom cap as a crow’s nest. She assembled them with fake fingernails taped to her fingers, slathering glue on the stick to adhere the flag and trying to poke the cheese gently enough so it wouldn’t rip. The end result was a crushed potato slathered in sour cream and pierced with a sail made from a crumpled cheese slice, a flap of pink construction paper, and a wet mushroom cap. Covered in glue, it was wholly inedible and didn’t remotely resemble the Potato Ship she had shown at the top of the segment. And on that day, it was also maybe the only thing that helped me stop — just for a few, blissfully confused moments — thinking about the state of the world. ● Scaachi Koul is a senior culture writer for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York.

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/486686044/0/news-opinion~Flashback-mdash-Massacre-at-Anytown-USA-Column/,"(This is a slightly updated version of a column orginally published in October 2015.) ANYTOWN, USA – A heavily armed, mentally disturbed young man opened fire yesterday at a school/church/theater/shopping mall, killing ___ people and critically wounding ___. The gunman also died, although it was unclear whether he shot himself or was slain by police responding to the scene. The Anytown massacre, the latest in a string of mass shootings across the nation, stunned the normally bucolic community. “I can’t believe something like this could happen here,” said Anytown Mayor _____ ______. As the sun set over the town, residents gathered to sing Amazing Grace at a candlelight vigil. Witnesses said they heard pop-pop-pop sounds that they initially mistook for firecrackers/balloons/a backfiring vehicle. Then they heard screams from inside the building. “We were lucky to get out alive,” said ____ ____, 18. POLICING THE USA Policing the USA Acquaintances described the gunman as a loner who showed signs of depression/felt like a ""nobody""/had trouble relating to women/spent many hours playing violent video games. Although he was prone to vicious outbursts, the acquaintances said they didn’t think he’d really do anything, so they didn’t bother to alert authorities. Authorities said they were trying to verify the authenticity of threatening rants the gunman posted on social media sites against blacks/whites/Christians/Muslims/Jews/people. On Capitol Hill, Democrats again called on Congress to pass “commonsense” gun control measures, such as universal background checks and a ban on assault-style weapons. It was questionable, however, whether any of those measures would have prevented the Anytown shooter from obtaining the guns used in the massacre. A spokesman for the NRA said the focus belongs on mental health and, out of respect for the victims, it’s too soon to talk about gun control measures. The spokesman noted that the massacre occurred in a supposedly “gun-free” zone and said that if only more people in the school/church/theater/shopping mall had been armed, the gunman could have been stopped sooner. USA TODAY Dear Roseburg, Shooting doesn't define you. Love, Newtown: Column Although more than half of the 12 deadliest shootings in U.S. history have occurred since 2007, and the United States leads the world in gun-related homicides, congressional leaders signaled they had no intention of bringing up gun legislation before next year’s election. “If we didn’t do it after Sandy Hook, why would we do it now?” one Republican insider said. Back in Anytown, plans were being made to bury the victims, who ranged in age from __ to __,  and hold memorial services. The rest of the nation turned its attention to a full slate of weekend football games. Bill Sternberg is editor of the editorial page."

https://www.thedailybeast.com/john-oliver-reveals-how-trump-creates-his-own-reality,"SEARCH The ‘Last Week Tonight’ host returned after a two-month hiatus to rail against President Trump’s reliance on the alt-right site Breitbart and the conspiracy-theory outlet Infowars. Senior Entertainment Editor Donald Trump, the 45th president of these United States, has a tenuous relationship with the truth. Politifact, the Pulitzer Prize-winning fact-checking site, calculated that Trump tells the truth approximately 4 percent of the time, while 17 percent of his statements constitute egregious lies. Critics of Trump have labeled his modus operandi “gaslighting”—a form of psychological warfare wherein you manipulate a person into questioning their own sanity. The term comes from the 1944 film Gaslight, starring screen siren Ingrid Bergman as a wife whose husband (Charles Boyer) convinces her that she’s lost her faculties in order to obscure his true motive: Stealing the jewels of her late aunt, whom he murdered years earlier. In Trump’s case, he has a troubling tendency to launch attacks at targets that are actually veiled criticisms of himself. It’s a genius strategy, really: a preemptive strike that not only removes the card from his opponent’s deck, but also accuses them of the very thing that he is guilty of. A few examples: After a photo emerged of Hillary Clinton being escorted up some steps, Trump spent weeks on the campaign trail taking shots at the Democrat’s perceived health woes, even though he himself is said to suffer from bathmophobia, or a crippling fear of steps and slopes. His childish nicknames for his political foes—“Little” Marco Rubio, “Lyin’” Ted Cruz,’ “Crooked” Hillary”—are words that have been used to describe Trump for decades, while his narrative of a corrupt Clinton Foundation more closely resembled his own. Even his continued assault on CNN, which President Trump has labeled “fake news,” appears remarkably disingenuous when you consider that CNN chief Jeff Zucker and Trump are longtime friends (Zucker hired him for The Apprentice, and he reportedly keeps a framed Trump tweet in his office), and the cable news network played a substantial role in helping Trump get elected POTUS—from round-the-clock coverage of his rallies, at times airing just an empty podium, to its army of pro-Trump campaign propagandists, including: Kellyanne Conway, Scottie Nell Hughes, Kayleigh McEnany, Jeffrey Lord, and Corey Lewandowski, who remained on Trump’s payroll for the lion’s share of his CNN tenure. Furthermore, nobody is more reliant on “fake news” than President Trump. On Sunday, John Oliver returned to his perch as the shouty host of HBO’s Last Week Tonight following a two-month hiatus, where he focused much of his attention on four questions pertaining to President Trump: “How did we get a pathological liar in the White House? Where are his lies coming from? Why do so many people believe him? And what can we possibly do about it?” Trump is, of course, widely known to regurgitate talking points that he hears on the right-wing morning-show programs, from Morning Joe to Fox & Friends. For instance, two weeks ago he tweeted: “Ungrateful TRAITOR Chelsea Manning, who should never have been released from prison, is now calling President Obama a weak leader. Terrible!” Manning, however, never called Obama a “weak leader,” and Trump’s tweet was sent a mere 15 minutes after Fox News aired a critical segment on Manning, calling her an “ungrateful traitor.” More troubling, though, is the president’s dependence on Breitbart, which former honcho Steve Bannon once called “a platform for the alt-right,” and former Breitbart writer Ben Shapiro labeled “Trump’s personal Pravda,” as well as Infowars, a site run by the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. “He also takes information in from frighteningly unreliable sources such as Breitbart, the organization which gave us Steve Bannon—now Trump’s chief strategist,” said Oliver. “Bretibart has published such Pulitzer-eligible stories as ‘Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy,’ ‘Racist, Pro-Nazi Roots of Planned Parenthood Revealed,’ and ‘Hoist It High and Proud: The Confederate Flag Proclaims a Glorious Heritage.’ You know, the kind of headlines you see your old high-school friends share on Facebook and think, Oh, that’s a shame! I guess Greg sucks now.”“But Trump’s trust in Breitbart actually goes way back,” the satirist continued. “A few years ago, Trump was challenged by Bill O’Reilly, who correctly pointed out that [Trump’s] claim that ‘thousands of Muslims’ were seen celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11 was based on no evidence whatsoever.” Trump, as is his wont, responded to Fox News’s O’Reilly by holding up a printout of a terribly misleading and unsubstantiated Breitbart story that appeared to validate his claims, saying, “Well, I don’t know that I’m wrong, Bill. This just came out from Breitbart—I mean, literally, it just came out: ‘Trump 100% Vindicated.’” This prompted O’Reilly to fire back, “Believe me: If there were thousands, that would have been reported.” “This article says they were swarming all over the place!” exclaimed Trump, waving the piece of paper around. “So, I don’t know what that means, but it means a lot of people!” Oliver was incredulous. “Wait: Holding up a Breitbart article does not make you seem more credible,” he said, before picking up a banana, holding it to his ear, and joking that the “sources” on the other end of the imaginary banana phone line were about as credible as a Breitbart story. Then there’s Infowars, which also attempted to back up Trump’s bogus claim that “thousands of Muslims” were celebrating in New Jersey on after the 9/11 attacks—while providing zero supporting evidence. Infowars’ unhinged host, Alex Jones, has claimed that 9/11 and the Oklahoma City bombing were inside jobs, the Boston Marathon bombing was a “false flag” operation, and that the U.S. government has the ability to control the weather, and are poisoning the water to “turn the friggin’ frogs gay.” One of Jones’s most disgustingly offensive claims is that the Newtown mass shooting, which left 20 young children and six adults dead at the Sandy Hook Elementary School, was “a synthetic, completely fake” and “manufactured” massacre “with actors.” Jones has not only boasted about advising Trump, but even confessed, “It is surreal to talk about issues here on air and then word for word hear Trump say it two days later.” For example, back in September, Jones claimed to have been the guiding force behind candidate Trump’s baseless claims that the election would be “rigged” against him. Trump also appeared on Infowars during the campaign, telling Jones, “Your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down, and you’ll be very, very impressed—I hope.” Mark Barden, a Sandy Hook father who lost his 7-year-old son, Daniel, in the shooting, told me some months back that he was sickened by Trump’s affiliation with Jones. “The Republican presidential nominee of the United States is being advised by a delusional sociopath. It speaks for itself,” Barden said, adding, “What else can you say about that? It’s disgusting.” Oliver pointed out how problematic this call-and-repeat with dubious news sites is: “This is really dangerous, though, because there is a pattern here: Trump sees something that jibes with his worldview, doesn’t check it, half-remembers it, and then passes it on, at which point it takes on a life of its own and appears to validate itself.” Jones’s constant claim of election “rigging” prior to the general later mutated into unsubstantiated allegations that “millions” of people voted illegally against Trump in the election, causing him to lose the popular vote to Hillary Clinton—a claim voiced by Trump, and parroted by Trump’s senior policy adviser Stephen Miller on Sunday’ news talk shows. “Trump’s constant claim that ‘millions of people voted illegally’ originated, as far as anyone can tell, from some dude on Twitter who claimed in November—while providing no evidence: ‘We have verified more than three million votes cast by non-citizens,’” said Oliver. “The next day, Infowars picked that up and it spread like jet fuel among right-wing sites. Now, it was quickly debunked by multiple outlets, but despite that, days later, President-elect Trump started tweeting about ‘millions’ of illegal votes, and ‘serious voter fraud’ in places like California. And by early December, people were on TV expressing similar concerns.” The comedian threw to a CNN clip of correspondent Alisyn Camerota interviewing a panel of Trump supporters. “Voting is a privilege in this country, and you need to be legal, not illegal like in California where three million illegals voted,” said Paula Johnson, a Trump supporter. “Where are you getting your information?” asked Camerota. “From the media!” Johnson replied. Cue Oliver, who broke it down as follows: “If you get your news from similar sources to [Trump], as many, many people do, he doesn’t look like a crank—he looks like the first president to ever tell you the ‘real’ truth. But rumors can be really tenacious, and I’ll prove it,” he said. “What rumor do you think of when you hear the name Richard Gere?” asked Oliver, referring to the infamous (fake) rumor that Gere had to have a gerbil removed from his rectum. “Well, here’s the thing: There is no proof that he did that. If you think about it, it’s ridiculous. Have you ever held one of those things? There’s no way it was possible,” he continued. “But, if the president went on TV and told you it was true, you’d go, ‘I knew it! Thank you! I knew it! Finally someone said it!’ But that loop gets much more dangerous when you’re not talking about something as silly as gerbils. Trump validated his supporters’ beliefs about voter fraud, and in turn, they validated his.” He closed the segment with a call to action: “We all need to commit to defending the reality of facts, but it’s going to take work.” That includes making sure stories are properly sourced, questioning stories that merely validate your own worldview, not taking the White House at its word, and, last but not least, avoiding sketchy sites like Breitbart and Infowars."

Officials said the massacre is not being investigated as a terrorist attack. Many children were among those killed, including an 18-month old and the pastor's 14-year-old daughter. The shooting spree might have been even more deadly if not for a local resident who grabbed his rifle and exchanged fire with the gunman.

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/487502516/0/usatoday-newstopstories~Texas-church-shooting-underscores-security-concerns-for-houses-of-worship/,"MEMPHIS — Sunday's shooting at a Texas church underscored the need for security and vigilance even in houses or worship, a task that congregations across the nation have been taking seriously already. A gunman identified by Texas authorities as Devin Kelley, 26, entered the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas, a rural area outside San Antonio, during Sunday morning services and opened fire. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said at least 26 people, not including the gunman, were killed. Police found Kelley dead in his car following a pursuit. Though such actions are impossible to guard against fully, churches and other houses of worship have become more alert to threats and have responded accordingly in the wake of incidents on their own property. In Tennessee, where the Texas shooting resonated strongly in the wake of the Burnette Chapel Church of Christ shooting in Antioch near Nashville less than two months ago, law enforcement Monday was offering security assessments for churches. More: Evangelist Billy Graham's doing fine at 99, family says More: Mass shootings and trauma: In a world that no longer feels safe, how do we cope? The Wilson County Sheriff's Department said in a statement it would provide a one- to two-hour check, depending on the size of the church. If requested, the check will be followed up with a written assessment of recommendations to help secure the facility and maintain order in an emergency situation. ""In light of the tragedies that have taken place in many churches across the country, we want to take proactive steps to ensure a safe place of worship for every church in Wilson County,"" Sheriff Robert Bryan said in a written statement Monday. Such efforts seem the best hope for countering the long history of violence in the pews. The Center for Homicide Research found 137 shootings in Christian churches between 1980 and 2005. Among those are the June 2015 killings at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C.; a 2012 shooting at a Sikh temple near Milwaukee and civil rights-era church violence such as the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham, Ala., in 1963. Even at the national level, the Trump administration is vowing in the wake of the Sunday attack to step up efforts to train churches and other houses of worship on security procedures and active-shooter situations. Sunday's shooting appears to have stemmed from a domestic dispute. Jamie Johnson, the director of the Department of Homeland Security's Faith Based and Neighborhood Partnerships office, told Time.com Sunday that the his team has worked with religious groups to improve security. He added that more action is planned. Many churches have already been proactive in bolstering security. Brown Missionary Baptist Church in Southaven, Miss., a Memphis suburb, has an emergency response team that helps monitor activities at the 10,000-member church, about half of whom regularly attend services. The team was instrumental last year in helping local police apprehend a man who church personnel had spotted in the parking lot. His motives were unclear, but firearms and explosives were found in his car. Brown Pastor Bartholomew Orr said the church's extensive security team includes members who are armed. Security measures at Brown and all other Mississippi churches got added support from the Church Protection Act signed into law by Gov. Phil Bryant last year. The law allows places of worship to designate members to receive firearms training in order to provide security. Under the law, those individuals who have received training can carry guns in church buildings under legal protection from the state. In addition, the Mississippi law allows people to carry holstered weapons without a permit. A spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association said at the time the law was signed last year that Mississippi was the ninth state to have such a law. Reports in Texas are that a resident living near the church grabbed a gun of his ownand engaged the shooter as he drove away. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said the state's concealed carry laws increased the chances that someone would be able to ""take out"" a gunman. Bellevue Baptist Church in Memphis had a scare of its own last year when a security guard there stopped a 31-year-old man as he attempted to enter the church during Sunday services. He was carrying a .40-caliber Beretta in his pants pocket and .300 Blackout assault rifle in a backpack. Memphis police said at the time that the man, identified as Marcus Donald, told them he had to be vigilant against threats in society. He was taken into custody as an ""emergency commitment"" and evaluated. Due to privacy laws, no additional information was released. John Tucker, pastor of the small Graceview Presbyterian Church in Southaven said after last year's incident at Brown Baptist that churches not already taking security seriously would soon be doing so. ""Not all churches have taken security seriously, which is a big problem,"" Tucker said. ""It's something all churches are going to have to look at, although not every issue will be deadly force. Still, we have people who are upset, and church is the place they go to cure their soul. So we should expect situations to arise.""

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/488539996/0/usatoday-lifetopstories~CMA-Awards-Brad-Paisley-Carrie-Underwood-say-itaposs-important-to-laugh-in/,"For the 10th year in a row, Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood will take center stage at Nashville’s Bridgestone Arena to co-host Wednesday’s CMA Awards. The country stars already know how they’re going to celebrate. “We’re planning matching tattoos to commemorate our 10-year anniversary,” Underwood says. “Yeah, we both got them,” Paisley adds. “Carrie has two or three more tattoos than I do at this point.” They’re joking, of course – and if you’ve watched them host the CMAs over the last decade, you probably already knew that. Newbies: Jon Pardi, Kane Brown share CMA Awards debut excitement Crossing over: CMA Awards: Pink, Niall Horan are going country with performances As co-hosts, Underwood and Paisley deliver the show’s opening monologue. And while that segment is fueled by irreverent humor, it’s also the closest thing country music has to a “State of the Union” address. For 10 minutes on primetime television, the outside world peers in on the foreign land of Music Row. In the past, it has also been the rare moment when the country music industry comments on current events. In 2011, after Hank Williams, Jr. was booted from Monday Night Football for remarks made about then-President Barack Obama, he popped up to sing with Underwood and Paisley. Aftermath: Still reeling from Las Vegas shooting, country music gathers in Nashville to heal More: Jason Isbell: the outspoken, unlikely CMA Awards nominee Controversy: CMA apologizes, lifts restrictions on media questions at CMA Awards Last year – one week before Election Day – the duo spoofed the presidential debates, with Paisley following Underwood around the stage and calling her ""Crooked Carrie.” In other years, they’ve touched on everything from Obamacare to Gangnam Style. But 2017 has provided the co-hosts with a true challenge. On top of a divisive political climate, the last few months have seen a series of devastating storms and natural disasters. Then, on October 1, a country music festival became the site of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. “This isn’t the easiest year to do comedy,” Paisley says. “But it’s also in some ways the most important (year). Because there’s two ways you could go about this show, and I prefer the one that’s uplifting, and takes us and says ‘It’s more important than ever that we play country music. It’s more important than ever that we laugh, and that we love one another and come together.’” Won't back down: Jason Aldean, Chris Stapleton, Keith Urban close CMT special with Las Vegas tribute More: In wake of Las Vegas shooting, country music DJ Bobby Bones urges fans to keep going to concerts As usual, the duo aims to keep the details of their CMA opening a secret, but they think they’ve struck the right balance. “There was a lot to sift through, but we can find enough humorous things that everyone can laugh at,” Underwood says. “But we have some serious moments in the show as well.” It's safe to assume those serious moments will include a tribute to the victims of the Las Vegas shootings. CMA chief executive Sarah Trahern told USA TODAY NETWORK-Tennessee that this year's show will remain upbeat, but will also include ""several poignant and memorable moments for us to reflect on the past year.” “Even though a month has passed, the shock of the tragedy in Vegas is still top of mind in our community,"" Trahern said. ""What many of our colleagues and fans experienced will long be remembered together as we try to understand and heal.” Underwood and Paisley say they spend three months officially planning the show, but ideas hit them year round. “Shoot, I got a text from Carrie in May one year that said ‘Tim (McGraw) and Faith (Hill) have Barbies!’” Paisley recalls. Months later, in the 2011 monologue, the two unwrapped the dolls onstage – with the real McGraw and Hill laughing in the audience. “From now until (showtime), I don’t think there will be an hour in the day that we’re not kind of thinking, ‘Hmmm, I wonder if that could be something we talk about,’"" Paisley says. ""Our radar is out.” “We love being the faces of the CMAs, but it’s also a great responsibility,” Underwood says. “We’re just so proud of country music, and want the world to see what we’ve got.” The 51st annual CMA Awards will air live on ABC at 7 p.m. CT Wednesday, November 8.

ABC “senior investigative correspondent” Brian Ross greeted Gen. Michael Flynn’s plea deal with Robert Mueller by claiming Flynn is “prepared to testify that President Trump, as a candidate, Donald Trump, ordered him — directed him to make contact with the Russians which contradicts all that Donald Trump has said to this point.” It was a nuclear explosion. Within minutes the stock market plunged 350 points. It quickly became clear that it was flat wrong. Later, ABC News added on the evening news what they disingenuously called a “clarification” – actually, Trump directed Flynn to contact the Russians after the election, which not only isn’t scandalous, it’s completely expected for a new president. After more uproar, they finally found it to be a “serious error” and suspended Ross for four weeks without pay. It’s a classic journalistic mistake to try and be first to report something before it’s verified. But in the Trump era, when liberals believe the president is a uniquely dangerous threat to America – even the world -- any news that could lead to speculation about Trump’s impeachment or resignation is like catnip. Journalists are prone to over-hype anything that could spell “The End.” This suspension might be an adequate punishment….if Ross hasn’t made a long line of whopper mistakes. Conservatives remember the movie-theater mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado in 2012 and how Ross came on in “breaking news” mode to announce there was a “Jim Holmes” on a list of Colorado Tea Party Patriots…as if that was a perfect starting point to find mass shooters. It wasn’t. But there are more. -- In 2001, Ross claimed the anthrax used in deadly attacks after 9/11 in Washington and New York was coated with bentonite, a chemical compound found only in biological weapons made by Saddam Hussein’s henchmen in Iraq. Former Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer remembers “I explicitly told ABC News not to go with the anthrax story because it was wrong. Brian Ross went with it anyway -- and one week later issued a murky, hard to understand correction.” -- In the first month of the Iraq War in 2003, Ross reported Saddam’s cousin Ali Hassan Al Majid (or “Chemical Ali”) had been killed. Several media outlets forwarded that report. Six months later, U.S. officials announced they had him in custody. -- In 2006, Ross claimed Pakistani officials had arrested Matiur Rehman, an al-Qaeda explosives expert who kept an “official” list of terrorist recruits, and could lead to Osama bin Laden. Pakistanis denounced the report as ‘fictitious.” ABC consultant Alexis Debat had warned ABC it was not true a day after the report had initially been broadcast. -- Also in 2006, Ross breathlessly relayed that then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert was under FBI investigation for bribery in the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal. “Justice Department officials describe the 64-year-old Illinois Republican as very much in the mix of the corruption investigation.” This prompted the Justice Department to deny there was any federal probe of Hastert, who demanded a retraction and threatened to sue ABC. None of these whoppers ever led to any suspension of Ross, who’s been at ABC since 1994. His liberal colleagues have given him six Peabody Awards and six George Polk investigative reporting awards, so his reputation inside the network was apparently unscathed by his large errors. It’s a little bizarre these days that sexual harassers like Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer are dumped abruptly, while Brian Williams has an hour-long nightly show on MSNBC and Brian Ross gets a slap on the wrist. These supposed guardians against “fake news” look like fact-mangling isn’t really a serious offense. Brian Ross should be fired.

Facebook’s fight against fake news hasn’t seen much success, according to journalists that fact-check stories on the platform, per the Guardian. The news comes despite the platform’s recent increased measures to fight the spread of false information, which include leaning on third-party human fact-checkers and flagging debunked stories with a “disputed” tag. A recent example of the company’s missteps with fake news is an article that incorrectly stated the suspect of a mass shooting was connected to anti-fascist groups. The article was shared 260,000 times on Facebook, despite being flagged as false by fact-checkers. Facebook has also refused to share information on the results of its effort to fight fake news. A fact-checking source inquired about how often Facebook employed its “disputed” tag on stories shared to Facebook, but the company did not provide the information. Here are two reasons why a struggling Facebook effort to fight fake news is troublesome for the company and publishers: That said, Facebook does have the capability to make fake news less visible. Once an article is tagged as false, its future impressions drop by 80%, according to Facebook, per The Guardian. Nonetheless, stories posted on the platform have the potential to be shared by Facebook’s over 2 billion monthly users, likely making the identification (and de-prioritization in Facebook’s News Feed algorithm) process of fake stories an arduous task. Trust is timely. In an era in which fake news is trending, and brands are pulling advertising from large publishers because they don’t want their messaging associated with offensive content, trust is a critical factor that brands consider when re-evaluating digital ad strategies.

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/487568316/0/usatodaycomnation-topstories~Texas-church-shooting-members-of-one-family-killed/,"Eight of the 26 people killed in Sunday’s mass shooting came from a family as close to one another as they were to the church. Associate pastor Bryan Holcombe and his wife Karla; their son, Marc Daniel Holcombe; daughter-in-law Crystal Holcombe; and several grandchildren were killed in the gunfire during the service at Sutherland Springs First Baptist Church, about 30 miles outside San Antonio. The Tyler Morning Telegraph was first to report the family lost eight members in the horrific attack. John Holcombe, husband of Crystal Holcombe, survived the gunfire. The couple had recently married, said Julius Kepper, who lives about two blocks from the church. More: Texas church shooting witness: 'There were so many rounds' More: Mass shootings and trauma: In a world that no longer feels safe, how do we cope? More: Texas shooting: How to help victims of Sutherland Springs Crystal, a widow with five children, ""was starting her life all over again,” he told The Associated Press. “That’s a crying shame.” John Holcombe suffered shrapnel wounds and Crystal’s youngest child, Evelyn Hill, was grazed by bullets, but both were discharged from the hospital on Monday, Crystal’s aunt, Michele Hill, told the AP. Crystal’s eldest child, Phillip Hill, had stayed home from church that day, Hill said. She added that Crystal was pregnant, due in early April. “They had actually just found out. They didn’t think it was possible so this was just a miracle baby,” Hill said. Three of Crystal Holcombe’s children — Emily, Megan and Greg Hill — were slain. Marc Daniel ""Danny"" Holcombe’s 1-year-old baby daughter Noah was killed but his wife survived, said Holly Maddox Elliott, niece of Bryan and Karla Holcombe. Three cousins, who got to the church service late, were unharmed, Elliott said — they arrived just as the gunman was fleeing. The family was tight-knit, said Elliott, who is from Tyler but now lives in Flint, Texas. Her aunt and uncle, Bryan and Karla Holcombe, “had hearts full of love for everybody,” she said. The couple, parents to four children, had been married for more than 40 years, she said. Her uncle played the ukulele. Her aunt worked with the church youth. “They didn’t judge anyone,” she said. “They had hearts of gold. They helped anybody and everybody they could.” Crystal Holcombe’s Facebook profile painted a picture of a woman devoted to her family, describing her husband in a post several weeks ago as “the love of my life.” “Excited to celebrate another birthday with you in my world!” wrote Holcombe.

http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-las-vegas-survivor-dies-hit-and-run-20171126-story.html,"Roy McClure had been gone for days. Calls to his phone had gone to voice mail, his wife wrote in a Thursday Facebook post asking people to let her know if anyone had seen her husband. Denise McClure learned on the same day that Roy was killed in a hit-and-run crash days earlier, on Nov. 17, seven weeks after he survived the Oct. 1 Las Vegas massacre. Roy McClure was in Pahrump in southern Nevada, about 60 miles west of Las Vegas, the day he was killed. He had a fight with a friend and took off about 2 a.m. and was not heard from since, Denise McClure wrote on Facebook. The crash occurred at Homestead Road and Highway 160 in Pahrump, NBC affiliate KSNV reported. A spokesman for the Nevada Highway Patrol did not immediately respond to a call and email from The Washington Post, but the agency told local media that McClure was walking illegally on the highway when the crash occurred. Roy McClure left behind not only his wife, but also two sisters, Denise McClure said. The Washington Post was not able to immediately reach McClure on Sunday, but she told KSNV that her husband had been attending therapy sessions since the Route 91 Harvest festival massacre. On that day in October, a gunman on the 32nd floor hotel suite of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino rained down bullets on thousands of concertgoers. The shooter, Stephen Paddock, was found later found dead inside the suite. Nearly 60 people were killed and hundreds were injured. The massacre is the deadliest mass shooting in the country's recent history. Denise McClure said she and her husband were at the concert. As they were escaping from bullets, Roy McClure stopped along the way to help people, she told KSNV. ""Those who knew him know he had his battles but also knew he had a big heart. He was a survivor of the Route 91 shooting, instead of running away he went back in. He helped transport people to the hospital. Roy also loved helping people and would literally give the shirt off his back,"" Denise McClure wrote on Facebook. Criminal charges are pending against the driver, KSNV reported. It's unclear why the driver fled or whether alcohol was involved. ""This isn't what I wanted for him,"" Denise McClure told the TV station. ""I don't understand why he wasn't taken at the shooting, but a month later he was taken this way. I hope my husband found peace and he's safe now."" A month before Roy McClure's death, a California couple who also survived the Las Vegas shooting died outside their Southern California home in Murrieta. Dennis and Lorraine Carver were killed in a fiery crash just before 11 p.m. on Oct. 16. Dennis Carver was trying to round a curve when the 2010 Mercedes-Benz sedan he was driving veered off the roadway and into a grassy area, said Officer William Strom, a traffic officer for the California Highway Patrol. The car crashed into a metal intercom speaker. Its back struck a brick column that was part of a fence; the impact ripped the car's rear axle and ruptured the gas tank, Strom said. The car struck another brick column, rolled onto its side and caught fire. Strom said the couple died immediately. Police do not suspect foul play. The couple, who lived part-time in Henderson, Nevada, just outside Las Vegas, left behind two daughters, ages 20 and 16. CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"

I picked you up as a Facebook friend as thoughtlessly as I might have picked up a computer virus, probably from some Facebook alumni page, or one of those “Find Your Classmates” websites I usually avoid like the plague. I knew your name, of course. I heard it often in my first year at the all-male boarding school we both attended at different points in our lives. It was spoken with awe and respect in connection with your toughness, your athleticism, your stoicism, the perfect way you embodied the school’s Spartan ethos. You probably know that were a bit of a legend in your own way. You don’t know me at all. As far as I can tell, we’ve never exchanged a personal message, or an email, or even a note. Even writing this, I can barely recall your face. It’s interchangeable in my mind with that of any number of red-faced, well-fed, well-tended, well-off middle-aged, middle-class white men. As I said, you don’t know me at all. If you did you’d know that, before going to bed, I check Facebook, Twitter, and the news—a bad recipe for sleep, I know, but being a news junkie is an occupational hazard for an ex-journalist. In the pre-dawn hours of June 12, 2016, I read the news that there had been a shooting in a gay bar in Orlando. In the hours that followed, the horror began to reveal itself. The body count wouldn’t be revealed until later, but as the night went endlessly on I followed every bulletin, every mention on Twitter. I reached out to west coast journalist friends who were the ones awake at that hour. The British media, eight hours ahead of us, were on the story while the majority of American networks all seemed to be fast asleep. In between updates, Twitter trolls played with the tragedy like it was a game of cat and mouse. An L.A. comedian sent out fake news stories claiming he was the killer. Teenagers tweeted pictures of other teenagers, claiming that the police were looking to question them in connection with the murders. One member of the truly lunatic fringe of gun nuts even tweeted: They’re faggots and they don’t like guns. The guns were in hands of real men not a gay bar. Just before dawn, the Orlando police tweeted that they had killed the murderer of what was then thought to be up to 20 people. I fell asleep at 6:00 a.m. and I slept fitfully till 3:00 p.m. the following afternoon. Like almost every queer person I know, I spent that Sunday glued to various screens—my laptop, the television, my iPhone. Facebook became like my living room, with good people I know, both in real life and online, weighing in, offering support, sharing their anger, grieving together. The wake may have been virtual but the grieving was in real time. That’s when a message from you suddenly flashed up on my public page. It was angry, scathing, filled with contempt. You told me there were “other things in life besides [LGBTQ issues]” and that you were “dumping” me, which I understood to be the late-middle-aged iteration of Facebook “unfriending” You told me Trump would “sort it all out” when he won the presidency in November, and that you were sick of my “rants.” Those may have been the first words you ever addressed to me. My retort was predictable, swift and blistering. And then you wrote Fuck you fag on my Facebook page. In the stunned nanosecond that followed, you accomplished what you set out to accomplish, my friend. I congratulate you on your achievement. With three words, you stripped me of my humanity. You actually stopped time. You made me fifteen years old. You made it the afternoon when, after literally a month of non-stop bullying and violence, two older boys dragged me out behind the furthest building from the dining hall and beat me up for being someone too delicate, too dewy, too queer for their liking; someone entirely alone in a new place, someone different, someone terrified, and someone who wouldn’t—or couldn’t—fight back. In that second, I heard the brutal, ice-cold voice of the one who repeatedly slapped me across the mouth, hissing Faggot! Faggot! with every blow. I heard it as clearly as if it had come from my computer. Forty years later, almost to the day, my third novel, October, partially inspired by that encounter, would be published. The book would be, among other things, a very welcome exorcism of a deeply malignant spirit. But in 1977 I was just a scared kid with a bloodied mouth in an alien landscape a long way from home. They left me there behind that outbuilding, weeping, bleeding and struggling for breath from one last punch in the solar plexus, knowing full well that I wouldn’t tell the teachers, because that wasn’t done, as I had already learned. This was a school designed to produce “complete men”—presumably the kind of “complete man” you now are. But that nanosecond passed, as they do. I’d like to think you deleted your words because you regretted of them, or because of the excoriation you received from my friends, but it’s just as likely you were afraid I’d immediately screen-cap them, and someone you knew would see them, and see the ugly, aging bigot behind the congenial online mask of geniality. Either way, it didn’t matter. I blocked you, and I hope I never see or hear from you again. You see I’m not fifteen years old now. I’m an adult. I’m a man. I’m an accomplished writer who has been married to a brilliant, handsome, loving man for thirty-three years. I have a wide, varied, and sophisticated group of friends. I have family, chosen and otherwise, who love me passionately and whom I love. I have been an out gay man since I was nineteen, and I am no stranger to activism. Still, forgiving you was surprisingly easy. Eighteen months from that terrible night, I’ve made peace with the fact that there must surely be something irreparably broken in the soul of an adult man who would write Fuck you fag on a queer person’s Facebook wall less than twenty-four hours after a savage anti-gay hate crime that coincidentally was also the worst mass-shooting massacre in U.S. history at that time. I can’t imagine what it would take to so casually throw that particular fistful of salt on an open wound, especially that night, when the airwaves and Internet were full of death, tears, horror, weeping mothers begging for news of their children or sharing the texts their sons sent them in the moments before they were shot in the head by a monster. The young men and women murdered by Omar Mateen could have been my friends and I, back in the 80s, dancing as though we were immortal, and as though Sunday morning would never come. Today, they could be my sons and daughters. I feel sorry for you, to be honest. In spite of all your successes and your possessions, and your memories of your glory days as a schoolboy, something is clearly missing. I hope you find it, because God knows neither of us is getting any younger. Forgiving the idea of you is harder, but I think I’m almost there. You see you gave me a number of gifts without intending to. In the banality of your cruelty you gave me something ghastly against which to compare my friends—women and men, old and young, including those complete men, with no quotations required, who don’t need to be members of marginalized groups themselves in order to stand up for what’s right, or denounce what’s wrong, or offer comfort, or protection. You reminded how, in the same way that the sight of two men kissing will drive some other men to murder, the sight and sound of our lamenting the murders of our brothers and sisters will be an irritant to some others— something to be slapped down as a disruptive interruption to their peace and quiet—indeed to their ordered view of the world itself. It’s a reality that queer people share with women, and with racial, ethnic, and religious minorities. Until this happened, I’d only understood the erasure that is #AllLiveMatter intellectually and morally. I understand it viscerally now. You reminded me that in spite of all our successes, however many books we’ve written, or movies we’ve made, or friends we have, or how long we’ve been married, or how many children we’re in the lives of, or how many “out” celebrities we can claim, or how many politicians are now in our court, or however freely our younger generation can blithely dispense with a lot to the things we had to go through (which is good), on some level, to some people, we’re still just faggots and dykes, and trannies to be shot dead in the street for daring to not be like them. That’s not self-pity, that’s just the weight of facts. It all feels horribly old, and horribly familiar. And other people will always continue to try to explain us to ourselves, and explain our lives to us, and make it about them when it suits them, and make it all our fault when it doesn’t. Most of all, my friend, you confirmed something for me. You confirmed the reason for the dailyness of activism. As life-changing, unforgettable, and dreadful as the Orlando massacre was, as long as Fuck you fag can ever be an nominally civilized straight man’s response to any queer person’s grief, there’s so, so much work to be done. Don’t worry, though. We’re on it. For that, I thank you. I forgive you. And, fuck you too. Novelist, award-winning journalist and essayist"
http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/487851866/0/usatodaycomnation-topstories~Car-worth-more-than-burns-on-US-Highway-known-as-aposThe-Dragonapos/,"KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — A sports car valued at more than $100,000 burned Sunday afternoon on a notorious stretch of U.S. Highway 129 aptly known as ""The Dragon."" The car fire was reported at 4:45 p.m. at mile marker 7 in Blount County, Tenn. Firefighters arrived 36 minutes later to find the car in the road, engulfed in flames, said  Blount County Fire Department Captain Kermit Easterling. Easterling identified the car as a 2017 Nissan GT-R, which has a sticker price of $109,900. The man identified as the owner, Sharif Abdelbaset, wrote in a Facebook post that the car was a ""Nismo"" — a performance-tuned version of the GT-R that costs about $65,000 more. ""This wasn't a wreck,"" Abdelbaset wrote just before 7 p.m. Sunday. ""We think it was an accumulation of leaves that started the fire up in the mountain. Thankfully nobody was injured and nothing important was lost."" In an earlier post on Sunday, Abdelbaset wrote that he was headed to TougeFest, described in a Facebook event page as an annual weekend event ""filled with comradery and spirited driving"" at the Fontana Village Resort in North Carolina. Abdelbaset's Facebook profile says he is the president of Forged Performance, based in Marietta, Ga. The company's website says it is ""one of the leading GT-R and late model import automobile specialty shops in the USA."" Abdelbaset didn't return a request for comment Monday. Easterling confirmed no one was injured and said authorities had ""no indication"" as to how the fire started. He said bystanders managed to stop the flames from spreading into the woods.

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/492779834/0/usatoday-newstopstories~things-you-need-to-know-Wednesday/,"Funeral services will be held Wednesday for eight family members killed in the mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Among the 25 victims of the Nov. 5 attack were associate pastor Bryan Holcombe and his wife, Karla; their son Marc Daniel Holcombe and his 1-year-old daughter, Noah; their pregnant daughter-in-law, Crystal Holcombe; and three grandchildren, Emily Hill, Greg Hill and Megan Hill. Crystal Holcombe's husband, John Holcombe, and two of her children survived. In a Facebook post, the Franklin Funeral Home also listed ""Carlin Brite Holcomb"" — the name John Holcombe and the surviving family members chose for Crystal's unborn child. Half of Puerto Rico's power grid will be back up Wednesday, a consequential milestone for the U.S. territory decimated by back-to-back Hurricanes Irma and Maria roughly two months ago. While it could be months before power is completely restored to the island, lawmakers are pushing to rebuild a grid better capable of handling extreme weather. Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló told senators the island wants to increase dependence on renewable sources and develop a system of microgrids. Other vital systems are slowly returning to the island, too, Rosselló said. Water systems are now 90% back, telecommunication systems are 75% restored, and roads, supermarkets and hospitals are all re-opening. Zimbabwe's military detained President Robert Mugabe and his wife Wednesday, although the army denied reports of a coup after taking over the state broadcaster.Mugabe, 93, one of the longest ruling leaders in the world, came to power in 1980 during the country's war of liberation against white-run former British colony Rhodesia. Last week, he sacked Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa, a former defense minister with strong ties to the military, replacing him with Mugabe's wife Grace, 52. Leonardo da Vinci's Salvator Mundi, his haunting, 500-year-old portrait of Jesus Christ, can be yours Wednesday — but bring your checkbook. The painting, said to be the only one of da Vinci's 20 known works in private hands, is expected to fetch well over $100 million when it goes up for auction at Christie's in New York. Da Vinci's Mona Lisa might be more famous, but Mundi boasts a greater radiance, having been recently cleaned. ""This is the holy grail of Old Master paintings, some people call it the male Mona Lisa,"" says Christie's expert Francois de Poortere. SpaceX is taking to the skies yet again on Wednesday night. Elon Musk's rocket company is planning to take a mystery payload for the U.S. government into orbit.While not the first government mission, details on what exactly is being launched remain a mystery. Aerospace and defense company Northrop Grumman, which is working with the government, revealed only that the mission was for the ""U.S. government.""

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/487453442/0/usatodaycommoney-topstories~Google-shared-conspiracy-theories-that-sought-to-tie-Texas-shooter-to-antifa-movement/,"Minutes after officials identified the shooter in Sunday's Texas church massacre, conspiracy theorists began spreading misinformation online that tied the man to the left-wing movement known as antifa. Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube helped make those claims real, despite law enforcement officials making no connection between Devin Kelley and the loosely organized antifa movement that sprung into the national spotlight at protests in the past year. On Sunday, within 30 minutes of Kelley's identification by the Associated Press as the suspect in the shooting at a Texas Baptist church that left 26 dead, posts had cropped up on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Google, naming Kelley variously as a member of a pro-Bernie Sanders group, as a supporter of Hillary Clinton, as a recent convert to Islam, and as a radical Alt-left supporter with possible antifa ties. That rapid surfacing of information with little grounding beyond speculation and assumption has again thrown into question whether Google, Twitter and Facebook do enough to flag false information when it surfaces in the chaotic aftermath of a disaster — as it did in the wake of the Las Vegas mass shooting. If you Googled Kelley's full name, results of tweets that linked Kelley with antifa showed up on Google's search page as ""Popular on Twitter"" results, directly below its top stories. A day later, those tweets had stopped surfacing. But typing Devin Patrick Kelley into the Google search engine, the third ""Instant Search"" result was still ""Devin Patrick Kelley antifa."" A similar search on Google's YouTube, after legitimate news sources like CBS and CNN, presented an entry from Patriotic Beast, with a video called ""Devin Patrick Kelley Antifa Confirmed, Proof."" More: What is antifa and what does the movement want? Just last month YouTube said it had changed its search algorithm to promote videos from more mainstream news outlets in search results after people looking for details on the Las Vegas shooting were served up conspiracy theories and misinformation. Google said in a statement to USA TODAY Monday that the Twitter results ""are changing second by second and represent a dynamic conversation that is going on in near real-time"" and noted that they appear after news sources, including Top Stories. ""We’ll continue to look at ways to improve how we rank tweets that appear in Search,"" Google said in a statement. In a statement, YouTube said it was investing in changes to YouTube search that provide authoritative results when people use YouTube to search for news. Several far right standard-bearers made the link between antifa and the shooter in the hours after the shooting in posts that were widely shared. Mike Cernovich, conservative blogger and author of Gorilla Mindset, Sunday night tweeted that photos of the suspect were ""consistent with profile of antifa member. This is looking more and more like antifa terror."" It was retweeted 1,565 times. Photos of Texas shooter is consistent with profile of Antifa member. This is looking more and more like Antifa terror. https://t.co/6pJcbCWZBo Alex Jones, founder of InfoWars.com and a proponent of many conspiracy theories including the government's involvement in the Oklahoma city bombing and the 9/11 terror attacks, posted several tweets Sunday about the incident. In one he posed the question, “Was this part of Antifa revolution against Christian and conservatives or a Isis op?” Was this part of the Antifa revolution against Christians and conservatives or a Isis op? Live from the church.. https://t.co/rcSU9Z8eeW pic.twitter.com/o2FSezFqCa Later Jones tweeted: ""Antifa follower Devin Kelley identified as Texas church shooter! Dressed in all black... left now celebrating!"" (2,700 retweets) and subsequently, ""Antifa killer attacks Texas church killing 26 fulfilling the groups dream for violent revolutionary action!"" Several tweets mentioned Kelley's Facebook page, which allegedly showed multiple posts tying him to antifa. But Antifa United posted on its own page late Sunday that the posts were fake. Facebook said in a statement to USA TODAY that it was increasing its investment in its strategy to ""combat misinformation. ... We've also created tools to help people trust what they're reading, such as making it easier for people to report misleading stories and providing additional information about an article, including information about the publisher and the types of stories published. ” Jonathon Morgan, a former digital advisor to the Obama-era State Department, and outspoken critic of social media’s presentation of news, said in a tweet that Google fails to serve its customers when it recommends conspiracy theorists as legitimate info sources in the aftermath of a tragedy. He believes the companies are taking the situation “more seriously” today than 6 months ago, but “they’re not really owning up to the problem. It runs much deeper than they’re willing to admit.” He tweeted a screenshot showing Google search results for Devin Patrick Kelley, which directed users to the Twitter feed of Info Wars editor Paul Watson. Google directs users to the Twitter feed of InfoWars editor Paul Watson in search results for Devin Patrick Kelley. pic.twitter.com/AwQ5MasJMr Texas Department of Public Safety official Freeman Martin on Monday said Kelley's motivation did not seem motivated by religion or investigated as terrorism, but instead stemmed from a domestic dispute. Justin Hendrix, the executive director of the NYC Media Lab, and a critic of the Trump administration, said he saw Morgan's tweet how Google was directing those searching “Devin Patrick Kelley” to InfoWars. He went to Google himself and found several other various examples of misinformation surfacing in the ""Popular on Twitter,"" including that Kelley was a Muslim convert. “In what situations is it better to have no information than some information?"" he told USA TODAY. ""In the traditional news media that is something we have always believed that sometimes it’s better not to provide information that it is to provide wrong information.

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/488067206/0/usatodaycomnation-topstories~Red-Cross-floundered-in-Hurricane-Harvey-relief-effort-Texas-leaders-residents-say/,"For the American Red Cross, Hurricane Harvey presented a perfect chance at redemption. A fast and efficient response would have shown critics the organization has learned from its past mistakes and is a capable partner when disaster strikes. But instead, say many Texas officials and residents, the Red Cross floundered and failed to provide needed help. Weeks after the storm, state and local officials, including Gov. Greg Abbott, complain of a charity disorganized and slow-to-respond. The Red Cross’ leader in the region hardest hit has resigned, complaining of a constant struggle to juggle the wants of the national office versus the needs of hurricane survivors. And many of those survivors have a long list of complaints. The post-Harvey rancor has left the group synonymous with volunteerism and selflessness again on its heels, forced to reconcile negative reports on the ground with its reputation as the go-to during America’s worst moments. Aubrey Dominguez returned to find his Rockport home completely gone, but was denied Red Cross assistance. ""They are good at driving around giving out hot meals,"" he said. ""Other than that, that's about it."" One Texas lawmaker who represents a section of rain-pummeled Houston, where thousands of people lost their homes and belongings to Harvey's floods, said he's had enough with the missteps and confusion. “I just won’t give the Red Cross any more money,” said state Rep. Garnet Coleman, a Democrat who has served 26 years in the Texas House. ""I'll find other ways to help people in need."" In recent years, the Red Cross’ reputation has taken repeated hits, spearheaded by reporting from NPR and ProPublica that highlighted lapses in how the organization spends its money and directs its resources. Then, a Congressional inquiry found the organization was using about a quarter of the money directed to the 2010 Haiti earthquake for other expenses. It also faces dwindling revenues, a smaller workforce and fewer volunteers than it did just a few years ago. Read more: Charting Hurricane Harvey's jaw-dropping size and destruction Read more: The cost of Harvey recovery will be staggering, lawmakers learn This round of criticism comes as the organization juggles a number of major disasters, from the hurricane trio of Harvey, Irma and Maria, to California wildfires and the mass shooting in Las Vegas. As for Harvey, the Red Cross described its response as “massive,” one that fulfilled its mission considering the historic nature of the storm, which dropped more than 50 inches of rain. “In a disaster, you don’t get everything perfect every time,” said spokeswoman Elizabeth Penniman, “but the incredible number of people we sheltered and meals we served and comfort and care we provided prove we fulfilled our mission, and some of the criticism does not take into account the size and scale of our response.” Bob Ottenhoff, the CEO and president of the Center for Disaster Philanthropy, said the Harvey response proved to be a huge challenge for relief organizations, but called it overall ""pretty good."" Still, it’s not over. ""The challenge confronting us now and the thing that often proves to be very frustrating to homeowners and business owners, is the fact that the recovery period is so complicated and so long,"" he said. ""There's a tremendous amount of work before us that is going to be very difficult."" Category 4 Harvey punished the small coastal town of Port Aransas, where 130-mph winds pushed boats into parking lots, destroyed buildings and sawed through trailer parks. While some local officials were pleased with the Red Cross response, others argue more could have been done on the ground. Consider Port Aransas Mayor Charles Bujan part of the latter group. “I don’t want them ever to come back here,” he said. “They’re supposed to help the people. They didn’t do that.” Much of his criticism centers on the Red Cross’ dispersal of funds and the fact that he said it took a couple weeks into the recovery process “before they even set up shop.” As a first step in recovery plans, the Red Cross offered $400 funding payments meant to address immediate needs, like clothing and food, for disaster survivors. Some applications were thought to be mistakenly rejected due to technological issues. Penniman said the initial demand ""challenged our IT infrastructure,"" leading to a temporary suspension in service. Gov. Abbott said he had “several conversations” with Red Cross President Gail McGovern about reports that the charity was fumbling the ball as Texans suffered. “I did express concern that the money that was donated to go to Harvey relief was not getting into the hands of the people who needed it — and about some of the slowness with regards to the funds,” Abbott said last week.  “I heard multiple concerns raised by people at local levels that they were not receiving the aid that they seemed to be expecting from Red Cross."" He said the charity was a doing ""good job"" at some shelters in San Antonio, Austin and Houston, but other problems were evident. “I know there was a lot of money, as in hundreds of millions of dollars of money that was available for Texans that seemed not to be getting to Texans in neither a timely fashion nor in a well-organized, well-directed fashion,” Abbott said. Cyndi Lee, who has lived in Aransas Pass for about 25 years, evacuated during the storm to a shelter in Austin that the Red Cross was helping to operate. While she saw no problems there and was “thankful for what they did in the moment,” getting her $400 was ""a little chaotic.” Nueces County Judge Loyd Neal and Mike Koerner, Aransas County's long-term recovery manager, were pleased with the work. Aransas Pass Mayor Ramiro Gomez was happy the Red Cross delivered hot meals, but lamented: “I wish we would have gotten more.” Penniman said the charity is working with Texas officials to ensure it is fulfilling its obligations to the state. In the Red Cross' monthly newsletter, McGovern said she was gratified to see the charity's volunteers ""doing everything in their power"" to help Harvey survivors. ""I’m proud of the work we’re doing to help individuals and families impacted by this catastrophic storm — and our efforts are far from over,"" McGovern wrote. ""I am profoundly grateful to the dedicated volunteers, donors and community partners who empower our vital mission.” The Red Cross' focus during a disaster is on shelter, food and emergency relief supplies, among other duties. Its 270 chapters provide the immediate response while operating off a “clear framework” which provides chapters the flexibility to meet local needs while “maintaining consistent services to support our mission,” Penniman said. When a situation requires a national-level response, such as in Harvey, oversight shifts to Red Cross headquarters in Washington, D.C. David Brady, the ex-CEO of the Red Cross’ Texas Gulf Coast region, which serves places like Houston, Galveston and Corpus Christi, found such an arrangement to be a struggle. After he resigned, he spilled his feelings on Facebook. “My challenge was a daily struggle to do what is best and serve the national organization that pays my salary and doing what is best and serving my fellow Texans and this community I love so much,” the Facebook post said, according to KHOU-TV in Houston. “I found myself in disagreement too often with decisions that were being made as it related to Hurricane Harvey recovery.” In confirming Brady’s resignation, Penniman said, “we are grateful for his contributions to the Texas Gulf Coast region over the past several months.” In recent years, the Red Cross has watched its resources shrink. From 2008 to 2016, tax records show the organization saw a 41% percent dip in employees, and revenue fell by nearly $700 million to about $2.6 billion as volunteers more than halved from about 662,000 to 314,000. That goes against the current trend, Ottenhoff said. Relief organizations are seeing more and more volunteers. Donations nowadays are more directed to local relief organizations rather than large ones, said Charity Navigator spokeswoman Sara Nason. The website, which evaluates charities and facilitates donations during disasters, directed about $3.1 million in the 17 days after Harvey to organizations supporting the relief effort. The majority went to small organizations in Texas. ""A lot of individuals we saw were looking to donate specifically to local organizations because they saw the value of this long-term commitment to the area,"" she said. Penniman seemed to dismiss any notion that the lower numbers have affected the charity’s response. The Red Cross operates in 90% of America’s counties, she said, and has grown more efficient and effective through technology. Roughly 9,500 Red Cross disaster workers assisted with Harvey — 110 are still there — and the organization raised $429 million, more than was raised during Hurricane Sandy. Its financial assistance program has provided $400 payments to 573,000 people, equal to $229 million. That leaves about $200 million in the coffers. An estimated budget of its Harvey expenses at the end of September showed 91% of the funds will go to programs and expenses. “We have spent more money on more people in a shorter time period than any disaster response since Hurricane Katrina,” Penniman said. Ottenhoff said government and nonprofits are better organized and more sophisticated at disaster response than they were 10 or 20 years ago, partly because of lessons learned after Hurricanes Andrew and Katrina. The Red Cross, Penniman said, is a “learning organization” that’s always looking to improve. In the meantime, frustration remains. “They have such a bad reputation in this community that it would be better for them not to come back,” said Bujan, the Port Aransas mayor. Port Aransas resident Julie Gall, after being denied once, was approved for her $400 in late September. Over a month later, she still hasn't received the money and hasn't heard back from the Red Cross, despite sending multiple emails asking for updates. ""It was empty promises,"" she said.

A collection of hand guns on display at the NOVA Armory, a gun shop in Arlington, Virginia. Rex Features/AP A new Quinniapac University opinion poll shows that support for universal background checks has reached an all-time high. The study, released Wednesday, found that 95 percent of American voters favor uniform background checks for gun purchases, including 94 percent of those who live in households with guns, marking the highest levels of support since the university started asking the question in 2013. The poll was conducted from November 7 to 13, just a few days after the Sutherland church massacre in Texas and a little more than a month after the mass shooting in Las Vegas, in which the shooter used a “bump stock” modification that enabled his semi-automatic rifles to fire as if they were fully automatic machine guns. “With each American gun massacre, there is stronger voter support for tighter gun control measures,” Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said in a statement Wednesday. The poll also found broad support for other gun control measures. Ninety-one percent of voters support banning the sale of guns to people who have been convicted of a violent crime, 62 percent favor stricter regulation of ammunition sales, and 74 percent support banning modifications that can make semi-automatic firearms function more like a fully automatic weapon. On the whole, 59 percent of voters say that it is currently too easy to buy a gun in the United States. “You rarely if ever see near-unanimity like this,” Larry Sabato, the director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, wrote on Twitter. “Broad support for other gun reforms too.

              since At least 26 people were killed in a mass shooting at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on Sunday. Identities of the victims have not been released, but the church's pastor Frank Pomeroy confirmed to ABC News that his 14-year-old daughter was among those who died. The pastor's wife Sherri Pomeroy told NBC News that she and her husband were out of town when the shooting took place, but their daughter was inside the church. Frank Pomeroy described his daughter, Annabelle Renee Pomeroy, as ""one very beautiful, special child."" Local authorities said a man walked into the church while service was underway and opened fire. One witness said she heard at least 20 shots. The suspect was reportedly shot and killed after a brief police chase. Authorities have not confirmed whether the suspect killed himself or was brought down by officers. Officials said the victims of the shooting ranged in age from 5 to 72. A spokesman for University Hospital in San Antonio said the hospital has received nine patients from the shooting, four of whom are children.

          / CBS News SUTHERLAND SPRING, Texas -- As the investigation continues into the mass shooting at a church in South Texas, CBS News is learning more about the victims who were gunned down. Like the 26-year-old killer, some of the dead were U.S. Air Force veterans. Their deaths are in stark contrast to the lives they lived -- lives defined by a love for God and serving their country. Robert Corrigan and his wife, Shani, epitomized that devotion at their church and in their community -- a deeply patriotic one. Corrigan moved to Sutherland Springs two years ago after a decorated 30-year career in the Air Force. As chief master sergeant of the 55th medical group at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, he led the largest and busiest in the Air Combat Command, running continuous operations in the Middle East and North Africa since 1991. In other words, Chief Master Sgt. Corrigan was ""everything his killer was not,"" as pointed out on a veterans website. Bob and Jeann Sommers, his uncle and aunt, spoke to CBS News. ""They lost a young man that loved the military, that loved to serve his country,"" Jeann said. Scott and Karen Marshall were also in the Air Force, stationed in North Carolina. They met in the barracks. Mike Norton had known the couple since then. He even took their wedding photos. ""I knew that I had a brother and sister that had my back,"" Norton told CBS News. Both families are reminiscent of the deep sense of service that runs through this part of Texas. Both have sons on active duty -- their loss still unfathomable to those who worshipped with them. ""It is just hard to imagine, these poor innocent people that had no idea ... They were never returning back,"" Gloria Rodriguez told CBS News. A memorial of 26 crosses is just one of many throughout town as the community copes with its shared grief. There are funeral plans underway that may include a mass service for everyone to worship together. Michelle Miller is the co-host of ""CBS This Morning: Saturday.""

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/487262902/0/usatoday-newstopstories~Devin-Kelleyaposs-troubled-past-included-divorce-domestic-battery-and-time-in-the-stockade/,"  NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas – The 26-year-old gunman responsible for the deadly mass shooting at a Texas church had a long, troubled past – divorce, domestic battery and a failed U.S. Air Force career that ended with time in military prison – before he carried out the macabre attack on Sunday worshipers, authorities said. Investigators are still probing what led Devin Kelley to target the First Baptist Church in the small town of Sutherland Springs, Texas, but authorities noted he was embroiled in an ongoing domestic dispute with his wife’s family. His mother-in-law had attended the church, but his in-laws were not at Sunday’s deadly service. “We can tell you that there was a domestic situation going on within his family,” said Texas Department of Public Safety regional director Freeman Martin. “The mother-in-law had attended this church. We know she had received threatening texts from him.” Both President Trump and Gov. Greg Abbott said Monday that Kelley, who is accused of killing 26 people and wounding 20 others, suffered from mental health problems. They did not disclose the nature of his mental illness. Trump, who was travelling in Japan, called the gunman ""deranged” and pushed back against the notion that tougher gun laws could have prevented the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history. ""I think mental health is the problem here,"" Trump said. ""This isn't a guns situation."" Outside the gunman's family's house in New Braunfels, about 40 miles from the Sutherland Springs church,  the Comal County Sheriff's Office stood guard on Monday, as law enforcement officials conducted their investigation. For the past month and half, the gunman worked as an unarmed security guard at the Summit Vacation Resort in New Braunfels, the resort’s manager Claudia Varjabedian told USA TODAY. ""He worked the 4 (p.m.) to midnight shift,” she said. “Nobody ever really talked to him. “There were no suspicions that he was capable of doing what he did,"" Varjabedian added. ""There’s no way we could have known that.” Earlier this year, Kelley worked for five and a half weeks as an unarmed security guard at Schlitterbahn New Braunfels, park spokesperson Winter Prosapio said in an email. The water park in this San Antonio suburb is located about 35 miles north of where Kelley conducted the largest mass shooting in Texas history. Prosapio said Kelley’s background check “came back clean prior to his starting work,"" but was later terminated. “He was not a good fit,” said Prosapio, who did not offer further details on the firing. Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said Kelley served in Logistics Readiness at Holloman Air Force Base in southern New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge in 2014. After he was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his spouse and a child, he received a bad conduct discharge, was confined for 12 months at Naval Consolidated Brig Miramar in California  and busted to the service’s lowest rank. Kelley was alleged to have fractured the skull of his young stepson, said Don Christensen, the Air Force's former chief prosecutor whose office oversaw Kelley's prosecution. The Air Force on Monday said it failed to flag Kelley as banned from buying the weapons he used in the killing spree. Kelley’s domestic violence offense was not entered into the National Criminal Information Center database by the Air Force officials at Holloman Air Force Base, Stefanek said in a statement. The Air Force was required to provide the information to the database because Kelley was convicted of a domestic assault and under federal law would not have been able to purchase a gun legally. Late Monday, the Pentagon announced it requested the Defense Department's Inspector general launch a review into how the error occurred. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) said Kelley owned four guns, purchasing two in Colorado and two in Texas since 2014. The shooter bought two guns at two San Antonio locations of Academy Sports+Outdoors in 2016 and 2017 and “both sales were approved” by National Instant Criminal Background Check System, the seller confirmed in a statement.    Kelley had another run in with law enforcement in August 2014 while living in a Colorado mobile home park. El Paso County authorities charged him misdemeanor animal cruelty, charges which were later dropped. Four witnesses at the mobile home park said they saw Kelley repeatedly punch a white and brown husky, according to an El Paso County Sheriff’s Department incident report. One witness said Kelley picked up the dog by its neck and slammed it onto the ground. Other witnesses also said they saw Kelley punch the dog and then drag the dog away. “We were just getting set up in the RV park when we saw him running after his dog and tackle it like a football player,” witness Brent Moody said in an interview. “Then, he starts beating the dog. He was picking it up and hitting it in the face. I went over to confront him and he jumped up. He had a two-foot-long knife on him. You could tell he was whacked out. So, we backed off and waited for the police.” Kelley initially refused to leave his camper when deputies arrived at the scene and told them he wouldn't talk to them about the incident or let them see his dog without a search warrant. He later admitted to deputies that he jumped on the dog, because the animal had been acting aggressively toward another dog in the area. But Kelley denied punching the dog. The dog was impounded, and Kelley was released at the scene with a summons to appear in court. High school classmates described Kelley as a social outsider who kept to himself. Christopher Leo Longoria, who attended high school with the gunman in New Braunfels, recalled Kelley as “being socially awkward at times.” “But nothing over the top,” Longoria wrote to USA TODAY. “He would just kind of go with the flow of being around others. He wasn’t popular, energetic or looking for attention. Just a different kid who stuck to himself.” Kyomi Brooks, another high school classmate of Kelley, recalled Kelley as “weird.” ""The fact that I walked the same halls with this guy makes me so sick to my stomach to the point I literally want to throw up,"" Brooks said. ""What makes me even more sick is how everyone is trying to justify it by mental illness when I think we should just call it how it is. Stop sugar coating. Devin Kelley was a terrorist!""     The conviction for domestic abuse should have flagged Kelley as ineligible to buy the weapons, if the FBI had been made aware of it,  said Christensen, the former Air Force prosecutor. ""This clearly fell under federal law, without a doubt,"" Christensen said. ""The Air Force is supposed to report the information to FBI. It was possible that it was never reported. It's possible that somebody in the Air Force just blew it.""

Witnesses spotted him shortly before the attack at a nearby gas station wearing some of the gear. He began firing outside the church and then entered the building and continued firing. As he left the church, a neighbor heard the commotion at the church. The neighbor, armed with his own weapon, shot Kelley outside the church wounding him. Kelley dropped his Ruger AR assault-type rifle and fled the scene in his car.  The neighbor flagged down a passing driver and they drove after Kelley, who crashed his vehicle in the neighboring county. Martin said investigators are still awaiting pathology tests, but it appeared Kelley died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Two handguns were found in Kelley’s vehicle. “We know during the pursuit, the suspect used his cell phone to notify his father that he had been shot and didn’t think he was going to make it,” Martin said.

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/487489732/0/usatoday-newstopstories~AR-style-rifles-are-common-among-mass-shootings/,"Corrections and Clarifications: A previous version of this story erroneously included a mass shooting in Oregon in which the gunman did not use an AR-15. AR-15 style rifles have been the weapon of choice in many recent mass shootings, including the Texas church shooting Sunday, the Las Vegas concert last month, the Orlando nightclub last year and Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. The manufacture of rifles more than doubled in the past decade, to nearly 3.7 million rifles manufactured in 2015, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Much of the growth coincided with the Obama administration, when industry experts said gun owners were worried the government would restrict weapon sales. Amid that growth, the AR-15 style weapon became popular for its ease of use and versatility. The National Rifle Association has called the AR-15 the ""most popular rifle in America"" and estimates Americans own more than 8 million of them. The NRA said ""the AR-15 has soared in popularity"" because it's ""customizable, adaptable, reliable and accurate."" It is also versatile and can be used for ""sport shooting, hunting and self-defense situations,"" the NRA said, adding the ability to ""personalize"" so many of the rifle's components ""is one of the things that makes it so unique."" The site TacticalGear.com offered a favorable comparison of the U.S. AR-15 to the Russian-made AK-47. The AR-15 has a higher base price, shoots farther effectively, fires more rounds per minute, is lighter and its service life is longer if properly maintained, the site said. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence said the AR-15, a civilian model of the military’s M-16, also cited the weapon’s versatility in evaluating its popularity. “They’re accurate and they can basically shoot as quickly as you can pull the trigger,” according to a campaign statement. “Along those lines, they’re very customizable — most average people can figure out how to install accessories like forward trigger grips that let you hold the gun at waist height and spray bullets while stabilizing the gun, laser sights, and you can add high-capacity magazines.” Dean Hazen, owner of The Gun Experts in Mahomet, Ill., and a master firearms instructor, said the reason mass shooters are turning to the AR-15 is due to a ""copy-cat"" mentality more than any feature of the rifle. ""It’s really just a perception thing,"" Hazen said. ""There are rifles that are more powerful and more dangerous than that, but they're not being used."" For example, Hazen says the AK-47 — and its semiautomatic variants — is a ""far more wicked gun than an AR-15."" The AK-47 variants can hold just as many rounds as the AR-15, are more reliable and use larger 7.62 mm rounds as opposed to the standard AR-15's .223 rounds. Some killers might be drawn to the AR-15 because they are the ""weapon of choice"" for the military and police. But ironically, the police ""choose it because it is under-powered, Hazen said, ""making it less likely to penetrate interior walls and hit an unintended target."" The Army is considering moving to a higher-caliber rifle partly because that would make the weapon more deadly. Hazen said the AR-15 has ""gotten a bad rap."" He believes mass shooters generally don't know much about guns and choose the AR-15 because of the reputation it has gotten from being used in other mass shootings. ""Thank God they don't know any better because if they did they would use much more effective weapons,"" Hazen said.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/06/this-isnt-a-guns-situation-says-trump-after-texas-church-shooting?CMP=share_btn_tw,"US president says mental health of perpetrator, not gun ownership, to blame for mass shooting in which 26 people died Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.15 BST Donald Trump has blamed Sunday’s deadly mass shooting at a Baptist church in Texas on the mental health of the perpetrator and claimed that gun ownership was not a factor. Asked during a press conference in Tokyo what policies he would support to tackle mass shootings in the US, the president said: “I think that mental health is a problem here. Based on preliminary reports, this was a very deranged individual with a lot of problems over a very long period of time.  “We have a lot of mental health problems in our country, as do other countries, but this isn’t a guns situation … we could go into it but it’s a little bit soon to go into it. Fortunately somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction, otherwise it wouldn’t have been as bad as it was, it would have been much worse. “This is a mental health problem at the highest level. It’s a very sad event … these are great people at a very, very sad event, but that’s the way I view it.” Speaking at the end of a two-day visit to Japan, Trump said he sent his “thoughts, prayers and deepest condolences” to the victims of the “horrific assault”, in which 26 people died and 20 others were wounded. The dead ranged in age from five to 72 years old. Flanked by the Japanese prime minister, Shinzō Abe, Trump paid tribute to the community of Sutherland Springs, a small town 30 miles (48km) south-east of San Antonio. “Beautiful area … so sad … Sutherland Springs, Texas, such a beautiful, wonderful area with incredible people. Who would ever think a thing like this could every happen? So I want to send my condolences, the condolences of our first lady. “In tragic times, Americans always pull together, we are always strongest when we are unified. To the wounded and the families of the victims all of America is praying for you, supporting you and grieving alongside you.” Law enforcement officials in Sutherland Springs did not name the gunman, though his name was reported elsewhere as Devin Patrick Kelley. The US Air Force said Kelley, 26, served from 2010 to 2014, when he left following a court martial. He received a bad conduct discharge for assaulting his wife and child. Kelley lived in the town of New Braunfels, about 35 miles from Sutherland Springs. On Sunday night police were at the property. The killing is the worst mass shooting in modern Texas history and one of the worst such gun rampages in recent years. The lone shooter was found dead after he was chased by locals and police across county lines. Trump’s defence of the retaliatory use of use of guns echoed comments made earlier by the Texas attorney general. American churches should be “arming some of the parishioners” or hiring “professional security”, Republican Ken Paxton told Fox News in an interview hours after the shootings at Sutherland Springs First Baptist Church. “It’s going to happen again.” If more churchgoers were armed “there’s always the opportunity that the gunman will be taken out before he has the opportunity to kill very many people”, Paxton said. The Texas governor, Greg Abbott, said on Sunday: “There are so many families who have lost family members, and it occurred in a church, in a place of worship. That’s where these people were mown down. We mourn their loss.” Two years ago, Abbott lamented that the state’s population were not buying enough guns. “I’m EMBARRASSED: Texas #2 in nation for new gun purchases, behind CALIFORNIA. Let’s pick up the pace Texans @NRA,” he tweeted in October 2015. The lone suspect, dressed in black tactical gear and a ballistic vest, drove up to the church during Sunday morning services and started firing inside. He kept shooting once he entered, according to law enforcement officials. Among the dead was the 14-year-old daughter of Pastor Frank Pomeroy, the family told several television stations."
http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/505240196/0/usatodaycomnation-topstories~Las-Vegas-shooting-Patients-went-to-wrong-hospital-as-misinformation-spread/,"LAS VEGAS — They found the couple sprawled across the warm asphalt outside the Route 91 Harvest festival. Blood seeped from bullet wounds, his near an elbow, hers on the head. Panicked concertgoers streamed past them. David Hendrickson, an EMT who attended the Oct. 1 concert, stopped and knelt beside the couple. The woman was growing woozy. Blood soaked through the shirt tied around her head. Hendrickson tightened it, and then took off his own shirt and tied it around the man’s arm. “We need to get these guys to the hospital,” Hendrickson told his girlfriend, Michelle Wolters. There was no time to wait for an ambulance. The four climbed into Wolters’ Mercedes. Blood seeped into the leather seats. More: Was Reno high-rise gunman mimicking Las Vegas shooter 2 months ago? More: Las Vegas massacre survivor killed in hit-and-run Hendrickson started the car and inched through the crowd near Mandalay Bay. They had driven in from California and nobody in the car knew the local hospitals, so Wolters pulled out her iPhone. With shaking fingers, she typed in ""Vegas hospital."" Sunrise Hospital appeared at the top of the list. “All right,” Hendrickson said, “we’re gonna go there.” They had no way to know that Sunrise would soon become overwhelmed with patients, with every gurney full and ""red-tag"" triage patients waiting for care. At the same time, the county’s most comprehensive trauma center, University Medical Center, barely three miles away, was preparing itself for victims who never arrived. Metropolitan Las Vegas has a trauma response plan designed to send manageable numbers of patients to each hospital. The plan dictates which injuries must be treated at a trauma center and which ones can go to a regular hospital. It splits Clark County into three areas and assigns each one a trauma center where patients should be taken. The Route 91 Harvest festival stage was at a location designated for UMC. But in the hours after the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history, that plan became impossible to follow. Bystanders like Hendrickson and Wolters loaded victims into their cars and drove them to the first hospital they could find, bypassing the county's transport system entirely. More: Las Vegas shooting lawsuits stack up with 14 more filed More: Jason Aldean remembers 'pandemonium' during Las Vegas shooting Confusion and rumors swirled, partly because the county lacks the central communications system that emergency planners called for in 2009. That resulted in an uneven rush of patients into hospitals all over Clark County. Sunrise, a Level II trauma center, treated 199 patients in a few hours. UMC, Nevada’s only Level I trauma center and the hospital President Trump visited after the massacre, took 104 patients. A handful of UMC's beds remained empty as rumors it had closed it doors spread through the county. Hundreds more patients filtered into smaller hospitals. “Some places got hit hard,” said UMC trauma director Dr. John Fildes. “But that’s what happens when 500 people went down.”  City, county and hospital officials insist their response to the shooting went as smoothly as possible. “From an emergency response perspective, the event was very professionally managed,” Clark County Fire Chief Greg Cassell said in a statement. No complaints have been filed with the state’s health department, and a spokeswoman for the Division of Public and Behavioral Health said she was not aware of any complaints about the emergency response. “If it’s a problem, it needs to be addressed,” said John Hammond, the EMS and trauma system manager for the Southern Nevada Health District, about the imbalance of patients at hospitals. “But I don’t know if it’s a problem.” More: Couple who survived Las Vegas mass shooting die in car crash More: 'Is this real?': Seven hours of chaos, bravery at Las Vegas hospital after mass shooting Among the unanswerable questions from a night of terror is whether the Level I trauma center should have received more patients, potentially spreading the work more evenly among over-burdened emergency workers. The drop in care from a Level I to a Level II trauma center is minimal, experts say, and often disputed. Nationwide studies of their treatment have given mixed results. Some research shows that more people die at Level II centers, which aren’t required to have as many specialists or treat as many patients annually as top-tier centers. Other research shows more people die at Level I centers, because those places receive the patients closest to death. It’s impossible to know if the confusion caused any patients to receive lesser treatment. But it at least created disparate levels of chaos at the region’s two largest trauma centers. At Sunrise, the flow of patients seemed never to stop. Staff, space and resources ran thin. The hospital used up its entire supply of universally compatible O-negative blood, and at least one ER doctor said he worked until his brain couldn’t process charts anymore. Every gurney and wheelchair in the hospital held a patient. Some patients waited on the floor. Others with minor injuries walked out, not wanting to take up time or resources that could be used on more critical patients. A few miles away, UMC’s trauma director wondered where the rest of the patients were. Around 1:45 a.m. MT, Fildes counted nine empty trauma bays. Three operating rooms sat open. Even two months after the shooting, nobody has determined exactly why patients stopped arriving at UMC. But in the immediate aftermath, rumors spread by word of mouth and on social media that UMC had closed its doors. Multiple emergency workers and hospital staffers told The Arizona Republic they heard, at some point during the evening, that UMC had stopped taking patients. Representatives of two ambulance companies heard it. Two Sunrise staffers said they heard it. Two medics working at the concert venue received texts about it. None of those people could identify the source of the rumor. ""So many injuries that UMC hospital having to divert to other hospitals,"" Las Vegas blogger Christy Oldenkamp wrote on Twitter. Other accounts tweeted similar rumors. It wasn’t true. UMC didn’t close, and nothing similar appears in an audio recording of Clark County Fire Department dispatchers in the first hour after the shooting. Fildes, the UMC trauma director, recalled telling somebody at Sunrise that he had room to take their excess patients. He remembered asking for them to come three at a time, so his teams could focus on the most critical patients. In an email, Fildes said he couldn't remember how many more arrived.  The Southern Nevada Health District’s trauma plan, last updated in February 2015, dictates that a patient must be taken to a trauma center if he or she has certain injuries, including a “penetrating injury to the head, neck, torso or the extremities proximal to the elbow or knee.” It then divides Clark County into three segments: Trauma patients injured in an eastern area should be taken to Sunrise, which is northeast of the Strip. Patients in an area to the south should go to St. Rose Dominican Hospital, Siena Campus, in nearby Henderson. Patients found anywhere else in the county go to UMC, which is northwest of the Strip. The Route 91 concert stage was in a part of the county for which UMC was responsible. The plan allows for exceptions if bad traffic or dangerous weather make the designated hospital too difficult to reach in time. It's designed to make first responders, ambulance drivers and other emergency personnel work in unison, all following the same strategy to move people to hospitals. It does not mention how to handle a mass of gunshot victims being transported in pickup trucks and strangers’ back seats. So when it came time for the plan to be implemented, confusion ruled the moments after the shooting. Emergency responders weren’t sure if it was safe to head toward the festival grounds. False reports of multiple shooters circulated. One man on the Clark County Fire Department dispatch radio kept repeating reports of a man in Army fatigues climbing into a van. Through it all, audio recordings obtained by The Arizona Republic show, the dispatch feed flooded with requests for ambulances. “The ambulances do not have enough units to transfer all the gunshot wounds,” one responder reported. “We are out of ambulances and we still have a couple more criticals,” said another. “Chief, we’re currently loading patients into private vehicles. We have no more ambulances,” still another said. “We’re getting pickup trucks full of patients coming in."" In 2009, a study of the region's trauma plan concluded that Clark County needed a centralized communications center to handle emergency situations, rather than relying on a patchwork system of dispatchers and hospitals. That center was never created. “We’ve been trying to fix that problem for a while,” the health district's Hammond said recently, noting that the initial set-up of a system could cost upward of $1 million. “Not just for large events, but for everyday movement of patients within the system, a centralized system would be better.” The streets were jammed when Hendrickson pulled his girlfriend’s car off the Strip. He and Wolters tried to introduce themselves to the strange couple in their back seat, searching for some way into a conversation. The man said his name was David, too. That was a start. He introduced his girlfriend as Stephanie. Her alertness started to fade. They reached a red light. Hendrickson blew through it. A truck filled with bleeding people sped past them, clambering over the median and through a turn lane. A six-mile drive took 10 minutes. Finally Hendrickson pulled into the curve behind Sunrise’s emergency room. Hospital staff had filled the ambulance bays with as many wheelchairs and gurneys as they could find. An ER doctor and nurses worked in a hurried quiet. A small group crowded around the Mercedes. “Back seat,” Hendrickson told them. He and Wolters watched as nurses pulled out the couple and helped them onto gurneys. Then they disappeared into the crowded hospital. ""We’ve been trying to look for them and see if they’re OK,"" Wolters said recently. ""It does kind of bother us that we don’t know how they are."" Follow Alden Woods on Twitter: @ac_woods "
http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_latest/~3/UPPtdpwPVzM/index.html,"""One of the responsibilities I have as a pastor, as a shepherd of the church, is to protect the people, and that includes spiritually, but it also includes the physical protection,"" said Pastor Jack Graham of Prestonwood Baptist Church in Plano, Texas. The deadliest-ever mass shooting in Texas -- in which a gunman walked among pews at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, killing 25 parishioners and an unborn child -- has become the latest in a string of attacks directed at religious institutions. Now, Christian leaders, in particular, are considering new security measures or bolstering existing rules, mirroring actions taken by leaders of Jewish, Muslim and other faith communities when their institutions have been targets. ""We need to be doing everything we can right now to protect our people,"" Graham said, ""and that includes visible police officers, volunteers and keeping our eyes open."" 'Church should be a safe place' At a congregation in central Florida, volunteers who welcome parishioners every weekend know they also need to remain alert. ""The more you understand what is normal, the easier it is to spot what is abnormal,"" said Eric Little, associate pastor of Bethel Baptist Church in Lakeland. The church has installed security cameras, and doors remain locked during services. The minister said it was an adjustment for many but ""people feel safer and they understand why."" ""The church should be a safe place,"" Little said. ""We are hoping we are doing that. People are welcome. We are not trying to keep people away."" For Pastor Darius Pridgen of True Bethel Baptist Church, preparedness has become a priority. Volunteer security guards patrol the Buffalo, New York church, and on Sunday, parishioners are due to learn ""run, hide and fight back"" techniques from local police. People need to know where exits are and how to pay attention if a threat emerges amid the music, prayers and solemnity, Pridgen said. ""It doesn't give me any pause; it's the world we are in,"" he said, pointing out that no one used to worry about so-called soft targets, such as movie theaters and churches. Volunteers become armed guards At some places of worship in Texas, ushers and greeters serve double duty as armed guards. Chuck Chadwick, who founded the National Organization of Church Security and Safety Management, has trained more than 350 parishioners and pastors to become certified security officers approved by the Texas Department of Public Safety. During a six-day training, Chadwick teaches volunteers handgun skills, de-escalation techniques, and hand-to-hand tactics, such as handcuffing suspects. ""You could think of them as bodyguards,"" Chadwick said. Until recently, churches in Texas were required to hire certified officers as armed security. A state law that went in effect in September now allows churches, synagogues and other places of religious worship to create their own security teams with volunteers who are legally allowed to carry guns. ""I would rather arm law-abiding citizens and make sure they can prevent this from happening, as opposed to trying to pass laws that would prevent law-abiding citizens from having guns,"" Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton told Fox News Channel. At least five volunteers trained as guards are on duty every Sunday at Trinity Lighthouse Church in Denison, Texas. Pastor Brian Ulch said his team opted not to hire a private security firm because ""they don't know your congregation; they don't know the heartbeat of your ministry."" Ulch says the 750-member church nestled in the northeast Texas Hill Country, 75 miles outside of Dallas, is prepared for a shooting scenario, as well as other dangers. Those include ""the hot topics that pastoral teams touch every day that can be controversial that can lead to picket lines, to protests,"" he said. ""You never know what you're going to engage on a Sunday-to-Sunday basis, and doing nothing was not an option."""

https://www.elitedaily.com/p/can-a-domestic-violence-offender-own-a-gun-the-reality-is-tricky-3233751," On Sunday, Nov. 5, a gunman used an AR-15-style rifle to kill 26 people in a mass shooting at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, according to Texas authorities. The gunman had a history of domestic violence, and died following three gunshot wounds (which included a self-inflicted gunshot to the head) after leaving the church on Sunday, according to authorities. In 2012, he was court-martialed and found guilty during Air Force service of assaulting his wife and child, according to The New York Times, and was discharged for ""bad conduct"" in 2014 after a sentencing of 12 months' confinement. A background of domestic violence is not uncommon for a mass shooter â although it's not a prerequisite, either. Many of the more high-profile mass shootings were reportedly committed by men accused of domestic violence, including June's shooting at a Congressional baseball practice, the Pulse nightclub shooting, a 2016 shooting of 17 people in Kansas, and the 2015 Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood shooting. Overall, between 2009 and 2016, 54 percent of mass shootings involved killing intimate partners or family members, according to Everytown for Gun Safety. ""One of the most common factors behind mass shootings is domestic violence,"" Amy Barasch, executive director of Her Justice, a legal group for women, tells me in an interview for Elite Daily. There is actually a federal law in place that's supposed to keep domestic violence offenders from owning guns. However, federal laws often fall short of actually keeping guns out of the hands of domestic violence offenders for a handful of reasons. ""The problem is that there isnât really an effective enforcement mechanism,"" Barasch says. In terms of the national laws themselves, they don't apply to violence against a girlfriend (as opposed to a wife) or against someone who is neither a partner nor a child (i.e. a parent). There is also a lack of specificity in laws regarding same-sex couples, which can lead to legal confusion. The laws also don't apply to convicted stalkers. This allows for many people to be convicted of a domestic violence-related crime, but still buy and own a gun. What's more, the national laws don't actually require convicted domestic abusers to turn in their guns. Instead, it's left to states to decide if they're going to step up their own laws to take away guns from domestic abusers after a conviction. However, just 15 states have laws in place requiring people with domestic violence restraining orders to give up guns, according to Everytown. And then there are the gun sale issues that go beyond domestic violence. Background checks for gun sales â that, in theory, would prevent convicted abusers from being able to purchase guns â only happen with licensed gun sellers, per the law. But they aren't the only people who sell guns. There are also sales on the internet, sales between families/friends, and sales at gun shows (which is why this issue is often referred to as the ""gun show loophole""). When it comes to third-party sales without background checks, Barasch says, ""the fact that people donât think folks they know are going to harm their partners does, unfortunately, affect whether they think that person should be able to own a gun."" There are a host of other technical and legal problems â ranging from a lack of clarification of what an ownership restriction means, to the idea that a convicted abuser is not likely to self-report breaking a law by owning a gun, to simple human error in documentation â that allow for convicted domestic abusers to continue to have access to guns. Ultimately, this touches on two major issues: the apparent inability to pass stricter gun control laws and the lack of understanding American society has around domestic violence. ""There are certainly people on the ground who think folks have a very invariable right to possess a firearm,"" Barasch says, explaining that this right is for recreational purposes, such as hunting. But, she says, people need to get to a place where they recognize that an adult's right to weekend fun is not as important as, say, a child's right to life. Although our culture is now at a place where we can talk more about domestic violence than we could in previous American history, when it was more of a silent issue, ""we don't really understand it any better than we used to,"" Barasch says. This means that both bystanders and law enforcement still miss red flags when it comes to domestic violence and guns. So people can still have a feeling that domestic abusers ""hurt their partners in a 'small way,' but they would never use their gun to hurt them,"" according to Barasch. In reality, if a gun is present in a domestic violence situation, a woman is five times more likely to be killed, a 2003 study on risk factors for femicide in abusive relationships from the American Journal of Public Health found. The Texas gunman was denied a license to carry a gun in the state, Governor Greg Abbott said. ""By all the facts that we seem to know, he was not supposed to have access to a gun,"" Abbott said. Still, according to CNN, he was able to purchase a gun in Texas in 2016. He checked a box in the background check paperwork to claim that he did not have a criminal history that would prevent him from owning a gun. The Air Force said in a statement on Monday evening that they failed to enter his domestic violence offense into the National Criminal Information Center database, so it would not have come up in a background check search. Ultimately, this instance came down to a human or system error. Now, 26 people are dead."
http://nypost.com/2017/11/07/florida-sheriff-urges-people-to-arm-themselves-after-church-massacre/,"Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. The day after a gunman killed 26 people and wounded 20 others at a church in Texas, sheriff officials in Florida urged locals to arm themselves — sparking backlash from some users online. “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun, is a good guy with a gun,” the department tweeted on Monday. “We do active shooter scenario training.” The officials even offered help anyone with questions on how to legally purchase firearms. “We encourage those who can legally arm themselves to do so & we offer [Concealed Weapon Permit] classes for those who want to get the permit,” the Polk County Sheriff’s Office tweeted. The tweets elicited a wide range of responses, including one woman who asked if parishioners should be armed and places of worship be guarded. “That is awful,” a user by the name of Ananda Kelley replied. “What kind of world do you want your grandchildren to live in?” “A safe one, where a bad guy with a gun can be eliminated by a good guy with a gun – regardless of where that is,” the sheriff’s office responded. Another user noted that the Texas church shooter, Devin Kelley, was likely at one point a “trained good guy with a gun” prior to the massacre, while another commenter sarcastically agreed with the sheriff’s suggestion. “Let’s add more guns to the picture so [it] slows the response and cops don’t know who the real shooter is,” Bill Millard-Sarkis wrote. “Real brilliant … There was an armed officer at Pulse that was no match for the assault rifle the killer had. STRICTER gun laws MUST BE ENACTED.” Another user tweeted: “Unbelievable that you think having people strapped in church is the solution. Hope you have a lot of soap to get that innocent blood off.” At least four people indicated they would they sign up for the training and several others praised the sheriff office’s effort for “thinking outside of the box” in the aftermath of yet another mass shooting in America. “A great defense starts with a strong offense,” one man replied. Meanwhile, President Trump rejected calls for tougher guns laws on Tuesday, saying that “hundreds more” would have died if not for an armed citizen who opened fire at Kelley, prompting him to flee the scene. Kelley later killed himself after a pursuit with the hero locals. “If you did what you’re suggesting, there would have been no difference three days ago and you might not have had that very brave person who happens to have a gun or a rifle in his trunk,” Trump told reporters during a trip to South Korea.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas – The man who authorities say carried out the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history had a rifle and two handguns with him. Devin Patrick Kelley opened fire during worship services at a small church in Sutherland Springs, southeast of San Antonio, killing 26 people and wounding 20 others. Investigators say based on evidence at the scene they believe Kelley, 26, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after he was chased by bystanders and crashed his car. Here is a glance at what officials have said regarding the weapons they found, other shooting evidence and the gunman's background: — Three guns were recovered. A Ruger AR-556 rifle was found at the church. Two handguns were recovered from Kelley's vehicle — a Glock 9 mm and a Ruger .22-caliber. Kelley purchased all three guns, authorities said. — Investigators collected hundreds of shell casings from the scene, along with at least 15 empty magazines that held 30 rounds each. — Kelley owned a total of four guns, law enforcement authorities said. He bought one per year from 2014 to 2017. Two were purchased in Texas and two in Colorado. — Kelley did not have a license to carry a handgun, authorities said. In Texas, you're not required to have a license to buy or own a handgun, just one to carry a handgun in public. And a person does not need a license to carry a long rifle in the state. Kelley did have a license to serve as an unarmed private security guard. — Kelley served at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge in 2014. Kelley was found guilty of abusing his wife and her son and received a bad-conduct discharge from the Air Force. He had faced a court-martial in 2012 on the allegations and served 12 months of confinement. The Air Force failed to report Kelley's criminal history to the federal database used to conduct background checks on citizens looking to buy a gun, even though it was required to do so by Pentagon rules, federal officials said.

http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/breakingnews/~3/VvSVUScnWFY/ct-met-northern-california-shooting-huppke-20171115-story.html,"I’m not going to bring up gun control. We’re still under the “too soon” rule from last week’s massacre during Sunday service at a Texas church, so it’s certainly too soon to talk about guns in connection to Tuesday’s shooting spree. Maybe you didn’t hear about that one — such things tend to come and go with little fanfare these days. It happened in Northern California. A man with a semi-automatic rifle and two handguns started randomly shooting people all over a small town, including at an elementary school. Five people were killed and at least two children were wounded, one of them at the school. There’s no motive yet, just reports of a neighborhood dispute. Phil Johnston, assistant sheriff of Tehama County, told reporters: “This is an individual that armed himself with the motive of getting even with his neighbor and just went on a rampage. I don’t know how to describe it to you any different.” Maybe that’s because these tragedies all start to sound the same: some random guy; an inexplicable outburst of violence; lives shattered. Remember, I’m keeping quiet about the firearms. One has to be respectful. Instead, I’m going to talk about mental health. The wise folks, the ones who tell us guns aren’t the problem when it comes to a Texan shooting 26 people to death in a church or a Nevadan opening fire from a hotel window in Las Vegas and killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more, say mass shootings are a mental health issue. Period. I’m inclined to agree with that, except for the “period” part. There’s more than that to blame, but it involves something I’m not talking about right now because it’s too soon. So let’s just say mental health is a factor when it comes to murderous rampages. Law enforcement officials say the Northern California shooter tried to get into the elementary school to shoot more kids but was stopped because the school was on lockdown. Nobody’s going to convince me a person capable of such a thing is sane. So we have a mental health problem in this country. We’re reminded of that after every mass shooting. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle extend their thoughts and prayers, those who line their pockets with cash from the National Rifle Association say guns aren’t the problem and everyone brings up mental health and says it must be addressed. But it doesn’t get addressed, at least not in any significant way. Nothing changes with that other thing — the one that it’s too soon to speak about — either, but since there seems to be agreement on the mental health issue, let me ask this: Why no action? It feels like we’re being played. A New York Times story from September 2013, in the wake of the Washington Navy Yard shooting, read: “Despite deep divisions that have kept Congress from passing new gun safety laws for almost two decades, there is one aspect of gun control on which many Democrats, Republicans and even the National Rifle Association agree: the need to give mental health providers better resources to treat dangerous people and prevent them from buying weapons.” Yeah, that didn’t really go anywhere. Republicans worried it might be a back door to tighter laws on purchases of those things I’m not talking about and Democrats worried Republicans might use it as an excuse to not pass tighter laws on purchases of those things I’m not talking about and everyone just gave up and started waiting for the next mass shooting to roll around. Tragedy. Outrage. Too soon. Mental health reform. Nothing. Repeat. It has been only a month and a half since the Las Vegas massacre, which was followed by the Texas church shooting and now this shooting spree in California. That’s 89 people dead and hundreds injured. If we’re going to declare mental health the real problem behind these shootings, it seems fair to say America is facing a mental health crisis. What has happened this year, as bodies continue to hit the ground at concerts and in churches and elementary schools, is this: Republican lawmakers tried to repeal Obamacare, proposing a phaseout of the law’s Medicaid expansion that provides mental health care for hundreds of thousands of Americans. The law also makes employer health care plans cover mental health services on the same level as medical services. Obamacare repeal failed, but now Republicans are trying to push through a tax cut package that would sabotage the health care law by eliminating the individual mandate, which the Congressional Budget Office says would cause millions of Americans to lose their health care. I thought mental health was the big problem. I thought that was the thing we were supposed to be talking about in the wake of a tragedy like the one Tuesday in California. After the Texas church shooting, President Donald Trump said: “I think that mental health is your problem here. We have a lot of mental health problems in our country, as do other countries. But this isn’t a guns situation.” It’s good it’s not a guns situation, because we’re not allowed to talk about those things. We can only talk about mental health. What I don’t understand, then, is why the people talking about mental health in the wake of a mass shooting never seem to do anything to make our mental health care system better. I almost think they’re trying to distract us, hoping thoughts and prayers will be good enough. But people keep dying. And those thoughts and prayers aren’t solving anything. rhuppke@chicagotribune.com CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"

It was lined and spiral-bound, nothing fancy, but perfect to 16-year-old Haley Krueger. On Sunday, Uhl dropped Haley off at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, where the teen regularly attended services. Haley arrived early so that she could help prepare breakfast for the parishioners, her mother said. She brought her new notebook along. The church had a special meaning to her daughter, Uhl said. Two years ago, Haley’s father died of pancreatic cancer, and the weekly youth group meetings carried her through difficult times. At some point on Sunday morning, Haley started to draw. On the first page of her notebook, she colored in pink hearts and sketched green crosses. “I accept God,” she wrote. “Take me away Jesus help me not hurt anymore.” That was the last communication Uhl would ever see from her daughter. A few hours after she left Haley with a kiss, Uhl received word that there had been a shooting. Haley was one of 26 people ― about a third of them children ― gunned down by Devin Patrick Kelley in the deadliest mass shooting in modern Texas history. On Thursday, Uhl stood on the road outside the church and stared at the line of wooden crosses erected in memory of the victims. Each one had a name, a red heart and a photo. “It’s unreal,” she told HuffPost. “No parent should have to bury their child.” Earlier that day, an FBI agent had returned Haley’s notebook to her because she kept asking for it. She was astonished when she saw what was on Haley’s mind before she died. She was thinking about heaven. She described her daughter as a vibrant and happy child who loved to help others. It was Haley’s dream to become a nurse and work in a neonatal intensive care unit, Uhl said. The two of them liked to watch television together and bond. “She’d make me watch Grey’s Anatomy,” Uhl said. “She was behind, and she realized that she liked the show, so she was going through all the seasons. And every night she’d be watching it in my bedroom.” Uhl has barely slept since she heard the news; when she tries, she has nightmares. “She went through a horrible tragedy,” she said about Haley. “I close my eyes and that’s all I see.” For now, Uhl said she is staying indoors and trying to help her three other children cope with the loss of their sibling.

https://www.elitedaily.com/p/trump-tweets-about-sutherland-springs-shooting-on-night-of-rancho-tehama-shooting-so-thats-dark-5476942," Just when you thought things couldn't get worse, President Donald Trump gave his condolences to the wrong mass shooting. On the evening of Nov. 14, Trump tweeted about the Sutherland Springs shooting instead of the Rancho Tehama shooting, which happened that day. Early Tuesday morning, a shooter killed four people and wounded at least two children outside an elementary school in Rancho Tehama Reserve in Northern California. Trump seemed to have mixed up the two recent mass shootings, with both tweets appearing to be ""copy and pasted."" Maybe his two-week long Asia trip has him all turned around, but either way, it did not go unnoticed by the public. The tweet that is under fire reads, ""May God be with the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI & Law Enforcement has arrived,"" which Trump tweeted on Nov. 14. However, on Nov. 5, Trump wrote an almost identical tweet saying, ""May God be with the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan."" The shooting, which seems to be a bit overshadowed by Trump's tweet, is still under investigation for motive. However, the shooter was reportedly killed by authorities after leaving the school and going on a random shooting spree around Rancho Tehama Reserve. The Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston of Rancho Tehema Reserve said, according to KCRA, ""This is a very tragic event for all of us. There are children involved, it is an emotional thing.â Brown issued a statement saying, ""Anne and I are saddened to hear about today's violence in Tehama County, which shockingly involved schoolchildren. We offer our condolences to the families who lost loved ones and unite with all Californians in grief."" One of the most important parts of being president is to address and console a grieving nation in times of distress, and Trump's little misstep is not helping his already-criticized lack of empathy in response to events such as Hurricane Harvey. Trump was criticized for focusing on crowd size and how catastrophic the storm before consoling and comforting people. In this instance, it was not a problem of empathy, but an actual mix-up of facts. While this is comical to some, other people on Twitter are using this as an opportunity to bring up the conversation of the deeper root of mass shootings, something that some users feel Trump has not adequately addressed. Regardless of if Trump or his staffers are directly to blame for the tweet, it still looks equally as bad for the administration and their awareness of domestic issues happening on the home front. While the tweet has since been deleted, you can always count on Twitter to (literally) have its finger on the pulse for Trump's every move and misstep."

http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/offtopic/~3/MzE8SpThjKo/ct-republicans-gun-background-checks-20171205-story.html,"WASHINGTON — Rare bipartisan consensus around legislation to improve the national background check system for gun purchases is in jeopardy after House Republicans linked the measure to a bill allowing gun owners to carry concealed weapons across state lines. The House is expected to vote and pass the combination bill Wednesday over the objections of House Democrats, who accused Republicans of ""trickery"" and ""sabotage"" in tying the background-checks bill to a concealed-carry measure that the National Rifle Association called its ""highest legislative priority."" In the Senate, Democrats have labeled the concealed-carry legislation a nonstarter, while key Senate Republicans cautioned that pairing the bills is a recipe for the demise of both. ""When you put them together it makes it harder for us to do what we can do, and can do now,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, the Senate's No. 2 Republican and a co-author of the background checks legislation. ""I want to separate those two out, get the Fix NICS bill passed and hopefully save some lives."" The background-checks legislation, which forces federal agencies and incentivizes states to better report offenses that prohibit individuals from buying firearms, is the first gun bill in years to secure the support of Democrats, Republicans, gun-control advocates and the NRA. Bill authors credit its narrow focus - shoring up the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, known as NICS - for keeping together an otherwise unwieldy coalition of support. They caution against upsetting the balance by loading up the bill with other measures. ""When we were negotiating in a very bipartisan, good-faith way, the understanding was the NICS-fix bill would be considered on its own,"" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., an original co-sponsor of the bill. ""Combining them would be completely unwise and unacceptable, and everyone knows it."" But supporters of the House GOP effort say that the concealed-carry legislation is a logical complement to the background checks bill. ""Taken together, these two bills preserve and protect the rights guaranteed to us by the Second Amendment,"" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said Tuesday. ""I believe that both bills complement each other in keeping people safe."" Lawmakers began drafting legislation last month to improve reporting to the background check system after it emerged that the shooter in a deadly attack on a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, could have been prevented from buying guns if the military had reported a domestic violence charge to the NICS database. The background- checks effort has been more successful than a Democratic-led push to respond to the October mass shooting in Las Vegas with a ban on ""bump stocks"" - an add-on device that turns a semiautomatic weapon into an illegal, automatic one. The bump-stocks matter is largely on hold in Congress, as GOP lawmakers, under NRA pressure, defer to a new Justice Department effort launched Tuesday to ""clarify whether certain bump stock devices fall within that definition"" of ""machine gun,"" a prohibited category of firearm. The Senate Judiciary Committee is nonetheless expected to discuss bump stocks at a hearing Wednesday that is also slated as the official start to the Senate's debate about improving NICS reporting. Gun-control advocates urging along the Senate process are excoriating House Republicans for what they see as complicating the debate. ""Instead of doing what's right, Congress is attempting to do what the gun lobby wants them to do, which is to pass this concealed-carry reciprocity law,"" said Mark Kelly, who co-founded the gun-control group Giffords with his wife, former Democratic congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who left the House after becoming a victim of gun violence in her home state of Arizona. Kelly said that he and Giffords are ""both offended and outraged that Republicans are trying to tie this bad piece of legislation to something that's trying to do something positive."" Giffords and the liberal-leaning litigation and policy organization Democracy Forward filed a lawsuit Monday against the Justice Department, alleging that the agency has failed to turn over documents showing how the gun lobby is attempting to influence federal firearms policy, including by pushing concealed-carry reciprocity after the Las Vegas shooting. The Justice Department declined to comment on the lawsuit. Lawrence Keane, senior vice president and general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, said the decision about how to package these bills has always been up to lawmakers. ""We support both bills, and if they get combined we'll support the combined bill - and if they're not combined we'll support both bills separately,"" Keane said. ""They're both good bills and they both should pass, and Americans should be allowed to exercise their constitutional right."" NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker applauded the House for being ""on the eve of voting for the biggest expansion of self-defense rights in modern American history."" But some Democrats in the Senate are shrugging off the House's maneuver as an empty threat - both because of Cornyn's resistance and because by their count, only a handful of Senate Democrats might possibly vote for concealed-carry legislation. It would take the support of eight Democrats, in addition to every Senate Republican, to clear the 60-vote procedural hurdles a gun bill would face. ""I don't think it changes anybody's vote,"" said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a lead author of the background-checks bill. ""I don't think the votes are there in the Senate to pass concealed carry.""

http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/After-Texas-church-massacre-Congress-scrutinizes-12339071.php,"High school yearbook photo of Texas church shooter, Devin Kelley. WASHINGTON – The massacre of more than two dozen churchgoers in the small central Texas town of Sutherland Springs on Sunday has sparked calls in Congress for a fresh look at the government background check system that allowed the 26-year-old gunman – a court-martialed airman – to get the weapons he used in the mass shooting. Lawmakers expressed frustration Tuesday that Devin Patrick Kelley, 26, could have legally possessed the semiautomatic rifle used to kill 26 men, women and children after his 2014 court-martial on two charges of domestic assault against his wife and step-son. New reports on Tuesday also indicated Kelley had escaped from a mental health facility in New Mexico in 2012. The Air Force has launched an internal review into its reporting procedures and why the service failed to provide that information to the FBI division that does background checks on prospective gun buyers at federally-licensed gun stores. Texas U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, also announced plans to introduce legislation tightening reportedly loose and confusing reporting requirements for federal agencies, including the military, to promptly upload already-required criminal conviction records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). ""This critically important information from the suspect's criminal history was not uploaded into the relevant background check databases, even though a federal law clearly requires that it be done,"" Cornyn said. ""Because there was no record of it, he was able to lie his way into getting these firearms. This is very clearly a problem, and the Air Force has now admitted that Kelley's conviction should have barred him from ever purchasing or possessing firearms."" House Speaker Paul Ryan also questioned how the gunman, allegedly motivated by a domestic altercation, was able to ""slip through the cracks"" to obtain a gun after he was convicted of domestic abuse. ""This man shouldn't have gotten a gun. You know why? Because he was a domestic abuser,"" the Wisconsin Republican said at a press conference with GOP leaders. ""This speaks to making sure we actually enforce our laws that we have on the books,"" he said.Texas U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, echoing the arguments of gun-rights advocates, said in a television interview that had federal law been enforced, the worst mass shooting in Texas history could have been prevented. ""This should've been stopped beforehand. Under federal law, it was illegal for this individual to purchase a firearm,"" Cruz said. ""He had a conviction for a crime that is punishable by more than a year in prison and he had a conviction for multiple domestic violence crimes. Both of those, it's already ineligible."" Taking a political turn, Cruz also blamed it on the Obama administration. ""Several things happened,"" he said. ""Number one, the Air Force, the Obama Administration, didn't report those convictions to the NICS database. That's an endemic problem. It's a problem with the federal government, it's a problem with the states. And so, when he went in to buy the guns, they ran the background check, and they didn't find it because it wasn't in the database."" Gun control advocates, meanwhile, have argued that the current background check system doesn't go far enough, since it exempts private sales and sales at gun shows where military-style armaments like the assault rifle used by Kelley are easily obtained under the federal radar. Kelley, however, passed a routine background check in a San Antonio gun store, despite having served a 12-month sentence for domestic assault and being released from the Air Force on a bad-conduct charge. But while the Air Force acknowledged that Kelley should have been prohibited from buying or possessing firearms, some gun experts say there has been some confusion about what procedures were followed and how federal law might have applied. Texas Department of Public Safety and other state officials said Monday that Kelley was denied a state handgun license, even though he would not have needed one to possess the Ruger AR-556 semi-automatic assault rifle reportedly used in the shooting. That was among four guns he purchased -- two in Colorado, two in Texas -- between 2014 and 2017, officials confirmed. The two in Texas were purchased at Academy Sports and Outdoors stores in San Antonio after cleared the required pre-purchase background check, officials and the company confirmed. Texas law enforcement officials said the discrepancy between the federal and state background checks could be due to the use of several overlapping but separate databases: the NICS system established by the FBI in 1998 to process background checks; and the National Crime Information Center database, and the Interstate Identification Index. Cornyn, like Cruz, suggested that the participation of some state and federal agencies in updating records is often lacking. ""According to the Department of Justice, the number of these records that are actually uploaded is staggeringly low,"" Cornyn said. ""That is unacceptable and it must change."" FBI officials acknowledged that the oversight in Kelley's case is not unique. ""Unfortunately, this has happened in the past from a number of agencies,"" said Christopher Combs, the special agent in charge of the FBI's San Antonio division. ""Nothing is perfect."" Despite Kelley's criminal record, the Air Force listed no active records in the NICS system as of last December 31 for dishonorable discharge or domestic violence, according to a new FBI report of active NICS records. In all the Department of Defense listed just one domestic violence conviction case on file.Altogether, the FBI report listed 273,733 records arising in Texas involving persons prohibited from receiving firearms under state or federal law, out of nearly 16 million total records in the NICS system. Until now, one of the most glaring breakdowns in the national background check system occurred in the leadup to the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, in which a senior with a history of mental illness shot and killed 32 people and wounded 17 others. The shooter, Seung-Hui Cho, had been declared mentally ill by a state judge, but because he was not institutionalized he was not reported to NICS and was allowed to purchase guns. A law closing the loophole was signed a year later by President George W. Bush. Some analysts suggest that Kelley might not have been caught up in the national background check system because of a different loophole: Possible confusion over the ""bad conduct"" charge on which he was discharged from the Air Force. Federal law bars gun sales to ex-service members discharged under ""dishonorable conditions."" The federal Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) form Kelley would have had to complete when he purchased his guns defines dishonorable conditions as any separation ""resulting from a dishonorable discharge or dismissal adjudged by a General Court-Martial.""  It specifically excludes ""any other discharge or separation from the Armed Forces."" David Chipman, a former ATF agent and advisor to the gun-control group Americans for Responsible Solution, said that Kelley's ""bad conduct"" discharge might not have been seen as meeting the ""dishonorable discharge"" threshold on federal forms. ""Typically in my experience you needed to be dishonorably discharged to be prohibited from purchasing or owning a gun,"" Chipman said. ""Not any other kind of discharge."" In addition, the ATF guidance for disqualification due to a domestic violence conviction specifies ""under Federal, State or Tribal law."" Kelley, he noted, was convicted in a military court, possibly creating an unintended technical exemption. Together with the distinction between ""dishonorable discharge"" and ""bad conduct discharge,"" Chipman said, the question about military court jurisdiction may have created a gap in the law.""This may reveal a loophole we did not know existed,"" Chipman said. ""This might be a whole new area we need to look at where there may need to be a legal remedy."" Some analysts say that even if Kelley's record of domestic assault charges did not technically block him from possessing guns under federal law, a charge of assault and his year of imprisonment should have. But there is a fine line. Kelley was sentenced to 12 months in confinement. Federal law states that for a person to be automatically ineligible to purchase firearms, they must be under indictment or convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment ""for more than one year."" Other analysts take a more clear cut view. Jared Febbroriello, a Dallas attorney who works with firearms and defense companies, suggested that Kelley's ability to buy firearms more likely resulted from a failure of the background check system than the law. ""Based on the fact that it was a general court-martial, and his discharge under dishonorable conditions, he should have been barred,"" Febbroriello said. ""According to the law, he should not have legally been able to purchase any firearms... based purely on his condition of discharge from the military under dishonorable conditions. There is no loophole."" FBI and ATF officials said that they were still looking into the legal questions, not just in Kelley's case, but to ensure that records in other cases have been reported correctly. ""What I will tell you right now is that in general, if an individual has a dishonorable discharge from the military, they would be prohibited from possessing or purchasing firearms,"" said Fred Milanowski, special agent in charge of Houston's ATF field division, speaking to reporters in Sutherland Springs on Monday. ""In this specific investigation we're early in the investigation,"" he continued. ""We do not have all the documentation yet. So until we can get all the documentation to determine exactly what his discharge was, exactly what his conviction was in the military, we will not have a determination on whether this individual was prohibited from possessing or purchasing firearms.""

http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/26-slaughtered-at-texas-church-12334212.php,"SUTHERLAND SPRINGS - A gunman toting a rifle and wearing a ballistic vest shot and killed at least 26 people during Sunday service at a Baptist church in this tiny town, marking the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history. Two law enforcement sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the continuing investigation, identified the gunman as Devin P. Kelley, 26, of New Braunfels. The Pentagon confirmed Kelley was at one time an Air Force airman, but provided no additional information. Gov. Greg Abbott said Sunday's shooting some 20 miles east of San Antonio was ""worsened by the fact it occurred in a church."" ""There are no words to describe the pure evil that we witnessed in Sutherland Springs,"" Abbott said. Twenty-three bodies were found inside the church; two outside. One more person who was transported to the hospital also died. The dead were still being identified late Sunday, but included a pregnant woman and several children, including the pastor's 14-year-old daughter. The victims ranged in age from 5 to 72. It was unclear whether the bodies remained inside the small church late Sunday. ""We don't know if that number will rise or not,"" Abbott said at a Sunday evening news conference, ""but we know that number is too many."" Twenty more people were hospitalized, some with critical injuries, Martin said. Some of the injured were flown to local hospitals by helicopter as law enforcement SUVs swarmed the two-lane country road outside the church. Texas Department of Public Safety Commander Freeman Martin said the gunman parked at a gas station across the street from the white, wood-framed church about 11:20 a.m., 20 minutes after the scheduled start of the service. Dressed in all black, he approached the church and started shooting from outside before entering the vestibule. As the gunman left the church, he was confronted by a local man with a rifle. The suspect dropped his rifle and tried to flee in his vehicle, but the local man pursued him, Martin said. Worst shootings in U.S. history 58 killed: Oct. 1; Las Vegas 49 killed: June 12, 2016; Orlando, Fla. 32 killed: April 16, 2007; Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Va. 27 killed: Dec. 14, 2012; Newtown, Conn. 26 killed: Nov. 5; Sutherland Springs The gunman later was found dead in his vehicle about 10 miles from the church. ""We don't know if it was a self-inflicted gunshot wound or if he was shot by our local resident who engaged him in gunfire,"" Martin said. Authorities, including the FBI, were still working late Sunday to piece together what may have driven the shooter to target the church. ""If you want to know the motive,"" Martin said at the news conference, ""you are going to leave here disappointed."" The unincorporated community of Sutherland Springs has a single post office and a Dollar General. Once a vaunted tourist destination known as the ""Saratoga of the South,"" Sutherland Springs went into a long decline after a massive flood destroyed its pools and pavilions a century ago. About 400 people live there now, many lower and middle income, who commute to San Antonio for work. ""It's something we all say does not happen in small communities,"" Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said, ""but today we found out it does."" The shooting comes just a month after a gunman in Las Vegas opened fire on a country music event, killing 59, including himself, and wounding more than 200. Scott Holcombe and Sarah Slavin said their parents, Bryan and Karla Holcombe, were among the dead. Sobbing on a curb outside Connally Memorial Medical Center in Floresville, about 15 miles from Sutherland Springs, Scott Holcombe said: ""I'm dumbfounded. This is unimaginable."" He added: ""My father was a good man and he loved to preach. He had a good heart. They knew where they were going. There's peace in that."" Earl Seesen Good, 68, said one of his good friends lost eight relatives in the shooting Sunday morning. The victims span generations, he said, from children to grandchildren to great-grandchildren. ""You just can't get your mind wrapped around something like that,"" he said. Good's daughter is a nurse, and her husband is a paramedic in Seguin. Once news of the shooting broke, Good and his daughter headed to Floresville Memorial Medical Center. Good said he talked to a few survivors, who said the gunman sprayed bullets inside the church and also shot people in the head, execution style. ""Everybody always asks 'Why?' But the reality is that we live in a times where there is no why, other than the person has an issue or grudge or he wants to vent against anyone, anywhere,"" Good said. ""It's a sad state of affairs."" David Brown and his wife, Myris, who work at a Houston pizza parlor, saw a text message from his sister flash on her phone saying, ""Shooting at mom's church."" ""I thought, 'This is a sick joke,'"" she said. The family drove from Houston to Floresville, arriving a little before 4:30 p.m. David Brown said his mother, Farida, 73, had been shot four times in both legs and was at Connally Memorial. Her cell phone is thought to have deflected one bullet. As news of the tragedy spread rapidly across the nation, elected officials expressed their sympathy and support for Sutherland Springs. President Donald Trump issued a statement offering condolences to the victims. ""We cannot put into words the pain and grief we all feel, and we cannot begin to imagine the suffering of those who lost the ones they loved,"" the statement said. ""Our hearts are broken."" U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Democrat who represents part of the area, called the shooting a ""horrific tragedy."" Sutherland Springs, he said, is ""one of those unique communities where everyone knows everyone else and supports each other."" U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, said in a statement that the shooting ""leaves yet another community reeling from the heartache and devastation caused by gun violence."" Congregants from the Cowboy Fellowship church in LaVernia gathered Sunday night to hold a memorial service for those killed just down the road. ""We want to help our members process this because a lot of these people knew people,"" said Pete Pawelek, head pastor at Cowboy Fellowship. ""Some of them had family, and we just want to help them process this …. Everybody here from this area is going to know somebody or know of somebody."" An off-duty police officer and an off-duty state trooper stood guard at the door of the church for the congregation inside. ""You're not supposed to have to worry about being shot at a church,"" Pawelek said. ""Evil knows no bounds and unfortunately it comes into church too."" Four miles away, candles flickered in the gentle breeze of the post office lawn as hundreds of people gathered for another vigil just across the the road from the church. Together they leaned against each other, cried and prayed for the lives extinguished at the church across the street. ""Lord, I ask that you heal our broken hearts,"" Mike Gonzales, who studies theology in San Antonio, said to the people under the waning moon. He and his wife live down the street from the church and have been there several times. ""It's a very small, tight community,"" said Ines Gonzeles as she stroked her young grandson's hair as he leaned against her leg. She knows several people who attend the church just down the street from her house, and said she's sure she'll know some of the victims. ""It's so close to home, right in your backyard."" Three teenage boys drove down from LaVernia for the vigil. ""We're all family,"" said Charlie Sladovnik, 16, wearing a black cowboy hat. ""Everybody here is our people That's how it is down here. We all support each other."" The most recent of the videos that the church posted on YouTube, from Oct. 29, shows parishoners standing amid wooden pews and singing as a little girl in pink plays on the stage near the band. ""From the rising to the setting sun,"" they sang, ""His love endures forever."" ""And by the grace of God, we will carry on.""

https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/nov/09/late-night-tv-hosts-elections-democrats-shooting-texas?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other,"Comics, including Trevor Noah and Samantha Bee, discussed Tuesday’s state elections, where Democrats performed strongly, and the mass shooting in Texas Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.16 BST Late-night hosts on Wednesday discussed the mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, and Tuesday’s state elections, where Democrats performed well in races for governorships and state legislatures. “One year ago today, Donald Trump was elected president,” Stephen Colbert began. “Yesterday, Democrats commemorated this anniversary by kicking Trump’s ass by using his arch-enemy, the popular vote.”  “Let’s start in Helena, Montana, where Wilmot Collins became the first black mayor in Montana’s history,” Colbert continued. “And in New Jersey, Democrat Phil Murphy was elected governor. A sad day for Chris Christie. So, a day for Chris Christie.” “Democrats have their swagger back,” the host said. “Virginia also elected its first transgender state lawmaker, Danica Roem. And in a moment of sweet irony, the man she beat was Bob Marshall, the Republican who introduced Virginia’s bathroom bill. “So soon there will be one bathroom Bob Marshall can’t use,” Colbert quipped. “The one in his office.” Colbert showed Trump’s tweet about Virginia’s Republican contender for governor, Ed Gillespie. Trump said Gillespie, who lost to Democrat Ralph Northam, “did not embrace me or what I stand for” – despite the fact that Gillespie’s campaign aired advertisements about immigrant violence, preserving Confederate monuments, and the NFL anthem protests. “Mr Trump, all of these elections were about you,” Colbert responded. “Significant numbers of voters in each state said Trump was a reason for their vote, with far more voting to oppose you than support you. That’s the problem with making everything about you, sir. It means everything, even losing, is about you. That’s the downside of narcissism.” Samantha Bee of TBS discussed the Republican reaction to the massacre in Sutherland Springs, where 26 people were killed. “And after the week we’ve had, there is nothing more important to me than gun control,” Bee said. “I would love to not talk about gun massacres, but we can’t ignore them. That’s Congress’s job. These savvy politicians have a few different moves to dodge the issue of gun violence.” Bee showed a clip of Trump officials and Republican politicians who said “now is not the time to talk about gun control” – including Kellyanne Conway, who called the conversation “disrespectful to the dead”. “Kellyanne should know, as someone who’s been dead inside for decades,” Bee responded. “How is it not the time? Ninety-three Americans a day die from gun violence. It’s like if a scary clown was killing 93 people per day and Congress was like, it’s not the right time to talk about the clown.” Bee then referred to the “timeless classic” of “thoughts and prayers” offered by politicians in the wake of gun violence. “I’m sorry, but unless you’re praying to the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl and these mass shootings are human sacrifices, your thoughts and prayers are not working. Thoughts and prayers are not a substitute for action, and pretty much all American voters want action on this. “The Republican party has completely bought into the myth that the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. “But that is not fair to ask of our nation’s many good guys. Good guys should be helping people move couches and lending you their Netflix password. They shouldn’t have to risk their lives in a church parking lot to protect the world from a monster.” Finally, Comedy Central’s Trevor Noah addressed the Tuesday elections, seeing them as a wave of karma. Noting Trump’s quick move to dissociate himself from Gillespie, Noah said: “Goddamn, Trump does not play games with how fast he will abandon you. I bet when the US economy crashes, Trump’s gonna be like, ‘What a loser economy, I’ve never even heard of America.’” “As much as Trump wants people to believe Gillespie lost because he didn’t embrace Trump’s worldview, the truth is, Gillespie did everything but grab someone by the pussy. “When you look at the bigger picture, you know who really won big in last night’s elections?” the host asked. “Karma, the spiritual principle that the universe will reward good actions and punish bad ones.” “Incumbents were defeated by the very thing they were being dicks about,” Noah went on, noting that in New Jersey, John Carman was defeated by Ashley Bennett after Carman mocked the Women’s March in January by asking if the protesters would be home in time to cook dinner. And in Montana, a Liberian refugee defeated a candidate who opposed having refugees in his city. “Carman, meet karma,” Noah concluded. “He was worried about women having time to make dinner, and now karma has given him all the time he needs to make his own dinner.”"
http://time.com/5005286/new-york-city-attack-las-vegas/?utm_campaign=time&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_medium=social&xid=time_socialflow_twitter,"The month of October was bookended by two national tragedies: the mass shooting in Las Vegas, which left 59 dead and over 500 injured, and a lone wolf terror attack in New York City, where a 29-year-old male barreled down a popular New York City bike path, killing eight and injuring over a dozen. The cause of the incidents differed. Authorities immediately concluded the attack in New York City was terrorism, while the motives of the Las Vegas shooter are still unknown. The death toll in Las Vegas was also significantly higher. But both of these incidents, which came so close to each other, sparked discussions about policy, the first about gun control and the second about terrorism and immigration, since the suspect was identified as an immigrant from Uzbekistan. President Trump and the White House reacted very differently to both of these incidents, however, declining to weigh in on policy after Las Vegas, and then immediately doing so following the New York City attack. The following is an overview of these separate reactions in the 24 hours after each incident unfolded. Las Vegas: Trump tweeted approximately five hours after the overnight attack: “My warmest condolences and sympathies to the victims and families of the terrible Las Vegas shooting. God bless you!” The White House also told reporters that Trump had been briefed on the attack and the Administration was monitoring the situation closely and offered support to Las Vegas officials and keeping those affected “in our thoughts and prayers.” New York: The White House told reporters Kelly had briefed Trump and that thoughts and prayers are with those affected. Four hours after the attack, the White House sent out an official statement from the President offering support to law enforcement in their investigation and thanking the first responders. But during this time frame, Trump also sends out a series of tweets, in which he called the suspect “a very sick and deranged person,” railed against ISIS being allowed to enter the United States and offered condolences to the victims. At approximately 9:30 p.m., Trump tweeted for a fourth time: “I have just ordered Homeland Security to step up our already Extreme Vetting Program. Being politically correct is fine, but not for this!” Las Vegas: President Trump addressed the nation from the White House the morning after the mass shooting. In a brief speech, he thanked First Responders, called for national unity and directed flags to fly at half-staff in honor of the victims. “Our unity cannot be shattered by evil. Our bonds cannot be broken by violence,” Trump told Americans. “And though we feel such great anger at the senseless murder of our fellow citizens, it is our love that defines us today and always will – forever.” The White House planned a moment of silence for the victims, and Trump subsequently said during his meeting with Thailand’s Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha that he would visit Las Vegas. The White House also said Trump had spoken with Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman and Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo. New York: Trump linked the attack to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, arguing that he was the driving force behind the diversity lottery program, which the Department of Homeland Security said was the program under which the suspect, Sayfullo Saipov, entered the United States in 2010. (While Schumer did support the measure creating this program nearly 30 years ago, he also sought to end it in recent years as part of a bipartisan immigration reform.) Trump tweeted two more times, apparently citing the Fox News morning show “Fox and Friends,” and describing how he wants to replace the lottery system with merit based immigration. “We must get MUCH tougher (and smarter),” he wrote on Twitter. Trump then gave remarks before a Cabinet meeting, where he reiterated these sentiments after offering condolences to the victims of the attacks. “We’re going to as quickly as possible get rid of chain migration and go to a merit-based system,” Trump says. “We have to get much tougher. We have to get much smarter. And we have to get much less politically correct.” Trump also says he would consider sending the suspect to Guantanamo Bay. Las Vegas: White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders choked up during the White House briefing when she recalled stories from Las Vegas. At that point, several Democratic lawmakers had begun issuing calls for more stringent gun control regulations. When asked about the White House’s position on this issue, Sanders said it was not the time to discuss policy and that any suggestions are premature.  “Today is a day for consoling the survivors and mourning those we lost,” she tells reporters. There’s a time and place for a political debate, but now is the time to unite as a country.” New York: As she did with Las Vegas, Sanders opened her daily briefing by offering thoughts and prayers for the victims, highlighting the resilience of New Yorkers and praising the heroic actions of Ryan Nash, the police officer who shot the suspect. But she also quickly dove into policy implications, arguing that this incident showcases the need to heighten security measures for people seeking to enter the United States. “We must vet those seeking entry to the United States thoroughly,” she said. The first question for Sanders was about the discrepancy between the White House’s reluctance to discuss policy after Las Vegas, when gun control was on the table, and its willingness to discuss it after New York City, when immigration is the issue at hand. Sanders denied any change. “This wasn’t about going the political route,” she said. “This is something that, frankly, the President has been talking about for a long time. This isn’t a new policy, this isn’t a new position, this isn’t a new conversation. The President has been talking about extreme vetting and the need for that, for the purpose of protecting this country since he was a candidate.” She also disputed that Trump had blamed Schumer. “The President has not blamed Senator Schumer and doesn’t believe he is responsible for the attack,” she said.

http://www.chron.com/news/politics/texas/article/ADL-criticizes-Abbott-over-Hitler-remark-12342714.php,"AUSTIN -- The Anti-Defamation League on Wednesday strongly criticized a statement by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott about the tragic church shooting in Sutherland Springs, in which he tried to put the massacre in context by saying evil has been present from the early times of the Bible to the Middle Ages to Hitler. In an interview Monday on Outnumbered Overtime on Fox News, Abbott commented that the church shooting, as well as recent terrorist attacks in New York, London and Las Vegas, are ""acts of evil that are taking place. ""Because they are close in time to us right now we think this is something heavy right now, but put this in the context of history,"" Abbott said. ""Look at what happened with Hitler during the horrific events during that era, and Mussolini and go back in time before that to the earlier ages, the Middle Ages, when people committed horrific crimes. And when you go back through the history of the Bible, there was evil that took place from earliest stages of the Bible to post-New Testament, so evil is something that has permeated this world. ""And that force of evil must be combated with the force of good that is offered by God and it is so heartwarming to see the people of this community turn to God, turn to hope, turn to the promise of good overcoming evil."" In a statement on Wednesday, ADL Southwest Regional Director Dayan Gross said Abbott's comment ""diminishing innocent Texans' lives and calling for the tragedy in Sutherland Springs to be viewed in the 'greater context of history' is deeply insulting and irresponsible."" ""We reject the offensive and insensitive remarks made by Governor Abbott contrasting the tragedy in Sutherland Springs to the 'Hitler era' and other horrible events in history,"" the ADL statement said. ""The comparison of the mass shooting in Sutherland Springs to the victims of the Holocaust is deeply offensive and an insult to the memories of those killed in Sutherland Springs as well as the survivors of the church shooting and their families."" ""We are concerned about the many instances of gun violence taking place across the country. Unfortunately, we have witnessed the tragic danger of guns in the hands of determined killers or domestic extremists.  In schools, businesses and houses of worship, individuals have used guns to terrorize communities and local institutions,"" the statement continued. ""ADL firmly believes, and will continue to advocate, that our leaders can reduce the violence in our communities by enacting tough, effective gun violence prevention measures. We call upon our state leaders to address this issue responsibly.""

Asked during a news conference here whether he would entertain “extreme vetting” on guns, Trump appeared irritated by the question and suggested it was not appropriate to talk about “in the heart of South Korea.” He then answered by saying, “If you did what you're suggesting, there would have been no difference three days ago.” Devin Patrick Kelley opened fire with a semiautomatic rifle, killing 26 people in a church. Another man, Stephen Willeford, later grabbed his own gun and exchanged fire with Kelley outside the church. Police found Kelley dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, but authorities called Willeford a “hero"" and said he helped stop Kelley. Trump referred to Willeford as a “brave man” and said, “If he didn't have a gun, instead of having 26 dead, you would have had hundreds more dead.... Not going to help.” Trump was answering questions after a bilateral meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who also participated in the news conference. Reporter Ali Vitali of NBC News followed up by asking Trump if he would consider any other gun control measure. “You look at the city with the strongest gun laws in our nation, is Chicago,” Trump replied. “And Chicago is a disaster. It's a total disaster.... If this man didn't have a gun or rifle, you'd be talking about a much worse situation in the great state of Texas.” Read more: Trump says Texas shooting is a problem of mental health, not guns Trump asserts ‘a lot of progress’ on North Korea, urges ‘deal’ to resolve standoff with United States Trump expresses ‘great confidence’ in Saudi regime accused of political purge The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/arts/~3/1jaLwRJNK3k/ct-met-stop-bleeding-training-20171018-story.html,"Responding to a 911 call for a gunshot victim, Chicago police Officer David Watson followed a trail of blood into an apartment and found a teenager with blood streaming from a leg wound. Using training he received as a Marine, Watson took the belt from the young man’s pants and wrapped it around his thigh. The officer placed a stick under the belt to tighten it by twisting, and his partner helped stem the blood by pressing down on the wound until paramedics arrived. Doctors said that if Watson and his partner, Paul Moreno, hadn’t taken those steps after the October 2016 shooting, the teen probably would not have survived. Medical experts say anyone can employ a few basic techniques to achieve the same results when confronted with a life-and-death scenario. And a public service campaign called “Stop the Bleed” aims to do just that: teach bystanders to save someone’s life by learning basic blood-stemming techniques. Stop the Bleed is a national effort established by the White House in 2015 as one response to the Sandy Hook mass school shooting three years before. It aims to arm civilians with skills and bleeding control kits to provide crucial aid in an emergency until medical professionals can take over. And each time there is a mass shooting or other violent event — like the massacre of more than 25 people at a Texas church on Sunday and the Oct. 1 shooting in Las Vegas that has claimed nearly 60 lives — the campaign takes on greater urgency. In Chicago, more than 3,000 people have been shot this year, and the victim of a gunshot wound can bleed to death in only five minutes. Bystanders are on the scene before first responders, and experts say bleeding remains one of the leading preventable causes of death for such victims. While street crime remains a common cause of severe injury, it is lessons learned from battlefield medicine that are the basis for training to stop blood loss. The military use of tourniquets in Iraq and Afghanistan saved an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 lives, according to the Journal of Trauma. Now, experts are hoping to translate that success into a civilian setting, and they have a precedent for such a program. Thanks in large part to American Heart Association classes, more than 12 million people each year learn how to keep blood flowing through cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR. Yet few nonprofessionals train in how to stop blood loss. In the past two years, the American College of Surgeons, the primary group coordinating Stop the Bleed classes, has trained 165 people to be bleeding control instructors. They, in turn, have held more than 80 courses for more than 900 students, the group reports. So far, only a few classes are offered each month by hospitals in the Chicago area, but sponsors like the Cook County Trauma and Burn Unit are hoping to ramp that up as people become more aware. Audrey Robinson, a nurse practitioner for the county, began teaching classes on bleeding control there this summer. She first taught surgeons so they could teach other students. She then provided the training to social workers at Stroger Hospital and is planning a free class each month for the general public. While medical professionals have expertise in human anatomy, Robinson said anyone can be trained to recognize severe bleeding and try to stop it. In case of a bleeding emergency, here are the main steps to follow, as described at bleedingcontrol.org: • Get yourself and the victim to a safe place, call 911, and assess the seriousness of the situation. • If blood from a wound is spurting, soaking clothing or pooling, the injury could be life-threatening. • Caregivers should first figure out the origin of the bleeding, then cover the wound or, if it’s large, stuff it with gauze, bandages or clean cloth, such as a T-shirt. • Apply pressure to the wound as hard as you can with both hands to keep blood from flowing out until help arrives. • If that doesn’t work, and the wound is in an arm or a leg, the next step is to make a tourniquet, using virtually anything that can be wrapped around a limb, such as a piece of clothing. It should be placed above the wound, or closer to the torso, and tightened until the bleeding stops. • A short stick called a windlass can then be inserted under the tourniquet next to the knot and used to tighten the tourniquet more if necessary. It should be tight enough to be uncomfortable. If the bleeding continues, a second tourniquet can be added. These are the same kind of techniques paramedics use almost every day to save lives, Robinson said. Besides in regard to mass casualty events, these skills are also valuable for accidents that can occur at home, work or on the road. Officials say that keeping a first-aid kit with a tourniquet and blood-clotting gauze at home should be as routine as having a smoke detector. Cook County sheriff’s deputies are among dozens of big-city departments that already carry tourniquets and get bleeding control training. The Chicago Police Foundation also is working to provide first-aid kits, including tourniquets, to Chicago police officers who undergo special training.  Yet not all medical authorities have full confidence in letting civilians cut off blood flow.  The Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, in Scotland, released a position statement in July stating that tourniquets “must be used correctly or not at all,” warning of possible circulatory complications or even increased bleeding if used incorrectly.  The statement said it “could be argued that in a civilian setting,” the need to use a tourniquet is rare and that “most bleeds can be controlled with direct pressure successfully.” But it said there “remains a place for tourniquets” in cases of shootings, stabbings, industrial accidents or where a serious flesh wound occurs in a remote location.  Officials with the American College of Surgeons say they’re confident that properly trained civilians can be effective, citing real-life examples.  Dr. Kevin Chow, who has taught the Stop the Bleed course at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said someone used a ripped T-shirt, an apple and a pencil to make a tourniquet to save another person’s life. In a different case, two soccer players collided, leaving a large gash in one player’s leg. A friend packed the wound with a clean T-shirt to stop the bleeding until they could get to a hospital. Hospital workers themselves often apply direct pressure to stop sudden bleeding until they can get in an operating room. The long-term goal of the program is to hold classes at police stations, churches, community centers, offices and schools, and to make bleeding control kits as common as defibrillators in public places.  “A high school student can learn the same techniques I would use to hold pressure, pack a wound or apply a tourniquet,” Chow said. “These are skills that we are trying to get into everyone's hands so that it becomes common knowledge. … We tell people that they can make a huge difference and be the reason someone lives.”  Dr. James Doherty, trauma surgery director at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, and education director for the College of Surgeons, taught the class to two Boy Scout troops, using an aquarium pump to simulate blood flow in a fake leg Halloween prop.  Since medical prosthetic models are expensive, Doherty is working in his basement to build his own models made of pool flotation noodles with a wooden rod inserted to simulate the bone, just to make lessons more available.  “This is a lifesaving maneuver,” he tells students. “Don’t be afraid to do it. The potential benefit far outweighs any harm.”  rmccoppin@chicagotribune.com Twitter @Robert McCoppin RELATED: CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"
http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/breakingnews/~3/c7mfEpgKvV4/ct-edit-texas-church-shooting-20171106-story.html,"Mass killings like the one at a South Texas church are acts of extreme violence that defy rational explanation and simple solution. They raise demands for specific steps to be taken to ban horrors that are as indiscriminate as they are depraved. That doesn’t make this a time to mourn and shrug. America needs to deal with its propensity for gun violence. Here was another reminder. Tens of thousands of churches across America held worship services Sunday, but it was the First Baptist Church in tiny Sutherland Springs that came under surprise attack by a heavily armed, disgraced Air Force veteran. The 26-year-old man, wearing a ballistic vest and skull face mask, murdered 26 members of the congregation, including children. The shooter was found dead in his vehicle after being chased by two heroic civilians in a truck. America has endured so many mass shootings that people across the country were poised immediately to add the Texas incident to the raging debate over gun rights vs. gun control. It’s only been a month since Las Vegas, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Second Amendment supporters believe gun ownership is a right and guns protect. The adherents probably heard everything they needed in the incredible early news accounts from Sutherland Springs to justify their position: A church neighbor rushed to the scene with a rifle to engage the shooter, potentially saving lives. The neighbor flagged down a passing driver and they bravely took off after the gunman at 95 mph.. Gun control advocates think the country is less safe with a proliferation of guns: Assault rifles, concealed carry permits and permissive laws for firearms and ammunition contribute to the American disease of gun violence. They believe stricter controls would reduce mass shootings and carnage in Chicago and other cities. Does either side’s argument gain sway after Sutherland Springs? We’ll see. The Texas rampage apparently grew out of a demonic domestic dispute: The killer had been court-martialed and sentenced to military prison for assaulting his spouse and child. He received a bad-conduct discharge. He was feuding with his former in-laws and may have targeted the Sutherland Springs church because they attended there. The shooter was armed with a semi-automatic rifle and several handguns. It wasn’t clear Monday how he obtained his weapons, but the Air Force said it had failed to notify federal authorities of his conviction, which would have prevented him from purchasing firearms. The Air Force said it would investigate. The Texas killings were incomprehensible, and the circumstances were unique. But it’s not tempting fate to anticipate more mass shootings. There will be more. That requires a response. The country can’t accept mass carnage at churches, concerts, schools, workplaces and elsewhere as a fact of life. What to do? Because the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2008 that the Second Amendment guarantees individuals the right to own guns, bans on specific weapons or other strict measures are not on the horizon. But there are steps Congress can take to reduce the opportunities for armed villains to kill. Among them: Nor is Springfield on the case. In late October, an effort to ban bump stocks and comparable devices died in the Illinois General Assembly. Each mass shooting in America is its own terrible story that can’t be undone. The responsible perspective is to use the shock of the moment to take actions that will save lives in the future. CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"

              since In the wake of Sunday's mass shooting at a Texas church that left 26 people dead, many conservatives are arguing that the way to stop similar attacks is by encouraging law-abiding individuals to arm themselves. Pastor Robert Jeffress, an evangelical preacher at a Dallas megachurch and faith adviser to President Donald Trump, told ""Fox & Friends"" on Monday morning that a shooter wouldn't get more than one or two shots off in his church before being stopped by an armed member. ""I'd say a quarter to a half of our members are concealed carry, they have guns and I don't think there's anything wrong with that,"" Jeffress said. ""They bring them into the church with them."" ""That probably makes you feel safer,"" ""Fox & Friends"" co-host Ainsley Earhardt interjected. ""I think it does and I think, look, if somebody tries that in our church, they might get one shot off or two shots off, and that's the last thing they'll ever do in this life,"" Jeffress said. Co-host Brian Kilmeade added that mass shooters might not target a church or other gathering where attendants are known to carry weapons. ""Most of these guys are cowards, they don't like when people shoot back, they like to hit defenseless people, and that won't be the case anymore,"" Kilmeade argued. The Fox morning show hosts have long promoted the argument that, as National Rifle Association leader Wayne LaPierre puts it, ""the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun."" Trump promoted the same theory in his response to Sunday's shooting, which he said had nothing to do with a lack of gun control, noting that two Sutherland Springs locals pursued and shot at the gunman after he left the First Baptist Church. ""We have a lot of mental health problems in our country, as do other countries, but this isn't a 'guns' situation,"" the president told reporters during a Sunday press conference in Japan. ""I mean we could go into it, but it's a little bit soon to go into it, but fortunately, somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction, it would have been as bad as it was, it would have been much worse."" In 2012, the gunman, Devin Patrick Kelley, was convicted of assaulting his wife and cracking his infant son's skull and was dismissed from the Air Force for bad conduct. It is unclear whether Kelley's criminal record would have legally prevented him from purchasing a weapon. Watch the clip below: For you For you"
http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Church-shooter-threatened-military-superiors-had-12339953.php,"SUTHERLAND SPRINGS - The gunman who killed 26 churchgoers Sunday made death threats against his military superiors, smuggled weapons onto his New Mexico Air Force Base and was admitted to a mental health facility with what were described as ""mental disorders."" The details were included in a report filed with the El Paso Police Department by officers who detained Devin Patrick Kelley at a bus station in 2012 after he escaped from the mental health facility where he was getting treatment. He was described as ""a danger to himself and others as he had already been caught sneaking firearms onto Holloman Air Force Base,"" and was believed to be ""attempting to carry out death threats that (he) had made on his military chain of command,"" according to the June 13, 2012, report. He did not resist arrest at the El Paso bus station and was turned over to the Sunland Police Department in New Mexico, according to the report. The escape came just a few months after Kelley was court-martialed for domestic violence in a case that left his infant stepson with a fractured skull. But the conviction was not reported to FBI criminal databases, where it likely would have stopped him from buying weapons later used at the First Baptist Church in this rural community southeast of San Antonio. The FBI reported no information on file about Kelley that would have stopped him from purchasing the Ruger AR-556 and several handguns used in what is the worst mass shooting in recent Texas history. The reporting oversight also raises questions about what other cases may have gone unreported by the U.S. Department of Defense. The agency had only a single domestic violence conviction listed on a national FBI database published at the end of 2016. Along with that single misdemeanor, an FBI report of active records on the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, from December 2016 shows the military service branches and the Pentagon had just a handful of ""adjudicated mental health"" reports, one felony, and 10,958 dishonorable discharges. The end-of-year report did not list any records at all from the Department of Defense regarding soldiers, sailors, airmen or Marines barred from buying guns because of domestic violence restraining orders. Review supported The massacre in Sutherland Springs sparked calls in Congress on Tuesday for a fresh look at the government background check system as lawmakers expressed frustration that Kelley was allowed to buy the weapons. The U.S. Air Force acknowledged Monday that investigators from the Holloman Air Force Base Office of Special Investigations had not entered Kelley's domestic violence offense into the NICS database, and launched an internal review into its reporting procedures. Texas U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, also announced plans to introduce legislation tightening reportedly loose and confusing reporting requirements for federal agencies, including the military, to promptly upload already-required criminal conviction records to the NICS. Kelley killed 26 worshipers in the midst of what investigators said was a ""domestic dispute"" with his mother-in-law, who attended the church but was not there Sunday. Twenty other people were injured, and about half remained hospitalized Tuesday, including at least one child. Kelley was shot twice by a church neighbor as he tried to leave the scene and eventually killed himself with a single gunshot after a high-speed chase. Investigators confirmed that Kelley passed a federal background check despite his military conviction and was allowed to buy four firearms before his shooting rampage. Kelley joined the U.S. Air Force in 2009, and pleaded guilty in 2012 to assaulting his wife and the young child, earning a demotion and sentence of one year of confinement. Procedure explained FBI Spokesman Steve Fischer said in an email Tuesday that the Department of Defense - which has 1.3 million employees - regularly sends information about dishonorable discharges to NICS indices but did not say whether they send information about domestic violence. He said NICS examiners check three databases: the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), the Interstate Identification Index (III), and the NICS Indices. ""The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) contained no information that would have prohibited Devin Patrick Kelley from purchasing a firearm,"" Fischer wrote. ""Those domestic violence convictions would have prohibited Kelley from making firearm purchases, but the information was never received for use in any of the three databases."" Fischer said the Department of Defense submits all dishonorable discharges to the NICS Indices monthly for the Air Force, Army, Navy and Marines. As of Oct. 31, there were 11,189 dishonorable discharge entries made by the Department of Defense. As of Nov. 6, there are 2,248 dishonorable discharge entries and one mental health entry from the Air Force within the NICS Indices. Even if the records were properly entered into one of the three databases used to perform background checks, however, it's not guaranteed that Kelley would have been stopped before purchasing a weapon. A 2016 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office examined domestic violence-related NICS checks from 2006 to 2015. The GAO reviewed 59,000 cases involving domestic violence convictions and 30,000 involving protective orders, and found more than 6,700 instances where purchasers still walked away with firearms. Calls for action Cornyn said Tuesday that the shooting raises concerns about the reporting process. ""This critically important information from the suspect's criminal history was not uploaded into the relevant background check databases, even though a federal law clearly requires that it be done,"" Cornyn said. ""Because there was no record of it, he was able to lie his way into getting these firearms. This is very clearly a problem, and the Air Force has now admitted that Kelley's conviction should have barred him from ever purchasing or possessing firearms."" Texas U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, echoing the arguments of gun-rights advocates, said in a television interview that had federal law been enforced, the shooting perhaps could have been prevented. ""This should've been stopped beforehand,"" Cruz said. Taking a political turn, Cruz also blamed the Obama administration. ""Several things happened,"" he said. ""Number one, the Air Force, the Obama Administration, didn't report those convictions to the NICS database. That's an endemic problem. It's a problem with the federal government, it's a problem with the states."" Gun control advocates, meanwhile, have argued that the current background check system doesn't go far enough, since it exempts private sales and sales at gun shows where military-style armaments like the assault rifle used by Kelley are easily obtained under the federal radar.

President Trump at work. El Universal, Sept. 30, 2017. Angel Boligán, Cuba/Mexico Boligán literally grew up amid cartoons and satire. His hometown of San Antonio de los Baños, outside of Havana, is known as Cuba’s humor capital. “In 1917, my hometown held the first exhibition about cartoons and about drawing ever in Cuba.” Over the years San Antonio de los Baños has become a center for visual arts. It hosts Cuba's Museum of Humor, the first of its kind in Latin America, and since 1979 has hosted a biennial Festival of Humor. Cuba also has a long tradition of cartoons and satire. ""Cartoons are considered art, not just as drawing. It’s part of the arts in Cuba,"" says Boligán. ""It's one of the reasons that me and my colleagues don't see ourselves as journalists. We see ourselves as artists, graphic artists. We give something more to journalism. It’s complementary, drawing as an art, and journalism.”  Never again. Drawn after the Las Vegas slaughter by a gunman, the worst mass shooting in modern American history. El Universal, Oct. 8, 2017. Angel Boligán, Cuba/Mexico Boligán soaked up all that his hometown had to offer. And by the time he entered art school in Havana in the mid-1980s, Cuba was smack in the middle of what some have dubbed a Cuban renaissance, a 20-year period of experimentation among artists now considered a movement, the New Cuban Art. Rachel Weiss has written a book on the New Cuban Art, and says the artists on the vanguard during this period were literal products of the Cuban Revolution. They were all born around 1959. ""These were not counter-revolutionaries. These were not people who wanted Fidel [Castro] to go away. They considered themselves to be authentically revolutionary and they saw themselves as artists, an important part of that process."" Some of them were satirists, cartoonists, and multimedia artists who worked for a revolution-approved Cuban humor magazine called Dedeté, a play on the banned pesticide, DDT, that had been used in the US. And they pushed satire into areas it hadn't gone before by creating art that reflected Cuban reality instead of the Cuban dream. Their work touched on issues like scarcities, corruption and nepotism, and they dared to question whether the US embargo was really to blame for everything.  Politicians deceive us over and over again. El Universal, May 6, 2017 Angel Boligán, Cuba/Mexico ""It's inherently Cuban to talk back to power,"" Weiss says. “It’s important to understand that in the Cuban context, humor is not considered to be a lower form of expression. It’s a really important cultural form.”  Courtesy of Angel Boligán ""I think that maybe we wanted to remove the headaches of the head with humor,"" he says. And raising questions about the world is Boligán in a nutshell. In that way, his approach is different from most political cartoonists, who typically focus on the news of the day. ""I think style comes not just in the way you draw, but also in the topics you choose, and the metaphors you use. I always try to make my cartoons universal assuming that the whole world will see them.""  Selfie with an extraterrestrial. El Universal, Mexico. Angel Boligán, Cuba/Mexico Boligán was in his early 20s and just getting his career going when Cuba’s economy collapsed after the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991. Energy supplies dried up and some of the publications that Boligán worked for stopped printing. A lot of Cubans were growing their own food. During the early 1990s, many Cubans, including many artists, left the island. What’s interesting about Boligán, however, is that he wasn’t looking to leave. It was almost an accident that he did.  Metaphorical influences are already at play in this cartoon by Angel Boligán, drawn in 1991. He left Cuba for Mexico in 1992. Angel Boligán ""I traveled to Mexico in 1992. I was invited to take part in an exhibition at the Museum of Cartoon Art in Mexico. I never intended to stay and live in Mexico. But on the same day that I arrived in Mexico, I got an offer from El Universal — one of Mexico's biggest daily newspapers, and it was where, in my opinion, the best Mexican cartoonists work."" Boligán took the job and the move to Mexico changed everything for him. He went from publishing one cartoon a month in Cuba to having a whole range of outlets for his work in Mexico, including a major daily newspaper. He also found himself part of a larger cartoonist community and started exploring new ideas like love, consumerism and our obsession with technology.  Love and the generations. El Universal, Mexico. Angel Boligán, Cuba/Mexico ""In Mexico, I did find the space and the freedom to tackle subjects that were a lot harder to talk about in Cuba,"" including a no-go zone for anyone in Cuba: Fidel Castro. In 1998, when John Paul II became the first pope to visit communist Cuba, Boligán, now in Mexico, did what he knew his cartoonist colleagues back home couldn’t. He drew about it. His cartoon showed Castro cleaning out the cobwebs of churches in advance of the pope’s visit. ""My friends in Cuba could draw about it but their cartoons wouldn’t be published. I’m not a religious person but I respect those who are,"" he says.  Drawn during Pope Benedict's visit to Cuba in 2012. He was the second pope to visit communist Cuba. Angel Boligán, Cuba/Mexico These days Boligán is in high demand. Besides his day job with El Universal in Mexico, he exhibits his work internationally and has won countless awards. And he feels slightly uncomfortable that his being based in Mexico and having more freedom to distribute his work means he gets more attention than his cartoonist friends back in Cuba.  Angel Boligán, center, flanked by two fellow cartoonist friends from Cuba: Osmani Simanca, left, who now lives in Brazil and Ares, right, who lives in Havana. Carol Hills But he remains close to Cuba and close to his cartoonist friends who still live on the island. My enduring image of Boligán is goofing around with a few of them at an international cartoon festival in France, where I caught up with him. By the way, he won first prize.  The Emigrant.

http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/texas/article/Local-man-who-helped-stopped-church-shooter-says-12335247.php,"Johnnie Langendorff, who pursued the suspect of the Sutherland Springs First Baptist Church church shooting that killed at least 25 people, gets a kiss Sunday, Nov. 5, 2017 as he is picked up from the scene where the suspect died near the intersection of FM 539 and Sandy Elm Road in Guadalupe County. Officials have not said how the suspect died. 2. Authorities have seized the shooter's phone, but they can't get into it. On Tuesday, the FBI confirmed they have possession of Devin Kelley's phone. However, they don't know what's on the phone yet because it is encrypted. The phone has been sent to Quantico, Virgina, where investigators are trying to gain access to the phone. They also declined to say specify the type of phone. (Photo by Hitoshi Yamada/NurPhoto via Getty Images) 3. Victims' families will receive compensation funds. District Attorney Audrey Louis said she is working diligently to quickly release compensation funds to victims' families to ease the burden of funeral costs. She said families would receive roughly $6,500 per victim. Louis also said they are working with funeral homes and partnered with one business that will donate caskets for the funerals. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) Devin Patrick Kelley, 26, lived about 30 miles north of Sutherland Springs in an isolated ranching area north of New Braunfels. Comal County deputies guarded his secluded home Sunday night. It's unclear whether a search of his home turned up any information pertaining to the shooting. Kelley was caught on gas station surveillance cameras in the all-black garb, authorities confirmed in their Sunday evening news conference. Authorities also confirmed Kelley wore a black mask with a white skull on it during the shooting and a ballistic vest. After Kelley walked out of the church, a local resident identified as Stephen Willeford, shot at Kelley. Investigators determined Willeford shot Kelley twice before he fled in a vehicle. Kelley's vehicle eventually crashed in Guadalupe County. The Wilson County sheriff told reporters Monday he believes Kelley, who was found dead in the vehicle, shot himself. Before the shooting, Kelley allegedly called his father and told him he wasn't going to make it out alive. After the shooting, friends and relatives of the victims relayed stories of children, teenagers, parents and grandparents gunned down at a vigil held Sunday night. The small town has fewer than 1,000 residents, with many of them saying they all knew each other. 8. One family suffered significant losses. Pastor Frank Pomeroy and his wife Sherri, who were not in town that weekend, lost their 14-year-old daughter to the shooting on Sunday. One other family reportedly lost 8 members to the shooting. Kelley joined the Air Force in 2009 until 2012, when he received a bad conduct discharge in after a domestic violence conviction. The conviction should have prevented him from purchasing firearms, but the Air Force released a statement Tuesday admitting the conviction was not entered in the relevant databases. Though the motive is still unclear, Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said Kelley's ex-in-laws attended church there, though they were not present for Sunday's service. Authorities said Kelley had a domestic dispute going on, and had sent the mother-in-law threatening text messages before the shooting occurred. 11. Kelley legally purchased four firearms. According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Kelley legally purchased four firearms. Kelley purchased one gun a year from 2014-2017, two of which were obtained in Colorado and two of which were obtained in Texas. However, Kelley did not have a license-to-carry. (Jay Janner/Austin American-Statesman via AP) 12. Kelley was employed as a security guard at an RV park. Kelley worked at the resort just over a month before not reporting to work Sunday, according to Claudia Varjabedian, manager of The Summit Vacation and RV Resort. She said Kelley did not go into work Saturday, complaining of a headache and did not show up for his Sunday shift. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip) 13. Kelley's work history. Before working at the RV park, Kelley worked as a security guard at Schlitterbahn New Braunfels. He also spent time at a New Braunfels H-E-B's seafood department and once taught a bible course in Kingsville. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) See images from the mass shooting that claimed 26 lives at First Baptist Church on Nov. 5, 2017.

He said he engaged in a high speed chase to catch the shooter, driving around 95 miles an hour until the shooter veered off the road a crashed into a ditch. Langendorff said the chase started after a man who exchanged fire with the shooter approached his car and said they needed to catch him. Langendorff said he did not have a gun.

She realizes it may seem paranoid, sitting in a restaurant thinking about things like that. But her sons, both grown now, get it. Bad things happen. Evil exists. Better to be prepared. Hupp knows. In 1991, she was eating lunch in a Luby's cafeteria when a gunman drove a blue Ford pickup through the restaurant's front window, got out and started shooting. He killed 23 people, including Hupp's mother and father, before finally shooting himself. In its time, the massacre in Killeen, Texas, was the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Now it ranks sixth, just behind Sunday's murder of more than two dozen people at Sutherland Springs First Baptist Church outside of San Antonio. What happened inside Luby's is never far from the minds of Hupp and other survivors. And with each mass shooting that follows, they relive their own experiences. ""It brings everything back,"" said 71-year-old Kelley Fitzwater, who saw two women shot in the head that day. She can hardly watch the news this week. ""I watch maybe five or ten minutes, and then I just have to change the channel,"" Fitzwater said. ""Because it brings all those feelings back. It brings back all of the very bad memories for the families that lost loved ones, as well as the survivors."" She and her husband were in the Luby's serving line when George Hennard, 35, of Belton, smashed his truck through the restaurant's façade. When he started shooting, Fitzwater's husband told her to get on the floor. ""Is he here to rob us?"" she recalls asking. ""No,"" she says her husband replied. ""He's here to kill us."" Fitzwater and her husband managed to escape. She and other survivors say talking about what they went through was a key to dealing with it. ""We had group sessions that we went to, where the survivors and those that had lost loved ones, we all came together,"" Fitzwater said. ""Really I found for myself, right after this happened, that the more I talked about it, the better off I was."" Fitzwater said it took her about a year to decide she could move on. ""It was very hard to do,"" she said. ""At first you deal with guilt, as to why you were a survivor and they weren't."" You never forget, she said. ""But you learn to move on. Or it would just drive you crazy."" Hupp, 58, agrees. ""You've got a couple of different ways to handle stuff like this,"" she said. ""You can go crazy, or you believe that things happen for a reason. Believe me, I'm going to be one of the first in line when I die with a list of questions for God."" Those questions boil down to: why do you let terrible things happen? Hupp says she worked through her grief with help from a supportive family. She also wrote a book about her experience, and she became a state legislator who advocated the right to carry concealed weapons. (Just before the Luby's massacre, Hupp had left her own gun in the car.) ""That gave me some outlet for anger, anger both at myself and at the legislature, that I felt had legislated me out of the right to protect myself and my family,"" she said. Hupp says people have asked her if it isn't a bit paranoid to still be checking restaurant exits after all these years. She asks them if they have smoke alarms at home. ""Sometimes houses do burn down, and we know that a smoke alarm can give you a little early warning that might mean the difference between life and death,"" she says. Bobbie Crawford, now 85, was eating with a friend inside Luby's that day. A teacher's aide, she knew several other school district employees who'd come for lunch. Several of them were shot to death. Crawford says her own mental recovery was long and difficult. Like Hupp and Fitzwater, she said talking about how she felt — especially at the group counseling sessions — was essential. ""It really helped to be able to talk to people that understood, and to get it out,"" she said. It was months before she could go into a restaurant again. Then she was eating at a Red Lobster, and a busboy accidently dropped the handle of a carpet sweeper. The sound of it hitting the floor rang out. ""I came unglued,"" Crawford said. ""I just screamed out, it frightened me so bad."" Twenty-six years later, loud noises still get to her. Even thunderstorms. And like Hupp, Fitzwater and others, Crawford said she doesn't sit in a restaurant without checking her surroundings and noticing who's coming in the front door. ""I don't sit by a front window,"" she said. ""And I know where the exits are."" ___ This story has been corrected to show more than two dozen people killed in Sutherland Springs, not more than dozen ___ Information from: The Dallas Morning News, http://www.dallasnews.com This is an AP Member Exchange shared by The Dallas Morning News"

              since Devin Patrick Kelley, the man authorities say killed 26 and injured 20 in the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history, should not have had access to firearms, according to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. Kelley had been denied a license to carry a gun in Texas, Abbott told CNN. ""So how was it that he was able to get a gun? By all the facts that we seem to know, he was not supposed to have access to a gun,"" said Abbott. ""So how did this happen?"" A former airman with the US Air Force, Kelley, received a ""bad conduct"" discharge from the military after charges of assault against his spouse and child led him to be court-martialed. Military members dishonorably discharged cannot legally purchase a gun, but Kelley's bad-conduct discharge falls just short of that mark. It's unclear if Kelley's assault charges constituted domestic violence, but such a conviction could have also legally disqualified him from gun ownership. But even if the assault charges didn't technically go down as domestic violence, assault alone can be treated as a felony, which should preclude gun ownership. And even if the charges didn't go down as felonies, the twin charges carried a maximum sentence of over a year in prison, and therefore should preclude gun ownership. The federal government's firearm transaction record, which buyers must legally fill out, asks about felony convictions. Kelley bought a Ruger AR-556 rifle, used in the attack on the church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in April of last year from an Academy Sports & Outdoors store in San Antonio, a law-enforcement official told CNN. The purchase of the gun took place two years after Kelley had been court-martialed, imprisoned, and discharged from the military. Wearing black tactical-style gear and carrying that rifle, Kelley entered the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs and opened fire on the churchgoers. ""You've got your pews on either side. He just walked down the center aisle, turned around and my understanding was shooting on his way back out,"" said Wilson County Sheriff Joe D. Tackitt Jr., whose territory includes Sutherland Springs. Tackitt added that there was likely ""no way"" for churchgoers to escape after the shooting started. The victims of the shooting range from 5 to 72 years of age. Kelley fled the scene when confronted by armed citizens, whom he then led on a high-speed chase. Authorities found Kelley dead in his car several miles from the scene. Editor's note: An earlier version of this article mistakenly said that Devin Patrick Kelley received a dishonorable discharge from the Air Force, which would have constituted a felony and made it illegal for him to purchase a firearm. He received a ""bad conduct"" discharge. For you For you"

Authorities have given no indication that the shooter was connected to antifa or that there was another gunman. Texas Department of Public Safety Regional Director Freeman Martin says the mass shooting stemmed from a domestic situation and was not racially or religiously motivated.

http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/breakingnews/~3/hxCsgHChGn4/ct-las-vegas-shooting-lawsuits-20171115-story.html,"CHICAGO — Legal action following the mass shooting at a Las Vegas concert is picking up with lawsuits filed Wednesday on behalf of 14 concertgoers, including some who were shot or injured trying to escape and one woman who is so traumatized that she has since mistaken the sound of rain for gunshots. The hotel-casino from where Stephen Paddock fired, concert organizers and the makers and sellers of a bump stock gun accessory that enabled him to fire rapidly are named as defendants. The court filings argue that they all share blame for the worst mass shooting in recent U.S. history. The 14 civil complaints, filed together in state court in Las Vegas, follow at least three others filed since Paddock opened fire Oct. 1 from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds of others. The lawsuit seeks unspecific compensation for both ""physical and mental injuries."" The challenge for mass-shooting lawsuits is clearing a high legal bar to prove someone other than the shooter bears any responsibility. Such litigation typically drags for years and can end with victims and their families receiving little to nothing. One of those suing, Elisha Seng, described in a phone interview haunting images she can't dispel — of bullets thudding around her on the concert grounds and of turning to see a young woman covered in blood after being shot, clutching her throat and falling forward. ""I don't sleep at night and, when I do, I have nightmares,"" said the 46-year-old from Bartlett, Ill., just outside Chicago. Recently, as heavy rain began to fall outside overnight, she jumped up from her bed. ""I thought it was gunshots."" Seng, who wasn't physically injured, returned to work as a sales representative, but said she quickly tires from her lack of sleep. Going to concert or sports halls can prompt flashbacks. She recently attended a Chicago Blackhawks game and found herself nervously calculating the best escape routes should someone open fire. A Chicago law firm helped to prepare the filings, which include several plaintiffs from the Chicago area. Victims named in the suits also include a California man, Anthony Crisci, who was rushed to a hospital with a gunshot wound in a truck crowded with other victims. Among deficiencies at the concert venue were poorly marked exits, Wednesday's filings say. And the hotel, it says, should have had gunfire-location devices that pinpoint where shots are coming from. The 64-year-old Paddock, who killed himself just before his room was stormed, is also named in a bid to seize assets from his estate. Paddock was able to use VIP status conferred on him as a high-stakes gambler to stockpile more than 20 rifles in his hotel suite, including by using exclusive access to a service elevator over days, the filings say. They argue what should have been routine checks of Paddock's bags and his room would have revealed his growing arsenal. The filings name a leading bump stock maker, Texas-based Slide Fire Solutions, as a defendant. A lead attorney, Chicago-based Antonio Romanucci, said it wasn't yet clear which manufacturer, wholesaler or retailer made and sold the specific bump stock that Paddock used, but that the idea was to hold ""the entire supply chain"" responsible. Messages seeking comment from Slide Fire weren't returned. MGM Resorts International, the parent company of Mandalay Bay, called the shooting ""a meticulously planned, evil ... act"" in a statement Wednesday and added that it would respond to any allegations only through ""the appropriate legal channels."" Live Nation, a concert organizer named in the filings, said in a statement it cannot comment on pending litigation, but that the company remains ""heartbroken for the victims."" Bump stocks were originally created ostensibly to make it easier for people with disabilities to shoot. But the filings allege that Slide Fire geared its marketing to regular gun owners who wanted their semi-automatic rifles to mimic fully automatic weapons. Civil cases in mass shootings are becoming increasingly common. Romanucci has also filed a lawsuit on behalf of victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting that killed 49 people last year in Orlando, Fla. It alleges, among other things, that a security firm that once employed gunman Omar Mateen knew Mateen was mentally unstable and had threatened violence, and should have alerted authorities. Mateen was killed in a shootout with police. The 2007 Virginia Tech campus shooting in which Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people illustrated the difficulties posed by such lawsuits. In 2013, the Virginia Supreme Court overturned a jury verdict siding with parents of two victims who claimed the state was negligent. A statement from the state attorney general's office at the time said the reversal showed what it had argued during years of litigation: ""Cho was the lone person responsible for this tragedy."" Cho killed himself after his rampage. Seng said she joined the civil case to force better security at concerts and at hotels. She said she can't fathom how a hotel-casino that devotes so many resources to catching gamblers that cheat didn't notice Paddock bringing in high-powered weapons over a number of days. ""They can catch a person counting cards,"" she said. ""But they can't catch someone carrying bags of guns."" CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"
http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/breakingnews/~3/fo2jQzF2uDg/ct-texas-church-shooting-20171105-story.html,"SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, TEXAS — A man dressed in black tactical-style gear and armed with an assault rifle opened fire inside a church in a small South Texas community on Sunday, killing 26 people and wounding about 20 others in what the governor called the deadliest mass shooting in the state's history. The dead ranged in age from 5 to 72 years old. Authorities didn't identify the attacker during a news conference Sunday night, but two other officials — one a U.S. official and one in law enforcement — identified him as Devin Kelley. They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the investigation. The U.S. official said Kelley lived in a San Antonio suburb and didn't appear to be linked to organized terrorist groups. Investigators were looking at social media posts Kelley made in the days before Sunday's attack, including one that appeared to show an AR-15 semiautomatic weapon. Kelley received a bad-conduct discharge from the Air Force for allegedly assaulting his spouse and child, and was sentenced to 12 months' confinement after a 2012 court-martial. Kelley served in Logistics Readiness at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge, Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said. At the news conference, the attacker was described only as a white man in his 20s who was wearing black tactical gear and a ballistic vest when he pulled into a gas station across from the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio, around 11:20 a.m. The gunman crossed the street and started firing a Ruger AR rifle at the church, said Freeman Martin, a regional director of the Texas Department of Safety, then continued firing after entering the white wood-frame building, where an 11 a.m. service was scheduled. Wilson County Sheriff Joe D. Tackitt Jr., whose territory includes Sutherland Springs, said there was likely ""no way"" for the church congregation to escape once the shooting started. ""You've got your pews on either side. He just walked down the center aisle, turned around and my understanding was shooting on his way back out,"" said Tackitt, who said the shooter also carried a handgun but that he didn't know if it was fired. Tackitt described the scene inside the church as ""terrible."" ""It's unbelievable to see children, men and women, laying there. Defenseless people,"" Tackitt said. ""I guess it was seeing the children that were killed. It's one thing to see an adult, but to see a 5-year-old ..."" As he left, the shooter was confronted by an armed resident who ""grabbed his rifle and engaged that suspect,"" Martin said. A short time later, the suspect was found dead in his vehicle at the county line. Several weapons were found inside the vehicle and Martin said it was unclear if the attacker died of a self-inflicted wound or if he was shot by the resident who confronted him. He said investigators weren't ready to discuss a possible motive. Martin said 23 of the dead were found in the church, two were found outside and one died after being taken to a hospital. The man who confronted Kelley had help from another local resident, Johnnie Langendorff, who told KSAT TV that he was driving past the church as the shooting happened. He didn't identify the armed resident but said the man exchanged gunfire with the gunman, then asked to get in Langendorff's truck and the pair pursued as the gunman drove away. Langendorff says the gunman eventually lost control of his vehicle and crashed. He says the other man walked up to the vehicle with his gun drawn and the suspect did not move. He stayed there for at least five minutes, until police arrived. ""I was strictly just acting on what's the right thing to do,"" Langendorff said. Gov. Greg Abbott called the attack the worst mass shooting in Texas history. ""There are no words to describe the pure evil that we witnessed,"" Abbott said. ""Our hearts are heavy at the anguish in this small town, but in time of tragedy, we see the very best of Texas. May God comfort those who've lost a loved one, and may God heal the hurt in our communities."" Among those killed was the church pastor's 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle Pomeroy. Pastor Frank Pomeroy, and his wife, Sherri, were both out of town when the attack occurred, Sherri Pomeroy wrote in a text message. ""We lost our 14-year-old daughter today and many friends,"" she wrote. ""Neither of us has made it back into town yet to personally see the devastation. I am at the charlotte airport trying to get home as soon as i can."" Federal agents swarmed the small rural community of a few hundred residents, including ATF investigators and the FBI's evidence collection team. Alena Berlanga, a resident of nearby Floresville, known for its annual peanut festival, said everyone knows everyone else in the sparsely populated county. ""Everybody's going to be affected and everybody knows someone who's affected,"" Berlanga said. Church member Nick Uhlig, 34, wasn't at Sunday's service, said his cousin, who was 8 months pregnant, and her in-laws were among those killed. ""We just gathered to bury their grandfather on Thursday,"" he said, shaking his head. President Donald Trump, who was in Japan, called the shooting an ""act of evil"" and said he was monitoring the situation. Later Sunday, two sheriff's vans were parked outside the gate of a cattle fence surrounding the address listed for Kelley on the rural, western outskirts of New Braunfels, north of San Antonio. Ryan Albers, 16, who lives across the road, said he heard intensifying gunfire coming from that direction in recent days. ""It was definitely not just a shotgun or someone hunting,"" Albers said. ""It was someone using automatic weapon fire."" The church has posted videos of its Sunday services on a YouTube channel, raising the possibility that the shooting was captured on video. In a video of its Oct. 8 service, a congregant who spoke and read Scripture pointed to the Oct. 1 Las Vegas shooting a week earlier as evidence of the ""wicked nature"" of man. That shooting left 58 dead and more than 500 injured. Until Sunday, the deadliest mass shooting in Texas had been a 1991 attack in Killeen, when a mentally disturbed man crashed his pickup truck through a restaurant window at lunchtime and started shooting people, killing 23 and injuring more than 20 others. The University of Texas was the site of one of the most infamous mass shootings in modern American history, when U.S. Marine sniper Charles Whitman climbed the Austin campus' clock tower in 1966 and began firing on stunned people below, killing 13 and wounding nearly three dozen others. He had killed his wife and mother before heading to the tower, one victim died a week later and medical examiners eventually attributed a 17th death to Whitman in 2001.

          / CBS/AP PLANO, Texas -- Meredith Hight had gathered friends at her suburban Dallas home for a day of grilling and watching football when her estranged husband showed up and opened fire, killing her and seven others before a police officer killed him. Plano police have said that an officer responding to calls about shots fired Sunday evening saw bodies in the backyard and heard shots. The officer went inside, confronted 32-year-old Spencer Hight and fatally shot him. Police say he shot nine people in the home and that seven died there. One of the two wounded victims died at a hospital. Among those killed was 31-year-old Rion Morgan, who was a groomsman in the couple's wedding, The Dallas Morning News reported . Also killed were Anthony ""Tony"" Cross, 33; Olivia Deffner, 24; James Dunlop, 29; Darryl Hawkins, 22; Myah Bass, 28; and Caleb Edwards, 25. Meredith Hight, who was 27, filed for divorce in July after six years of marriage. The divorce hadn't been finalized yet. Her mother, Debbie Lane, said her daughter's gathering on Sunday was the first party she was hosting on her own. Records show the couple got married in Collin County in September 2011. They exchanged ceremonial vows during a Caribbean cruise the following year. Lane said Spencer Hight started out as a loving husband to her daughter, but she and her husband noticed something was off with their son-in-law. When they visited the couple, he would retreat to his room and his computer. She said they later learned he had a drinking problem. Spencer Hight lost his job doing contract work for Texas Instruments around the time that he and her daughter bought the Plano house in 2015, Lane said. She said her daughter, who worked for Coca-Cola Southwest Beverages in Fort Worth, was shouldering the mortgage by herself. Lane said it wasn't until Meredith filed for divorce that she told her parents that Spencer had been violent at least twice, including a time last fall when he slammed her face against a wall. But she said her daughter hadn't reported the incidents to police. ‪Lane told CBS DFW that her daughter did not take the decision to file for divorce lightly. ""After two years of trying to get him in treatment, trying to get him to stop, trying to help him… she said, enough is enough. She made every effort she could… and could leave that relationship with no regrets."" When Meredith filed for the divorce, she didn't request a restraining order against Spencer. She wasn't afraid of him, her mother said. Spencer Hight's father, Chester Hight, told the newspaper Wednesday that that the family is living a ""nightmare."" He said his son called to tell him that he and Meredith were splitting, but he couldn't speculate about their relationship. ""They didn't confide in me, let's put it that way,"" he said. ""And Meredith, I really liked Meredith, for what it's worth,"" he said. ""We all had a very good relationship with Meredith."" Chester Hight said his family is grieving over the deaths of the others who were killed at the party. ""I'm so sorry. We knew some of those kids,"" he said. On good days, the elder Hight said, Spencer was creative and clever. But he said his son also struggled with drinking.

Cardona and Tom Steele 9:07 PM on Nov 6, 2017 CST Before he walked into a church on Sunday and fired more than 450 rounds in what would become Texas' deadliest mass shooting, Devin Patrick Kelley had a history of domestic violence and hositility. It wasn't race or religion that motivated the 26-year-old to take aim at worshippers at Sutherland Springs' First Baptist Church, authorities said. Rather, the massacre that claimed 26 lives and wounded 20 others may have stemmed from a conflict between Kelley and his wife's family. Law enforcement officials described the couple's relationship as ""estranged."" The gunman had sent threatening texts to his mother-in-law, who attended First Baptist, officials said. ""There are many ways that he could've taken care of the mother-in-law without coming with 15 loaded magazines and an assault rifle to a church,"" said Freeman Martin, Texas Department of Public Safety regional director. ""I think he came here with a purpose and a mission."" Martin said that it would be speculation to say whether the shooting was done out of revenge. Kelley's wife, who also sometimes attended the church, and her parents were not there Sunday, authorities said. Officials could not confirm reports that his wife's grandmother was killed. Kelley, 26, wore a ballistic vest and black mask with a white skull as he walked down the sanctuary's aisle with an assault-style rifle and fired on churchgoers. Congregants likely had ""no way"" to escape once the shooting started, Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said Monday. Kelley's victims range in age from 18 months to 77 years old. A pregnant woman and her unborn child were among those killed. Officials were working to identify the dead and notify relatives. Of the 20 wounded, 10 remained hospitalized Monday night in critical condition and four were in serious condition, according to DPS. Hundreds of shell casings and more than 15 30-round capactiy magazines had been discovered at the crime scene, where authorities continued to work Monday night. Authorities recovered a Ruger AR-556 rifle at the church and two handguns — a Glock 9mm and a Ruger .22-caliber — from Kelley's vehicle, said Fred Milanowski, special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. As the gunman left the church, resident Stephen Willeford grabbed his own rifle and confronted him. The gunman dropped his weapon and fled in his vehicle, with Willeford pursuing him in the vehicle of passer-by Johnnie Langendorff. Kelley was found dead in his vehicle, which had crashed near the Wilson and Guadalupe county lines. An autopsy showed the shooter had three gunshot wounds — two in the torso and leg that came from the armed citizen, and a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, Martin said. As he drove away from the church, Kelley ""used his cellphone, notified his father that he had been shot and didn't think he was going to make it,"" he said The shooter's family has been cooperating with authorities in the investigation. Kelley owned four guns, law enforcement authorities said. He bought one each year from 2014 to 2017. Two were purchased in Texas and two in Colorado. His criminal past should have prevented him from purchasing them, however, the Air Force did not submit his history to the FBI and he was able to pass the background check. Under Pentagon rules, information about convictions of military personnel in crimes like assault should be submitted to the FBI's Criminal Justice Investigation Services Division. ""We are working with the Air Force to figure out what happened,"" FBI Special Agent Christopher Combs said. {""type"":""video"",""title"":""Dallas News Video"",""author_name"":""Dallas News"",""_id"":""NsdGZhZDE6zSNvGSra7z3wcbb3Gf1_GX"",""provider_name"":""Ooyala"",""html"":"" "",""raw"":""{\""type\"":\""video\"",\""title\"":\""Dallas News Video\"",\""author_name\"":\""Dallas News\"",\""_id\"":\""NsdGZhZDE6zSNvGSra7z3wcbb3Gf1_GX\"",\""provider_name\"":\""Ooyala\"",\""html\"":\""\\u003Cdiv class=\\\""oo-vid-container\\\"" data-oo-content-id=\\\""NsdGZhZDE6zSNvGSra7z3wcbb3Gf1_GX\\\""\\u003E\\u003C\\/div\\u003E\\u003Cscript defer src=\\\""https:\\/\\/www.dallasnews.com\\/resources\\/motif\\/dist\\/js\\/ooyala.js\\\""\\u003E\\u003C\\/script\\u003E\""}"",""providerType"":""ooyala"",""providerLink"":""https://www.dallasnews.com/oembed"",""embedType"":""video""} Kelley, who was in the Air Force from 2010 until he left the military in 2014,  served 12 months' confinement after a 2012 court-martial for assaulting his wife and stepson, Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said. He had repeatedly struck, kicked and choked his first wife beginning just months into their marriage, according to Air Force records, and hit his stepson's head with what the Air Force described as ""a force likely to produce death or grievous bodily harm."" ""He assaulted his stepson severely enough that he fractured his skull,"" said Don Christensen, a retired colonel who was the chief prosecutor for the Air Force. ""He pled to intentionally doing it."" Prosecutors withdrew several other charges as part of their plea agreement with Kelley, including allegations that he repeatedly pointed a loaded gun at his wife. His wife divorced him while he was confined, and he ultimately received a bad-conduct discharge and reduction in rank. His final duty title was ""prisoner."" 1/11Eight-year-old Heather Cooper and her mother, Meredith Cooper, of San Antonio walk away after placing a remembrance at the 26 crosses placed in a field in Sutherland Springs to honor those who were killed in Sunday's mass shooting.

(Louis DeLuca/The Dallas Morning News)(Louis DeLuca / Staff Photographer) Criminal allegations against Kelley also extended beyond his time in the military. Officials in Comal County said deputies were called to Kelley's home in February 2014 after a report that he was abusing his girlfriend. The people at the home told deputies that there was no problem, and they left. Kelley married the girlfriend two months later. Later that year, Kelley was arrested on an animal-cruelty charge in Colorado Springs after witnesses reported seeing him beat a husky and drag it by its neck. The charge was dismissed after Kelley completed deferred-adjudication probation. Before he bought the guns, Kelley had applied for a license to carry a concealed weapon in Texas, but was denied the permit, Gov. Greg Abbott said. A license is not required to purchase a gun in the state. {""type"":""video"",""title"":""Dallas News Video"",""author_name"":""Dallas News"",""_id"":""IweWhhZDE6p6PQTYbP0vRGwmkjgnnlWh"",""provider_name"":""Ooyala"",""html"":"" "",""raw"":""{\""type\"":\""video\"",\""title\"":\""Dallas News Video\"",\""author_name\"":\""Dallas News\"",\""_id\"":\""IweWhhZDE6p6PQTYbP0vRGwmkjgnnlWh\"",\""provider_name\"":\""Ooyala\"",\""html\"":\""\\u003Cdiv class=\\\""oo-vid-container\\\"" data-oo-content-id=\\\""IweWhhZDE6p6PQTYbP0vRGwmkjgnnlWh\\\""\\u003E\\u003C\\/div\\u003E\\u003Cscript defer src=\\\""https:\\/\\/www.dallasnews.com\\/resources\\/motif\\/dist\\/js\\/ooyala.js\\\""\\u003E\\u003C\\/script\\u003E\""}"",""providerType"":""ooyala"",""providerLink"":""https://www.dallasnews.com/oembed"",""embedType"":""video""} Though he did not have a concealed carry license, Kelley did have a ""non-commissioned, unarmed private security license similar to a security guard at a concert-type situation,"" said Martin, the DPS regional director.

http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/horoscopes/~3/PpBt759sBZY/ct-john-conyers-son-20171205-story.html,"WASHINGTON — The son of Rep. John Conyers Jr. - the embattled congressman who announced his sudden retirement Tuesday - may be headed for his father's seat, carrying on a decades-long political dynasty in Michigan. Conyers, D-Mich., resigned Tuesday amid allegations of sexual harassment; in doing so, the erstwhile dean of the House endorsed his eldest son, John Conyers III, to take his place representing Michigan's 13th Congressional District, which includes Detroit. The younger Conyers has been one of his father's fiercest defenders as the 88-year-old faced increasing pressure from Democratic leaders to step aside when a growing number of female former aides accused him of mistreatment and unwanted advances. ""It's very unfortunate to see him fight so long for so many people and to automatically have the allegations assumed to be true,"" John Conyers III told reporters last week, according to NBC affiliate WDIV. ""And of course, with sexual assault, women are to be believed. But in this instance, he has no history of this. ""And I think that if we're not going to make [Sen.] Al Franken resign when we have evidence of him groping a woman while she was asleep . . . it's disconcerting to me to see the way my father is being treated after he's given so much to this country, not just for black people but for people alike."" Of his father, he added: ""He fights for everyone."" Here's what we know about John Conyers III. He lacks political experience. Conyers is 27 and from Detroit. He attended Morehouse College as well as New York University, according to his contributor bio on HuffPost. That bio, whose details The Washington Post has not yet confirmed, identifies Conyers as ""a partner at Detroit's first minority run hedge fund"" and ""a seasoned multi-discipline consultant who has provided fundraising and social media services to both political and business clients."" It also says he served as an intern in the Department of Community Outreach in the Israeli Embassy in Washington. ""John is committed to melding community engagement, entertainment and politics,"" the bio states. He caused public headaches for his father in 2010. In 2010, MLive.com reported that John Conyers III was cited for speeding in his father's Cadillac Escalade - or rather, the government-leased vehicle his father used as a member of Congress. There were also reports that year that the younger Conyers had driven the vehicle to a rap concert and that it was broken into, according to MLive.com. The then-20-year-old reported to police that two laptops had been stolen from the Cadillac, along with tens of thousands of dollars worth of concert tickets. After the incident, the elder Conyers apologized. Conyers resigns from Congress amid harassment allegations, endorses son to succeed him ""I have just learned about the inappropriate use of a congressional vehicle by my son over the Thanksgiving holiday,"" he said in a statement at the time, according MLive.com. ""I am sorry it happened and will make sure that it does not happen again."" The Detroit Free Press reported that the congressman said he reimbursed the Treasury Department more than $5,600 for his son's unofficial use of taxpayer money. A photo on social media at the time showed his son in a Cadillac with a bottle of French champagne, according to an MLive.com article. The story's headline: ""The fabulous online life of John Conyers III, or why his family needs to do damage control immediately."" He's an opinionated writer. In a HuffPost op-ed, under the headline ""Orange Watergate: The Inevitable Impeachment of the 45th President,"" Conyers wrote that the ""reactionary and cavalier nature of the president will ultimately be his down fall. ""As his approval ratings tumble and confidence wanes, expect the weight of possible impeachment to make his already poor decision making worse. Self-preservation is ultimately the downfall of the narcissist."" In the wake of the mass shooting in Las Vegas, Conyers wrote that the national debate should be about gun control, not mental illness, explaining: ""I have dealt with Major Depressive Disorder since I was 15 years-old. I've not once thought about murder. I know right from wrong. ""My friends with bi-polar and depression and multiple personality disorder don't think about hurting others, if anything we think about hurting ourselves."" ""So if you grapple with mental illness do not let the medias stigmatization of our ailments make you self-conscious,"" he wrote in his October op-ed. ""As much as they love to make us their scapegoats, It's not our fault. You, as well as I, know we know right from wrong. When they need someone to blame they look to us first, when it's time to lend their hand to help us they're nowhere to be found."" He's a rapper. In a 2013 song, ""Rich Glorious,"" Conyers talked about his battles with the media amid his mother's 2012 bribery conviction, as well as the Cadillac mishap, according to Roll Call. ""Hey f - making a living, boy, I'm trying to make history. So picture me letting the news nitpick at me,"" Conyers said in the rap video, which showed an image from a news story about the incident. He's up against his cousin for the congressional seat State Sen. Ian Conyers, John Conyers Jr.'s great-nephew, told the New York Times that he intends to run as well in the special election.

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-mass-shooting-prayer_us_5a014f1fe4b07eb51181be67?ncid=edlinkushpmg00000313,"Overnight Editor, HuffPost Religion Reporter, HuffPost House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is defending his call for prayers after a gunman killed 26 people in a Texas church on Sunday. Ryan and other politicians have been criticized for offering thoughts and prayers instead of legislative action to reduce gun violence. But on Monday night, Ryan told Fox News host Laura Ingraham: “It’s disappointing, it’s sad, and this is what you’ll get from the far secular left. People who do not have faith don’t understand faith, I guess I’d have to say. And it is the right thing to do is to pray in moments like this, because you know what? Prayer works. And I know you believe that, and I believe that and when you hear the secular left doing this thing, it’s no wonder you have so much polarization and disunity in this country when people think like that.” Sending “thoughts and prayers” on social media has become a way for both religious and secular people to grieve after national tragedies. For religious people in particular, prayer is an important form of worship and a way to ask God for guidance and intervention. Especially after great personal sorrow, faith helps people to cling to hope. The Rev. Frank Pomeroy, pastor of First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, lost his 14-year-old daughter and at least 25 other church members in Sunday’s mass shooting. He told reporters on Monday that he has decided to “lean into the Lord.” “I don’t understand, but I know my God does,” Pomeroy said. But it is one thing for Pomeroy to lean into his faith after the shooting at his church, and something completely different for Ryan to offer prayers without action ― especially after reportedly receiving more than $170,000 in contributions from gun rights groups in 2016. In a statement, Bishops United Against Gun Violence, a group representing more than 70 Episcopal bishops, said that Christians are called to pray after the tragic shooting in Texas, but that prayer should also be accompanied by deep introspection about “whether we are complicit in the evils we deplore.” “In the wake of the heartbreaking shooting at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, we find ourselves both calling people to prayer, and wishing that the word did not come so readily to the lips of elected leaders who are quick to speak, but take no action on behalf of public safety,” the bishops said. “Each of us has a role to play in our repentance. Elected representatives bear the responsibility of passing legislation that protects our citizenry. If our representatives are not up to this responsibility, we must replace them. In the meantime, however, we ask that in honor of our many murdered dead, elected leaders who behave as though successive episode of mass slaughter are simply the price our nation pays for freedom stop the reflexive and corrosive repetition of the phrase ‘thoughts and prayers.’” “One does not offer prayers in lieu of demonstrating political courage, but rather in preparation.” See Ryan and Ingraham’s full discussion in the clip above.

http://www.sfgate.com/nation/article/26-killed-20-wounded-in-massacre-at-Texas-12334036.php,"SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas — A gunman clad in black, with a ballistic vest strapped to his chest and a military-style rifle in his hands, opened fire on parishioners at a Sunday service at a small Baptist church in rural Texas, killing at least 26 people and turning this tiny town east of San Antonio into the scene of the country’s newest mass horror. The gunman was identified as Devin Patrick Kelley, 26, according to two law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Kelley, who lived in New Braunfels, Texas, died shortly after the attack. He had served in the Air Force at a base in New Mexico but was court-martialed in 2012 on charges of assaulting his wife and child. He was sentenced to 12 months of confinement and received a “bad conduct” discharge in 2014, according to Ann Stefanek, chief of Air Force media operations. The motive of the attack was unclear Sunday, but the grisly nature of it could not have been clearer: Families gathered in pews, clutching Bibles and praying, were slain in cold blood. Kelley started firing at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs not long after the Sunday morning service began at 11 a.m., officials said. He was armed with a Ruger military-style rifle, and within minutes, many of those inside the small church were either dead or wounded. The victims ranged in age from 5 to 72, and among the dead were several children, a pregnant woman and the pastor’s 14-year-old daughter. It was the deadliest mass shooting in the state’s history. At least 20 more were wounded. “It’s something we all say does not happen in small communities, although we found out today it does,” said Joe Tackitt, the sheriff of Wilson County, which includes Sutherland Springs. Tackitt and other officials said the gunman first stopped at a gas station near the church. He drove across the street, got out of his car and began firing from the outside. Then he entered the building and kept firing. The authorities received their first call about a gunman at 11:20 a.m.. Officials and witnesses said Kelley appeared to be prepared for an assault, with black tactical gear, multiple rounds of ammunition and a ballistic vest. “He went there, he walked in, started shooting people and then took off,” said Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who represents the region and was briefed by law enforcement officials. When Kelley emerged from the church, an armed neighbor exchanged gunfire with him, hitting Kelley, who fled in his vehicle. Neighbors apparently followed him, chasing him into neighboring Guadalupe County, where Kelley crashed his car. Kelley was found dead in his vehicle. Officials said it was unclear how he had died. At the church, he left behind a scene of carnage. Of the 26 fatalities, 23 people were found dead inside the church, two were found outside, and one died at a hospital. In nearby Floresville, hours after the attack, Scott Holcombe, 30, sat with his sister on the curb outside the emergency room at Connally Memorial Medical Center. They were both in tears. Their parents, Bryan and Karla Holcombe, had been at the church and were killed. “I’m dumbfounded,” Holcombe said. “This is unimaginable.” A parishioner, Sandy Ward, said a daughter-in-law and three of her grandchildren were shot. Her grandson, who is 5, was shot four times and remained in surgery Sunday night. She said she was awaiting word on her other family members. Ward said she did not attend services Sunday because of her troubled knees and a bad hip. “I just started praying for everybody who was there” when she learned of the shooting, she said. President Trump, who was in Japan on a trip to several Asian countries, called it a “horrific shooting.” He ordered flags flown at half-staff at the White House and all federal buildings through Thursday. In a time of crisis, he said, “Americans will do what we do best: we pull together and join hands and lock arms and through the tears and sadness we stand strong.” The FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were helping in the investigation, which was being led by the Texas Rangers. Until the attack Sunday, the deadliest mass shooting in Texas was in 1991, when George Hennard drove his pickup truck through the window of a Luby’s Cafeteria in Killeen and opened fire on patrons there. He killed 23 people before turning a gun on himself. The authorities said Kelley used a Ruger AR-15 variant — a knockoff of the standard service rifle carried by the U.S. military for roughly half a century. Almost all AR-15 variants legally sold in the United States fire only semiautomatically and were covered by the federal assault weapons ban that went into effect in 1994. Since the ban expired in 2004, the weapons have been legal to sell or possess in much of the United States and sales of AR-15s have surged. Ruger’s AR-15s made for civilian markets sell for about $500 to $900, depending on the model. Kelley grew up in New Braunfels, in his parents’ nearly $1 million home, and was married in 2014. He had been married at least once before and was sued for divorce in 2012 in New Mexico, the same year he was court-martialed on charges of assaulting his wife and child. Why he chose to attack a church 30 miles away from his home is one of the questions that remained unanswered. David Montgomery, Christopher Mele and Manny Fernandez are New York Times writers."

        BuzzFeed News Worshipers pull a cross past the church following Sunday service at the temporary First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs on November 12. The First Baptist Church welcomed people back Sunday for its first service since the mass shooting that killed 26 people last week. The meeting was held in a baseball field covered by a white tent and filled with hundreds of folding chairs. The first three rows reserved for survivors of the attack and family members of victims, while the rest were filled by the public, the Associated Press reported. It was led by Pastor Frank Pomeroy, whose daughter, Annabelle, died in the shooting. Her funeral is planned for Monday. ""I say we choose light,"" Pomeroy told the mourners, according to NBC News. ""Not the darkness that the gunman did."" Pomeroy, who was out of town with his wife when the shooting happened, urged his followers to continue to worship their God. ""I know everyone who gave their life that day, some of whom were my best friends and my daughter,"" he said, pausing to gather himself. ""I guarantee they are dancing with Jesus today."" The congregation had spent the last few days working to transform the church into a memorial for the victims, which opened later on Sunday. Bullet holes were filled in and everything inside the memorial was painted a bright white, including 26 chairs, adorned with a single rose and the name of a victim. While most of the roses were red, single chair carried a pink rose and was dedicated to ""Baby Holcombe,"" in memory of the unborn child of Crystal Holcombe, who was eight months pregnant when she was killed. In the front of the church was a large wooden cross with a crown of thorns, and an old church service played in the background. Though Pomeroy said last week that he thought the building should be demolished, it now seems uncertain how long the memorial will remain up.
Church officials said Sunday that memorial would remain open 12 hours a day and five days a week, though it was not clear for how long. ""The members of the church will make this decision in the far future,"" Associate Pastor Mark Collins told NBC News. He added some members of the congregation needed to see the church, and it is a way to honor the victims. Collins said that the congregation plans to hold a service on the church's grounds next Sunday that will likely take place in a makeshift structure.

— Michelle Broder Van Dyke Tessa Brennaman, the ex-wife of Devin Kelley, spoke out Friday for the first time since the gunman killed 26 people at a Texas church, describing the abuse she suffered during their short marriage. Kelley spent a year in military confinement after pleading guilty to domestic assault against Brennaman and her young son. On Friday, Brennaman told Inside Edition he once threatened to kill her while holding a gun to her head over a speeding ticket. ""He had a gun in his holster right here and he took that gun out and he put it to my temple, and he told me, 'Do you want to die? Do you want to die?'"" Kelley also threatened to kill her family, she said. ""He just had a lot of demons or hatred inside of him,"" she said. According to law enforcement, Kelley threatened the family of his current wife before going on the shooting rampage that left 26 people dead at their church. Among the victims was his wife's grandmother. —Claudia Koerner The pastor of First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, said that the church will not reopen after a gunman opened fire on parishioners Sunday, killing 26 people and wounding 20 others. ""There’s too many that do not want to go back in there,” Pastor Frank Pomeroy told the Wall Street Journal. “We will probably turn it into a memorial for a while. We’re playing it day by day right now.” Pomeroy was out of town when the massacre occurred on Sunday. His 14-year-old daughter Annabelle was killed in the shooting. The congregation will continue to meet at another location, Pomeroy said, adding that church services would resume as early as this Sunday at a nearby community center. The church itself will likely be demolished, according to a spokesperson for the Southern Baptist Convention, who said Pomeroy told the convention this week that he wants to tear down the building. ""The pastor expressed his desire that perhaps the best way forward is to have the church demolished and replaced with a prayer garden,"" the spokesperson, Roger ""Sing"" Oldham told USA Today. The decision about what to do with building will ultimately be up to the church's members, Oldham said, but added that he expects they will follow the pastor's lead. —Talal Ansari SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas — Three days after the horrific church shooting that claimed the lives of 26 people, Texans are grappling with the question of what could be done to prevent a similar tragedy from happening again. While residents are dealing with feelings of disbelief and heartbreak over the shooting, they’re also considering what changes local communities and national leaders can make going forward. Rebecca Fernandez, a resident of nearby town Helotes, said she’s still having trouble wrapping her mind around the brutality of the shooting. “You attend church and think you’re in a safe place. For something like this to happen, it’s heartbreaking,” she said.

An internal review on why the Air Force did not report that the Texas church shooter had been court-martialed for assaulting his wife and child will be completed ""in days, not weeks,"" Vice President Mike Pence said Wednesday. Pence was visiting Sutherland Springs to meet with first responders, survivors, and victims of the mass shooting that left 26 people dead. ""Three days ago, evil descended on this small town and on this small church,"" Pence said. ""But we also gather with the resolve that this evil must come to an end."" Pence said he and his wife, Karen, were asked by President Trump, who is currently on an Asia tour, to visit the small town. The vice president said the Air Force review would be completed in days and that the Department of Defense was conducting its own review to assure bureaucratic errors like the one that allowed Devin Kelley to purchase firearms would not occur again. ""We now know it was a crime that the assailant was ever able to purchase a firearm in the first place,"" Pence told reporters at a news conference Wednesday. ""He lied on his application, had a history of mental illness and there were bureaucratic failures."" The conviction in 2012 should have barred Kelley from being able to purchase a gun, but Air Force officials said they failed to report the conviction to the FBI's National Crime Information Center, allowing four background checks for gun purchases since then to come back clean. ""We will work with leaders in Congress to ensure that this never happens again,"" Pence said. He did not, however, detail what sort of solutions the Trump administration would consider with members of Congress. Pence also met with and applauded the two men who shot at and pursued the gunman during the attack. ""These two brave men undoubtedly saved lives,"" he said. —Salvador Hernandez The man responsible for killing 26 people and injuring 20 at a church in Texas fired his weapon continuously for seven minutes, according to the New York Times. Video footage from inside the church showed Devin Kelley shooting the victims, including young children, in the head, execution-style, the Times reported, citing an unnamed law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. It is unclear how many shots Kelley fired. The church regularly recorded its services and posted the video online. Investigators have reviewed the footage from Sunday's shooting. —Mary Ann Georgantopoulos SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas — In the years before he opened fire inside a rural Texas church, taking the lives of 26 people, Devin Kelley threatened the people around him. In high school, Kelley made “impulsive verbal threats” when he got angry, though no one ever thought he’d actually act on them, one classmate recalled. That behavior later escalated into a brutal attack on his then-wife and young stepson. Allegations of violence and threatening behavior continued over the years, most recently in threatening text messages to his second wife's mother. Law enforcement and military records documented Kelley’s patterns of behavior over the last six years. But that paper trail didn’t reach the federal background check system — leaving Kelley free to purchase four firearms and act against the latest target of his anger: his wife’s family and their church. Another former classmate said that Kelley was once a typical, happy kid. That changed over the years, she said. Read more here. —Claudia Koerner The Pentagon has known for at least 20 years about failures to report military criminal history to FBI databases, which allowed Texas church gunman Devin Kelley to purchase four guns in two states despite serving time for assaulting his wife and cracking his stepson's skull while he was in the Air Force, the Associated Press reported. The Air Force's failure to send Kelley's violent offender conviction, which included multiple charges of domestic violence, as well as pointing a loaded gun at his wife, to the federal database allowed Kelley to buy several weapons before he shot and killed 26 people and wounded 20 more at the Sutherland Springs church. Federal law prohibits people with such convictions from buying guns, but Kelley passed every background check. “I don’t believe the Air Force should be left to self-police after such tragic consequences,” Rep. Mac Thornberry, the Texas Republican chair of the House Armed Services Committee, told the AP. The Pentagon inspector general said they found hundreds of convicted offenders' fingerprints were never added to the FBI's criminal database, a failure rate of about 30%. A report from 1997 showed that fingerprint cards were not submitted in more than 80% of cases in the Army and Navy, and 38% in the Air Force. “The lack of reporting to the FBI criminal history files prevents civilian law enforcement agencies from having significant information on military offenders,” the report said. —Brianna Sacks Texas church shooter Devin Kelley escaped a mental health behavioral facility in New Mexico in 2012, months after he attacked his first wife and child, and about five years before the massacre in Sutherland Springs, according to police documents obtained by media outlet KPRC2. The El Paso Police Department incident report states that after Kelley was picked up by two officers at a bus terminal in El Paso on the evening of June 7, 2012, they learned he had escaped from Peak Behavioral Health Services in Santa Teresa, New Mexico. A witness told officers that Kelley “suffered from mental disorders"" and had plans to escape Peak Behavioral Health Services by taking a bus, according to the police report, which does not note the reason why Kelley had been admitted to the facility. The witness also told officers Kelley “was a danger to himself and others as he had already been caught sneaking firearms onto Holloman Air Force base."" The report adds that Kelley “was attempting to carry out death threats” he had made to his military superiors. The police report also notes that an entry regarding the incident was submitted to the FBI’s National Crime Information Center database for gun purchases. —Cora Lewis Devin Kelley went aisle to aisle searching for congregants to shoot at during his rampage at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs. He also shot at crying babies, according to Joaquin Ramirez, a survivor of the shooting. In an interview with KSAT, Ramirez and his wife Roseanne Solis provided a chilling firsthand account of the shooting that left 26 dead, including several children. The youngest victim was 18 months old. ""I hear firecrackers popping. Ta-ta-ta,"" Solis, who was hit in the shoulder, recalled. ""Everybody started screaming, yelling. Everyone got down, crawling under wherever they could hide. It was so scary. He was shooting hard."" Solis thought the police had arrived when there was a moment of silence, but then the shooter entered the church. ""Everyone was saying, 'Be quiet. It's him. It's him,'"" she said. Solis told KSAT that Kelley yelled, ""Everybody die, [expletive],"" and resumed shooting. The gunman went aisle-to-aisle searching for his next victims, according to Ramirez. Speaking in Spanish, Ramirez said that Kelley also shot at babies who were crying. He told KSAT that he signaled the pastor's 14-year-old daughter Annabelle Pomeroy to keep quiet because the gunman was shooting at anyone who made a sound. The teen was one of the victims of the shooting. “I was praying to God to save me, because I could see death,"" Ramirez said. He managed to crawl out of the church and called 911. ""The Lord saved me because I know it was my last day,"" Solis said. —Tasneem Nashrulla The FBI has taken church shooter Devin Kelley's cell phone into evidence but has not been unable to unlock the device, according to Special Agent Christopher Combs, who is leading the federal investigation. ""They're in the process of looking at the phone. At this point in time we are unable to get into that phone,"" Combs said Tuesday, speaking to reporters during a morning press conference. The difficulty accessing the phone's contents, he added, ""highlights an issue that you have all heard about before with the advance of the technology and the phones and the encryptions. Law enforcement, whether it's at the state, local, or federal level, is increasingly not able to get into these phones."" Combs said he did not have a time frame on how long it would take agents to access information stored on the phone. He said he would not specify what kind of phone it is, ""because I don't want to tell every bad guy out there what phone to buy to harass our efforts on trying to find justice."" Texas officials at the press conference reiterated that they do not believe the shooting was an act of domestic terrorism. ""By definition we have no reason to believe this crime was politically motivated or motivated based on religious beliefs,"" said Freeman Martin, regional director for the Texas Department of Public Safety, adding that authorities have not found evidence that anyone was working with Kelley on the attack. Regarding Kelley's motivation, Freeman said the investigation is ongoing, and repeated that officials ""know that there was conflict"" between the gunman and his mother-in-law. ""He was upset with the mother-in-law. But beyond that, I can't comment,"" Freeman said. Officials said the crime scene investigation at the church is likely to wrap up by Wednesday night. Ten of the victims injured in the shooting remain in critical condition in area hospitals. —Nidhi Prakash In June 2013, an officer from the Comal County Sheriff's Office answered a ""non-emergency call"" about a reported sexual assault allegedly committed by Kelley against an unnamed victim, according to records obtained by BuzzFeed News. The alleged assault, labeled in sheriff's department records as ""completed"" and ""forcible rape,"" was witnessed by a Tessa Kaylnn Brennaman, a name listed for Kelley's first wife in some public records. Records also show that an officer with the Comal County Sheriff's Office responded to a February 2014 call for a domestic violence incident involving Kelley and Shields, his then-girlfriend. According to a report from the sheriff's department obtained by BuzzFeed News, a caller reported receiving texts from Shields, saying that ""her boyfriend is abusing her,"" and Shields then told authorities that ""her arms were red and he told her to pack a bag."" The sheriff's department report concludes by labeling the incident a ""misunderstanding and teenage drama."" Shields and Kelley were married two months later. Here's what else we know about the shooter. —Cora Lewis and Claudia Koerner During his court martial in 2012, Texas church shooter Devin Kelley accepted a deal with Air Force prosecutors, pleading guilty to two domestic violence charges in exchange for having several others dismissed. Kelley's court martial ultimately ended with him earning a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force. Court documents, obtained by BuzzFeed News on Monday, show that as part of the proceedings he pleaded guilty to choking, kicking, and pulling the hair of his then-wife, Tessa Kelley. He also pleaded guilty to striking a child, in this case his stepson, ""on the head and body with a force likely to produce death or grievous bodily harm."" According to an Air Force prosecutor who spoke with NBC News Monday, Kelley was convicted of fracturing his then 2-year-old stepson's skull. In exchange for the guilty pleas, Kelley had several other charges dismissed, including several for pointing guns at his wife and one for hitting a child. Earlier Monday, the Air Force said that Kelley's convictions were never reported to the FBI and entered into the National Criminal Information Center database. —Jim Dalrymple II Texas officials say church shooter had 3 gunshot wounds, 2 from the armed citizen who confronted him and 1 ""consist… https://t.co/sIzQ6dS7qR Texas church shooter Devin Kelley was found dead in his vehicle with three gunshot wounds, two from an armed citizen who confronted the 26-year-old, and the third from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, officials said Monday. Kelley unloaded 15 gun magazines during the shooting rampage at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs on Sunday, killing 26 people. The news came after authorities spent more than a day assessing multiple crime scenes and pulling bodies from the small church. ""I can tell you the scene in there is horrific, not even a word to describe it,"" Christopher Combs, the FBI special agent in charge, told reporters Monday. Four people remain in critical condition. More than 15 magazines with 30-round capacity have been recovered from the crime scene, officials said, while adding that Kelley passed all required systems and background checks when he purchased four firearms. ""There was nothing in the system that said he could not purchase that firearm,"" Combs said. ""In all three of those databases, there was not information that we would say was prohibitive for that man to get the firearm."" The Air Force on Monday said it failed to alert federal authorities to Kelley’s 2012 domestic violence conviction, which could have prevented him from purchasing the firearms. Officials would not confirm that the massacre, the worst mass shooting in Texas history, was a revenge attack, but emphasized that Kelley appeared to be angry with his mother-in-law, Michelle Fields, whose mother was one of the victims. ""There are many ways that he could have taken care of the mother-in-law without coming with 15 loaded magazines and an assault rifle to the church,"" said Freeman Martin, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of Public Safety. ""I think he came with a purpose and a mission."" —Brianna Sacks A domestic violence conviction that should have barred alleged Texas shooter Devin Patrick Kelley from buying a firearm was never entered into the National Criminal Information Center database, US Air Force officials said Monday night. In a statement, the Air Force confirmed that Kelley was convicted by a general court martial on two counts of domestic abuse against his wife and stepson, and served 12 months in confinement before being released with a bad conduct discharge in 2014. ""Federal law prohibited him from buying or possessing firearms after his conviction,"" the statement said, adding that ""initial information indicates that Kelley's domestic violence offense was not entered into the National Criminal Information Center database,"" which is used to conduct FBI background checks for gun purchases. The Air Force did not offer any explanation for how or why Kelley's criminal conviction was never put into the system. Officials said Monday that the service has launched a review of how Kelley's records were handled, as well as ""a comprehensive review of Air Force databases to ensure records in other cases have been reported correctly."" —Grace Wyler The gunman in the deadliest shooting in Texas history shot and killed his grandmother-in-law, Lula Woicinski White, during Sunday's church service, according to multiple outlets and social media accounts. Devin Kelley was married to White's granddaughter, Danielle Shields, records show. White also posted a photo of her granddaughter, as well as multiple pictures with her own daughter, 54-year-old Michelle Fields. Investigators said that Kelley, 26, had been involved in a ""domestic situation"" and had been texting his mother-in-law ""threatening"" messages before the attack. Ann Montgomery, a family friend of the Shields and White, wrote on Facebook that Danielle used to go to the small, tight-knit church. ""She was part of our youth group. Her parents and grandmother went there. We think he was targeting them. They had a lot of problems with him."" The 71-year-old was an active member of the Baptist church, where she died on Sunday, and a devout Christian, often posting about and sharing its events, as well as Bible verses. In 2013, she shared a photograph of herself hugging Pastor Frank Pomeroy's son, writing about how she missed him now that he was in college. In July, White shared a photo of a fishing trip she took with her grandson, David, writing that the two ""had a great time...made great memories..fishing..swimming pool..billards...ping pong...waves in port a...more of all before mentioned...kid kept me busy!!! Lol."" ""My sister was a wonderful, caring person — a God-loving person. She loved the people in her church. They were all her best friends,"" her sister, Mary Mishler Clyburn, told the New York Daily News. White's family members and friends posted their remembrances on social media, recalling how she always had a ""smile on her face,"" as well as their heartbreak and disbelief. ""I have no doubt where she is right now. She is in heaven laying her crowns and jewels at the feet of Jesus and celebrating. I love and will miss you Aunt Lula Woicinski White,"" wrote her niece, Amy Backus. Another niece, Charity Sales, posted several times that ""she just can't believe this,"" and called the massacre a ""horrific act."" ""Aunt Lula Woicinski White will be missed greatly, I don’t think there was ever a time I saw her she didn’t have a smile on her face and a crazy fun tactic up her sleeve,"" she said. —Brianna Sacks Karen &amp; I will travel to #SutherlandSprings on Wednesday to meet w/families of the fallen, injured &amp; law enforcement. We are with you Texas A LinkedIn account that appears to belong to Kelley states that he graduated from New Braunfels High School in 2009, which a former classmate, Arnold Cerda, confirmed to BuzzFeed News. Cerda said he remembered playing football with Kelley in middle school, but in high school he ""changed"" and dressed in black. When the news spread through Texas on Sunday afternoon, Rosemary Tribbey heard that the shooter went to New Braunfels, and asked her son, Taylor, if she’d known him. Taylor pulled up his Facebook profile photo and recognized him right away: They’d taken karate together for years. “The big thing I remember about him is that he was normal and nice,” Taylor Tribbey, Devin’s karate classmate told BuzzFeed News. “He broke up with his girlfriend in high school, but they stayed friends.” Taylor, his sister, and others from the karate school would periodically go on outings coordinated by the school — to the local water park, and, on one occasion, to the movies. “We had a good time with him,” Tribbey said. “I’ve been seeing on social media that he said he was an atheist all the way in 6th grade, but there were times when he talked about God — it must’ve been before he lost his faith.” Olivia Corbello, who attended sixth grade with Kelley, told BuzzFeed News that even in sixth grade, Kelley was ""constantly challenging our teacher about Christianity."" ""He wanted everyone to know that he was an atheist,"" Corbello said, describing Kelley as a ""quiet and opinionated"" student. She said that he would wear glasses and black cut off gloves to school. Tribbey described Kelly as a good karate student during the four to five years they practiced together. Later on, when the two attended high school together, Tribbey stopped taking karate and became involved in the ROTC. “It seems to make sense, given that he ended up in the Air Force.” After Tribbey enlisted in the Air Force, his father continued to practice and later teach at one of the karate school's studious. Here's everything else we know about Kelley. —Michelle Broder Van Dyke, Charlie Warzel, Mary Ann Georgantopoulos, Anne Helen Petersen Authorities said Monday that ""there was a domestic situation going on"" within the shooter's family, and that the shooter had sent ""threatening"" text messages to his mother-in-law, who attended the church where the massacre took place. ""We can't go into details about that domestic situation that is continuing to be vetted and thoroughly investigated, but we wanted to get that out there: This was not racially motivated,"" FBI Special Agent Christopher Combs told reporters at a press conference. ""It wasn't over religious beliefs. There was a domestic situation going on with the family and in-laws."" Combs said that authorities know the shooter had ""expressed anger towards his mother-in-law,"" but declined to provide further details. At the press conference, officials confirmed that the current death toll of 26, with 23 dead at the church, two outside the church, and one at the hospital. Twenty people were wounded in the shooting, and 10 remain in critical condition, officials said. Inside the church, the deceased range from 18 months to 77 years of age, officials said. According to Cory Lane and Brian Braskinski, who are leading the investigation for the Texas Rangers, the suspect, 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley, initially drew attention Sunday morning at the Valero gas station because he was dressed in all black. Officials were uncertain whether Kelley also wore a black mask with a white-skull design at the time, but said he was wearing the mask and a ballistic body armor vest with a plate on the front when he got out of the car in front of the church and began shooting. According to officials, “there was some length of time that the subject spent inside that church in the shooting event” and “he moved around freely inside the church.” The suspect continued to fire as an active shooter call went out to local law enforcement, officials said. As law enforcement responded to the call, a local resident who lives across the street from the church heard the gunfire, armed himself with an air assault rifle and engaged the suspect, according to the authorities. The suspect was shot, dropped his assault rifle, jumped into his Ford Expedition and fled the scene. The local resident then flagged down another young man and the two pursued the suspect in their cars. During the pursuit, officials said, the suspect called his father to tell him he’d been shot and “didn’t think he was going to make it,"" and subsequently appears to have shot himself. Pathologists will determine the final cause and manner of his death, officials said. Fred Milanowski, special agent in charge of Houston's field division for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said three firearms were recovered from the scene: a 5.56 rifle, which was found at the church, and two handguns — a Glock 9 millimeter and a Ruger 22 — that were recovered from the car. All three firearms, as well as a fourth gun, were purchased by Kelley. Two of the weapons were purchased in Colorado and two in Texas; the sales were conducted in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, authorities said. Officials confirmed the suspect did not have a license to carry, although he did have a noncommissioned unarmed private security license, which they described as “similar to a security guard at a concert-type situation.” “There were no disqualifiers entered into the national crime information center database that would preclude him from receiving a private security license,” an official with the Texas Department of Public Safety said Monday. —Cora Lewis Chris Singleton, the son of a victim of the 2015 church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, which left nine people dead, posted about gun violence on social media on Monday after the massacre at church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, the night before. ""This morning [26] people were murdered in a church while praying,"" Singleton wrote in part on Instagram. ""This cuts so deep because I know exactly the pain that is being felt in Texas right now. There are parents losing children & children losing parents. Their whole world has been turned upside down. Gun control is an issue that needs to be resolved."" Singleton also tweeted about the tragedy as more information about the victims was released. If this doesn't upset you about our laws on gun control then nothing will. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH !!! https://t.co/A6g3QmO37f Hard to breathe thinking that 20 more people were killed in a place of worship. Gun violence is REAL &amp; needs to be STOPPED!!! Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, Singleton's mother, was killed while attending a prayer group at Emanuel AME Church in June 2015, along with eight others. She was a mother to three, a reverend, and a high school track coach. The gunman, Dylann Roof, was motivated by racial hatred. People responded to Singleton's message with hopes, prayers, and agreement. Read more here. —Cora Lewis Devin P. Kelley’s former in-laws attended the church he attacked on Sunday, the local sheriff confirmed. Sheriff Joe D. Tackitt, speaking to CNN, said the shooter’s motivation remained unclear but provided more details about the attack. “We know that his ex-in-laws or in-laws came to church here from time to time. They were not here yesterday. So we don't know why he actually showed up yesterday. “But we know that when he left, he left destruction.” He also said it was his “understanding” that there were more weapons in the vehicle used by the attacker. Tackitt confirmed that 26 people were killed in the attack, and said his department’s focus would be on helping the victims' families and finding answers. “We're going to give them all the support we can,” he said. “They were all good people that were there in the church,” he said. “I know there's one family that [lost] six or seven. And that's going to be something that's really hard for them to deal with.” Tackitt said that “never in my wildest dreams” did he believe that his town would suffer such a tragedy, but he praised his officers’ response and professionalism as they reacted to the shooting. “A lot of them were off. But they came out when they heard about it. They got dressed and they came out to help.” He said that the hardest part of the attack was that children were involved. At least two children, aged 14 and 7 years old, are among those confirmed dead so far, BuzzFeed News reported yesterday. Asked about President Donald Trump’s remarks that the shooting was the result of a mental health issue, rather than a gun control one, Tackitt responded: “We just wish there was more help for these people.” Twenty people remain in the hospital in a “stable” condition, Tackitt also said. –Rose Troup Buchanan Suspect in Sutherland Springs shooting confirmed to be Devin Patrick Kelley, 26, of New Braunfels, TX.

Speaking to reporters Sunday after a gunman opened fire at the church, killing at least 26 people, Abbott said the entire state mourned the loss of life.

SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas — Michael Ward didn’t hear the shots at the Sutherland Springs Baptist Church on Sunday, but his wife, Leslie, did. She heard at least 20 and yelled at him to wake up. Michael ran to wake up his brother, Chris, who was also sleeping after a long night at work, and told him, ""They shot up the church, everyone’s been shot."" He flagged down his father on the road and they ran to the church, where a handful of police officers were already on the scene, and ran inside. ""I was just looking for my nephew, looking for my nieces, searching all over,"" Ward said. ""There was a woman who’d been shot three times in the leg, and she was doing all she could to help."" They started pulling bodies out. All four of the children who had gone to church with their mother, Joann, that morning — Rihanna Garza, 9; Emily Garza, 7; Ryland Ward, 5; and Brooke Ward, 5 — were found. Ryland, Ward said, was shot four times but as of Sunday night was alive, as was Rihanna. Emily and Brooke, however, did not make it, nor did Joann. At least 26 people in all were shot dead at the church. The gunman was later found dead in his vehicle after a short pursuit. It wasn’t until later that the Wards learned that Chris had been mistakenly identified as the shooter — which then quickly spread through social media.

Authorities did not publicly release the gunman's identity Sunday, but officials confirmed to multiple outlets that he was 26-year-old Devin P. Kelley. He was found dead in his vehicle after being pursued from the church. Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek told BuzzFeed News that according to records, Kelley served in logistics readiness at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge in 2014. After he was court-martialed in 2012 for assault on his spouse and assault on their child, Stefanek said, Kelley received a bad-conduct discharge and confinement for 12 months.

After the suspect fled in his vehicle, the other man, who Langendorff described as a member of the community, ran up to his truck and said they needed to go after the gunman. ""He said he just shot up the church so that's what I did,"" Langendorff told KSATV. ""I just acted."" The two men pursued the suspect down the highway, dodging traffic at about 95 miles per hour, Langendorff recounted, until the suspect ""lost control and got off the road."" Langendorff parked his car nearby and the other man, clutching his rifle, hopped out and kept his weapon trained on the suspect's car. Langendorff had been on the phone with police during the chase and helped direct authorities to the scene. Langendorf said he didn't see any movement coming from the vehicle — officials are trying to determine whether the suspect, identified by multiple outlets as 26-year-old Devin P. Kelley, killed himself in his car. Police arrived about five minutes after the suspect pulled off, Langendorf said, and ""took care of the rest."" ""I was strictly acting on what the right thing to do was,"" he said. Langendorff's girlfriend, Summer Caddell, shared the story on Facebook, pointing out his pickup truck in a flock of police vehicles in a shot broadcast on KSAT. —Brianna Sacks Moment of prayer for the victims at the candle light vigil.

Everyone raising their candles. —Charlie Warzel Kevin Jordan, who lives across from the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, told KENS5 that the suspect fired at his house before taking off in his car. ""I was literally maybe 50 yards from the guy. He was in a face mask and shooting,"" Jordan said. ""He saw me and took a pop shot at my house. It went through my window and my son was literally 2 feet from where the guy shot our house."" Jordan, a medical assistant, said he then ran to the small church and said the scene inside was indescribable. ""They try and train you for everything, but I can't describe what I saw,"" he told the station. ""I was trying to dress people's wounds. I saw my best friend's mother and I was trying to help her out. It was bad. I tried to help as many as I could. You can't explain it. Your mind doesn't want to grasp it."" Another witness told BuzzFeed News that those inside the church said the gunman started shooting through the windows before coming inside. The children in the congregation were seated in the back pews and were the first people the shooter encountered, they added. Michael Ward told BuzzFeed News that his four nephews and nieces were some of the children shot sitting in the back row. His sister-in-law was also wounded. Ward ran and woke up his brother, Chris, whose children were inside, and ""they went over to the church and began pulling them out.""

He later ordered flags to be flown at half-staff in honor of the victims. —Jason Wells At least 26 people are dead after a gunman opened fire during a Sunday service at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, making it the deadliest shooting in the state's history. At 11:20 a.m., a man dressed in all black and tactical gear started firing at the small church, officials said at a press conference. He then crossed to the right side of the building, still firing, before going inside and killing 23 people and injuring dozens more. When he left the building, ""a local resident grabbed his rifle and engaged that suspect,"" said Freeman Martin, regional director of the Texas Department of Public Safety. The gunman then dropped his weapon, an assault rifle, and ran to his car, Martin said. Authorities pursued the suspect, whom they found dead inside his vehicle after it veered off the road. Twenty-three people died inside the church, two people were killed outside, and one person died from their injuries after being transported from the scene, Martin said. The victims' ages range from 5 to 72 years old. ""There's a lot of work to be done,"" Martin said. ""We are only hours into this investigation, which is going to take significant amounts of time."" Officials did not immediately release the suspect's name, saying only that he was a young white male, maybe in his early twenties. ""There are many, many we cannot answer,"" Martin said, explaining that authorities were still processing ""many crime scenes."" ""We have the church, we have outside the church. We have where the suspect's vehicle was located. We have been following up on the suspect and where he's from, his residence,"" the director said. Officials cautioned that the death toll could rise. ""We ask for God's comfort, for God's guidance, and for God's healing, for all those who are suffering,"" Gov. Greg Abbott said at the press conference. ""I ask for every mom and dad at home tonight that you put your arm around your kid and give your kid a big hug and let them know how much you love them."" Frank Pomeroy, the pastor of the church, believes his 14-year-old daughter is one of the victims. He told ABC News that ""she was one very beautiful, special child."" Pomeroy and his wife, Sherri, were not at the church when the shooting occurred, according to CNN and NBC News. The CEO of Connally Memorial Medical Center, a nearby hospital, told BuzzFeed News the hospital had received eight shooting victims on Sunday, four of whom were transferred out to University Hospital in San Antonio. The four who remained at Connally Memorial were in stable condition — three of them have been discharged, he said. A staff member at the University Hospital in San Antonio said he could not provide any information. A spokesperson for the FBI's San Antonio field office, Michelle Lee, confirmed to BuzzFeed News that the agency is assisting local law enforcement in Sutherland Springs.

The organization had previously asked reporters to avoid asking questions about politics, gun control, or the recent Las Vegas mass shooting—or risk being removed by security. “CMA apologizes for the recently distributed restrictions in the CMA Awards media guidelines, which have since been lifted,” the organization said in a statement. “The sentiment was not to infringe and was created with the best of intentions to honor and celebrate Country Music.” The organization initially said the restrictions were “out of respect for the artists directly or indirectly involved” and that they wanted everyone “to feel comfortable talking to press.” Several country music artists, including this year’s co-host Brad Paisley, publicly criticized the restrictions."

http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-jason-aldean-las-vegas-shooting-first-interview-20171114-story.html,"NASHVILLE, TENN. — Country star Jason Aldean says he hopes that healing can start for those affected by a mass shooting at a Las Vegas music festival in his first interview since the October shooting. Speaking on NBC's ""Today"" show, Aldean, who was on stage when a gunman opened fire on the crowd at the Route 91 Harvest Festival, said that he initially thought a speaker had blown when he heard a sound like a crackling over his in-ear monitors. After the shooting continued, he looked over to the side of the stage to figure out what was going on. ""When I turned to look, my guitar player had run behind me and was telling me to move, like 'Let's go,'"" Aldean said. ""And my security guy was running on stage telling me to run."" Fifty-eight people were killed and hundreds more injured in the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history after gunman Stephen Paddock opened fire from the 32nd floor of a hotel-casino. SWAT teams with explosives then stormed his room and found he had killed himself. ""Everyone was scrambling, just didn't know what was going on,"" Aldean said. ""It was panic. That's probably the best way to describe it."" The country star cancelled some of his tour dates, but resumed touring about two weeks after the shooting. ""Honestly being back on stage probably helped us more than anything,"" he said. Aldean did not address gun control in the interview. ""At the end of the day, we're all in this together,"" Aldean said. ""We spend so much time arguing with each other and not enough time like working on the issue that is really the problem."" Aldean was joined in the interview by fellow country stars Dierks Bentley and Lady Antbellum, who were all gathered in Nashville, Tennessee, on Sunday to raise money for hurricane and Las Vegas victims. The Country Rising concert, which also featured performances by George Strait and Chris Stapleton, raised more than $4 million for relief efforts. ""I just hope everybody can start to heal,"" Aldean said. ""Some of this stuff you can never get over. I hope it gets better for everybody as time goes on.

It kicked off with the inauguration of President Donald Trump, a man who was elected despite being accused by more than a dozen women of sexual assault and misconduct. In response, millions of people took to the streets the following day for the Women’s March in cities worldwide. As the year unfolded, large numbers of women indicated interest in running for office. And the final months have been marked by dozens of women courageously coming forward to call out sexual abuse by powerful men. This year of activation around women’s rights was reflected not only in our national politics and media, but in our social media feeds. Facebook’s 2017 Year in Review, which looks at the topics generating the most interest on the social media platform, found that the most talked-about moment of 2017 was International Women’s Day. This year, International Women’s Day ― which people around the world celebrate each March 8 ― was marked by notable activism in the United States, with the “Day Without A Woman” strike rallying thousands in cities from New York to Alaska in the name of social justice. What’s more, Facebook’s Year in Review found the most “attended” event on its platform this year ― among events that people actually attended in person ― was the Women’s March in Washington, D.C., with more than 500,000 people marking themselves as “interested” or “attending” the event on Facebook. The second and third most talked-about moments of the year according to Facebook were the Super Bowl and the Las Vegas mass shooting. To measure the most discussed topics, Facebook looked at the number of times that keywords were used in its users’ posts or status updates, data communications research manager Sheida Neman told HuffPost. It’s worth noting that unlike previous Year in Review rankings, this year’s rankings didn’t consider the cumulative discussion of topics over the whole year, but rather those most talked about on a single day. To select its top “moments,” the site first looked at data from Jan. 1 to Nov. 1, 2017, to determine the moments with the highest volume of keywords on any single day, and then among those, selected the ones that saw high increases from last year to this year. Facebook’s new measurement system would explain why Donald Trump wasn’t one of the top three most talked-about “moments” in 2017. Even though you may think Trump dominated the conversation on social media throughout the year, reactions to the president were not concentrated on one day in particular. This also means that even though “Mother’s Day” or “Valentine’s Day” might be topics heavily talked about on a single day, they didn’t make Facebook’s top rankings of the most discussed moments because they weren’t talked about much more this year compared to last year. In contrast, International Women’s Day, an annual event, was talked about dramatically more this year than last. The volume of conversation around the celebration doubled from 2016 to 2017, according to Facebook’s stats. Over 165 million people worldwide discussed the topic on Facebook, and more than 200 countries celebrated the day ― from Dia Internacional da Mulher in Brazil to Journée Internationale des Femmes in France. But why wasn’t the Women’s March ― which brought out millions of people around the world ― among the top three most talked-about moments of the year? It may be because the main events were focused in the United States, Naomi Gleit, Facebook’s vice president of social good, told HuffPost. International Women’s Day was a more global event. Still, the other two most talked-about moments of 2017 ― the Super Bowl and the Las Vegas mass shooting ― would seem to be disproportionately U.S.-centric events too. So some mystery remains.

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cma-awards-las-vegas-mass-shooting_us_5a03f6e1e4b03deac08b2993,"Nov 8 (Reuters) - The Country Music Association’s (CMA) annual awards on Wednesday blended somber reflections on recent tragic events including the Las Vegas mass shooting, with show-stopping performances by top music stars and even a dose of political humor. Eric Church opened the live three-hour broadcast from Nashville, which aired on ABC, with an a cappella rendition of the hymn “Amazing Grace.” Church was joined by Keith Urban and Darius Rucker, who led a roster of A-list country music stars including Lady Antebellum, Tim McGraw and Faith Hill, Reba McEntire and Luke Bryan in a stirring group performance of “Hold My Hand.” Veteran hosts Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood took the reins, with Underwood declaring, “This has been a year marked by tragedy impacting countless lives, including so many in our country music family.” Underwood referenced mass shootings in Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs, Texas, fatal car attacks in New York and Charlottesville, Virginia, and deadly storms that hit Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. “Tonight,” she proclaimed, “we’re going to do what families do, come together, pray together, cry together and sing together, too.” Paisley then dedicated the 51st CMA Awards “to all those we’ve lost, and to all of those who are still healing. We love you, and we will never forget you.” Two hours into the show, the CMAs acted on that vow, ending a segment memorializing country stars who died this year by showing pictures and names of the 58 people killed by a gunman in Las Vegas at a country music festival on Oct. 1. Earlier the hosts lightened things up with banter about the CMA’s edicts on avoiding controversial subjects, before launching into jokes about Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. President Trump was not immune, lampooned for his cable news watching and Twitter habits and his personal style as Paisley sang “Before He Tweets,” a take-off on Underwood’s hit “Before He Cheats.” He sang about Trump tweeting “from a gold-plated White House toilet seat.” “It’s fun to watch it that’s for sure, ‘til little Rocket Man starts a nuclear war. Maybe next time he’ll think before he tweets,” which drew cheers and applause, but fans’ reaction on social media was divided. Country music legend Garth Brooks was among the big winners, taking home the top award of Entertainer of the Year for a second straight year. “We’re a family,” Brooks said, echoing a sentiment repeated often throughout the ceremony. Female Vocalist of the Year went to Miranda Lambert while Chris Stapleton was again named Male Vocalist of the Year. Other honorees included Single of the Year, won by Urban for “Blue Ain’t Your Color,” and Taylor Swift’s “Better Man,” which won Song of the Year. Jon Pardi won for New Artist, while Stapleton won Album of the Year for “From a Room: Volume 1.” Little Big Town took Vocal Group of the Year and Brothers Osborne were named Vocal Duo of the Year, both for a second consecutive year."

(Jay Janner/Austin American-Statesman via AP)  Authorities didn’t identify the attacker during a news conference Sunday night, but two other officials — one a U.S. official and one in law enforcement — identified him as Devin Kelley. They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the investigation. The U.S. official said Kelley lived in a San Antonio suburb and didn’t appear to be linked to organized terrorist groups. Investigators were looking at social media posts Kelley made in the days before Sunday’s attack, including one that appeared to show an AR-15 semiautomatic weapon. In a brief statement, the Pentagon confirmed he had served in the Air Force “at one point.” Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said records show that Kelley served in Logistics Readiness at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge. The date of his discharge and the circumstances under which he left the service were not immediately available. RELATED: Man linked to Texas church shooting faced military court martial At the news conference, the attacker was described only as a white man in his 20s who was wearing black tactical gear and a ballistic vest when he pulled into a gas station across from the First Baptist Church around 11:20 a.m. The gunman crossed the street and started firing a Ruger AR rifle at the church, said Freeman Martin, a regional director of the Texas Department of Safety, then continued firing after entering the white wood-frame building, where an 11 a.m. service was scheduled. As he left, he was confronted by an armed resident who chased him. A short time later, the suspect was found dead in his vehicle at the county line, Martin said. Several weapons were found inside the vehicle and Martin said it was unclear if the attacker died of a self-inflicted wound or if he was shot by the resident who confronted him. He said investigators weren’t ready to discuss a possible motive for the attack. He said 23 of the dead were found dead in the church, two were found outside and one died after being taken to a hospital. Addressing the news conference, Gov. Greg Abbott called the attack the worst mass shooting in Texas history. “There are no words to describe the pure evil that we witnessed in Sutherland Springs today,” Abbott said. “Our hearts are heavy at the anguish in this small town, but in time of tragedy, we see the very best of Texas. May God comfort those who’ve lost a loved one, and may God heal the hurt in our communities.” Among those killed was the church pastor’s 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle Pomeroy. Pastor Frank Pomeroy, and his wife, Sherri, were both out of town in two different states when the attack occurred, Sherri Pomeroy wrote in a text message to the AP. “We lost our 14-year-old daughter today and many friends,” she wrote. “Neither of us has made it back into town yet to personally see the devastation. I am at the charlotte airport trying to get home as soon as i can.” Federal law enforcement swarmed the small rural community of a few hundred residents 30 miles southeast of San Antonio after the attack, including ATF investigators and members of the FBI’s evidence collection team. RELATED: Small-town Texas church where mass shooting occurred was center of community At least 16 wounded were taken to hospitals, hospital officials said, including eight taken by medical helicopter to the Brooke Army Medical Center. Another eight victims were taken to Connally Memorial Medical Center, located in Floresville about 10 miles from the church, including four who were later transferred to University Hospital in San Antonio for higher-level care, said spokeswoman Megan Posey.  Alena Berlanga, a Floresville resident who was monitoring the chaos on a police scanner and in Facebook community groups, said everyone knows everyone else in the sparsely populated county. “This is horrific for our tiny little tight-knit town,” Berlanga said. “Everybody’s going to be affected and everybody knows someone who’s affected.” Regina Rodriguez, who arrived at the church a couple of hours after the shooting, walked up to the police barricade and hugged a person she was with. She said her father, 51-year-old Richard Rodriguez, attends the church every Sunday, and she hadn’t been able to reach him. She said she feared the worst. Church member Nick Uhlig, 34, wasn’t at Sunday’s service, but he said his cousins were at the church and that his family was told at least one of them, a woman with three children and pregnant with another, was among the dead. “We just gathered to bury their grandfather on Thursday,” he said, shaking his head. “This is the only church here. We have Bible study, men’s Bible study, vacation Bible school. Somebody went in and started shooting.”
President Donald Trump, who was in Japan, where he was on an Asian trip, called the shooting an “act of evil” and said he was monitoring the situation. “We’re shocked. Shocked and dismayed,” said state Sen. Judith Zaffirini, a Laredo Democrat whose district includes Sutherland Springs, a rural community known for its peanut festival, which was held last month. “It’s especially shocking when it’s such a small, serene area. These rural areas, they are so beautiful and so loving.” Later Sunday, two sheriff’s vans were parked outside the gate of a cattle fence surrounding the address listed for Kelley on the rural, western outskirts of New Braunfels, north of San Antonio, preventing a group of waiting journalists from entering. Officials from the Comal County Sherriff’s Office and the Texas Rangers declined to comment or say if they had raided his home. Ryan Albers, 16, who lives across the road said he heard intensifying gunfire coming from that direction in recent days. “It’s really loud. At first I thought someone was blasting,” Albers said. “It had to be coming from somewhere pretty close. It was definitely not just a shotgun or someone hunting. It was someone using automatic weapon fire.” The church has posted videos of its Sunday services on a YouTube channel, raising the possibility that the shooting was captured on video. In a video of its Oct. 8 service, a congregant who spoke and read Scripture pointed to the Oct. 1 Las Vegas shooting a week earlier as evidence of the “wicked nature” of man. That shooting left 58 dead and more than 500 injured. Until Sunday, the deadliest mass shooting in Texas had been a 1991 attack in Killeen, when a mentally disturbed man crashed his pickup truck through a restaurant window at lunchtime and started shooting people, killing 23 and injuring more than 20 others. The University of Texas was the site of one of the most infamous mass shootings in American history, when U.S. Marine sniper Charles Whitman climbed the Austin campus’ clock tower in 1966 and began firing on stunned people below, killing 13 and wounding nearly three dozen others. He had killed his wife and mother before heading to the tower, one victim died a week later and medical examiners eventually attributed a 17th death to Whitman in 2001.

http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_latest/~3/D-nMecHquAM/index.html,"In a Saturday news release, the Texas church invited the public and the media to the memorial to honor the dead, saying it had ""undertaken several projects to help the healing process for the families and the community,"" one of which included restoring the church's sanctuary.  ""Through generous volunteer efforts and offers from several individuals with varying fields of expertise,"" the statement read, ""the scene of this unspeakable event has been transformed into a beautiful memorial that celebrates and pays tribute to the lives that were lost."" The sanctuary will open to the public at 5 p.m., the statement said, and will be open Monday through Friday. It's unclear whether the church plans for the memorial to be a permanent installment. It was previously announced that the church would hold its first Sunday service since the shooting this weekend, at a community center next door. First Baptist's pastor, Frank Pomeroy, is expected to speak. Pomeroy -- whose 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle, was killed in last Sunday's attack -- has previously said he wants the church to be torn down and possibly have a memorial erected in its place. ""This was just the pastor discussing what the thinks (the) best case scenario would be,"" Roger Oldham, spokesman for the Southern Baptist Convention, told CNN earlier this week. ""But the church has to make the decision together to tear down the church."" Following previous mass shootings, those tasked with addressing the future of the site have responded in a variety of ways.  In Newtown, Connecticut, Sandy Hook Elementary School was torn down and replaced by a new school after 20 children and six staff members were killed there in December 2012. The Pulse nightclub in Orlando was to be torn down following the June 2016 shooting that claimed 49 lives, but the owner has since decided it will be turned into a memorial. And in Charleston, South Carolina, the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church reopened just days after nine parishioners were killed in a racially motivated attack."

He and his wife Karla had been married for more than two decades. The Air Force failed numerous times to take steps that would have prevented Sutherland Springs shooter Devin Patrick Kelley from purchasing the firearm he used to kill 26 people and wound 20 others, according to a claim filed by the Holcombe family, which lost 9 members in the massacre. The claim, filed against the U.S. government Tuesday specifically in the death of Bryan Holcombe, could be the first step to an eventual lawsuit if the Air Force denies responsibility. The family is seeking monetary damages but said they are also hoping to prevent the type of error that allowed Kelley to purchase the tools he needed to carry out the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history. READ MORE: Air Force admits it failed to send Sutherland Springs gunman's records to feds ""Although the shooter undoubtedly 'pulled the trigger' that resulted in the injuries and death of JB Holcombe and others, failures of the US Air Force, and others, allowed the shooter to purchase, own and/or possess the semiautomatic rifle, ammunition and body armor he used, and it is these failures that were a proximate cause, in whole or in part, of the injuries and death of the decedent,"" reads the claim. Remembering Nov. 5 Joe “Papa Joe” Holcombe joined Houston-based attorney Rob Ammons in downtown San Antonio Tuesday afternoon to discuss his claim and tell the story of his nine family members who lost their lives on Nov. 5. He said he returned home from teaching Sunday School at the First Baptist Church in Floresville to do what he and his wife always did those days — each lunch and watch church services streamed from San Antonio. The 86-year-old said he noticed his pastor walking up to the house and thought, ""What in the world is he doing here?"" It was about an hour after the shooting and the pastor arrived to deliver the terrible news. ""I said, 'How about my family?'"" Holcombe recalled. ""'Bryan?'"" He's gone, the pastor said. John? He was wounded. Karla? She's gone. ""How many are gone?"" Holcombe finally asked. And then the pastor named them all. ""That's what hit me the hardest,"" Holcombe said.  RELATED: Handwritten lawsuit on behalf of Devin Kelley's family appears to be work of Ohio inmate The family's patriarch lost his son Bryan, daughter-in-law Karla, grandson Marc, granddaughter-in-law Crystal, and great-grandchildren Noah, Emily, Gregory, Megan and an unborn child who was to be named Carlin Brite ""Billy Bob"" Holcombe. Kelley's history The Air Force found through an internal investigation that it failed to report Kelley's 2012 conviction for spousal and child abuse to the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System. If the agency had followed through on its reporting requirement, that conviction would have followed him and prevented him from purchasing firearms. Instead, he bought four in Colorado and Texas between 2014 and 2017, including the rifle used in Sutherland Springs. Because of his abuse convictions, Kelley received a bad-conduct discharge from the Air Force. The claim also cites threats Kelley made against his superior officers and his attempts to smuggle guns onto base, which landed him in a mental health facility in New Mexico. He escaped that facility and was later apprehended by law enforcement. Ammons said Kelley's case and the Air Force's error is not uncommon, citing a February 2015 Air Force which report found 30 percent of servicemen convicted of crimes were not reported to the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. RELATED: Apple served with search warrant in Sutherland Springs shooting “By failing to report, the Air Force is basically shredding gigantic holes in the safety net that is there to protect all of us in society,” Ammons said. “It’s time that this ends and it’s time that this problem is corrected.” The Air Force admits failures Coincidentally, the Air Force on Tuesday released the results of a review into Kelley's case it launched immediately after the shooting. They found similar reporting lapses at other locations. In a statement the Air Force also said it was implementing a number of corrective measures to ensure reporting compliance. Air Force officials have not yet responded to Holcombe's claim. Holcombe, a devout Christian, said he believes his lost loved ones are in a better place. And someday soon, he’ll get to join them.  “They’re just in a much better place now because it’s never going to happen to ‘em again,” he said.

Thanks to a 30-person team working overtime for 72 hours, the Texas sanctuary was completely revamped, offering a simple, whitewashed tribute to the two dozen victims shot by Devin Kelley. But even as mourners and community members lined up outside for a few quiet moments in the church, the congregation’s leaders admitted they were considering all options about what to do next with the site — tear the structure down? Built a permanent monument? First Baptist has yet to decide, The Washington Post reported on Monday. The tiny Texas church is not the first place to weigh the heavy question of how best to memorialize an everyday location — from schools to office complexes to nightclubs — transformed by the sudden flash of gun violence into a symbol of national tragedy. It is a delicate question of memory and respect, healing and remembrance. “On the surface, it appeared to be about a building,” Rich Harwood, a Bethesda-based consultant who worked with Newtown, Conn., officials told The Post in 2013. “It’s really about a community coming to grips with the trauma and the despair it is feeling.” On April 20, 1999, Columbine High School became one of the first public spaces to go through such a high-profile identity crisis. In the space of a day, a Littleton, Colo., public school became shorthand for a new breed of school violence after Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris killed 12 students and a teacher in an orchestrated attack. As the Los Angeles Times reported in 2016, the school underwent a $1.2 million renovation following the shooting. Because the majority of the violence happened in the school’s library, a new facility was constructed at another part of the school. The old library was razed and an atrium was put in its place. A permanent memorial was also constructed nearby. In July 2012, the Century 16 movie theater in Aurora, Colo., was the scene of a shooting that claimed 12 lives and injured 70 during a showing of “The Dark Knight Rises.” Two months after the incident, the theater’s owner, Cinemark, conducted a local survey showing the majority of residents wanted the space to reopen, the Denver Post reported. The company refurbished and renamed the theater; the first screening happened six months after the shooting, and was met with a boycott from the families of some victims. “Our family members will never be on this earth again, and a movie ticket and some token words from people who didn’t care enough to reach out to us, nor respond when we reach out to them to talk, is appalling,” angry family members wrote at the time. “We, the families, recognize your thinly veiled publicity ploy for what it is: A great opportunity for you to distance yourselves and divert public scrutiny from your culpability in this massacre.” Twenty students and six teachers were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn., in December 2012. The next year, the town held a referendum to decide what should happen to the school. NPR reported 4,504 voted to ripped the structure down and rebuild the location, with 558 voting against the measure — the town’s largest voter turnout since the 2008 presidential election. Not all the victims were in favor of removing the site. “The hardest thing I’m having to deal with is . . . the feeling that we didn’t just lose 20 children and six adults,” the father of a dead first-grader told the Los Angeles Times. “We’re letting [the gunman] take the building too, and he’s winning.” The redesigned $50 million Sandy Hook Elementary opened in August 2016. The new site, however, did not include a memorial. In an interview with NPR, Barry Svigals, one of the new school’s designers, explained: “We didn’t look back. We felt our charge was very much to look forward, and to offer the community the hold of building and creating a new school that would serve their children for many years to come.” A separate permanent memorial is also in the works. Orlando’s Pulse Nightclub was the scene in 2016 of the then-deadliest shooting in modern U.S. history. Omar Mateen killed 49 people at the popular LGBT club. Following the shooting, the boarded-up site became a makeshift memorial for the victims. Last May, the club’s owner Barbara Poma announced plans to form a foundation for a permanent memorial and museum at the site. Months later, Poma also said she was looking for a new location to reopen Pulse. “By reopening it, same name, same format that we had, it just proves, you know, that hate will not win,” she told WFTV 9. “We will not let him win.” More from Morning Mix: One of world’s most prominent Scrabble players banned temporarily for cheating Trump chuckled as Duterte called journalists ‘spies.’ That’s no joke in the Philippines. ‘He could have blown up the block’: Fla. police discover booby-trapped SpongeBob lunchbox The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

While no officials have publicly questioned Kelley’s mental health, Trump said that “is your problem here.” He offered no details. “This was a very, based on preliminary reports, a very deranged individual. A lot of problems over a long period of time,” Trump said when asked about the shooting as he and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held a joint news conference in Tokyo during Trump’s first official visit to Asia. Advertisement “We have a lot of mental health problems in our country, as do other countries. But this isn’t a guns situation,” the president said. The attack happened Sunday morning when a man dressed in black tactical-style gear and armed with an assault rifle opened fire inside a Baptist church in a small South Texas community, killing 26 people and wounding at least 16 others in what the governor said is the deadliest mass shooting in state history. Trump first tweeted that he was monitoring the situation from Japan. He later described the shooting as an “act of evil” during remarks to a gathering of American and Japanese business executives. Abe also offered condolences. Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said Sunday that Devin Kelley served 12 months’ confinement after a 2012 court-martial. He ultimately received a bad conduct discharge and reduction in rank. Stefanek said Kelley served in logistics readiness at Holloman Air Force Base, N.M., from 2010 until his discharge in 2014. He was responsible for moving passengers, cargo and personal property in military transportation. Advertisement As Kelley left the scene, authorities said he was confronted by an armed resident who engaged the suspect, who later was found dead in his vehicle. Trump said “fortunately somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction otherwise . . . it would have been much worse.” “But this is a mental health problem at the highest level. It’s a very, very sad event.” The shooting comes just over a month after a gunman opened fire on an outdoor music festival on the Las Vegas Strip from the 32nd floor of a hotel-casino, killing 58 people and wounding more than 500. Trump visited Las Vegas soon after to meet with families of victims and first responders. In the days after the Las Vegas shooting, Trump and his aides declined to discuss possible changes to gun laws, saying it was too soon after the tragedy to discuss policy. Trump on Monday ignored shouted questions about whether the US needs to consider tightening gun laws.

http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/11/bills_to_allow_concealed_guns.html,"Senate Majority Leader Arlan Meekhof, R-West Olive, takes testimony on a package of bills that would expand where some gun owners could concealed carry at a Government Operations Committee hearing on Oct. 11, 2017. (Emily Lawler | MLive.com) LANSING, MI - Gun owners with extra training could carry concealed weapons in traditionally weapon-free places like schools and bars under legislation approved by the Senate Government Operations Committee along partisan lines on Tuesday. ""The highest-trained gun owners, to be able to defend themselves and others, I think that's a good thing,"" said Senate Majority Leader and bill sponsor Arlan Meekhof, R-West Olive. Senate Bills 584-586 allow people with concealed weapons permits to - with additional training - get permission to carry concealed weapons in traditionally pistol-free zones like schools, day care centers, stadiums, churches and college dorms. To get the exemption and be allowed to carry in these areas, a CPL holder would have to have at least eight hours of additional training beyond the required CPL training, or be a certified firearms instructor. Meekhof said he knows some people may think it's insensitive to take up the bill shortly after the shooting incident in a Texas church. But, he said, ""I feel quite the opposite."" He said that since 1950, 98 percent of mass shootings have occurred in gun-free zones. As policymakers look for ways to stop the next mass shooting, ""Responsible, well trained licensed gun owners may be one of those deterrents."" But those who testified against the bill had a different take on it. ""No matter what we do in state government or anywhere else, tragedies are going to happen. And the passage of this bill or any other isn't going to prevent them,"" said Dan Wotruba,  executive director of the Michigan Association of School Boards. What allowing more people to carry in schools could do, he warned, was create accidental tragedies. He also expressed concern that school districts couldn't create a policy on whether their own staff could carry guns or not - something Meekhof said would be allowed for under a change to the bill while it's before the full Senate. Martha Omilian, from Plainwell, knows firsthand the pain guns can inflict on a family. Her daughter, Maggie, was killed by a gun in her dorm at Kalmazoo College in 1999. It was supposed to be a gun-free zone. Since then, she's been involved in advocacy around gun laws. This package she labeled ""ridiculous,"" pointing out that a 16-year-old needs more than eight hours of training to operate a car, but an adult gun owner is expected to learn how to safely operate a gun in less time, under this bill. She approached Meekhof after the hearing and, though he talked with her for a bit, thought he was dismissive of her experience. ""The pain I feel inside will never go away. I don't want anybody else do have to feel this way. I don't,"" Omilian said. Some organizations, including the Michigan Coalition of Responsible Gun Owners, testified in support of the bill. But at the hearing they were outnumbered by people who, like Omilian, came with the group Moms Demand Action. A change in the bill on Tuesday prohibited open carry in schools -- something that is currently allowable, though a recent Court of Appeals decision allowed school districts to ban the practice. In the end the bill was approved along partisan lines, with Republican Sens. Meekhof; Goeff Hansen, R-Hart; and Mike Kowall, R-Whitelake, voting in favor of it. The two Democrats on the committee, Senate Minority Leader Jim Ananich, D-Flint, and Sen. Morris Hood III, D-Detroit, voted against the bill. ""I think I just have a fundamental difference of opinion about the direction we should take when it comes to safety in our community,"" Ananich said. Hood said the kids in the hearing room made him think about their safety, especially when a person with eight hours of training is making important decisions in gunfire that affect their safety. He was also opposed to letting concealed weapons in bars. ""We know that alcohol is an intensifier for bad judgement. Do we intensify that judgement by taking a life that you can't get back?"" Hood asked. The bills could come up for a vote before the full Senate as soon as tomorrow, Meekhof told reporters after the hearing. Gov.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lasvegas-shooting-lawsuit/hundreds-of-las-vegas-shooting-victims-file-lawsuits-in-california-court-idUSKBN1DK2OX,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Tina Bellon 3 Min Read (Reuters) - Hundreds of victims of the Oct. 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas filed five lawsuits on Monday in a California court against the operators of the hotel from which the gunman fired, the organizers of the country music festival he targeted and the killer’s estate. The largest of the lawsuits was filed on behalf of 450 people who were either injured in or witnessed the shooting, while the other four were brought by families of people who were killed or severely injured. All five cases were filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Muhammad Aziz, a Houston-based lawyer heading the lawsuits, said they were filed in California because nearly all the plaintiffs were from the state and had been treated there. He noted that Live Nation Entertainment Inc, the event organizer, was a California-based company. Stephen Paddock, 64, fired into the crowd gathered for the Route 91 Harvest Festival from a 32nd-floor hotel suite at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas on Oct. 1, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more, the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Paddock also killed himself. The victims accused the hotel operator MGM Resorts International and its subsidiary Mandalay Corp, which owns the hotel, of failing to properly monitor Paddock’s activities, train staff members and employ adequate security measures. The festival goers also alleged Live Nation was negligent for failing to provide adequate exits and properly train staff for an emergency. Several lawsuits have previously been filed in the shooting, mostly in Nevada state court. One of those filed on Monday was brought by college student Paige Gasper, who brought the first lawsuit over the mass shooting. Gasper voluntarily dismissed the Nevada lawsuit on Friday. Live Nation and MGM did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The companies have previously declined to comment on lawsuits. Plaintiffs also sued the shooter’s estate for battery and assault. The reportedly wealthy shooter is thought to have had multimillion-dollar real estate investments across Texas and California. A court hearing about who will be appointed to administer Paddock’s estate is set for Dec. 7. Slide Fire Solutions, the maker of the so-called bump stock device Paddock used to achieve a near-automatic rate of fire, was named in previous lawsuits over the shooting, but not in any of the suits filed on Monday. Aziz said Slide Fire was not named because most of his clients supported the right to bear arms. “We want to focus on hotel and venue security, not turn this into a gun rights case,” he said.

https://mashable.com/2017/11/07/stephen-colbert-sutherland-springs/,"Once again Stephen Colbert has addressed a mass shooting in America. On Monday night Colbert gave his response to the shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas. ""I haven't the slightest idea how to adequately address the attack,"" said Colbert. He pointed out that this shooting occurred 35 days after the largest mass killing in Las Vegas. He adds that although everyone wants something to change after an event like this, ""no one does anything... and that seems insane."" However Colbert did not give in to pessimism, saying ""I know that hopelessness is not the answer,"" and urged people to reclaim power not through arms, but with their vote."
http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/glanton/ct-met-mary-shepard-texas-dahleen-glanton-20171106-story.html,"After the ghastly church shooting in Texas, I am reminded of Mary Shepard. Shepard was the lead plaintiff in the National Rifle Association’s lawsuit that forced the Illinois General Assembly to pass a law four years ago allowing residents to carry concealed firearms in the state. She is a fighter and a fierce supporter of Second Amendment rights. And though we disagree on many aspects of what that should entail, she is a woman for whom I have a great deal of respect. A few years ago, the then-74-year-old grandmother invited me to her home in rural southern Illinois to talk about the gruesome 2009 attack she suffered in the basement of the Anna First Baptist Church, where she worked as the treasurer. The assailant, who entered through an unlocked door, beat Shepard and another woman, 76-year-old church custodian Leona Mount, mercilessly. Shepard's skull was fractured in four places. Her nose and both cheekbones also were broken. After robbing the church of $300, the man fled, leaving the two elderly women on the floor unconscious and near death. Shepard was well-trained in the use of firearms. Had she been allowed to carry a handgun with her to church, she told me, she could have at least had a chance to defend herself. Her case — Mary E. Shepard and the Illinois State Rifle Association v. Lisa M. Madigan — convinced a federal appeals court to strike down the last state statute in the country that kept law-abiding citizens from carrying handguns in public. Perhaps a handgun would have given the 5-foot-2-inch Shepard an edge over her 6-foot-3, 245-pound attacker. No one can know for sure. But Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton thinks more gun-toting congregants could put an end to mass shootings like the one that occurred Sunday at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. “We’ve had shootings at churches for forever,” Paxton said on “Fox News Sunday.” “This is going to happen again. And so … we need people in terms of professional security or in terms of arming the parishioners or the congregation so that they can respond when something like this happens again.” Everyone knows that the issue of firearms is both complex and contentious. There is no “one-size-fits-all” answer to how to stop mass shootings from occurring in churches or anywhere else. But it is unlikely a parishioner armed with a handgun would have been able to subdue a determined killer like Devin Kelley. Dressed in all black, wearing bulletproof tactical gear, carrying a military-style rifle and equipped with dozens of rounds of ammunition, Kelley entered the Texas church prepared for a massacre. When he was done, 26 people, about half of them children, were dead. This is how the Texas attorney general responded: “All I can say is in Texas at least we have the opportunity to have conceal carry,"" he said. ""And so ... there's always the opportunity that gunman will be taken out before he has the opportunity to kill very many people."" The attorney general is delusional if he thinks an armed church member or even a security guard could have frightened Kelley into submission. A handgun would have been as powerless in Sutherland Springs as it would have been against Dylann Roof’s .45-caliber semi-automatic pistol and the arsenal of magazines and hollow-point bullets he used to kill nine people during Bible study at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C., two years ago. It was easy for gun lovers to write off Roof’s racially motivated attack as the act of a mentally deranged 21-year-old. Still, lawmakers never did anything to keep people like Roof from having access to firearms. In fact, in February, President Donald Trump made it easier for some 75,000 mentally ill people to get guns. He rescinded a rule put in place under President Barack Obama requiring the Social Security Administration to report certain mentally ill recipients to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which screens gun applicants. On Sunday, Trump said the Texas shooting was caused by “a mental health problem” not a problem with gun laws. ""This isn't a guns situation,"" Trump said. ""This is a mental health problem at the highest level. It's a very, very sad event."" It’s unclear whether Kelley actually suffered from mental illness. But we do know that he had a documented history of domestic violence. While federal law prohibits anyone convicted of domestic violence from obtaining a firearm, Kelley’s 2012 court-martial and discharge from the Air Force were never reported to the federal background check database, the Air Force acknowledged Monday. That, coupled with Texas’ lax gun laws allowing people to legally purchase assault weapons, was a deadly combination. Paxton’s misguided solution is to advocate for more guns, rather than figuring out how to keep firearms out of the hands of people who should not have them. “You can’t necessarily keep guns out of the hands of people who are going to violate the law,” Paxton said. “If someone is willing to kill someone, they’re also going to be willing to violate a gun law.” With that attitude, we’d might as well just give up trying. There is certainly was nothing wrong with citizens like Mary Shepard standing up for the right to carry a weapon in church. The problem is with people like Paxton, who believe that carrying a weapon in church can put an end to mass shootings. dglanton@chicagotribune.com Twitter @dahleeng RELATED CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"
http://theconversation.com/most-mass-killers-are-men-who-have-also-attacked-family-87230,"Senior Lecturer, University Without Walls, University of Massachusetts Amherst Lisa Aronson Fontes does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.  University of Massachusetts Amherst provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation US. The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations View the full list What do most mass killers have in common? As a researcher who studies coercive control in intimate relationships, I can point out a few key characteristics. First, they are men. Additionally, they have a history of controlling and abusing their wives and girlfriends – and sometimes other family members – before “graduating” to mass killings. Considering a few recent examples makes the pattern clearer. Devin P. Kelley, 26, who shot to death 26 people and injured 20 more at a Texas church on Nov. 5, had kicked, beaten and choked his first wife and infant stepson, fracturing the baby’s skull. In the following years, he was investigated for other charges of violence against women including sexual assault and rape. Since 1996, those convicted of domestic violence – even misdemeanor offenses – are supposed to be entered into the National Criminal Information Database and permanently barred from legally purchasing guns. However, Air Force officials neglected to register Kelley’s conviction, leaving him free to walk into a sporting goods store and purchase the rifle used to murder Texas churchgoers. A congressional report determined such registration failures happen at least 30 percent of the time. Esteban Santiago, charged with killing five travelers in a mass shooting at the Fort Lauderdale airport in January 2017, was previously accused of assaulting and strangling his girlfriend. Spencer Hight shot and killed his estranged wife and seven of her friends who had gathered to watch football on TV in Plano, Texas. These family-based mass shootings rarely gain the same kind of publicity as those conducted in public, perhaps because the average person mistakenly thinks they can avoid being victimized if the shooting occurs “in the family.”  From Jan. 1 to Nov. 5, 2017, the U.S. experienced 307 mass shootings, which the government defines as a shooting that kills or injures four or more people. However, not all domestic violence perpetrators who become mass killers use guns. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who planned and executed the Boston Marathon bombing along with his younger brother, had been arrested for assaulting his girlfriend. Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, who plowed a truck through a crowd in Nice, France in 2016, killing 82, and Khalid Masood, who killed five and injured 50 driving through a crowd in Westminster, London, both controlled and abused the women in their lives. An obvious question arises. If domestic violence laws were more effective, could perpetrators be caught earlier? Could they be deprived of their access to weapons, jailed when necessary and given the kinds of intensive intervention and supervision that would curb their behavior? In other words, could stronger domestic violence laws prevent some mass shootings? The laws in the U.S. that are currently used to address domestic violence were developed for attacks by unrelated people. They don’t work so well for what happens in families. A bar fight is over when the violence ends, but abusive violence in couples does not end. In as many as 40 percent of cases, the abuser assaults his partner several times a week and sometimes daily, often over many years. Most domestic violence incidents involve pushes, slaps, kicks, pulling hair and the like. If police wait for broken bones, they miss more than 95 percent of domestic violence incidents. As Evan Stark of Rutgers University points out, the seriousness of partner violence derives from the cumulative weight of all previous abuse, rather than the severity of a particular assault. U.S. law does not adequately address these “minor” violent incidents, nor the constant intimidation, harassment, monitoring and the limiting of a partner’s freedom that is so typical of violent control in couples. In 2015, England and Wales made controlling a current or former partner a serious crime. This new offense recognizes the harm that can result from an ongoing pattern of controlling behavior. A relative of Westminster car attacker Masood’s ex-wife is quoted in The Guardian describing their relationship: “He was very violent towards her, controlling in every aspect of her life – what she wore, where she went, everything.” Masood’s behavior is an example of coercive control. Coercive control combines tactics designed to instill fear, like violence and threats, with tactics that isolate a partner, degrade her and deprive her of basic rights. Eighty percent of abused women are being coercively controlled and not simply hit. In the U.K., police and prosecutors have undergone intensive training related to the criminalization of coercive control. Police have learned to use an incident of reported domestic violence as a window through which to examine the entire relationship. One of the earliest convictions for coercive control concerns a 30-year-old named Nigel Wolitter, who was arrested for vandalizing machinery belonging to his partner’s family to punish her for refusing to give him money for marijuana. As a result of their new training, police traced Wolitter’s vandalism to a 13-year pattern of dominating his girlfriend. The prosecution linked photos of injuries from his partner’s cellphone with her compelling testimony that he had “controlled every aspect of my life from where I went to what I wore, to what possessions he allowed me to own.” Wolitter received a 
4.5-year sentence. It’s the pattern of enforced subordination that is the problem here, not one or two incidents. Changing the domestic violence laws to include coercive control will draw attention to serious cases of controlling behavior and obligate law enforcement to examine them more closely. According to the American nonprofit organization Everytown for Gun Safety, an average of 50 women in the U.S. are shot to death each month by a current or former intimate partner. While most domestic abusers will not become mass murderers, early, consistent and effective domestic violence intervention might keep us all safer. Global Challenges Podcast Series 2

https://www.ocregister.com/2017/11/06/rifle-handguns-linked-to-gunman-in-texas-church-shooting/,"Trending: SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas  — The man who authorities say carried out the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history had a rifle and two handguns with him. Devin Patrick Kelley opened fire during worship services at a small church in Sutherland Springs, southeast of San Antonio, killing 26 people and wounding 20 others. Investigators say based on evidence at the scene they believe Kelley, 26, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after he was chased by bystanders and crashed his car. Here is a glance at what officials have said regarding the weapons they found and Kelley: — Three guns were recovered. A Ruger AR-556 rifle was found at the church. Two handguns were recovered from Kelley’s vehicle — a Glock 9 mm and a Ruger .22-caliber. Kelley purchased all three guns, authorities said. — Kelley owned a total of four guns, law enforcement authorities said. He bought one per year from 2014 to 2017. Two were purchased in Texas and two in Colorado. — Kelley did not have a license to carry a concealed handgun, authorities said. In Texas, you don’t have to have a license to buy or own a handgun, just to carry a handgun in public. In Texas, one does not need a license to carry a long rifle. Kelley did have a license to serve as an unarmed private security guard. — Kelley served at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge in 2014. Kelley was found guilty of abusing his wife and her son and received a bad-conduct discharge from the Air Force. He had faced a court-martial in 2012 on the allegations and served 12 months of confinement. It’s unclear if the Defense Department reported his conviction to the federal database that is used to conduct background checks on citizens looking to purchase a firearm.

https://www.inquisitr.com/4601691/texas-church-shooting-motive-domestic-devin-kelley-threatened-former-mother-in-law-who-attended-church/,"Devin Kelley is dead. After killing more than half of the parishioners who had gathered in a small Baptist church in Texas on Sunday, he took his own life. He cannot unravel the mystery surrounding this horrific act of carnage, but authorities are doing everything within their power to get the answers to the many questions that are still unanswered today. The 26-year-old shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, lived in New Braunfels, which is about 35 miles away from the Sunderland Springs church that he targeted with carnage on Sunday morning, according to Business Insider. He was not a member of that church and has never been a member there, the authorities report. Kelley's ex-in-laws were known to attend Sunday services at this church, but they weren't there on Sunday. From the details that have emerged so far today, his former in-law's attendance at that church wasn't on a regular basis, according to Sheriff Joe D. Tackitt Jr. Despite Kelley's in-laws attending the church from ""time to time,"" it still wasn't clear to Tackitt why Kelley targeted this church, he told reporters. At the press conference on Monday morning, it was revealed that there was a domestic situation going on within this family, and Kelley's former mother-in-law did attend this church. There were threatening messages involved, but the authorities would not elaborate any further. This incident was not a random act or religiously motivated, according to the officials at Monday morning's press conference. ""He expressed anger toward his mother-in-law,"" said the officials when pressed for details about the messages. The officials at the press conference also clarified that the ages of those who were killed in the church ranged from 18-months-old to 73-years-old. Those in the hospital who are wounded range from 5-years-old to 72. According to the Statesman today, Texas Governor Greg Abbott stated, ""I don't think this was just a random act of violence."" He also called Devin Kelley a ""very deranged individual."" The authorities suggest that Kelley didn't just pick out any church for his shooting rampage -- he had this one in mind. Governor Abbott said that he expects people will learn about that link between Kelley and this church within the days that follow.  He was sentenced to a year in prison for this charge. When he got out, he lost his ranking in the Air Force and was discharged under ""bad conduct."" Records indicate that he was divorced in 2012, the same year as he was court-martialed. Ed Davis, who is the former Boston Police Commissioner, spoke with Fox News during their live coverage of the Texas church shooting aftermath. He suggests that the information the investigators find out about this case can help identify the precursor to this tragedy. The Statesman suggests, ""It's become so common that the greatest predictor of who will commit a mass shooting is identifying people who've committed domestic assault.""  The Statesman reports, ""The men behind the fatal mass shootings at Orlando's Pulse nightclub, a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood, D.C.'s Republican Congressional softball practice, Sandy Hook Elementary, Virginia Tech, and, most recently, a concert on the Las Vegas strip — they all had a history of domestic abuse.""

Speaking at the University of Chicago, Cupich said: “We need to take action. We need to tell our legislators that we need to ban these high-powered weapons.” It’s not the first time that Cupich, a keen hunter and supporter of hunters’ rights, has called for tougher gun laws. But he was as pointed as he has been in his criticism of Republican politicians who toe the National Rifle Association’s line on gun control (President Donald Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan have offered their prayers after Sunday’s atrocity, but none has supported an assault weapons ban). “When the hunting sport has human prey, we have to take action,” Cupich said. Cupich described the murder of 26 worshippers as “a violation of … our relationship with God and with one another.” While he said the mental health services offered to the killer should be looked at, he added, “The time, however, for expressing sorrow and leaving it at that is over. It’s time to act.” “Let’s start with these high-powered weapons. Both state and federal law need to change to make these guns not available. We don’t need military weapons in our society. We’re not supposed to be at war with one another.” Cupich said he was “sympathetic” to those among his flock who may be reluctant to go to church following the mass shooting, but he said failing to attend would “only let these people win.” He said he did not want to step up security at Catholic churches in the archdiocese because, “Once we begin to make our churches safety zones in a military-style approach, we’re going to lose something of the character of our places of worship.” Instead, he said, voters should put pressure on politicians to enact an assault weapons ban. “Let’s not be naive about this,” he said. “This is a money issue. It’s nothing about the Second Amendment. It’s about people who want to make money on these weapons and really don’t care about the human cost.” “But a good place to start is that many of these killings would not have taken place if these weapons were not available. Let’s be honest about that. Let’s get these weapons out of the hands of people. We don’t need to be selling them.” Cupich, who spoke on stage with journalist E.J. Dionne, also spoke out against libertarianism, saying it separates people from one another and from themselves. Neither the NRA nor spokesmen for the Republican leadership immediately responded to Cupich’s comments.  kjanssen@chicagotribune.com Twitter @kimjnews RELATED CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"

Festival from his hotel room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip.

The gunman was identified as Stephen Paddock, 64, of Mesquite, Nevada. They said he acted alone. Investigators said they 
found 47 firearms in three locations, including Paddock's room at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino and his home.

Only last year, a similar such incident occurred at a night club in 
Orlando, Florida, 
where 49 people lost their lives in a mass shooting. Las Vegas police reported that a single gunman opened fire on concertgoers attending the Route 91 Harvest Country Music

Read: At least 26 killed in mass shooting at Texas church. Voters prefer Democrats in 2018 poll: Voters say they prefer Democratic candidates for the House of Representatives over Republicans by the widest margin in more than a decade, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. A 51% majority of registered voters say that if the election were held today, they would vote for or lean toward the Democratic candidate in their congressional district, while 40% say they would choose the Republican. That is the biggest spread in a Post-ABC survey since October 2006 — just weeks before a midterm in which Democrats won back control of the House and Senate amid dissatisfaction with President George W. Bush and the Iraq war. Menendez could remain even if convicted: Lawyers for Sen. Bob Menendez have a final chance Monday to persuade the jury hearing his corruption case in Newark, N.J., that the veteran lawmaker is not guilty. Politico writes his fellow Democrats are quietly strategizing on how to respond if he is found guilty — and will be in no rush to force him out of office. If he is found guilty, Senate Republicans are expected to try to expel him from the Senate. But doing so would require a two-thirds majority, meaning they would need Democratic votes. Brady sees small-business support for tax plan: House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady says he believes he’ll be able to get a leading small-business group on board with the House GOP’s tax bill. The National Federation of Independent Business, or NFIB, said it couldn’t support the measure in its current form, arguing it doesn’t provide tax relief for enough small businesses. The Hill reports Brady saying the panel is continuing to look at ways to simplify rules relating to the new lower rate for “pass through” businesses, which includes many small businesses.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2017/11/07/daily-202-how-the-virginia-governor-s-race-might-scare-republicans-away-from-criminal-justice-reform/5a01249530fb0468e7654192/?undefined=&utm_term=.155758a1e7bc&wpisrc=nl_politics&wpmm=1,"This article is more than 1 year old with Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve With Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve THE BIG IDEA: The potency of Ed Gillespie’s law-and-order message in the Virginia governor’s race may have a chilling effect on criminal justice reform efforts around the country by deterring other Republicans from taking up the issue. In the closing weeks of the campaign, the Republican gubernatorial nominee has blistered his Democratic rival for supporting Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s order that restored voting rights to felons, including a sex offender who completed his sentence and was rearrested, but not convicted, on child pornography charges. Both sides believe that this line of attack has been a significant factor in allowing Gillespie to close the gap with Ralph Northam in public and private polls. Democrats involved in the race believe that ads on this theme, which they say are unfair and misleading, have shrunk their lead by a couple of points — both by appealing to suburban swing voters and consolidating support for Gillespie among people who love Donald Trump but have viewed the former Republican National Committee chairman warily. In a tweetstorm from Asia this morning, the president echoed Gillespie’s closing message: Conservative elites, led by the Koch brothers, have championed policy initiatives in recent years to encourage more leniency for convicts and to improve reentry programs for after they get out. They’ve made strides around the country, even in deep red states, and came close to getting a federal bill through the Senate last year. Criminal justice reform is a much tougher sell politically than substantively. There will always be recidivism, and bad people will fall through the cracks. If a lawmaker votes for something or a governor issues an order to give a wayward apple another chance at rejoining society, but that apple continues to be rotten, it’s as easy as apple pie to produce commercials that make them eat it. That’s why the Willie Horton ad against Michael Dukakis in 1988 helped lead to a generation of tougher sentences and less sympathy, even for nonviolent drug offenders. Politicizing crime this way has led to a massive overcrowding of prisons. Trump broke with the zeitgeist by running a lock-her-up-and-throw-away-the-key kind of campaign. Then he appointed Jeff Sessions, who has long been the single biggest obstacle to criminal justice reform in the Senate, as attorney general. Republicans like Gillespie are now following his lead. Ambitious Republicans, especially those with 2020 and/or 2024 presidential aspirations, are watching today’s off-year election in Virginia for lessons they might learn. They are already familiar with recent history. As governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee issued more than 1,000 commutations and pardons. He got political mileage out of it at the time, but the effort backfired in 2009 when one of the convicts whose sentence he commuted killed four police officers. Vulnerability on this issue was one of the reasons he opted not to seek the Republican nomination in 2012. -- Some background on what happened in Virginia if you haven’t been following the story: “In one of the few states that permanently disenfranchises felons, McAuliffe (D) has restored the right to vote and to serve on juries to more than 168,000 felons who have completed their sentences. His action also helped them over the first hurdle to have their gun rights restored, although the felons still need judges to sign off,” Laura Vozzella and Fenit Nirappil explain. What the narrator says in Gillespie’s ad: “Last year, Terry McAuliffe and Ralph Northam instituted the automatic restoration of rights for violent felons and sex offenders, making it easier for them to obtain firearms and allowing them to serve on juries. One of these felons, John Bowen, had his rights restored two months after being found with one of the largest child pornography collections in Virginia’s history.” A shorter version of the ad ends with a clip of Northam, the lieutenant governor, calling the restoration of rights “one of our greatest feats.” What actually happened: Bowen was convicted of aggravated sexual battery and indecent liberties with a minor in 2001 and served a one-year sentence. Like other felons who had completed their sentences, he had his rights restored under McAuliffe. Bowen lost his voting rights again in January when he pleaded guilty to a new felony, possession of child pornography. He is now serving 15 years in prison. (The Virginian-Pilot has more details on the Bowen case.) The Northam campaign cries foul: “Gillespie is running a fact-free, fear-mongering campaign in vintage Trump fashion,” said spokesman David Turner. “It is a new low for him to accuse a pediatrician and children's hospice medical director of favoring felons who have hurt children.” Gillespie’s campaign says he supports criminal justice reform if it’s “tough, fair and smart.” A white paper released around Labor Day said he would seek a permanent legislative solution and follow the lead of former Republican governor Bob McDonnell, who simplified and accelerated the process without automatically restoring voting rights. The Koch network endorsed this approach when Gillespie unveiled the plan. -- McAuliffe, a potential Democratic candidate for president in 2020, considers the restoration of voting rights his proudest achievement in office. He has reacted angrily to Gillespie’s attack ad. “In 40 states, you couldn’t run that ad because it’s automatic. There’s no governor involved. I just made Virginia the 41st state,” he said during a get-out-the-vote rally in Fairfax over the weekend. “These people deserve second chances! They’ve served their time. They’re back in society. … This is not a Democratic or a Republican issue. This is a human rights issue!” -- Every vote counts: Republican operative Rick Gates, the senior aide on Trump’s presidential campaign who was indicted as part of the special counsel’s Russia investigation, received permission from a federal judge to leave house arrest today so that he can vote in the Virginia election. Northam’s campaign said it doesn’t object to Gates receiving permission to vote but accused Gillespie of hypocrisy for not opposing Gates’s request. Gillespie aides declined to comment. -- Gillespie is as well positioned as he could hope for going into today, but he remains the underdog. Demographics and the national environment (Trump’s approval rating is 38 percent among likely voters in our poll) give the advantage to Northam. Virginia is trending blue. It was the only Southern state Hillary Clinton won a year ago today. And the state has a long history of electing a governor of the opposite party from the president. -- Three polls published yesterday give Northam a slight edge but show a very close race: -- Polls are open in Virginia until 7 p.m. Eastern. -- Four other states we’re watching today: WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: -- DHS has told 2,500 Nicaraguans living here with provisional residency status they have 14 months to leave the country. But it's allowing 14,000 Hondurans with the same status to stay while it continues to deliberate their fate. Nick Miroff reports. “The decision was likely to displease immigration hard-liners who have urged the administration to end the TPS program on the grounds that it was never intended to bestow long-term residency to those who may have entered the country illegally. But DHS Acting Secretary Elaine Duke appeared to deliberate on the decision right up to Monday night’s deadline, and the six-month extension for Hondurans punts the decision to Duke’s successor.” The announcement comes one week after Rex Tillerson sent a letter to Duke essentially giving DHS a green light to lift protections for Central Americans and Haitians, writing that conditions in those countries “no longer warranted an exemption from deportation.” TEXAS SHOOTING LATEST: -- The South Texas church massacre that left 26 people dead came amid a “domestic dispute” between the gunman and his family, some of whom attended the small Baptist church. Eva Ruth Moravec and Mark Berman report: “While few clues were initially offered about what made [Devin Patrick] Kelley target a church in tiny Sutherland Springs, officials had suggested family ties could have played a role. Joe D. Tackitt Jr., the Wilson County sheriff, said Monday that Kelley’s in-laws had attended the church but were not present Sunday. They came to the scene after the shooting.” Authorities said that in addition to the 26 people who were slain in Sunday’s attack, another 20 were injured – at least 10 of whom remain in critical condition. Texas authorities reported that Kelley suffered three gunshot wounds, including a self-inflicted shot to the head. He was also shot in the leg and torso by an armed citizen. (CNN’s Holly Yan, AnneClaire Stapleton and Darran Simon) -- Kelley was discharged from the Air Force for bad conduct in 2014, which should have precluded him from obtaining firearms. “[Kelley] was court-martialed in 2012 and sentenced to a year in military prison for assaulting his then-wife and her child,” our colleagues write. “According to court martial documents … Kelley kicked, choked and struck his wife in 2011 and 2012. He also struck her young child ‘on the head and body with a force likely to produce death or grievous bodily harm[.]” -- The Air Force said it failed to follow procedures for alerting law enforcement about Kelly’s violent past, which allowed him to procure the weapons used in Sunday’s mass shooting. “Initial information indicates that Kelley’s domestic violence offense was not entered into the National Criminal Information Center database,” Air Force spokesman Ann Stefanek said in a statement. She added that Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson and Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein have directed an investigation of Kelley’s case and “relevant policies and procedures.” (Alex Horton) THE VICTIMS: -- The names of those who died in the shooting are beginning to be released. Here are a few of their stories: -- The Holcombes lost eight members of their extended family. The New York Times’s Shannon Sims, Julie Turkewitz and Christina Caron report: “Bryan and Karla Holcombe, a guest preacher and his wife, were dead. Their son Marc Daniel Holcombe, gone. Their pregnant daughter-in-law, Crystal Holcombe, gone. And four of their grandchildren — Noah, Emily, Megan and Greg — gone. … [T]he gunman nearly wiped out the Holcombe family, leaving Joe Holcombe, 86, Bryan’s father, to mourn the loss of the generations he had raised. ‘We know where they are now,’ he said in an interview, his voice strained by exhaustion. ‘All of our family members, they’re all Christian. And it won’t be long until we’re with them.’” -- The shooting in Sutherland Springs was actually the second deadly act of violence at a place of worship on Sunday. Cleve R. Wootson Jr. reports: “[A] month ago, Martha Garcia filed for divorce, Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer told reporters. Shortly after, Martha Garcia told family and friends that there was a new man in her life. The new couple had attended a 7:30 a.m. Mass at St. Alphonsus Church on Sunday. An hour later, officers were called to the church parking lot, where they found the couple in a car, both with gunshot wounds to the head. Martha Garcia was dead. Her boyfriend, whose identity has not been released, died a little while later. Manuel Garcia, authorities said, killed them both.” THE OFFICIAL RESPONSE: -- Addressing the tragedy in Seoul earlier today, Trump asserted that, if Texas was a state with stricter gun regulations, “hundreds more” might have died. David Nakamura reports: “Asked during a news conference here whether he would entertain ‘extreme vetting’ on guns, Trump appeared irritated by the question and suggested it was not appropriate to talk about ‘in the heart of South Korea.’ He then answered by saying ‘if we did what you are suggesting it would have made no difference three days ago.’ … Trump referred to [Stephen Willeford, who exchanged fire with Kelley outside the church] as a ‘brave man’ and said ‘if he had not had a gun, instead of having 26 dead, you would have had hundreds more dead … It’s not going to help.’” -- And Congress is likely to do nothing to step up the country's gun laws. Ed O'Keefe and Sean Sullivan report: The shooting “Although Democrats and some Republicans have introduced dozens of proposals this year to address gun violence, there is no bill poised for consideration in a House or Senate committee or scheduled for an up-or-down vote. … A senior [House Judiciary Committee] aide would say only that the panel is in touch with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the FBI about the shooting. ATF is also set to brief Judiciary Committee members this week on the use of bump stocks, aides said.” -- ATF officials have reportedly told Congress they believe it lacks the authority to regulate bump stocks. Politico’s Seung Min Kim and Heather Caygle report. -- Counterpoint: The gun lobby hasn't advanced pro-gun legislation, despite Trump’s support of the NRA. Boston Globe’s Annie Linskey and Evan Horowitz report: “The NRA’s top agenda item is to pass a federal law that would allow a gun owner with a permit to carry a concealed weapon in one state to conceal that weapon in any other state that issues such permits, which is virtually every state in the country. … Despite Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress and more than 200 co-sponsors on the main bill for the measure, called ‘concealed carry reciprocity,’ there have been no hearings held on the bill, and it seems to be stalled.” -- Fierce gun-control advocate Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who represents the state where the Newtown massacre happened in 2012, issued a statement worth reading, though its tone is dark. “The paralysis you feel right now — the impotent helplessness that washes over you as news of another mass slaughter scrolls across the television screen — isn’t real. It's a fiction created and methodically cultivated by the gun lobby, designed to assure that no laws are passed to make America safer, because those laws would cut into their profits,” he wrote. “None of this is inevitable.” -- Meanwhile, Texas’s attorney general called for beefed-up security measures at places of worship. Lindsey Bever and Kristine Phillips report. GET SMART FAST:​​ The federal jury in the corruption trial of Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) began deliberating yesterday. Jurors will decide whether the senator misused his office to support a friend and donor. (Alan Maimon) Saudi Arabia accused Iran of direct responsibility for last week’s missile strike on Riyadh, significantly ramping up tensions in the region as it warned the attack may be an “act of war.” (Kareem Fahim) Democrats in Oklahoma have won three GOP state legislative districts in special elections since Trump’s victory last year. But the Democratic newcomers largely won by embracing pieces of Trump’s playbook, namely an emphasis on their status as political outsiders. (Robert Samuels) THE TAX OVERHAUL INCHES FORWARD: -- The day-long markup of the GOP tax bill resulted in only minor changes, sidestepping requests from Trump that the legislation include a repeal of the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate. Mike DeBonis reports: “House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.) offered an amendment that would tweak the way the bill would tax the earnings of investment managers, cross-border transactions by multi­national corporations and the endowments of private universities. The amendment did not make other, more costly changes to business taxation[.] … [Brady said] that ‘we are not including various health-tax related measures as part of our tax reform efforts,’ though he did not specifically rule out repealing the ACA’s individual mandate. ‘We will move to these important policies separately and immediately after conclusion of our tax reform efforts,’ Brady said.” -- Big Oops: The Tax Policy Center was forced to retract its report on the plan after it discovered an error in its calculations. Heather Long reports: “Republicans and Democrats alike have cited the TPC’s assessment of tax proposals in recent years, but the error opens the organization to attacks from either party should lawmakers not like its conclusions. The uncorrected version of the report released Monday showed that the bulk of the House GOP bill’s benefits would go to the wealthy and that many working class households earning under $48,000 would see their tax bills rise in upcoming years. … Someone familiar with the error who was not authorized to speak publicly said the revised report would likely come to a similar conclusion overall, but that exact numbers of how many Americans are helped and hurt would be different.” -- The White House’s Marc Short and Gary Cohn will sit down today with moderate Democratic senators. Ed O’Keefe reports: “What, if any, substantive change to the emerging proposals might come out of the meeting is unclear — but it will allow the White House and these moderate Democrats to claim that they are at least trying to forge bipartisan consensus. … Despite being shut out of the tax debate, [the Democrats] attending Tuesday’s meeting have insisted they are eager to reach accord with Republicans.” -- Special interest groups are now flooding the zone to secure favorable changes to the bill. Politico’s Theodoric Meyer reports: “Trade associations in Washington have sent emails to their members across the country and held conferences calls to try to figure out the best way to convince the Ways and Means Committee to spare deductions and tax credits they view as essential to their industries. Now, many of the groups are settling on strategies for spurring their members to act or identifying members of Congress they will pressure to amend the proposal.” TRUMP IN ASIA: -- Trump has arrived in South Korea, where he will give a speech to the country’s National Assembly. South Korean officials hope the president will use the speech to lay out a concrete policy on the North Korean nuclear threat. David Nakamura and Ashley Parker report: “The administration has made progress in ramping up pressure on the North, but analysts said many in Seoul, as well as Tokyo and Beijing, remain confused because Trump and his senior aides have offered mixed messages. … A senior administration official said Trump will use his speech to highlight the North Korean regime's long history of human rights abuses — on its own people and abroad.” In a news conference earlier today, Trump asserted that he was making “a lot of progress” with North Korea. Our colleagues report: “[H]e urged dictator Kim Jong Un to ‘make a deal’ at the negotiating table on the rogue nation's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. ‘I believe it makes sense for North Korea to do the right thing, not only for North Korea but for humanity all over the world,’ Trump said . . . ‘I do see certain movement, yes, but we'll see what happens.’ He offered no proof or details.” -- After South Korea, Trump will head to China, where President Xi Jinping hopes to woo Trump and will give him the full red-carpet treatment. The New York Times’s Jane Perlez and Mark Landler report: “The Chinese are calling it ‘a state visit-plus,’ promising grand pageantry in the Great Hall of the People and the ancient roofed pavilions of the Forbidden City. The welcome is planned to make Mr. Trump feel important[.] … But the pomp will also be a chance for Mr. Xi to showcase his ‘China Dream’ — a vision of his nation joining or perhaps supplanting the United States as a superpower leading the world. Mr. Xi is expected to propose some version of what he has called a ‘new type of great power relations,’ the idea that China and the United States should share global leadership as equals and break a historical pattern of conflict between rising and established powers.” -- Ashley Parker analyzes the relationship between Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe: “Their relationship can seem like an oddball mismatch of global leaders who are thrust together over their shared dislike of the nuclear-armed tyrant next door in North Korea but who somehow hit it off amid golf course high jinks. Since Trump took office, Abe has been his most consistent suitor, courting him with luxurious gifts … and constant attention[.] … [But] their relationship has retained a subtext in which the U.S. president insists on asserting his dominance in a passive-aggressive manner. … [Trump] has continued to show who is the alpha — a price Abe appears willing to pay in his strategic servitude to keep Trump supporting the postwar security alliance that the president had openly questioned in his election campaign.” THERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS: -- Russia’s support for Trump’s presidential campaign began on Facebook and Twitter just weeks after he announced his candidacy in June 2015, the Wall Street Journal’s Mark Maremont and Rob Barry report: “A U.S. intelligence assessment released early this year concluded the Kremlin developed a ‘clear preference’ for Mr. Trump over [Clinton], but cited December 2015 as the earliest suspected time that Russian social-media accounts advocated for Mr. Trump … The earlier starting point of pro-Trump tweets highlights the breadth of the Russian effort to manipulate social media during the 2016 election.” -- Newly released records show that during a trip to Moscow last year, Carter Page sent an email to fellow Trump campaign associates describing “a private conversation” with a senior Russian official who spoke highly of Trump. Rosalind S. Helderman, Matt Zapotosky and Karoun Demirjian report: “Page also wrote that he had been provided ‘incredible insights and outreach’ by Russian lawmakers and ‘senior members’ of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s administration during the trip. The email appeared to contradict earlier statements by Page, who had said he had only exchanged brief greetings with the senior Russian official, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich, after he delivered a speech at a Russian university.” -- BuzzFeed subpoenaed the DNC for information related to the Democratic hack — marking the publication's latest attempt to defend itself from a libel lawsuit after publishing the now-infamous Trump dossier. Foreign Policy reports: “Aleksej Gubarev, a Russian technology executive, has sued BuzzFeed for libel for its decision to publish a series of memos authored by the former British spy Christopher Steele. Those memos — part of a so-called ‘dossier’ of information about [Trump’s] alleged ties to Russia, include claims strongly denied by Gubarev that his companies were recruited by the Kremlin’s security organs to break into Democratic Party computer systems ahead of the 2016 election. BuzzFeed is trying to figure out if the allegations relating to its libel suit are true as part of its defense strategy that could end up revealing details of the dossier and the DNC hack that have not been made public.” -- The judge handling the case against Paul Manafort and his deputy, Rick Gates, suggested that Robert Mueller’s team was being “too lenient” in negotiating a bail package. Politico’s Josh Gerstein reports: “U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson said her inclination was to impose stricter conditions on Manafort and Gates than the prosecution team was proposing, but she said she might acquiesce after she gets details of the agreement defense lawyers are trying to strike with Mueller's team. A magistrate judge put Manafort and Gates in home confinement last week after they were [charged in a 12-count indictment]. Manafort agreed to pay $10 million if he failed to appear in court and Gates agreed to pay $5 million . . . "" -- Meanwhile, Trump’s longtime body guard and former White House aide Keith Schiller is slated to testify today before the House Intelligence Committee about Trump’s 2013 trip to Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant. Politico’s Annie Karni reports. “In interviews with more than half a dozen White House officials and former advisers, many shrugged off the potential for any big revelation to come out of Schiller’s testimony. But many Trump officials and friends said their main concern is that the sight of Trump's longest-serving and closest aide … being hauled in front of a committee could aggravate Trump as he enters a series of high-stakes meetings with the Chinese on his 12-day trip through Asia.” MORE PARADISE PAPER REVELATIONS: -- A top aide to Wilbur Ross served on the board of Navigator Holdings — the shipping company revealed to have “significant” business ties to Putin — while working in the Trump administration. Politico’s Lorraine Woellert, Nancy Cook and Andrew Restuccia report: “Wendy Teramoto retained her seat on Navigator’s board after joining Commerce in mid-March as a part-time adviser to Ross, one of the most influential voices in [Trump’s] ear on global trade and economic policy. Teramoto didn’t resign her seat on Navigator’s board until July 17 … On Aug. 1, she was formally named Ross’s chief of staff. A Commerce spokesman downplayed Teramoto’s role, describing her job [until] Aug. 1 as a ‘part-time special government position …’ [but] two government employees who have worked with Teramoto described her role at Commerce during the months she remained on Navigator’s board as more significant, saying she was Ross’s closest ally and aide.” -- Ross indicated he would “probably not” keep his stake in the Russian-linked shipping company, though he insisted in an interview that his investment did not pose a conflict of interest. The New York Times’s Mike McIntire reports: “He also defended Navigator’s business dealings with Sibur, saying there was ‘nothing whatsoever wrong with it.’ Navigator was not listed in an ethics agreement Mr. Ross submitted in January that described the investments he intended to keep after joining the Trump administration. It had appeared in an earlier filing showing his assets as of December 2016 . . . "" -- GOP megadonor Robert Mercer has now been implicated in the papers as well. The Guardian’s Jon Swaine reports: “Leaked documents and newly obtained public filings show how the billionaire Mercer family built a $60m war chest for conservative causes inside their family foundation by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax. The offshore vehicle was part of a network of companies in the Atlantic tax haven of Bermuda led by [Mercer.] … Mercer, 71, appears as a director of eight Bermuda companies in the Paradise Papers[.]” -- Bigger picture: “The number of Russian connections to President Trump’s campaign and to his administration should stun and worry even the most credulous Republicans,” Post columnist Jennifer Rubin writes. “The blizzard of Russia connections between members of Trump’s team, including his son Donald Trump Jr. … and son-in-law, top members of his administration (the attorney general, former national security adviser [Michael] Flynn) and his campaign (Manafort, George Papadopoulos, Page), coupled with the utter lack of candor about such ties, all take place in the context of an election in which Russia executed a sophisticated plan to interfere in our democracy.” THE REST OF TRUMP’S AGENDA: -- Trump has reportedly prepared an executive order weakening the ACA’s individual mandate. Juliet Eilperin and Sean Sullivan report: “The draft order would broaden the ‘hardship exemption’ that the Obama administration established for those who face extraordinary circumstances, according to people familiar with the matter. … The Treasury Department, which enforces the mandate, has traditionally granted this exemption in cases such as the death of a family member, bankruptcy, a natural disaster, or when a taxpayer cannot afford to pay his or her utilities.” But those familiar with the matter cautioned that Trump has not abandoned the goal of repealing the mandate through legislative routes. -- Meanwhile, the number of participants in Obamacare’s exchanges has surged in the opening days of enrollment. Juliet reports: “More than 200,000 Americans chose a plan on Nov. 1, the day open enrollment began, according to one administration official. That’s more than double the number of consumers who signed up on the first day of enrollment last year. More than 1 million people visited HeathCare.gov, the official federal website, the official said, which amounts to roughly a 33 percent increase in traffic compared with 2016.” -- Energy Secretary Rick Perry’s plan for revamping electricity markets could provide a windfall for prominent Trump supporter Bob Murray’s coal company. Politico’s Darius Dixon and Eric Wolff report: “Perry's plan would force consumers to subsidize ailing coal-fired and nuclear power plants with billions of dollars, in what he calls an effort to ensure that the nation’s power network can withstand threats like terrorist attacks or severe weather. But his narrowly written proposal would mostly affect plants in a stretch of the Midwest and Northeast where Murray's mining company, Murray Energy, is the predominant supplier[.] … The company and its PAC together sent $200,000 to pro-Trump election efforts last year, while Bob Murray threw an invitation-only West Virginia fundraiser for Trump in 2016.” WEINSTEIN'S P.R. MACHINE: -- The New Yorker published Ronan Farrow’s latest look at Harvey Weinstein, reporting that Weinstein employed an elaborate system of lawyers and intelligence companies (yes, that's right) to suppress sexual assault allegations against him: “In the fall of 2016 . . . [Weinstein] began to hire private security agencies to collect information on the women and the journalists trying to expose the allegations. According to dozens of pages of documents, and seven people directly involved in the effort, the firms that Weinstein hired included Kroll, which is one of the world’s largest corporate-intelligence companies, and Black Cube, an enterprise run largely by former officers of Mossad and other Israeli intelligence agencies. … “Two private investigators from Black Cube, using false identities, met with the actress Rose McGowan, who eventually publicly accused Weinstein of rape, to extract information from her. One of the investigators pretended to be a women’s-rights advocate and secretly recorded at least four meetings with McGowan. The same operative, using a different false identity and implying that she had an allegation against Weinstein, met twice with a journalist to find out which women were talking to the press. … The explicit goal of the investigations, laid out in one contract with Black Cube, signed in July, was to stop the publication of the abuse allegations against Weinstein[.] … Over the course of a year, Weinstein had the agencies ‘target,’ or collect information on, dozens of individuals, and compile psychological profiles that sometimes focused on their personal or sexual histories. Weinstein monitored the progress of the investigations personally.” -- How we got here: “The ‘Click’ Moment: How the Weinstein Scandal Unleashed a Tsunami,” by the New York Times's Jessica Bennett: “Forty years ago this month, Ms. magazine put sexual harassment on its cover for the first time. Understanding the sensitivity of the topic, the editors used puppets for the cover image — a male hand reaching into a woman’s blouse — rather than a photograph. It was banned from some supermarkets nonetheless. In 1977, the term sexual harassment had not been defined in the law and had barely entered the public lexicon. And yet, to read that Ms. article today, amid a profound shift in discourse, is to feel haunted by its familiarity … ‘What we have so far seen,’ the article stated, ‘is only the tip of a very large and very destructive iceberg.’” SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: Trump expressed his support for Saudi Arabia's leadership following the recent purge of influential citizens: From a former NSC spokesman for Barack Obama: One of The Post's White House reporters noted this of Trump's trip: A New Yorker cartoon addressed the tragedy in Texas: Sen.

He’s mostly ignored the sniping and second-guessing from Democratic operatives like Donna Brazile and Stan Greenberg, insisting he doesn’t even read the criticism. Even here in the Ivory Tower, though, 2016 is a subject he can’t avoid — and he’s presenting his last two years as a cautionary tale for a bunch of still-caffeinating twenty- and thirty-somethings.” -- The New York Times, “After a Tax Crackdown, Apple Found a New Shelter for Its Profits,” by Jesse Drucker and Simon Bowers: “Irish officials began to crack down on the tax structure Apple had exploited. So the iPhone maker went hunting for another place to park its profits, newly leaked records show. With help from law firms that specialize in offshore tax shelters, the company canvassed multiple jurisdictions before settling on the small island of Jersey, which typically does not tax corporate income. Apple has accumulated more than $128 billion in profits offshore, and probably much more, that is untaxed by the United States and hardly touched by any other country. Nearly all of that was made over the past decade.” HOT ON THE LEFT “Papa John's condemns new customers: White supremacists,” from Louisville Courier Journal: “In the days following a rant by Papa John's CEO and Louisville resident John Schnatter where he blamed the NFL and anthem protests for low sales, a white-supremacist publication claimed it as their official pizza.  In a blog post at the Daily Stormer, a photo of pizza with pepperonis arranged in a swastika has a caption that reads ‘Papa John: Official pizza of the alt-right?’ … Peter Collins, the senior director of public relations at Papa John’s, said the company was taken off-guard by the endorsement. ‘We condemn racism in all forms and any and all hate groups that support it,’ Collins told Courier Journal. ‘We do not want these individuals or groups to buy our pizza.’” HOT ON THE RIGHT “In Early Draft, Comey Called Clinton ‘Grossly Negligent’ in Handling Emails,” from the Wall Street Journal: “James Comey’s early draft of a statement concerning allegations that Hillary Clinton and her top aides mishandled classified information called the former secretary of state’s actions ‘grossly negligent[.’] … According to documents received by Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), that language was included twice in a draft of Mr. Comey’s statement in May 2016. His final statement, delivered on July 5, 2016, used the phrase ‘extremely careless’ in describing Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private server. The phrase ‘gross negligence’ appears in a federal law governing the handling of classified information as the standard that makes the loss or removal of such information a federal crime. In the initial drafts, Mr. Comey still recommended against prosecution.”  DAYBOOK: Trump’s Asia swing continues. Today he’s in South Korea and will attend a state dinner with the first lady.

https://newsone.com/3757279/devin-patrick-kelley-texas-church-white-terrorist-shooter/,"Posted November 6, 2017  It never fails. There’s always plenty of doubt and caution before labeling a mass killing by a White suspect as terrorism. White privilege immediately kicks in: the pattern is to humanize the shooter and blame their lone wolf attack on mental illness. That’s true in the latest case. The police identified 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley as the man who gunned down worshippers on Sunday morning at a Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas—killing at least 26 people and wounding others. It’s the worst mass shooting in Texas history. READ MORE: What We Know About The Texas Church Shooting  President Donald Trump, who is usually quick to identify mass shootings as acts of terrorism, avoided the label this time. CNN reported that Trump said on Monday that Kelley has a “mental health problem,” describing him as “a very deranged individual.” Trump came into office promising to keep the nation safe from terrorist. He looked outside the borders and saw threats from majority Muslim countries and “bad hombres” sneaking into to the country.

But almost pathological excuses for White terrorism keeps coming. After the Las Vegas mass shooting—one of the deadliest in U.S. history with a death toll of 58—many are still reluctant to label the shooter a terrorist. Instead, Stephen Paddock has been humanized through stories about his love of country music and high-stakes gambling. There’s almost a sense of wanting to somehow empathize with the killer–White privilege.

http://www.indiewire.com/2017/11/trump-election-tv-impact-news-late-night-reality-sports-1201895268/,"By Ben Travers, Steve Greene, Liz Shannon Miller, Hanh Nguyen, Michael Schneider 
								Nov 8, 2017 5:30 pm Nov 8, 2017 5:30 pm FX/Shawn Thew/Epa/REX/Shutterstock/CBS A year after the Election That Shocked The World, Donald Trump has permeated almost every ounce of popular culture — especially television. Just about everything on the small screen these days ends up being interpreted through a political lens. Even things that once weren’t politicized have now been thrust into that world. That’s probably not surprising, given that the President of the United States is someone who has been obsessed with ratings, and winning an Emmy, over the years. He’s someone who spends all day consuming — and tweeting about — cable TV news, and often treats big announcements like he’s revealing the winner on “The Apprentice.” And that’s led to real-life storylines that would be dismissed as too outlandish or unbelievable if they were actually written on the page.  “This election happens and you have to reevaluate everything,” “Royal Pains” executive producer Michael Rauch said this summer at an ATX TV Festival panel about writing and producing in the age of Trump. “There’s a reset that happens… it forces us to evaluate what the meaning of truth is.”  Trump and his policies (if he has any beyond simply making himself wealthier) have turned the apolitical — like NFL games and Jimmy Kimmel — into the political. But he’s especially had an impact, just a year in, on television storytelling. Just days after the election last year, “Empire” executive producer Ilene Chaiken was fired up: “It necessitates our doubling down on our convictions. We were already telling those stories. [But] a lot of us feel more rage. It’s probably going to come out in some of what we write. We still want to tell great stories, we want to be entertaining. But if I had an agenda before, I sure as hell have an agenda now.” A “Will & Grace” revival may not have happened, or would have struck a very different tone, had Trump not been a candidate, and ultimately elected to office. A recent episode that took on anti-gay “conversion” camps, for example, included a visual reference of Vice President Mike Pence. The episode would have been very different, and not have the same urgency, under a Hillary Clinton administration, noted executive producer Max Mutchnick. “I think it’s great that we got to make that episode, but it’s unbelievable that probably two years ago, we felt like we were almost done with [gay discrimination] as a story in America.” Several shows changed storylines along the way in the wake of Trump; on “The Originals,” executive producer Julie Plec killed a love story that also involved a female character getting beaten up. Plec said it felt even more inappropriate in the wake of Trump’s boastful claims that he sexually assaulted women. “Your conscious can’t advocate that kind of violence and lean into that,” she said at the ATX panel.  The shock that Trump could be heard saying those things and still get elected president may have ironically played a role in finally exposing the rampant cases of sexual harassment and assault in Hollywood — as more victims felt the strength to come forward. The changed environment may have even had an impact on the Emmy Awards, where “The Handmaid’s Tale” — brimming with even more timely relevance — sweeped the major categories. “I watch it and think if Hilary were president this would be a very entertaining and intelligent show,” Plec said. Instead, “it is so harrowing in the context of the reality we live in. The speculative fiction feels so presently of today in a way that it absolutely wouldn’t have if Hillary were president.” If they do try to find a silver lining, it’s the amount of content that the world under Trump is now inspiring. “There’s a strong possibility that great art can come out of this and we can all be okay,” said Javier Grillo-Marxuach (“The Middleman”) at ATX. “The only way we survive is being the most honest version of ourselves and tell the world to go f— itself if they don’t like it.” Below, a roundup of how the new president has triggered a world where there is no precedence. Evan Peters, “American Horror Story: Cult” FX Television shows with scripted narratives have diverged on how it handles addressing the political climate post-election. On one hand, a handful of shows have tackled it head-on. “American Horror Story’s” latest season, “Cult,” opens on Election Night and offers up a drawn-out analogy of being ruled by fear, seen as clowns here, but clearly representing Trump. CBS All Access’ “The Good Fight” also opens on Election Night, and the real-life surprise results actually caused a scramble to rewrite the pilot. Protagonist Diane (Christine Baranski) had been a longtime Hillary supporter, and Trump taking office put more emphasis on the “fight” aspect of the show’s title. Meanwhile, Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer specifically wrote their episode “Witches” to address how women have reacted to but should not be cowed by the Misogynist in Chief, and even the return of “Will & Grace” included a plot in which Karen is buddies with the Trumps. On the other hand, some networks have used a much stealthier approach to storytelling that ignores all politics and instead offers a haven. Such counter-programming has been a balm for those who are filled with anxiety from the non-stop news and social media cycle of national infighting. The Hallmark Channel has been enjoying an uptick in viewers thanks to its uplifting programming, and ABC’s surprise hit medical drama “The Good Doctor” is an example of the “Warm Bath TV” that has been appealed to viewers seeking comfort and feel-good fare. Based on a South Korean program, the series centers on a doctor with autism and offers up an optimistic and ordered view of the world.  And then there are series like “South Park,” that engaged, changed, and fled: The long-running Comedy Central satire had been digging into serialized narratives over its most recent seasons, shifting from the episodic structure it began with to more thoroughly eviscerate big targets — like Donald Trump — over longer periods of time. Airing new episodes during the election, Season 20 was thrown completely off-kilter when Trump won, and the series not only shifted back to more traditional one-off stories in Season 21, creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone said they weren’t going to focus on Trump at all. The election didn’t just change the show. It changed how the creators approached the show.  The programming genre that many believe made a Donald Trump presidency possible certainly didn’t go unaffected by his victory. Unlike plenty of scripted series, it’s not that reality shows had to scramble to alter their plans: After all, if this is the genre that birthed President Trump, why would it need to shift course during his reign? But like the rest of television, its viewers were still changed. Perception, need, and framing all shifted post-election, and suddenly people weren’t mindlessly watching trash TV; they’re taking a much-needed break from reality. Reality television became a necessary escapism, much like certain scripted shows. Like the aforementioned success of “The Good Doctor,” the same logic that applies to seeing a good man do good things in a medical drama can apply to inspiring reality shows like A&E’s “Born This Way” or NBC’s “The Voice.” People need something to feel good about, and they’ll seek it out any way they can. And yet Trump’s shadow can cast a pall over even the most disconnected escapism. So much of his celebrity and familiarity was built on “The Apprentice”: Who’s to say it won’t happen again? What reality star that you’re watching to escape the current cultural turmoil will be the cause of the next? With everyone from Dwayne Johnson to Kid Rock being pitched as political candidates, and an “anything is possible” attitude toward taking every celebrity candidate seriously post-Trump, it’s hard to see reality TV the same way today.  For years, we’ve looked to late night television as a voice of sanity in insane times; while once upon a time, Walter Cronkite was the soothing voice telling America bad news, now we have Seth Meyers, Jimmy Kimmel, Trevor Noah, John Oliver, Samantha Bee, and Stephen Colbert not necessarily reporting on the events of the day, but helping Americans process what happened. And they’re benefiting from ratings increases as a result. How have things changed in the last year? Well, it’s hard to imagine Walter Cronkite calling his sitting President the sorts of names that Seth Meyers uses on a semi-regular basis. It’s hard to imagine really anything that’s happened in the last year, but perhaps the best way to find a positive in this is that our talk show hosts — they really talk now. They talk about the tragedies we face, they seek actively to engage with the conversations that America wants to have. Even the politically adverse Jimmy Fallon, in the aftermath of yet another mass shooting, felt inspired to speak out.  And most prominent in the scene, unexpectedly, is a man whose most notable credit prior to his current long-running gig was “The Man Show.” Jimmy Kimmel has been credited with directly influencing the discussion around American health care, tackling to the ground efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act with the force of his infant son, Billy. Well, really, the story of Billy’s difficult medical history, but the weight of that story was enough to take down legislative efforts aimed at taking health care away from millions of Americans. It’s been a depressing year, but we’ve lived it with the hosts of late night, who (to varying degrees) have stepped up to the challenge of contextualizing this madness for their viewers. 2017 has made huge demands on these shows, but we’re grateful for their service. Rachel Maddow Heidi Gutman/MSNBC A year ago, the cable news networks were preparing for life after the election. CNN had already been bolstering its entertainment coverage, for example, to fill the void when the campaign news died down and interest in Washington and politics was set to wane. Then Trump won. And the roller coaster didn’t stop. It’s been a big year for all news operations, which have seen their fortunes grow as audiences tune in to see, well, whether the world is still standing. Natural disasters and terrorism (including mass shootings) have both fueled viewership, but it’s really the daily barrage of unbelievable headlines coming out of the White House that is keeping news on top. Fox News Channel continues to dominate, but MSNBC (led by Rachel Maddow) and CNN are also enjoying hefty year-to-year increases. In October, Fox News was the No. 1 cable network in total day viewership (1.5 million), while MSNBC was fourth (904,000) and CNN was seventh (726,000). Of course, that doesn’t necessarily mean audiences are being informed. Fox News, for example, is taking lumps for overly praising Trump, particularly during his favorite program, “Fox & Friends.” When former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort turned himself into the FBI, Fox News spent much of the day focusing on Hillary Clinton. But don’t just blame Fox News; all of the networks have fallen into their old bad habits. When Trump decided to threaten the planet’s health and torpedo the United States’ status as the leader of the free world by recklessly pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, it should have been noted that network TV news had failed in their job to properly educate the public on climate change (or even discuss it at all during the 2016 campaign). And even when they do cover issues like that, they do it the way they always do – via yelling pundits treating it all like a chess game, rather than bothering to ask scientists what’s really going on. “Sunday Night Football” has been the biggest show on TV since 2011, but this past year saw its market share steadily diminish. For years, the NFL has been besieged by waves of new research around the sport’s relationship to head trauma, restrictive player rights in relation to other major sports, and a decline in on-field quality of play.  But the increasingly politicized nature of the league threw into stark relief the biggest problem that the league hadn’t yet reckoned with: oversaturation. By diluting the power that the NFL held over its Sunday/Monday cultural stranglehold, their recent expansion into Thursday nights was a short-term cash-in with long-term negative effects. Having the NFL be a pop culture battleground not just once, but three nights a week, exacerbated chiefly by the current occupant of the Oval Office, only made it harder for casual fans to sweep aside the issues that have made football a problematic pastime for the better part of this decade. The result is a slightly more even landscape in the sports world. Baseball’s World Series topped Sunday Night Football in viewership for the second straight year, while this year’s NBA Finals smashed its ratings record. As the President targets the NFL (whether he, concussions, protests, or sloppy play is the ultimate culprit will be debated ad nauseum in the ESPN/FS1 Hot Take Industrial Complex), the stage is set for a necessary and overdue redistribution of American sports attention. Basketball’s biggest stars have been some of the most vocal athletes in this newly politicized age. If NBA viewership continues to rise in the coming calendar year, it’ll be a signal that speaking out doesn’t necessarily mean that audiences will turn away.

https://www.elitedaily.com/p/trumps-mental-health-statement-on-texas-church-shooting-is-hypocritical-given-this-policy-change-3229506," A mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas on Sunday, Nov. 5, left at least 26 people dead and dozens more wounded. During a press conference in Tokyo, Japan on Monday, President Donald Trump called the Texas shooting a ""mental health issue,"" leaving guns largely out of the debate. His response to the Texas church shooting has quickly come under fire. The president sent his condolences during the press conferences, saying, Later during the press conference, when Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Trump were fielding questions, Trump was asked by Steve Holland of Reuters what policies he would support to prevent future shootings, and whether gun control is the answer. Trump responded, It's unclear how the president knew the mental health status of the shooter, who died in a crash after a car chase with police. Per The Hill, officials have not released any assessment yet of the shooter. Regardless, Trump's comments at the press conference set off a fresh round of criticism. Trump said Monday that mental illness was the issue. Fine, but let's not forget that, back in February, Trump signed into law a rule that loosened the requirements around mental health background checks for gun purchases. According to FactCheck.org, requirements to report individuals prohibited from buying guns was initially the product of a law signed by President George W. Bush in 2008. Following the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012, President Barack Obama issued a memorandum ensuring that federal agencies were following this law. These rules required that firearms dealers run background checks on prospective buyers, and allowed for a 72-hour hold for reviewing applicants. Just before leaving office, Obama finalized the Social Security Administration's rules, which required reporting to include people who receive Social Security benefits for a documented mental health condition and are regarded as legally incompetent or unable to handle their own affairs. An estimated 4.5 million records existed as of December 2016 for those individuals. This rule was stripped away in February when Trump signed H.J. Res. 40. Trump's comments Monday in Tokyo drew a sharp contrast in tone with the way he joked in January 2016 about having such loyal followers that he could ""stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody"" and wouldn't lose voters. It seems strange that Trump would say it's ""a little bit soon"" to bring up the conversation around gun control when he has been quick to fire off sweeping declarations about how to combat ""terrorism"" following similar incidents. After a terror incident in New York on Halloween in which a driver mowed down several people in a truck, killing 11, Trump called for both policies and personal punishment: After the London tube attack in September, Trump jumped to use the incident to promote increased security. So what makes one incident an opportunistic zero-hour launchpad for policy and another a prognosis-less shrug? The answer is too long for one article. But you can start by looking at how he frames these incidents. Trump has repeatedly come under fire for his double standard in how he labels violent incidents and those that commit them. His statements following the New York attack, for example, were wildly different in comparison with those made following a mass shooting at a country music festival in Las Vegas that killed 58 in early October. There is a protocol to follow as far as officially labeling an incident as terrorism or not, but regardless, his statements were also picked apart for their hypocritical leanings. Often, Trump has labeled as terrorism indicidents commited by non-white males. The common thread isn't difficult to ascertain. Following the violence this past week, we're not just sending thoughts and prayers to New York and Sutherland Springs, but to every New York and Sutherland Springs that has been affected by mass shootings and terror incidents. And we're praying that the conversation at the highest level of office can transcend (a very conditional) sympathy and translate into action."

Only 14.8 percent of mass shooters in the US have been diagnosed as psychotic, according to one study. Loading... November 10, 2017 The day after Devin Kelley perpetrated America’s worst mass shooting in a place of worship – killing 26 and wounding another 20 at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas – President Trump called it a “mental health problem at the highest level.” Some mass shooters have been diagnosed with mental illness. Jared Loughner, who killed six and severely wounded then US Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in 2011, was found by psychiatrists to have a mental disorder. Ditto for James Holmes, who killed 12 people at the Century movie theater in Aurora, Colo., in 2012. Mr. Kelley himself escaped from a mental health facility in New Mexico in 2012, after being accused of assaulting his wife and severely beating his baby stepson while serving with the US Air Force. But few mass killers have a clinically diagnosed mental illness. Thus, pointing to mental illness as the cause of gun violence is not only misleading, say mental health and gun violence experts, it could also increase the stigma around it and make people less willing to seek help. “Imagine if [Mr. Trump] had said, ‘veteran’ – that this was a ‘veterans’ issue,” says Jeffrey Swanson, a professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, N.C. “He’d besmirch the whole community. Well, that’s what he’s doing with mental illness.” The best indicator of future violent behavior is past violent behavior, experts say. A history of animal cruelty, childhood maltreatment, access to guns, and being young and male are also more reliable indicators of future violence than a diagnosed mental health disorder, they say. Only 3 percent to 5 percent of violent acts can be attributed to a person living with a severe mental illness, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, while people linked to those illnesses are actually 10 times more likely to be victims of violent crime than the general population. Of 88 mass shooters – those who had killed four or more people in the US – since 1966, only 14.8 percent were diagnosed as psychotic, according to 2015 paper by Northeastern University criminologist James Alan Fox, a gun violence expert who maintains a database of indiscriminate mass shootings. Trump is not the only one to suggest that improving mental health services could prevent mass shootings. Last year, President Obama said as much in a speech that recalled the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. Days after last month’s mass shooting in Las Vegas – the deadliest in US history – House Speaker Paul Ryan did the same. It “perpetuates a stereotype of the mentally ill as dangerous,” says Dr. Fox, author of several books on mass shootings, including “Extreme Killing: Understanding Serial and Mass Murder.” That stigmatization may make it even more difficult for professionals to find the people who do need help. “Suggesting that this is what people who have mental illnesses do likely means that if I’m someone with mental illness, I’m less likely to reach out and seek help,” says Arthur Evans Jr., chief executive officer of the American Psychological Association. The ability to help is further hampered by a serious lack of resources and manpower, often leading to long wait lists for treatment. Two-thirds of Texas counties have no working psychiatrist, according to the Texas chapter of the National Association of Mental Illness (NAMI), a situation similar to other parts of the US. And with more than half of mental-health providers aged 55 and older and nearing retirement, there are few people to take their place. Only 4 percent of US medical school graduates have been applying for residency training in psychiatry, according to a 2015 study. These factors help explain why, according to NAMI, nearly 60 percent of adults with a mental illness don’t receive any mental-health services in a given year. That increases the risk that someone diagnosed with mentally illness may commit a violent act. “If [someone] has a psychotic episode, they don’t have time to wait and get help, and that’s when violence happens,” says Sarah Feuerbacher, director of the Center for Family Counseling at Southern Methodist University in Plano, Texas. There are some examples of state-level reforms. In November 2013, a mental-health facility in Virginia discharged Austin “Gus” Deeds because no psychiatric bed was available and he couldn’t be held in emergency custody for more than six hours. Less than 24 hours later, he attacked his father with a knife and committed suicide. Six months later, the father – state Sen. Creigh Deeds – got a law passed reforming several elements of Virginia’s emergency mental-health system. Back in Sutherland Springs, scene of the latest mass shooting, Eileen Anderson, who helps run the local historical museum, has been looking at her own family’s situation in a new light. Decades ago, her daughter was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and still sees a psychiatrist, takes medication, and, most important to her mother, continues to communicate with her.

Every Monday After the Sutherland Springs shooting, the online debate shifted to whether praying is 'doing anything.' Here's what religious Americans and scholars say they mean when they talk about prayer. Loading... November 16, 2017 It’s a familiar performance in a long-running drama: Following a mass shooting, proponents and opponents of gun control take to the national stage, find their blocking on the scene, and recite the same impassioned lines of dialogue. But the circumstances of last week’s gun massacre in Sutherland Springs, Texas, flipped the usual script. When politicians doled out their automatic condolences of “thoughts and prayers,” gun control advocates responded with rhetorical jiu-jitsu. “The murdered victims were in a church. If prayers did anything, they’d still be alive,” tweeted “Star Trek” actor Wil Wheaton, one of a number of Twittizens who used the cruel irony to mock Republican politicians. (He later apologized for offending “people of faith.”) The recurring “thoughts and prayers” meme stokes fiery exchanges in a political and cultural war where gun control and religion are frontline issues. But after the shooting in Texas, the debate is no longer just about whether politicians’ stock platitudes represent a sufficient response to gun violence. It’s an argument over the very efficacy of prayer itself. Is God a refuge and strength, an everpresent help in times of trouble, as a Psalmist once put it? “We are fundamentally spiritual beings,” says Richard Mouw, professor of faith and public life at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, Calif. “It’s a part of our deep longings and hopes and fears that we do have a sense of the divine. In the moments of tragedy in our lives there’s an impulse, there’s an instinct to turn to however we understand the higher power.” But beyond the individual supplications of the religious, there’s little agreement over the proper role of prayer after a tragedy. Does prayer constitute taking meaningful, practical action? Or does invoking “thoughts and prayers” merely offer the appearance of acting? That cliché, plucked from the inadequate lexicon of words to express grief, is a phrase employed by countless Republicans and Democrats over decades (including politicians from both parties last week). Its durability may stem from the fact that it nods to both secular and religious audiences and also fits neatly into a sound bite or a tweet. But it has to come to represent, for some, a parsimonious response that fails to convey a full reckoning of the tragic loss of life in each incident. In 2015, President Barack Obama responded to the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., by declaring, “Thoughts and prayers are not enough.” Since then, the primarily Republican “Thoughts and Prayers” contingent have been satirized (and trolled) by an online videogame, an episode of the Netflix series “BoJack Horseman,” a gospel choir on Samantha Bee’s TV show “Full Frontal,” and an online comic by Stephen Byrne in which two superheroes, Thought and Prayer, discover that their respective powers are ineffectual against a robber with a gun. Different faith traditions – and different people within those traditions – encompass a broad array of ideas on what prayer does. “Is prayer enough to stop an individual from acquiring an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle and gunning down 50 people at a concert?” asks Rabbi Yael Ridberg of Congregation Dor Hadash, a Reconstructionist synagogue community in San Diego. “No. But that’s only if you think the prayer is supposed to solve that problem. That is not going to solve that problem. Prayer is a reaction to, or a need after the fact.” For religious scholar Reza Aslan, the question isn’t: “Does prayer work?” Or, “Is prayer enough?” “Paul Ryan and most Republican politicians are saying, we will just hide behind the view that a majority of Americans have, which is a prayer is an effective tool and not do anything,” says Mr. Aslan, author of a new book, “God: A Human History.” “In a sense, we are inoculated from action, because most Americans do believe that prayer is a form of action.” Deliberation over the proper balance isn’t exclusive to the gun-control debate. During the 1980s, Dr. Mouw recalls attending an anti-apartheid meeting in Grand Rapids, Mich., in which a black South African church minister had been invited to speak. “We talked about the [economic] divestments and church pressures and various things,” says Mouw, author of “Uncommon Decency: Christian Civility in an Uncivil World.” “At the end, she said, ‘Do all of these things but please keep praying for a solution to all of us in South Africa.’ A young African-American man stood up said, ‘I’m getting sick of praying. I want to do something.’ At that point she said, in a very stern voice, ‘Prayer is doing something. You’re petitioning the highest ruler in the universe.’” People pray in a variety of ways. For some, it’s a simple call from the heart. For others, it’s the recitation of a complex liturgy. Prayer can be for oneself or it can be an act of intercession. It can be an act of petition or an act of praise. It can be silent or spoken aloud. Though the practice of supplication has been declining in recent decades, it nonetheless remains deeply woven into Americans’ lives – and thus their political outlooks. “In our big 2014 religious landscape study, we found that 55 percent of all American adults said that they pray every day,” says Greg Smith, Associate Director of Research at the nonpartisan, nonprofit Pew Research Center. “Another one in five, 21 percent, say that they pray ‘occasionally,’ maybe on a weekly or monthly basis, but not every day. The remaining quarter or so of the public, 23 percent, say that they seldom or never pray.” Another trend? More Americans now say they’re spiritual but not religious. Many people now gather for daily contemplation in yoga studios, not just to perfect flexible poses, but to deal with stressful events. “What you meditate on can be breath, it can be counting, it could be a mantra, it can be connecting to your heart space and talking to God. It’s not only a Buddhist thing, prayer is absolutely meditation,” says Emily Peterson, lead trainer for a mindfulness-based trauma recovery program called TIMBo (Trauma Informed Mind Body) in Brookline, Mass. Ms. Peterson offers one additional definition of her practice. “The Dalai Lama, a while ago, was asked, ‘What’s the most important meditation one can do?’ He said, ‘Critical thinking, followed by action.’ ” Theologian and author Leonard Sweet believes that prayer is a vital first step toward dealing with gun violence. “In a football game, your aim is to score a touchdown. But before you can score a touchdown, you huddle. But the game is not a huddle.” Prayer is not an empty puff of air thrown up into the heavens, but something that takes flesh in some kind of materialization in real life, says Mr. Sweet, a professor at Drew Theological School at Drew University in Madison, N.J. “There is a wonderful African proverb: ‘When you pray, move your feet,’ ” says Sweet, who posts sermons at PreachtheStory.com. “If it is serious prayer and systemic prayer, it should move your feet to deal with systemic issues that are bringing this on.” Republicans such as House Speaker Paul Ryan have been accused of dragging their feet on this issue. But other conservatives push back at the accusation that Republicans are acting in, well, bad faith. “I absolutely believe the biblical concept that ‘faith without works is dead,’ ” says David French, a senior writer for National Review. “But what they tend to mean when they say, ‘You should pray and take action,’ is that they mean you should pray and take the action I want you to take. If you actually look at these politicians that they get angry at, or these conservatives on Twitter that they get angry at, each one of us has advocated or proposed or engaged in dialogue about various things that could be done to try to stop mass killings, to try to ameliorate the problem.” For example, he says, solutions could include stepping up enforcement of existing law – including increased prosecutions for those who lie on background check forms – and shoring up existing reporting processes so that names don’t fall through the cracks, as was the case in Sutherland Springs. In the wake of the Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs shootings, Mr. French has been inspired by a verse in II Chronicles that stresses the importance of humbling oneself to listen for answers in how to deal with confounding acts of evil. “[Christians] use a word that is fraught with very deep meaning, and that is ‘relationship,’ ” says French. “They feel that they have a relationship with God. That feeling of relationship with God is directly connected to prayer. It’s a feeling of communing with God. There is deep comfort. There is deep peace. There is resolve. There is insight.” In Sutherland Springs, faith is at the forefront of a community that remains in a tight embrace since the Nov. 5 shooting that killed 26 churchgoers. At a prayer vigil last week, Pastor Stephen A. Curry, asked a candlelit throng, “Who are we going to be tomorrow? We are going to be people who go and live our lives, not in fear, but with compassion for our neighbors. Who are we going to be tomorrow? We are going to be people who do not let things like chaos and destruction interrupt who we are, or change who we are called to be.” “Prayer, to me, gathers people together,” says Eileen Anderson, secretary of the Sutherland Springs Historical Museum. Before the shooting, Mrs. Anderson prayed daily for the world. Now, the Roman Catholic asks that world respond in kind.

It’s the people down the road here that need us, need our prayers.’ ” Staff writer Henry Gass contributed to this article from Sutherland Springs, Texas. Already a subscriber?

Every Monday After the deadliest mass shooting at a place of worship in US history, residents of Sutherland Springs vowed to move forward and reclaim their beloved way of life. Loading... November 6, 2017 On a normal day in Sutherland Springs, Texas, all there is to fill the country air is the barks of local dogs and the hum of cars passing by. Indeed, locals say – with a hint of pride – you can drive through this town of several hundred without even noticing you did. But Sunday was not a normal day here. Instead, a lone, black-clad gunman shattered the town’s tranquility with a hail of bullets that left at least 26 dead and 20 wounded in the First Baptist Church. Neighbors chased the gunman away and found him dead in his crashed car in the next county. The tragedy in a close-knit, rural town that considers itself just outside of San Antonio’s commuting range was a reminder that in America, while a town may not have a single traffic light, it can still have a mass shooting. “It’s a peaceful town. Everyone knows everyone,” says Rita Serna, who grew up in Sutherland Springs and sang her first solo in the First Baptist Church. “It’s sad, disturbing, unbelievable,” she adds, “but possible in today’s times.” As many Texans proudly point out, church life permeates much of Texas culture. And while it has more than 200 megachurches and dozens of evangelical colleges and universities, churches like First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs still define the daily rhythms of life in many rural Texas communities, local pastors say. “It’s the kind of little church my dad pastored when I was growing up as a kid,” says the Rev. Bob Roberts, a Texas native who now pastors the 3,000-member NorthWood Church, an evangelical congregation in Keller. “These are the people who make Texas what it is – small towns, rural, hardworking people.” At the end of the 11 a.m. worship service, officials say, Devin Patrick Kelley of New Braunfels opened fire on the congregation with a Ruger assault-style rifle, before being shot at by a local man and fleeing in his car. Pursued by locals, he crashed his car a few miles away and was found dead. Kelley’s in-laws attended the church, according to reports, and officials said Monday the shooting arose from a “domestic situation.” A former member of the Air Force who was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and child and later kicked out of the service, Kelley was not legally allowed to own a gun, according to both US and Texas law. Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said Monday he was denied a right to carry license, but reports say he purchased the Ruger at a San Antonio gun shop. The worst mass shooting in Texas history has left a gaping hole in this community about 35 miles east of San Antonio. Among the dead were eight people spanning three generations of a single family. The victims ranged in age from 18 months to 77, and the teenage daughter of the church’s pastor was among those killed. Leslie Ward lost three family members in the shooting: her husband’s five and seven-year-old nieces Brooke Ward and Emily Garza, and their mother, Joann Ward. His five-year-old nephew, Ryland Ward was wounded, but in a stable condition as of Sunday night, the Dallas Morning News reported. “Words can’t describe it,” Ms. Ward says on Sunday night, pacing in front of her house a block away from the church, waiting for news from the hospital. “I feel angry. I feel sad,” she adds. “I would never think this would happen here, in a small community.” The shooting is also the deadliest at a place of prayer and worship in modern US history, and one of a series in recent years targeting churches and temples. In September, a man shot and killed one woman and injured seven others at Burnette Chapel Church of Christ, outside of Nashville. In 2015, white supremacist Dylann Roof opened fire in the basement of Mother Emanuel A.M.E Church in Charleston, S.C., killing nine black church members. In 2012, a gunman shot down six worshipers at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wis. “I think there’s going to be some serious questioning, some serious soul searching after this,” says Pastor Roberts. “This was one of us. It’s one thing when someone gets killed while hunting. When somebody can come in with a Ruger AR-15, you just can’t say, too bad, that’s the way things go, there’s nothing to be done. “This wasn’t some city slicker who went down to a little country town – he was born in that part of Texas,” he continues. “So there’s something in our culture that’s really out of control. It’s gone bad. We’re producing our own bad apples, we can’t blame it on ISIS.” Sutherland Springs is so small it doesn’t have its own high school. The town center is a post office, a Dollar General (new this year), a gas station, and the First Baptist Church. Cattle graze in surrounding fields, and metallic, submarine-shaped propane tanks dot grassy lawns. Signs for a yard sale still dotted the town on Sunday. Far away from the metropolises of Dallas and Houston, the gas station sells hats for the Junction Eagles high school football team. There are no traffic lights, only stop signs and a yellow blinking light strung over Highway 87. “You’re just outside [the range] of people buying places out in the rural areas and commuting into San Antonio,” says Tim Williams, a pastor with the South Texas Children’s Home Ministries. “People are living out here, moving out here, trying to get away from some of the big city stuff,” he adds. “Now the big city stuff’s come to them.” He has spent much of his 27-year career working in the rural towns between San Antonio and Victoria, including Sutherland Springs. “The central institution of a town like this is the school, and then it goes to the churches.... Not everyone is involved in [each] church, but everyone from other churches would know who’s in that church,” he adds. “It will be a whole lot more personal.” As night fell over the town on Sunday – the narrow streets lit up by red and blue police lights – locals vowed to move forward. “We’re not going to let this beat this town,” says Frances Garza, standing outside a police cordon, a block away from the church. She has lived in Sutherland Springs for 30 years. “I’m hoping we still go back to what we were: a small town,” she adds. Indeed, local mourners were not alone at a vigil for the victims held outside the post office on Sunday night. Residents from the surrounding network of towns – including Stockdale, La Vernia, Floresville, and Poth – flocked here to hold candles and sing together in a slow, somber murmur that occasionally strengthened with the chorus. “Who are we going to be tomorrow? We are going to be the people of Texas, the people of Sutherland Springs, the people of the First Baptist Church,” said Pastor Stephen A. Curry of the La Vernia United Methodist Church, during the vigil. “We are going to show compassion where compassion needs to be shown,” he added. “We will not be changed by one man.” After the vigil, Katie Metcalf – a stay-at-home mom who lives a mile away, on the Sutherland Springs-La Vernia border – stared silently across the road toward the small blue and white sign of the First Baptist Church. She drives past it almost every morning, she says, and would have been here on Sunday as well – on the way to the Dollar General – but turned around after her family said they wanted to go somewhere for food.

http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-judicial-nominee-brett-talley-20171113-story.html,"Brett Talley, the young lawyer nominated by President Donald Trump for a lifetime federal judgeship in Alabama, was asked by a Senate committee to disclose family members who are likely to present potential conflicts of interest if he is confirmed. In response, Talley said he would evaluate ""real or potential conflict, or relationships that could give rise to appearance of conflict"" and recuse himself from cases if necessary, according to a Senate Judiciary Committee questionnaire. He did not, however, identify any family members - including his wife, who is one of Trump's attorneys. Annie Donaldson is White House Counsel Donald F. McGahn II's chief of staff. Talley's failure to mention his wife in the 30-page written questionnaire was first reported Monday by the New York Times. Talley could not be immediately reached for comment. The White House did not respond to questions about whether the administration sees a potential conflict of interest, and whether Talley should have disclosed that he is married to a White House attorney. A spokesman for the Senate Judiciary Committee and its chair, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, did not respond to a call seeking comment. As a district judge, Talley could end up presiding over cases in which the federal government or the White House is one of the parties. For example, district judges in Hawaii and Maryland had previously heard cases challenging the Trump administration's travel ban. Talley attracted controversy for what some say is his limited experience in practicing law and the level of partisanship he had shown in the past. The Judiciary Committee, on which Republicans outnumber Democrats, approved Talley's nomination last week on a party-line vote. His nomination is now headed to the Senate for a full confirmation vote. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the ranking Democrat on the committee, said the Senate should not confirm Talley in light of the new revelation. ""By failing to disclose that his wife is one of President Trump's lawyers, Talley has betrayed his obligation to be open and transparent with the Senate and American people,"" Feinstein said in a statement, adding later: ""Talley's nomination shouldn't be considered by the Senate unless he answers questions about this glaring omission that clarifies matters concerning when he would recuse himself."" Feinstein said reports that Donaldson has been interviewed by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's team as it investigates Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election show ""a clear conflict of interest that should have been disclosed."" The Times reported that Mueller's team recently talked to Donaldson about her notes on conversations with McGahn regarding the firing of former FBI director James Comey. Feinstein and other Democrats on the committee have opposed Talley's nomination, citing his lack of trial experience and political comments he previously made on social media, on his political blog and in several opinion pieces he had written for CNN. The American Bar Association, which vets federal judicial nominees, has rated Talley as ""not qualified."" Trump judge nominee, 36, who has never tried a case, wins approval of Senate panel Talley, a 36-year-old lawyer from Alabama who also writes horror stories on the side, has practiced law for only three years and has yet to try a case. Before his nomination in September, he had been unequivocal about his political views. For example, one tweet from his account, which has since been made private, says, ""Hillary Rotten Clinton might be the best Trumpism yet."" On his political blog called Government in Exile, he wrote a post with the title, ""A Call to Arms: It's Time to Join the National Rifle Association,"" in January 2013, a month after a gunman in Newtown, Conn., killed 27 people before taking his own life. He criticized gun-control advocates, who, he said, ""have exploited"" the Newtown mass shooting to advance an agenda to strip people of their Second Amendment rights. Answering written questions from Democrats on the Judiciary Committee about his previous political statements, Talley said he would recuse himself in cases in which his impartiality is questioned, as required by federal statute, and that his personal views on the Second Amendment and other issues ""will have no bearing on how I would rule in a case."" He also said the blog post calling on people to join the NRA was meant to attract opposing views and encourage constructive discussion. Challenged about his lack of trial experience, Talley said he had previously argued motions in federal district court on behalf of the state of Alabama, often through written briefs rather than in person. He also said he had argued cases before the 11th Circuit appeals court and the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals. He said it would be ""inappropriate"" for him to comment on his recommendation for the federal bench - a decision made by two U.S. senators from Alabama, Richard Shelby and Luther Strange. Talley graduated from Harvard Law School in 2007. Shortly after, he became a law clerk in Alabama, spending two years in a federal-district court and another two at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. He worked as a political speechwriter for three years, first for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign in 2012 and then for Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, from 2013 to 2015. In April 2015, Talley became an Alabama deputy solicitor general, a position he held for nearly two years until he became deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department in January. In a statement defending Talley's nomination, Grassley said he does not believe ""extensive trial experience"" is the only factor in deciding on a nominee's qualifications. ""Mr. Talley has a wide breadth of various legal experience that has helped to expose him to different aspects of federal law and the issues that would come before him,"" Grassley said. Talley's nomination comes as Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., continue to intensify efforts to place conservative jurists on the federal bench. Talley and Donaldson were married in August 2015. Donaldson was an associate for the Washington law firm Jones Day before she was appointed to the White House post. She is one of several lawyers from the firm who were tapped to join the Trump administration, some as attorneys for the White House, including McGahn. Among the others: Greg Katsas, James Burnham and David Morrell, who now work in the Office of the White House Counsel. Katsas, Trump's deputy counsel, is also a judicial nominee. The Senate last week approved Katsas' nomination to an appellate court in Washington. CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"

Advertisement Talley, who also writes horror novels on the side, moved a step closer to becoming a federal district judge in his home state of Alabama on Thursday. Voting along party lines, the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which Republicans outnumber Democrats, approved Talley’s nomination, which now goes to the Senate for a full vote. Talley is the latest federal judicial nominee to draw scrutiny for what some say is his limited experience in practicing law and the level of partisanship he had shown on social media, on his political blog, and on several opinion pieces he had written for CNN. He has also received a ‘‘not qualified’’ rating from the American Bar Association, which vets federal judicial nominees. The vote on Talley’s nomination comes as Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky continue to intensify efforts to place conservative jurists, some of whom are young, on the federal bench. As he stood next to McConnell during a news conference in October, Trump said the judicial nominations are the ‘‘untold’’ success stories of his presidency. ‘‘Nobody wants to talk about it. But when you think about it, Mitch and I were saying, that has consequences 40 years out, depending on the age of the judge, but 40 years out,’’ Trump said. ‘‘So numerous have been approved. Many, many are in the pipeline. The level of quality is extraordinary.’’ Advertisement In a statement defending Talley’s nomination, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said he does not believe ‘‘extensive trial experience’’ is the only factor in deciding on a nominee’s qualifications. ‘‘Mr. Talley has a wide breadth of various legal experience that has helped to expose him to different aspects of federal law and the issues that would come before him,’’ Grassley said. Talley graduated from Harvard Law School in 2007. Shortly after, he became a law clerk in Alabama, spending two years at a federal district court and another two at the US Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. He worked as a political speechwriter for three years, first for Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign in 2012 and then for Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, from 2013 to 2015. In April 2015, Talley became an Alabama deputy solicitor general, a position he held for nearly two years until he became deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department in January. Talley’s lack of experience in the courtroom and his partisan commentaries, however, were repeatedly questioned by Democrats on the Judiciary Committee. ‘‘Your overall qualifications and preparation for becoming a lifetime-appointed federal judge are a concern to me,’’ Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said, according to her written questions to Talley. Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, did not mince words, asking questions like: ‘‘How can you claim to be qualified for a lifetime appointment to supervise federal trials on a daily basis when you have never yourself tried a single case?’’ and ‘‘Do you think it is advisable to put people with literally no trial experience on the federal district court bench?’’ Advertisement In response, Talley said he had previously argued motions in federal district court on behalf of the state of Alabama, often through written briefs than in person. He also said he had argued cases before the 11th Circuit appeals court and the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals. Talley said it would be ‘‘inappropriate’’ for him to comment on the decision to recommend him for the federal bench — a decision made by two US senators from Alabama, Richard C. Shelby and Luther Strange. ‘‘Federal judges come to the bench from a variety of legal backgrounds, each with something to learn and something to contribute,’’ Talley wrote. ‘‘I have worked in all three branches of the federal government, in state government, and in private practice.’’ In his previous job in Alabama, he said, he was ‘‘one of the highest-ranking lawyers in the state, handling the most sensitive and most important legal matters Alabama faced.’’ Feinstein, the top Democrat on the committee, also spent a good portion of her 14-page questionnaire asking Talley about partisan statements he’d made in the past, including tweets such as: ‘‘The press cares when you lie to the American people. Unless you are @HillaryClinton #LochteGate’’ Advertisement ‘‘The worst part of #NeverTrump is that they are helping Hillary win the election. Their self-righteousness while doing it is a close second.’’ Talley had written political commentaries for CNN, including a 2016 article in which he said Clinton ‘‘has committed acts that would have resulted in the prosecution of ordinary citizens.’’ In the blog post in which he called on his readers to join the NRA, he criticized gun-control advocates, who, he said, ‘‘have exploited’’ the Newtown mass shooting to advance an agenda to strip people of their Second Amendment rights. ‘‘These politicians either do not know or do not care that an armed, responsible citizenry is the last and greatest bulwark against tyranny that a nation can have,’’ Talley wrote in his blog, Government in Exile. ‘‘They certainly do not care about our right to bear arms, enshrined in the Constitution and reaffirmed by recent Supreme Court rulings.’’ Talley said the post was meant to attract opposing views and encourage constructive discussion. He also said that he would recuse himself in cases in which his impartiality is questioned, as required by federal statute, and that his personal views on the Second Amendment and other issues ‘‘will have no bearing on how I would rule in a case.’’ ‘‘Rather, I would be duty-bound to apply relevant Supreme Court and circuit precedent to the facts before me,’’ he wrote. Talley is one of five judicial nominees whom the Judiciary Committee approved Thursday. Advertisement The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights questioned his ability to be fair, particularly in presiding over cases with political overtones. ‘‘Brett Talley is entirely unqualified for a federal judgeship because he lacks the breadth and depth of experience necessary for the job, and he has demonstrated ideologically extreme views that call into question his temperament and judgment,’’ Vanita Gupta, president and chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said in a statement. In a Nov. 7 letter to Grassley and Feinstein, the American Bar Association did not raise questions about Talley’s temperament but said his lack of trial experience was a concern. Carrie Severino, counsel for the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, criticized the American Bar Association, saying the group is not a nonpartisan organization. ‘‘The ABA is a liberal interest group. They have a long history of giving lower ratings to Republican nominees,’’ she told the Los Angeles Times. The bar association gave a ‘‘not qualified’’ rating to four Trump judicial picks. Two, Talley and Leonard Grasz, an Omaha lawyer nominated to fill a vacancy on the US Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, were unanimously deemed to be unqualified. Two others, Charles Goodwin and Holly Teeter, nominees for federal district judgeship in Oklahoma and Kansas, respectively, were rated as ‘‘not qualified’’ in a split decision. Previously, the association, which has been vetting judicial candidates since 1989, unanimously rated only two other judicial candidates as unqualified, both of whom were nominated by then-President George W. Bush. Another Trump judicial nominee, Jeff Mateer, attracted controversy over earlier speeches in which he said transgender children are proof that ‘‘Satan’s plan is working,’’ described same-sex marriage as a harbinger for ‘‘disgusting’’ practices such as polygamy and bestiality, and advocated for conversion therapy. He also had previously admitted discriminating based on sexual orientation.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/11/13/texas-church-becomes-a-solemn-memorial-a-week-after-shooting-massacre/,"This article is more than 1 year old SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Tex. — They could have torn the bullet-riddled building to the ground or hidden it behind a towering construction wall, turning First Baptist Church into an eyesore full of mystery and despair. Instead, one week after more than two dozen people were gunned down inside the small, white sanctuary, church officials did something unusual in the wake of a mass shooting: They opened the building to the public. After Texas church massacre, tiny town turns to prayer to begin healing process Within hours, a tearful line of mourners — some of them friends and family members of victims, others visitors arriving from around the region — wrapped around the block to pray, cry and pay their respects to the deceased on a rainy Sunday night. “In most situations like this, the building would be closed off for months, but America was attacked, and we want America to grieve with us because they’ve expressed so much love for us,” the church’s associate pastor, Mark Collins, said. “We don’t want to appear defeated. We’re back in business, and it’s God’s business.” There was no sign of the bullets that pierced the walls, the blood that washed across the floor or the nightmarish misery that will haunt survivors of the worst mass shooting in Texas history. Turning a sprawling crime scene into a memorial is no simple task, Collins said. As recently as Wednesday, Texas Rangers and FBI agents were scouring the property, which sat behind multiple layers of security. The rapid transformation required a 30-person construction team working 72 hours to gut the heavily damaged structure, removing all chairs, pews and equipment, a church statement said. “The walls were painted, windows and ceiling tiles were replaced, and carpet was removed and the floors painted,” the statement said. Videos of recent services posted on the church’s YouTube channel reveal a lively and cluttered space with multiple television screens, band equipment, crosses hanging from the walls and multiple rows of tightly packed pews. The services there were informal and highlighted the nature of the community: Children ran and played, church members greeted each other warmly, hymns and songs came with the accompaniment of electric guitars. Church officials said this week that the building might still be torn down, rebuilt or replaced with a permanent memorial but that the decision will be left to pastor Frank Pomeroy and his congregation, which lost nearly half its members. So far, they said, they have not made any firm decisions. The sound of hymns drifted from the country church. Then came gunfire. One local man, who lingered outside the church with his wife, said he was sad the pews had to be removed but understood why. “They looked like Swiss cheese,” said the man, who declined to give his name. He had been part of the cleanup crew and helped haul them out. The pews were replaced with 26 “handcrafted chairs,” each adorned with a red rose and a victim’s name written in gold letters, one for each person who was killed, including a pregnant woman’s unborn child. Most of the chairs faced the front of the church, where a large wooden cross stood above a Bible surrounded by boxes of tissue. Instead of silence, the space was filled with audio recordings of Scripture readings from past church services. Inside, groups of mourners slowly paced the church or gathered in the center of the brightly lit room to hold one another and weep. Near the back of the church, a lone police officer stood guard, a handgun on his waist. In the line outside the church, Bradley Graf said he hadn’t been inside the building in years. As a child, he said, he attended youth services on Sunday mornings, riding his bike several miles down a county road to get there. He made the journey all on his own. “I would get up early to get down here,” he said. “They always welcomed me.” Minutes later, after walking through the newly renovated space, Graf appeared forlorn. “No, thanks,” he said when asked to share his reaction to the sanctuary. “Not right now.” Phillip Perez, a 41-year-old truck driver, made the 30-minute drive from his home in Universal City, a San Antonio suburb, to tour the memorial with his daughter. He walked out holding her hand, tears in his eyes. “You walk into something like that and see those chairs, and you think, ‘This could be my child or my parents or me,'” he said. “It’s a very emotional experience.” Tambria Read, 59, president of the local historical museum, said the sight of the church — now barren and colorless — was shocking and upsetting. “I like that they have the names of the victims on the chairs,” she said. “It’s very sad. The tile is gone from the floor, and it’s stark white. It’s just sad, but it provides some closure.” Instead of remembering the inside of the building, Read said she would remember the friends who spent time there. “They were good-hearted people,” Read said of the victims. “The Holcombe men had great smiles. They were the kind of men who kids wanted to be their fathers and grandfathers. That’s what I’ll remember.” The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning. By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy"

http://nypost.com/2017/11/05/multiple-victims-reported-in-texas-church-shooting/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. At least 26 people were killed and two dozen more injured when a gunman opened fire inside a crowded Texas church Sunday, according to reports. The unidentified shooter walked into the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs just before noon and began firing, authorities said. One of the shot victims is a 2-year-old child, the Dallas Morning News reported. Wilson County Commissioner Albert Gamez, Jr. told CNN that first-responders informed him the death toll is at 26 — and expected to climb. “My heart is broken,” he said. “We never think where it can happen, and it does happen. It doesn’t matter where you’re at. In a small community, real quiet and everything, and look at this, what can happen.” The gunman fled in a vehicle, but cops caught up with him after a short chase, according to Gamez, who told CNN it was unclear whether cops killed the gunman or he turned the weapon on himself. The church regularly posts its weekly services to its Youtube page, and investigators are now searching for video that could shed more light on what happened. “Our prayers are with all who were harmed by this evil act,” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott posted on Twitter. “Our thanks to law enforcement for their response.” The town — population about 400 — is roughly 30 miles southeast of San Antonio. The violence comes just a month after the US’s worst-ever mass shooting — when madman Stephen Paddock opened fire on an outdoor Las Vegas concert on Oct. 1, killing 58 and injuring hundreds.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/06/hero-of-texas-church-shooting-car-chase-sutherland-springs-johnnie-langendorff-gunman,"Johnnie Langendorff says he raced after gunman with a member of Sutherland Springs community who had earlier fought with killer Last modified on Fri 25 May 2018 17.06 BST A dramatic account of a high speed car chase after a mass shooting in a Texas church has emerged from one of the gunman’s pursuers, who describes a gunfight and subsequent crash. Motorist Johnnie Langendorff has told how he was driving near to Sutherland Springs First Baptist Church on Sunday morning when he saw two men shooting at each other.  He saw the church gunman – now named as Devin Kelley – take off in his car and a member of the local community came over to ask for help. Langendorff told a local TV station Ksat.com: “I pulled up to the intersection where the shooting happened. I saw two men exchanging gunfire, the other being the citizen of the community. The shooter of the church had taken off, fled in his vehicle, the other gentleman came and said we need to pursue him. And that’s what I did, I just acted. Langendorff said he did not know the community member. “He was just a member of the community and he came to my vehicle in distress with his weapon. He explained very quickly what happened. He got into the truck and I knew that it was time to go.” Langendorff said the gunman sped off but the duo soon caught up with him. “He got a little bit of a jump on us. We were doing about 95 [mph] down [Route] 539 going around traffic and everything. Eventually he came to a kind of a slowdown and after that we got within just a few feet of him and then he got off the road. “He just lost control. That is when I put the vehicle in park and I was still on the phone to Dispatch [police]. The other gentleman jumped out and has his rifle drawn on him. He didn’t move after that.” Langendorff said police arrived with seven minutes and surrounded the gunman’s vehicle. “We led police to him. Everybody else was headed to the church, all the other officers were responding to the church. From the time we actually stopped, it was about five to seven minutes. The police arrived and then they pushed us back and they took care of the rest. I didn’t see anything after that.” Langendorff said he acted on instinct when asked to help. “I was trying to get him, to get him apprehended. It was strictly just acting on what the right thing to do was.” His Facebook page has since been filled with messages of thanks and praise. One said: “Well done, Johnnie! You’re a true patriot and a hero. Thank you for coming to the aid of those in need, at such a terrible time.”"

By 11/14/2017 10:00 AM EST Presented by Ericsson With help from Steven Overly, John Hendel and Margaret Harding McGill TODAY: SESSIONS IN THE HOT SEAT — Attorney General Jeff Sessions faces a new grilling before the
House Judiciary Committee today, and here’s what we’re tracking. Expect questions from Democrats on the independence of the Justice Department, amid questions over whether DOJ’s antitrust division asked AT&T and Time Warner to offload CNN as a condition of their $85 billion merger. (CNN, of course, is a frequent target of President Donald Trump, who calls the network “fake news.”) Encryption may also come up. Remember, the FBI is having problems cracking the iPhone used by the gunman in the recent mass shooting in Texas. FEDERAL IT BILL ON THE MOVE — The Modernizing Government Technology Act (
H.R. 2227 (115)), a bill that would authorize a funding boost for federal IT upgrades, is getting a vote today as part of the House’s National Defense Authorization Act (
H.R. 2810 (115)). The tech measure, from Rep.
Will Hurd (R-Texas), would establish a revolving fund for federal agencies to improve their IT systems, and allow agencies to use the savings they generate through modernization for further upgrades. The bill was also included in the Senate’s version of the NDAA, which passed in September. NEW SOCIAL MEDIA HEARING — The Senate Commerce Committee is eyeing a hearing on social media and extremist content that could take place on Dec. 6, according to a committee aide who spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans are not yet finalized. The panel has not formally invited tech companies yet, the aide added. Facebook, Google and Twitter sent their general counsels to a series of Capitol Hill hearings on Russian election meddling a couple weeks ago. NOTES FROM SAN FRANCISCO — Day one of the Internet Association’s Virtuous Circle Summit produced a steady stream of news about the Trump administration’s promised
infrastructure plan and its tenuous
relationship with the tech industry, as well as one media mogul’s
prediction for the AT&T-Time Warner merger. Here are a few more nuggets from Steven’s notebook: —
Barry Diller had the analogy of the day: The Expedia and InterActiveCorp chairman
 said big media mergers like the pending marriage of AT&T and Time Warner are “irrelevant” because media companies must now compete, from a weakened position, with internet powerhouses like Amazon, Google and Netflix. “They, like everyone else, are going to be serfs on the land of the large tech companies,"" Diller said. He wasn’t done there. “Historically, serfs can do OK. They can eat and have a roof over their heads,"" he said. But, they can also revolt. ""As I’ve said to the leaders of Google, you should treat your serfs well because historically speaking, if you don’t really treat them well, they will then kind of attack you in vicious ways.” —
The U.S. CTO is still MIA: Michael Kratsios, the Trump administration’s deputy chief technology officer, dodged a question about when the federal government will have a full CTO. “We’re very excited to hopefully have someone on soon,” he said. Kratsios added that the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy counts about 45 employees — the same number that
POLITICO reported back in April — but that the “sweet spot” is likely between 60 and 70 employees. Under Obama, OSTP counted as many as 120 on its payroll. Kratsios said the smaller office, however, doesn’t mean the administration devalues technology issues. “We’re all out there trying to do more with less across all of our agencies,” he said. —
The net neutrality divide is alive and well: Reddit CEO Steve Huffman told the crowd that most Americans support net neutrality principles and that existing FCC rules guarantee that internet service providers will treat all web content equally. Later in the day, Cox Communications President Pat Esser, like his peers in the telecom industry, expressed support for the FCC’s plan to roll back the Open Internet rules — and said Cox plans to invest more in broadband infrastructure if it does. Diller, for his part, said the debate no longer matters, arguing the principles of the internet are already sacrosanct and it’s unlikely anyone would mess with them. —
Esser’s take on CNN’s fate in the AT&T-Time Warner review: “I don’t buy into the belief that this is all the president steering the Department of Justice,” the Cox president said. “I think there are legitimate things that need to be worked out there.” That includes concerns about the exclusive content that could be distributed through DirecTV if parent company AT&T comes to own TBS, TNT, Warner Bros. and many other Time Warner media properties, he said. — Tomorrow’s agenda brings another run of tech industry speakers: The lineup includes Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel, Quicken Loans CEO Dan Gilbert, Goldman Sachs Co-Head of Internet Investment Banking Kim-Thu Posnett, Instacart CEO Apoorva Mehta and SV Angel founder and investor Ron Conway.

— Rep.
Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), who chairs the House Small Business Committee, is siding with a group of credit unions that
pressed the FCC in September to clarify its robocalling rules. “While there may be more than one way to address the concerns raised by credit unions, it is important that the FCC provide further clarity, guidance, or some form of exemption,” Chabot wrote to fellow lawmakers asking for support for a letter he plans to send to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai. “Otherwise, an increasing number of credit unions will continue to be impeded from sending important financial information to their members because of both the lack of clarity in how to comply and out of fear of excessively costly litigation, due to the uncertainty.” He gives a deadline of Nov. 16 to sign onto his letter. CTIA CALLS DIBS ON DRONE NETWORK — The wireless industry trade group called on the Federal Aviation Administration to endorse commercial wireless networks — like those operated by AT&T and Verizon — for drone communications. Meredith Attwell Baker, president of CTIA, said the wireless industry offers “the best, most widely available and safest platform for future drone communications.” The trade group released a
white paper on the topic Monday, noting that the FAA is expected to open a rulemaking process next year to look at which spectrum platform drones should use.

By ANNA PALMER, JAKE SHERMAN and DANIEL LIPPMAN 11/06/2017 06:27 AM EST Presented by WEEK AHEAD -- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP is in Asia. But today begins Republicans’ frantic public sprint to rewrite the tax code this year. House Republicans are marking up their bill beginning at noon today and they plan to wrap up by Thursday. Look for more fissures in support as lobbyists and industries dig deeper into the bills and try to maximize their leverage to keep specific provisions from getting the ax. Senate Republicans are also releasing their bill. (Aaron Lorenzo with more on the Senate bill  http://politi.co/2yyb5CB) -- DRINK SOME COFFEE: House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady told us last week that they want to mark up the bill “during the normal working hours” but acknowledged it will creep into the night. Good follows for this week: @sahilkapur, @AaronELorenzo, @richardrubindc, @Brian_Faler, @colinwilhelm, @arappeport, @kristinapet. Missing someone? Shoot us a note. -- THE HOUSE has eight legislative days to get tax reform through the chamber. They say they want to get it passed before the Thanksgiving break. **SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/2lQswb Good Monday morning. THE LATEST IN TEXAS -- “Worst mass shooting in Texas History claims 26 at a church near San Antonio,” by the San Antonio Express-News’ Kelsey Bradshaw, Caleb Downs, Guillermo Contreras and Fares Sabawi: “Authorities said [Devin] Kelley, dressed in tactical gear, began the shooting spree outside the church. He then walked inside and continued shooting, before fleeing in a vehicle. “Earl Seesen Good, 68, lives about eight miles south of Sutherland Springs, near Stockdale. Several of his friends are members of First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, so he spent his night traveling to the hospital and community building to pray for the victims and their families. One of his good friends, whom he requested not be named, lost eight relatives Sunday morning. The victims span generations, from children to grand children to great grand children.” http://bit.ly/2AoGPHE -- KELLEY was using an AR-15. This is the fifth-deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. -- TRUMP’S REACTION -- @realDonaldTrump at 3:06 p.m.: “May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan.” … at 11:48 p.m.: “...Americans do what we do best: we pull together. We join hands. We lock arms and through the tears and the sadness, we stand strong…” WHAT PAUL RYAN IS READING -- “Post-ABC poll: Voters favor Democrats over Republicans in 2018 House midterms by widest margin in years,” by WaPo’s Sean Sullivan and Emily Guskin: “Voters say they prefer Democratic candidates for the House of Representatives over Republicans by the widest margin in over a decade, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll — a fresh sign of trouble for the GOP majority one year before the midterm elections. But Democrats’ effort to convert widespread disapproval of President Trump into victories in 2018 could be undercut by lower turnout, with Republicans expressing just as much motivation to vote in next year’s elections.” http://wapo.st/2Ac5JsZ CATCHING YOU UP ON TRUMP IN ASIA … TRUMP to business leaders: “[O]ne thing I can say -- that we make the greatest military equipment in the world. There’s nothing close. And the Prime Minister is ordering a lot of military equipment, as he should be -- as he should be with what’s happening with one of your neighbors. So that is happening. … And, just, we make incredible equipment, whether it’s the planes, the missiles -- anything you can think about. There’s nobody even close. So we’re going to be doing a lot of business with many countries on defense. … “We will have more trade than anybody ever thought of under TPP, that I can tell you. TPP was not the right idea. Probably some of you in this room disagree, but ultimately I'll be proven to be right. We will have much bigger trade with the way we're doing it right now, and it will be a much less complex situation.” ANDREW RESTUCCIA in Tokyo: “Trump to Japan: Make more cars in the U.S.”: “President Donald Trump on Monday took a shot at Japan over trade and called on the country to manufacture more cars in the United States, unleashing a direct criticism of the host country on the first leg of his 12-day tour of Asia. ‘Try building your cars in the United States instead of shipping them over,’ Trump implored during a briefing with business executives before asking, ‘That’s not rude?’ “Trump’s comments echoed his previous jabs, but they were notable because he lobbed them publicly during his visit here. And they’re an indication that he will not let his close relationship with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe quiet his long-standing concerns about trade and manufacturing. Trump and his aides have repeatedly trumpeted the president’s friendship with Abe, which began in February when the Japanese leader visited Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s private club in Florida.” http://politi.co/2yyWlTY -- WSJ: “Goldman, China’s Sovereign-Wealth Fund Plan up to $5 Billion in U.S. Investments: China Investment Corp. teaming up with top Wall Street bank on multibillion-dollar investment fund,” by Chao Deng and Lingling Wei in Beijing and Julie Steinberg in Hong Kong: “Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and China Investment Corp. are partnering on a multibillion-dollar fund to help the giant Chinese sovereign-wealth fund invest in U.S. manufacturing and other sectors, according to people familiar with the matter. “The fund is targeting as much as $5 billion and is a co-investment partnership between Goldman and CIC, which plan to announce their venture jointly this week during U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to Beijing, these people said. How much capital Goldman and CIC will each contribute to the fund is still being worked out, one of the people said.” http://on.wsj.com/2zjWlUS TRUMP TODAY -- The president will attend a banquet hosted by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

Rand Paul is recovering from five broken ribs and bruises to his lungs, and it is unclear when he will return to Washington, aides said Sunday, signaling that injuries he sustained Friday are far more severe than initially thought. ... Paul made his first public comments since the incident on Sunday, tweeting that his wife ‘Kelley and I appreciate the overwhelming support after Friday’s unfortunate event. Thank you for your thoughts and prayers.’ Doug Stafford, Paul’s chief of staff, said in a statement Sunday that the senator has five rib fractures, including three displaced fractures, meaning the bones are partly or completely cracked. “‘This type of injury is caused by high velocity severe force. It is not clear exactly how soon he will return to work, as the pain is considerable as is the difficulty in getting around, including flying,’ Stafford said. Paul has lung contusions, or bruises, caused by the broken ribs, Stafford said. He could not say whether one lung was bruised or both, but said Paul’s recovery could last several months. Such fractures can cause other significant medical problems, including internal bleeding, damage to other organs or pneumonia.” http://wapo.st/2yzVrGY THIS IS IMPORTANT -- SEUNG MIN KIM: “A prolonged absence by Paul could also complicate matters for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and the broader Senate GOP’s legislative agenda. Republicans control just 52 votes in the chamber, and absences can thwart the leadership from obtaining the simple majority needed to confirm nominees and pass some legislation. The Senate GOP is aiming to take up their own tax overhaul later this month, which they are trying to pass using a fast-track legislative procedure that undercuts a filibuster from Democrats. A bill could be released later this week. “Paul has already indicated that, like during the health care fight, he is preparing to use his leverage to push the Senate’s tax bill in a more conservative direction -- pushing for more ambitious rate cuts and even repealing Obamacare’s individual mandate to purchase health insurance. He was the sole Senate Republican to vote against the GOP budget that set up the fast-track procedure for tax reform, called reconciliation.” http://politi.co/2AjEXzX -- “Menendez could remain in Senate even if he’s convicted,” by John Bresnahan: “As the bribery case against Sen. Bob Menendez concludes, Senate Democrats could face a stark question — how long will they stick by the New Jersey Democrat if he’s convicted? Menendez’s lawyers have a final chance Monday in their closing arguments to persuade the jury hearing his case in Newark that the veteran lawmaker is not guilty. With Menendez's fate likely to be decided within days, Democrats are already quietly strategizing on how to respond if he's found guilty. They will be in no rush to expel or force Menendez out of office, even if a Democrat wins the New Jersey gubernatorial race, according to several Democratic senators and aides.” http://politi.co/2Ac9xKJ RUSSIA WATCH -- “Trump Jr. Hinted at Review of Anti-Russia Law, Moscow Lawyer Says,” by Bloomberg’s Irina Reznik and Henry Meyer: “A Russian lawyer who met with President Donald Trump’s oldest son last year says he indicated that a law targeting Russia could be re-examined if his father won the election, and asked her for written evidence that illegal proceeds went to Hillary Clinton’s campaign. “The lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, said in a two-and-a-half-hour interview in Moscow that she would tell those and other things to the Senate Judiciary Committee on condition that her answers be made public, something it hasn’t agreed to. She has received scores of questions from the committee, which is investigating possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. Veselnitskaya said she’s also ready -- if asked -- to testify to Special Counsel Robert Mueller.” https://bloom.bg/2y94Lxb WAPO: “At least nine people in Trump’s orbit had contact with Russians during campaign and transition,” by Rosalind S. Helderman, Tom Hamburger and Carol D. Leonnig: “A key question in the investigation — and one that hangs over Trump’s presidency — is whether these instances add up to a concerted Russian government effort to probe and infiltrate the Trump campaign, or whether they were isolated coincidences and, therefore, inconsequential. Ultimately, Mueller must decide whether anyone in Trump’s orbit coordinated with the Russians, and, if so, if such actions were illegal or just unseemly. Collusion itself is not a crime.” http://wapo.st/2Al7VPM -- “Feds: Manafort claims current net worth of $28 million,” by Josh Gerstein: “Lawyers from special counsel Robert Mueller's office disclosed the figure as negotiations continue over a package of assets Manafort would pledge in order to be released from home confinement, which he's been under since he and longtime aide Rick Gates were arraigned Monday on a federal indictment. In a court filing Saturday, lawyers for Manafort offered to pledge three properties as part of the bail arrangement: Manafort's Trump Tower apartment in Manhattan, a condo several miles south in Chinatown and Manafort’s primary home in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.” http://politi.co/2h7dfha TRUMP’S CABINET -- NYT A1, “Commerce Secretary’s Offshore Ties to Putin ‘Cronies,’” by Mike McIntire, Sasha Chavkin and Martha M. Hamilton: “After becoming commerce secretary, Wilbur L. Ross Jr. retained investments in a shipping firm he once controlled that has significant business ties to a Russian oligarch subject to American sanctions and President Vladimir V. Putin’s son-in-law, according to newly disclosed documents. The shipper, Navigator Holdings, earns millions of dollars a year transporting gas for one of its top clients, a giant Russian energy company called Sibur, whose owners include the oligarch and Mr. Putin’s family member.” http://nyti.ms/2h8KNvB DAVID IGNATIUS in WaPo, “The Saudi crown prince just made a very risky power play”: Mohammed bin Salman “is emboldened by strong support from President Trump and his inner circle, who see him as a kindred disrupter of the status quo — at once a wealthy tycoon and a populist insurgent. It was probably no accident that last month, Jared Kushner, Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law, made a personal visit to Riyadh. The two princes are said to have stayed up until nearly 4 a.m. several nights, swapping stories and planning strategy.” http://wapo.st/2hJsBJL IN VIRGINIA -- “Gillespie shuns Trump in biggest race of 2017,” by Alex Isenstadt: “As the Virginia and New Jersey governors races draw to a close, one person is conspicuously absent from the trail: President Donald Trump. The president hasn’t appeared in either campaign, an indication of his increasingly narrow political appeal and his growing inability to draw support in swing and liberal states. Trump’s absence in the competitive Virginia contest is especially striking: He is the first president since Richard Nixon, who at the time was in the throes of the Watergate scandal, not to campaign in its governor’s race. … “The administration made it clear to Gillespie it wanted to be helpful however possible and was open to sending the president, three Trump aides to Trump said. Vice President Mike Pence appeared at a rally and fundraiser for Gillespie, but administration officials said the candidate never made a hard ask for Trump. Gillespie’s team reviewed polling in the final weeks of the race showing that Trump was a drag — his approval ratings had been stuck in the low 40s in the commonwealth for some time. While the president is well-liked across much of the conservative southern part of the state, he is extremely unpopular in the more liberal northern suburbs.” http://politi.co/2hMeHGS NYT’S JMART: “‘He’s closed an enthusiasm gap by rallying around the Trump agenda,’ said Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s former strategist. ‘And I think the big lesson for Tuesday is that, in Gillespie’s case, Trumpism without Trump can show the way forward. If that’s the case, Democrats better be very, very worried.’” http://nyti.ms/2lWZqra TOM COTTON PROFILE -- JEFFREY TOOBIN in the New Yorker, “Is Tom Cotton the Future of Trumpism? The junior senator from Arkansas is a hybrid of insurgent and old guard”: “Stephen Bannon, Trump’s former top strategist and the chairman of the right-wing Web site Breitbart News, told me, ‘Next to Trump, he’s the elected official who gets it the most—the economic nationalism. Cotton was the one most supportive of us, up front and behind the scenes, from the beginning. He understands that the Washington élite—this permanent political class of both parties, between the K Street consultants and politicians—needs to be shattered.’ At the same time, Cotton has maintained strong ties with the establishment wing of the G.O.P. ... Roby Brock, who hosts the leading public-affairs television program in Arkansas, told me[:] ... ‘The only thing everyone agrees on is that he wants to be President someday.’ ... “In the early days of the Trump Administration, Cotton exercised influence from behind the scenes. Bannon told me, ‘He spent a lot of time in my little war room, and he gave us a lot of good advice. He was the one who told us about John Kelly,' the former Marine Corps general who is now Trump’s chief of staff. (The Senator and Kelly had met at a security conference when Cotton was in the House.) In recent months, however, Cotton’s influence has become more apparent, as Trump has embraced some of his most high-profile positions.” http://bit.ly/2lX7po8 PHOTO DU JOUR: Investigators work at the scene of a deadly shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on Nov. 5. | Jay Janner/Austin American-Statesman via AP SUSAN GLASSER’S latest “Global Politico” podcast: “Sexism on America’s Front Lines: Six top national security pros sound off in this week’s Global Politico about an adversary closer to home: piggish men”: Laura Rosenberger remembers telling a senior State Department official that she was going on a beach vacation. He responded by saying how much he’d enjoy thinking about her wearing a bikini. With another senior official, it was always a ‘head squirm,’ she remembered, ‘so he couldn’t succeed in kissing me on the lips.’ “For Mieke Eoyang, it was a committee chairman on Capitol Hill, cornering her at a reception to brag about his ‘sexual endurance.’ Or a male colleague looking at porn on his office computer, right where she could see it. Loren DeJonge Schulman thinks about the Special Forces men who would walk around her Defense Department office in their underwear, and talk about making a calendar of sexy women. ‘I thought that was just a cost of doing business in the Pentagon,’ she recalled, and complaints were not welcomed. ‘The few times we ever did, we were effectively laughed out of the room, like, ‘This is just what Special Forces guys are like. Come on. Get over it. You’re lucky that they haven’t done worse than that.’ “All three are accomplished national security hands in Washington, and until now none has spoken publicly about these experiences – and the broader culture of everyday sexual harassment and sexism that is still rampant in the national security world.

Latvala amid counteroffensive against sex-harassment accusers,” by POLITICO Florida’s Marc Caputo and Matt Dixon: “After six women accused Florida Senate budget chairman Jack Latvala of sexual harassment, his allies launched a counteroffensive over the weekend targeting the accusers as well as a congressman who had faulted his fellow Republican for being ‘a hound.’ ‘Predators think they can obtain the outcomes they desire through intimidation. Jack always has,’ said U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, a rival of Latvala who denies any wrongdoing or involvement in the pushback effort. Latvala is facing pressure publicly from the Florida House and privately from within the Senate to be removed — at least temporarily — as chairman of the Senate’s budget committee pending the outcome of an independent investigation … Soon after Gaetz spoke out against Latvala, an opposition research file detailing his drunken driving record and land deals were posted on the website HelloFLA.” http://politi.co/2yyWnLH VALLEY TALK -- NYT A1, “Kremlin Cash Behind Billionaire’s Twitter and Facebook Investments,” by Jesse Drucker: “In the fall of 2010, the Russian billionaire investor Yuri Milner took the stage for a Q. and A. at a technology conference in San Francisco. Mr. Milner, whose holdings have included major stakes in Facebook and Twitter, is known for expounding on everything from the future of social media to the frontiers of space travel. But when someone asked a question that had swirled around his Silicon Valley ascent — Who were his investors? — he did not answer, turning repeatedly to the moderator with a look of incomprehension. Now, leaked documents examined by The New York Times offer a partial answer: Behind Mr. Milner’s investments in Facebook and Twitter were hundreds of millions of dollars from the Kremlin. “Obscured by a maze of offshore shell companies, the Twitter investment was backed by VTB, a Russian state-controlled bank often used for politically strategic deals. And a big investor in Mr. Milner’s Facebook deal received financing from Gazprom Investholding, another government-controlled financial institution, according to the documents. They include a cache of records from the Bermuda law firm Appleby that were obtained by the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and reviewed by The Times in collaboration with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.” http://nyti.ms/2hfP0kQ --ALSO NOTEWORTHY from the story: “[I]n July 2015, he was one of several high-profile investors in Cadre, a New York-based real estate technology company founded by Mr. Kushner and his brother, Joshua.

The first lady unveiled the White House's Christmas decorations -- simple, yet elegant, with elements of Americana and nature -- on Monday. Melania invited young children from nearby Joint Base Andrews to view the decorations and do crafts, and they showered her with compliments. ""She's beautiful like an angel!"" one child said as the first lady, dressed in a gorgeous cream Dior dress with bell sleeves and a fluid skirt that hit below her knees, walked into the East Room to help a group of kids make a garland. ""Are you the first lady?"" asked another. When FLOTUS walked into the room, all the children adorably went in for a group hug. Melania looked absolutely ecstatic! The cream-colored number is the same silhouette as the navy blue Dior look she recently wore during her tour of Asia. For Monday's occasion, she opted to accessorize the classic look with a skinny gold belt and stilettos of the same hue. Melania began her tour by emerging from the Grand Staircase into the Grand Foyer where a trio ballerinas were performing the ""Nutcracker Suite."" The decorations in the foyer consisted of a forest of Christmas trees that looked like they had just been covered with a layer of snow. In the Blue Room, an 18-foot, Wisconsin-grown pine tree decorated in ornaments representing every state and territory filled the room. Melania even had the chance to make gum drop trees with children in the Red Room, decorated in a candy theme, while warning them about the dangers of sugar. This year's theme of ""Time-Honored Traditions"" paid homage to the different traditions in American history, with each room representing a different tradition.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/in-sutherland-springs-a-mass-shooting-draws-desire-for-more--not-fewer--guns/2017/11/06/f4193ece-c342-11e7-aae0-cb18a8c29c65_story.html?utm_term=.6661911e1828,"SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Tex. — Many of this small town's residents had just learned, mostly by word of mouth, the names of the people slain or wounded at the First Baptist Church, and the horror unleashed by a gunman was too fresh for anyone to process fully. But one thing was emphatically clear Monday: These Texans weren't about to embrace gun control. This is a place where people carry firearms as routinely as they wear boots. They carry them out of sight, tucked in a waistband or in a pocket like a billfold. Or they carry them openly. “There are lots of guns in the community. Most people own guns in Texas,” Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said Monday. “But guns don’t kill people, people kill people.” The gun rights community has long had a favorite saying: The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. What happened Sunday offered for that community a resounding echo of their belief. A local man — described by officials as “our Texas hero” — who lives near First Baptist grabbed his own weapon and shot gunman Devin Patrick Kelley outside the church, forcing him to flee. [Texas church gunman had threatened his mother-in-law, who attended services there, officials say] Then the man, along with another resident, got in a vehicle and chased Kelley at high speeds. Kelley was found dead in his vehicle on the side of a road about 10 miles from the church. He had been hit twice — in the leg and the torso — and also had a self-inflected gunshot wound, according to his autopsy. The resident who shot Kelley did not answer his door, and a sheriff’s deputy said the family did not want people on the property. The second resident, Johnnie Langendorff, described his actions as “act now, ask questions later.” What some people were saying Monday was that the massacre could have been stopped sooner had the worshipers in the church been carrying. The attack could signal that a change is needed, said Brandy Johnson, 68, an evangelical minister who moved to Sutherland Springs a few months ago. Even in a church service in a one-stoplight town, someone should be tapped to be on the lookout for trouble, she said. “I think there should be some designated watchers and some designated firearm carriers,” she said. Johnson said she worked for many years for the Department of Homeland Security and was trained to be observant: “Look for the weird. Look for twitches. Look for nervousness.” [The Air Force says it failed to follow procedures, allowing Texas church shooter to obtain firearms] Pastor A.T. Tor, 39, brought a group of worshipers from San Antonio, about 40 minutes away, and he saw this as a spiritual crisis rather than one involving powerful firearms. “I don’t think this is a gun issue. I think it is a condition-of-the-heart issue,” he said. “If this was a gun issue, you’d have this way more. Think about how many people around here have guns. It is the person behind the gun.” Resident Mike Jordan, 50, has a tattoo on the right side of his lower leg that he said embodies everything he stands for: two smoking 1847 Colt Walkers beneath a state of Texas, colored red, white and blue. For rural Texans like Jordan, who grew up around guns, the weapons are not just symbols of self-reliance, they’re a way of life. “At any given time, you might see me with an AR-15 on my shoulder walking in my neighborhood,” said Jordan, who estimated that he owns about 20 guns. While the majority of Sutherland Springs residents don’t take advantage of the state’s liberal open-carry law, residents said, most people do carry concealed weapons, and most households own at least one weapon and usually several more. Seeing high-caliber weapons out in the open, especially if the muzzle is pointed down and the gun is strapped to the owner’s shoulder, doesn’t cause alarm. Hearing multiple shots fired in town is more likely to bring to mind hunting, rather than a gunman on a killing spree. A day after the church massacre involving an assault-style rifle, residents said their resolve to carry those weapons had only strengthened. “What happened in that church should show everybody that it’s not a gun problem, it’s a people problem,” said Jordan, whose grandson was nearly shot by Kelley. “A screwdriver in the hands of the wrong person can be a deadly weapon.” [Death sweeps across 3 generations of a single family gathered at Texas church] Kevin Langdon doesn’t carry a screwdriver, but it’s not unusual to find the retired 62-year-old teacher carrying multiple guns — usually small arms he uses to kill rattlesnakes and copperheads. At home, on the south side of Sutherland Springs, Langdon owns about 50 weapons, ranging from Civil War-era antiques to modern guns, such as an AK-47, which he uses to kill wild hogs that wander onto his 10-acre property and destroy his crops. Without an assault rifle, a charging hog can be deadly, he said. It’s people, however — not snakes or wild hogs — that locals worry about most. Langdon’s neighbors, who have formed an unofficial watch program, all own rifles, he said. They use the scopes to monitor one another’s properties in case a stranger approaches — a constant concern because of the traffic that passes through town along Highway 87, bringing big-city strangers from nearby San Antonio, he said. “If someone were to hit a woman at a gas station, there’d be 20 men on top of him beating a new lesson into him,” he said. “Everyone has everyone else’s back, and guns are how we keep one another safe.” But it was a man with local ties, not a stranger, who ended up being the greatest danger to the community Sunday — a man who shouldn’t have been allowed to purchase guns in the first place because of a domestic-assault conviction while he was in the military. It was the lack of guns in that church, Langdon and other locals said, that put Sutherland Springs residents at risk. “If everyone was armed with a gun in that church, how many people would’ve been killed?” he said. “Probably zero.” Authorities revealed that Kelley had been in the midst of a domestic dispute with relatives, including his mother-in-law, who has worshiped at First Baptist but was not present Sunday. The method of the attack seemed to draw inspiration from other recent mass shootings. Kelley dressed in pseudo-commando clothes: all-black “tactical” gear and a mask. He chose a soft target: people effectively trapped in a confined space. He used a semiautomatic rifle. Rick Schultz, 58, who retired from the military, said: “You pass a bunch of laws — who is going to obey those laws? Law-abiding citizens. . . . We just need to harden up soft targets. Having someone in there with a concealed weapon.” Sutherland Springs is a town nowhere in particular, with a single blinking light at the main crossroads. The land here is wide open under a big sky. There’s no downtown to speak of, just a string of businesses, including a Dollar General, a Valero gas station with a convenience store, and the post office. Most of the people in town Monday were strangers — the media, law enforcement personnel, people from the Red Cross or the Billy Graham Rapid Response Team, and so on. A forest of cameras had arisen a block from First Baptist. Makeshift tents, erected overnight by authorities, extended from the front of the church, creating a crime-scene zone out of sight of overhead helicopters or drones. “INCIDENT AHEAD” declared a road sign at the edge of town. Religious pilgrims had arrived, coming from far away to pray at the scene of the massacre. The grieving families found shelter and comfort a mile up a country road, far from the media scrum, at a church guarded by sheriff’s deputies.

She has posted a video on Twitter and YouTube describing the incident and asking others to share their stories. Speier says, Congress has been a breeding ground for a hostile work environment for far too long. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File)  Jackie Speier was a 23-year-old congressional staffer excited about her new job on Capitol Hill when her chief of staff got her alone in a room. The 50-year-old grabbed her face and stuck his tongue down her throat. Now, four and a half decades later, the Peninsula congresswoman is leading the charge in Congress to clean up what she calls a culture of sexual harassment in the Capitol. Since she went public with her story in late October, she’s been thrust into the national spotlight, introduced legislation to streamline harassment reporting procedures, testified at hearings on the topic and shed light on the big settlements paid out with taxpayers’ money to silence harassment complaints. “I’m embarrassed to say it, but I think Congress has been an enabler of sexual harassers for a long time,” Speier, a Democrat who represents San Mateo County, said in an interview this week. Speier has worked on sexual harassment policies for decades, beginning in California’s state Capitol. But when she was accosted in 1973, there weren’t any official channels to report what had happened — and even the term “sexual harassment” hadn’t entered the vernacular. “There was nowhere I could go,” she said. As wave after wave of sexual harassment revelations hit Hollywood and the media this fall, Speier shared her story in a YouTube video. She looked directly into the camera, urging other congressional staffers to come forward with their experiences with harassment and blasting the “breeding ground for a hostile work environment” that she says Congress has become. Speier is now the lead sponsor of a bill that would reform the Office of Compliance, the obscure congressional office that investigates — and, activists say, often covers up — sexual harassment. Victims of harassment in Congress who want to report their experiences have to go through a byzantine process, submitting to mandatory counseling, signing a nondisclosure agreement and waiting months before an investigation into their claims even begins. And interns and fellows still have no official channels to report sexual harassment. Get top headlines in your inbox every afternoon. Get the free PM Report newsletter. Sign Up From 1997 to 2016, the office paid out $15 million to settle sexual harassment complaints and other discrimination cases, without any real transparency or accounting of the claims. The office “was really created to protect the harassers,” Speier said. Her legislation would shake that up, prohibiting nondisclosure agreements as a requirement to start an investigation, speeding the process and including interns and fellows. It would also require members of Congress reimburse the federal Treasury for any sexual harassment settlements paid out because of their actions going forward. The bill, which was introduced in the Senate by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, has received bipartisan support. While Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, hasn’t publicly commented on the effort to reform the office, he has supported another Speier bill to mandate sexual harassment training for members of Congress and their staff. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a San Jose Democrat who is co-sponsoring the reform bill, said she had never known about Speier’s experience with harassment as a young staffer, even though the two were both working on Capitol Hill at the time. She praised her Bay Area colleague for speaking up. “It empowered people, and she just opened a floodgate,” Lofgren said. “I think we probably will have momentum on her bill.” As a California state assemblywoman and senator from 1986 to 2006, Speier wrote legislation mandating sexual harassment training. She said the recent allegations of sexual harassment in Sacramento — where almost 150 women recently wrote a letter decrying a culture of harassment — were disturbing. “I’m dismayed that (the training) didn’t have the effect we wanted,” she said. “It does seem like it’s an Animal House up there right now — it’s disgusting.” She urged California’s legislative leaders to take swift action. “It starts at the top,” she said. “To the extent that the leadership tolerates it, the conduct exists.” Since being elected to Congress in 2008, Speier has worked on issues like sexual assault in the military and on college campuses. In 2014, she tried to pass an amendment to the legislative budget mandating sexual harassment prevention training, but the chairman of the rules committee didn’t allow the measure to be debated. She also tried to add in more funding in the legislative budget for the compliance office to do more outreach, only to have that money removed in later revisions. “There was no willingness to look at this issue at all,” she said, unlike in recent weeks. “To see the change this dramatic is reassuring that if you take full advantage of timing, you can accomplish a lot.” But Speier said that she knows that national attention can be fickle, and thinks that she and other advocates may have a limited window to pass reforms while the focus is on sexual harassment. She pointed to the long-running debate over gun control, noting how congressional resolve to pass more firearm regulations gains steam after a mass shooting, only to dissolve within weeks or even days. “This has captured the interest of every American,” she said of the harassment issue. “I do think that we are in a defining moment culturally — which, at my age, I’m just reassured is happening.” That moment definitely hadn’t happened 44 years ago when Speier was forcibly kissed by her chief of staff, Joe Holsinger, who died in 2004. The two worked in the office of Rep. Leo Ryan, whose old district Speier now represents. Speier was shocked when Holsinger grabbed and kissed her, not understanding how he could think it was acceptable. “I recoiled, and I made sure I was never alone with him in a room ever again,” she said. Going public in the YouTube video wasn’t the first time that Speier used her own experiences as powerful arguments in policy debates. She made headlines in 2011 when she gave an impromptu speech on the House floor about having an abortion in the early 1990s after doctors told her she was losing a baby that she desperately wanted. In 1988, Speier became the first California legislator to give birth while in office. And she’s also known for surviving five gunshot wounds in November 1978 while investigating the People’s Temple in Jonestown, Guyana, with Congressman Ryan, who was killed in the attack. Jessica Levinson, a law professor at Loyola University, said that Speier’s decision to share her experience of harassment was a smart way to prod Congress to act. “Lawmakers make better policy when they have a variety of experiences,” Levinson said. “It’s vitally important that this isn’t just something where we get outside testimony of how sexual harassment can affect people, but it’s someone on the inside who can say, ‘Let me talk to you about my personal experience.”’ Since she released the video, Speier said she’s talked in person to four House staffers who have experienced harassment or assault, and on the phone to “many others.” Leeann Tweeden, a Los Angeles newscaster, said she decided to publicly accuse Sen. Al Franken, D-Minnesota, of harassing and groping her after interviewing Speier and hearing her story. Tweeden wrote in an article that she came forward because she wanted to have the same effect on other victims of harassment “that Congresswoman Jackie Speier had on me.” Speier has said she knows of two current members of Congress, one a Democrat and the other a Republican, who have been accused of sexual harassment.

http://www.cleveland.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/11/talk_it_out_trump_says_texas_s.html,"CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Following the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. story last month in Las Vegas, President Trump refused to talk about whether or not the United States has a gun problem. After a man opened fire Sunday at a Texas church, killing 26 people, Trump still doesn't want to talk about it. ""Mental health is your problem here, he said at a news conference in Tokyo Monday. ""This was a very, based on preliminary reports, a very deranged individual, a lot of problems over a long period of time. We have a lot of mental health problems in our country, as do other countries. ""But this isn't a guns situation."" Trump is correct about the prevalence of mental illness. Nearly one of five Americans experiences mental illness in a given year, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. While that number is comparable to mental illness rates in other Western countries, it does not explain why there are more mass shootings here than anywhere else or that we are the most armed nation in the world. Any time there is one of these tragedies, the topic of gun control is inevitably brought up, eliciting strong opinions on both sides. WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU In today's Talk it Out session, we want to know, does this country have a gun problem, a mental health problem or both? If so, how serious is it? What can be done about it?

https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2017/nov/09/cma-country-music-association-awards-gun-control,"A gentle Trump parody aside, the Country Music Association’s annual event dodged burning political issues – including gun control Last modified on Wed 20 Feb 2019 16.08 GMT “Maybe next time, he’ll think before he tweets,” sang co-hosts Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood during their opening banter at the 51st annual Country Music Association awards. In terms of political provocation or controversy, the minute-long Trump-baiting parody of Underwood’s hit single, Before He Cheats, was as notable a political statement as anyone made during this year’s ceremony. Paisley and Underwood have developed a repartee in their decade-long stint as the show’s co-hosts, yet their shtick has always been grounded in an affable, aw-shucks flavor of humor designed not to offend. As such things go, they’re consummate professionals, able to effectively deliver one-liners and to keep the performances and award presentations moving at a brisk pace. But provocateurs they are not.  Underwood referred to several mass shootings and a couple of hurricanes in her first remarks. Then she and Paisley spoke briefly about the problematic media policy regarding political topics that the CMA issued and then retracted last week, which threatened to ban journalists who mentioned last month’s mass shooting at Route 91 Harvest, the Las Vegas country festival . A few puns on notable politicians’ names and that quick song about Trump’s Twitter use later, and the show largely went on about its business. Throughout, performers including Miranda Lambert (winner of female vocalist of the year), Little Big Town (vocal group of the year), and Garth Brooks (entertainer of the year) made passing references to “unity” and “family” and “healing” in their acceptance speeches. But the show lacked any sense of purpose – last year’s broadcast celebrated the CMA’s 50th anniversary and focused on the genre’s storied history – and failed to seize the opportunity to present a unified statement about how the country music industry has dealt with tragedies that have directly affected many within its community. That said, the show’s most moving moment came during the in-memoriam segment, when Underwood delivered a stirring, note-perfect rendition of the hymn, Softly and Tenderly. As her voice broke with emotion in the final bars, the slideshow of country music artists and insiders who had died during the last year was replaced with photos of the victims of the Las Vegas shooting. A moment that could easily have appeared cloying or manipulative was handled with grace. Still, that moment was relatively fleeting. After the commercial break, the lackluster performances resumed without further political comment – a tepid duet by Dan + Shay and Lauren Alaina on a cover of the Youngbloods’ Get Together was followed by a horrific pairing between Paisley and upstart Kane Brown on Paisley’s Heaven South. Keith Urban aimed for topicality when he debuted his new single, Female, purportedly inspired by the ongoing investigation into the sexual abuse allegedly committed by Harvey Weinstein, but the song’s poor construction undercut whatever its greater message may have been. With a chorus that is simply a list of words and phrases (“mother”, “sinner”, “baby girl”, “scarlet letter”, “holy water”), Urban’s performance hardly lit up social media with discussions of country music’s entrenched misogyny. Indeed, it’s worth noting that four of the five nominees for male vocalist of the year (Urban, Eric Church, Thomas Rhett and Chris Stapleton) were given solo slots on the show, while only two of the female vocalist of the year nominees (Lambert and Underwood) were accorded the same status. Moreover, that Urban premiered a single that was partially a reaction to Weinstein’s crimes felt questionable, given that the CMA still has not commented on the allegations of sexual abuse made against prominent Nashville publicist and CMA member Kirt Webster. Again, the CMAs seemed to be far more concerned with not being about anything at all. It wasn’t about anointing a new star in the way that Stapleton announced himself at the 2015 show. It wasn’t about celebrating any particular artist: Stapleton, Brothers Osborne and Little Big Town were the only acts to win two awards (the latter’s Taylor Swift-penned single Better Man earned the pop star a song of the year prize). It wasn’t about honoring country music either – the opening number was an enthusiastic but stultifying all-star cover of Hootie and the Blowfish’s Hold My Hand; Rhett performed a song built around a reference to Coldplay; Pink sang her track Barbies for reasons that went entirely unexplained; and Maren Morris performed a duet with Niall Horan that consisted primarily of one of his songs rather than hers. By focusing on what they didn’t want to talk about, the CMAs ended up with a show that lacked any discernible identity. Perhaps, in that way, it perfectly reflected the year in country music."
http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-met-rahm-emanuel-ballot-questions-20171117-story.html,"Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s City Council allies are trying to get three questions on Chicago ballots in the March primary election in an annual bid to prevent questions with potentially embarrassing results for the mayor from making it before voters. Ald. Pat O’Connor, the mayor’s council floor leader, hopes to ask voters if they support a comprehensive strategy to address opioid and heroin deaths, including more state money for addiction treatment. Ald. Margaret Laurino, who runs council meetings when the mayor leaves the dais, has submitted a question asking whether Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner should support legislation to amend the state insurance code to preserve various health care benefits for people who signed up for the Affordable Care Act. And Ald. Ariel Reboyras, who Emanuel tapped to chair the key Public Safety Committee, wants to know whether Chicagoans support state legislation to ban firearm bump stocks of the kind used in the mass shooting in Las Vegas, and if they would like stronger penalties for illegal gun traffickers. All three aldermen said Friday that they introduced the questions because they believe it’s worthwhile to take city voters’ pulse on the topics. “I just thought it was the right time to find out where people stand on this,” said Reboyras, 30th. RELATED: Who's running for Chicago mayor in 2019? Possible candidates emerge as Emanuel seeks term 3 Under state law, no more than three advisory questions can appear on the ballot each election. So if the City Council votes to include the recently proposed questions, it would effectively block anyone else from getting one on there. Such questions carry no legislative weight, but City Hall over the years generally has tried to avoid referendum topics that could show strong citywide support for positions the mayor opposes. In summer 2016, the council’s Progressive Caucus pushed a question for the fall ballot asking whether Emanuel should be stripped of his control of the city's two major airports in favor of an independent authority. The council instead opted to include questions about gun trafficking, school funding and city services for people who don’t have IDs. Aldermen previously have tried unsuccessfully to get on the citywide ballot a question about whether the Chicago Board of Education should be elected instead of selected by the mayor. RELATED: Weighing third term, Emanuel relies on campaign donors who get City Hall benefits O’Connor, 40th, said there was no intent to block other referendums from the ballot, and that the three proposals were put forward in a timely fashion by senior council members because they understand the process and have issues they want to address. “There is nothing that I’m aware of that (the mayor) is looking to not have on the ballot,” he said. And Laurino, 39th, pointed out “anybody has the option to introduce one if they wanted to, and I didn’t see anybody else doing that.” The three questions will head to the council Rules Committee, and the full City Council could vote next month to include them on the March 20 ballot that includes primary contests for governor and attorney general, and various other state and Cook County races. jebyrne@chicagotribune.com hdardick@chicagotribune.com CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-sight/wp/2017/11/14/pairing-feelings-with-facts-photographing-the-sutherland-springs-church-shooting/,"This article is more than 1 year old The rumble of TV satellite news trucks and crowing of roosters were the only sounds to break the heavy stillness as I pulled into Sutherland Springs before dawn on Nov. 6. This town of about 600, though new to me, felt familiar. Houses worn from the harsh South Texas sun; stray dogs lounging in the road; a single blinking traffic light. But at the corner of Highway 87 and Farm To Market Road 539, yellow police tape surrounded the perimeter of the short-steepled First Baptist Church. A black trailer, marked by a huge FBI seal, was parked out front. Residents, who less than 24 hours earlier had become the latest victims of a mass shooting, seemed to be in hiding. Well-dressed journalists knocked on doors while officials patrolled the streets. By nightfall, churches from nearby San Antonio organized a vigil on the local baseball field, which would later serve as the grounds for the town’s first church service after the shooting, drawing hundreds from across the country. One resident, Terrie Smith, who runs the kitchen in the S.S. Express Valero gas station, started cooking furiously to feed the influx of journalists — a welcome distraction from the immense sadness looming overhead. Yet, not until Thursday, after most out-of-town media had departed, did the locals start to emerge from their homes and the town seem to breathe again. During my week in Sutherland Springs, it was difficult at times to not feel overwhelmed by the incredible grief that the community was feeling. Part of my process as a photojournalist is to think about what the people I am photographing are feeling and then to convey that through many different scenes and individuals. Pairing feelings with facts makes for stronger visual journalism. While I will never be able to fully comprehend what these families experienced, as I witnessed their resilience in the wake of the tragedy, I tried to convey their fortitude visually. Many in the town cited their faith as the source of their strength. They see prayer as a way to take action and help their community heal. Some have hung wooden crosses on front doors, planted them in homes and yards. Others turned to constant prayer — squeezing in moments of gratitude and contemplation at every possible moment. I have never seen a community’s faith be so steadfast. On Monday, one week after I arrived, I attended 16-year-old Haley Krueger’s funeral. During the service, several of her friends stood up, teary-eyed, to remember how Haley could brighten a room in an instant. “It is imperatively important that we live like Haley did — full of light,” Pastor Brandon Caddell said. “We have to let our light shine like Haley did every day of her life.” Sometimes as a photographer, it’s not just about seeking the light, but providing some, too.

https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2017/11/12/addressing_mass_shootings_every_idea_on_the_table_135523.html,"For some children of the ’60s, the decade’s most traumatic crimes weren’t the assassinations of John and Robert Kennedy or the martyrdom of Martin Luther King—or even the appalling 1963 Klan church bombing that killed four black girls in Birmingham. It wasn’t even the rape, torture, and strangulation of eight student nurses by a psycho named Richard Speck in Chicago in mid-July of 1966. The most terrifying violence came two weeks later when a former U.S. Marine named Charles Whitman killed his wife and mother before taking an arsenal to the University of Texas tower and shot everyone he saw. By the time an Austin cop took him out, Whitman had killed 16 people and wounded 31. As a kid growing up the Bay Area, I viewed Stanford’s Hoover Tower and the Campanile at UC-Berkeley differently after that. One day, while walking by Saints Peter and Paul Church in North Beach, my dad said that Joe DiMaggio had gotten married there. My kid brother asked if a madman had ever used the cathedral as a perch to shoot people below in Washington Square. Parents assured their children with the only logic they could muster: Such crimes are rare, they said. This was true then. It’s not true anymore—and hasn’t been for a while. As a cub police reporter in San Diego in 1979, I was on the scene for the first mass shooting at an American elementary school. The anomaly wasn’t only the choice of target, Cleveland Elementary School, but also that the shooter was a girl, 16-year-old Brenda Spencer. The first mass shooting in a church took place the following year when a 46-year-old atheist walked into the First Baptist Church in Daingerfield, Texas, yelling “This is war!” It wasn’t war, but it seemed like hell to the parishioners cowering in the pews. Daingerfield and the Cleveland Elementary School revealed that no place was a sanctuary. Since then, America has suffered through at least eight other such attacks on places of worship, one of them a Sikh temple in Wisconsin. Three of these killers have professed racist, homophobic, or white supremacist views; another hated Baptists. One was a Muslim angry about the killings at Temple Emanuel in Charleston, S.C. The litany of colleges devastated by such crimes grows yearly. Everyone remembers the carnage at Virginia Tech, but have we forgotten the mass shootings at Northern Illinois University, Arizona, San Diego State, Umpqua Community College, and Santa Monica College? Yes, Columbine High School and Sandy Hook Elementary were shocks to the national psyche, but killers have slaughtered innocents at a host of other schools, including another Cleveland Elementary in California, this one in Stockton. In 2012, after 12 movie-goers were gunned down in Aurora, Colorado, I wrote a four-part series examining the issue. Since then, four of the five deadliest shootings in U.S. history have taken place. Twenty-six dead in Newtown, Connecticut, including 20 kids ages 6 and 7. Forty-nine at the Pulse club in Orlando; 58 killed and more than 500 wounded in Las Vegas last month; 26 killed a week ago at a small Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Speaking for millions of Americans, the time for business-as-usual is over. We need a national dialogue on this plague, followed by concrete action. It’s time to put everything on the table, and I do mean everything.  Mass shootings are not a new phenomenon. But the death toll has become staggering, and the ripple effects to the society potentially debilitating. The entrenched battle lines between Democrats and Republican are killing this country. Resuscitating it will require liberals and conservatives to put their fellow Americans ahead of stale ideologies and mindless talking points. In 1903 the streets of Winfield, Kansas were turned red by Spanish-American War veteran Gilbert Twigg. Twigg killed nine people and wounded many more at an outdoor concert before turning a revolver on himself. “The boys around town had referred to him as ‘Crazy’ Twigg,” the local paper reported later, “but no one thought he was dangerous.” Today, we all know that mentally ill men with a proficiency with firearms, no job, and a seething anger toward society are quite dangerous. So why such easy access to firearms? One reason is that our laws are too deferential to the rights of the mentally ill. Charles Whitman suspected, correctly, that he had brain damage. He told his shrink he fantasized about shooting people from a tower. His therapist told no one. Aurora multiplex killer James Holmes told his psychiatrist that he had “homicidal thoughts” three or four times a day and that it was getting worse. She told no one. Jared Loughner, the Tucson shooter who wounded Congresswoman Gabrielle Gifford and 13 others while killing six, acted so oddly that some students and teachers refused to be in the same class with him. But he could buy guns. Let’s change that. Here are other steps to consider: --You don’t like how Donald Trump speaks about Muslim immigrants? I don’t, either. But let’s not pretend we don’t know who attacked the Pulse nightclub, Fort Hood, two Chattanooga military bases, the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, or who drove the deadly truck in New York City. The answer is Muslim immigrants or first-generation Muslims radicalized by Islamic extremist groups. The Trump administration wants stricter vetting of such people? Isn’t that an obvious need? --You like the Second Amendment? I once did, too. But the arsenal Stephen Paddock took to the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas included weapons for a battlefield. If the National Rifle Association keeps defending the unlimited right of Americans to hoard such weapons, millennial generation voters already flocking to liberal candidates and causes will eventually repeal it. Take heed, NRA. --What about existing gun laws—why aren’t they enforced? How was a dangerous convict like Devin Patrick Kelley able to purchase his guns after being cashiered from the U.S. Air Force and serving time for beating his wife and stepson? Slipped through the cracks, did he? We should have laws making such negligence a criminal offense. --The Second Amendment isn’t the only constitutional hurdle we must confront. I’m a journalist who relies on the First Amendment for my livelihood. But is it time to set limits? Social scientists have known for 50 years that Americans’ unfettered access to violent programming contributes to aggressive behavior and copy-cat crimes. The Aurora shooter attended a midnight showing of “The Dark Knight Rises” with dyed hair and guns, having left chemical booby traps back in his apartment adorned with Batman posters. He told cops he was the Joker. So far, lawsuits targeting studios – and video game manufacturers – have not dented the production of such nihilistic fare. Plaintiff lawyers must keep trying. Remember, it took a while to bag Big Tobacco, too. --Finally, what about the wall-to-wall news coverage of such events? It’s become clear to criminal justice experts that some sort of grim competition exists with these killers. Covering their crimes – covering the news – is not the same thing as producing mindlessly violent video games and is certainly protected by the First Amendment. Yet not everything that the news media can do is something it should do. Food for thought, colleagues. Carl M. Cannon is the Washington Bureau Chief for RealClearPolitics.

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-filemon-vela_us_5a1acb05e4b0cee6c0504421?ck,"Senior reporter, HuffPost Rep. Filemon Vela (D-Texas) lashed out at President Donald Trump for using Friday’s deadly mass shooting at an Egyptian mosque to keep up his push for construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. “What an idiot,” Vela tweeted Sunday in response to a Washington Post piece analyzing Trump’s suggestion that a border wall would effectively stop Muslim extremists from entering the United States. Vela, an outspoken Trump critic, questioned whether the president “foolishly” believed such a wall could have prevented the 9/11 attacks, as well as the wave of mass shootings plaguing the country, including the ones in Las Vegas last month and at a Texas church earlier this month. What an idiot... Does @realDonaldTrump foolishly think a border wall would have prevented 9/11, Charleston, San Bernardino, Orlando, Las Vegas, and Sutherland Springs? Some details remain unclear over Friday’s attack in Egypt, which left at least 305 dead in the Sinai region. No group has claimed responsibility, though gunmen carried the black flag of the Islamic State during the attack. Trump almost immediately used the attack to peddle his border wall and tighter immigration policies. Will be calling the President of Egypt in a short while to discuss the tragic terrorist attack, with so much loss of life. We have to get TOUGHER AND SMARTER than ever before, and we will. Need the WALL, need the BAN! God bless the people of Egypt. Throughout his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump promised his supporters “a big, beautiful wall” if elected. But in the more than 10 months since taking office, Trump has failed to make any significant progress on it. There’s little evidence to suggest terrorists are crossing into the U.S. using the southwest border. Only “a handful” of people with ties to Islamic terrorist groups have ever been caught attempting to enter the U.S. from there, the Post reported Saturday. In most U.S. mass shootings, the gunmen are white, male U.S. citizens. Senior reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how."
http://time.com/5011644/donald-trump-texas-shooting-asia/?iid=sr-link3,"Just one day after arriving in Japan for a 12-day trip across Asia, President Trump was briefed on yet another mass shooting that had happened on U.S. soil: the rampage in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in which 26 people were killed after a gunman opened fire on a church. This is the third time within five weeks that Trump had to comfort a nation in the midst of a national tragedy. The shooting occurred just days after a terrorist attack in New York City killed eight people and injured a dozen more, and a little over a month after a gunman opened fire on a country music festival in Las Vegas, killed over 58 people and injured over 500. The President’s response to the tragedy in Texas echoed his reaction to the shooting in Las Vegas, where he offered condolences to the victims and stressed the importance of national unity, rather than his response to the New York City attack, where he immediately began calling for immigration policy changes after the suspect was identified. News of the shooting began to break Sunday afternoon, at approximately 2 p.m. Eastern. At 3:06 P.M., Trump tweeted: “May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan.” At 5:54 P.M. Eastern — which was Monday morning in Japan — Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that Trump had been continuously briefed on the shooting and had spoken with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. “Our thoughts and prayers are with all of the friends and families affected. May God comfort them all in this time of tragedy,” Sanders says in a statement. Approximately three hours later, the White House issues an official statement from Trump thanking first responders, calling for national unity, and pledging assistance for the investigation. “We cannot put into words the pain and grief we all feel, and we cannot begin to imagine the suffering of those who lost the ones they loved. Our hearts are broken. But in dark times such as these, Americans do what we do best: we pull together. We join hands. We lock arms. And through the tears and the sadness, we stand strong,” Trump says in the statement. The White House also issues a presidential proclamation honoring the victims of the shooting. Trump subsequently addresses the shooting in remarks to U.S. and Japanese business leaders in Tokyo, reiterating the sentiments expressed in the White House statement. “Our hearts are broken, but in dark times — and these are dark times — such as these, Americans do what they do best: “We pull together. We join hands, we lock arms, and through the tears and through the sadness, we stand strong — oh, so strong,” he says. By this point after the New York City attack just days earlier, Trump had already said on Twitter that he had implemented policy changes, asking the Department of Homeland Security to intensify extreme vetting procedures after the suspect was identified as an immigrant from Uzbekistan. When a reporter tried to ask Trump about gun control policy after this event, according to a pool report, White House aides asked the media to leave. But Trump held a joint news conference Monday morning with Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, less than 24 hours after the attack, where a question about the shooting and possible gun control measures inevitably came up. He told reporters that mental health is the issue at hand, and that the gunman, who authorities have identified as 26-year-old Devin Kelley, was a “very deranged individual.” “We have a lot of mental health problems in our country, as do other countries. But this isn’t a guns situation. I mean, we could go into it, but it’s a little bit soon to go into it,” Trump continued. “But, fortunately, somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction, otherwise it would have been — as bad it was, it would have been much worse.” Write to Alana Abramson at Alana.Abramson@time.com."
http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/hottopics/~3/Qwo-LZ_E1zI/ct-athletes-call-on-nfl-to-sign-colin-kaepernick-20171116-story.html,"Michael Bennett and other athletes, including the WNBA's Brittney Griner and Breanna Stewart, as well as Olympic fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad, are calling on the NFL to sign Colin Kaepernick. In a statement issued Wednesday by a Bennett-led group called Athletes in Action, they said, ""No one should be denied employment for having the courage to follow their convictions and take action for equality and social justice."" ""Join me and many others to get Colin Kaepernick signed!"" Bennett, a Seahawks defensive end, said on Twitter. Kaepernick has been a free agent since parting ways with the 49ers in March, and many believe that he is being deliberately shunned by the NFL for being the first in the league last season to stage protests during the national anthem. The 30-year-old Kaepernick has filed a grievance against the NFL for colluding to deny him employment, and attorneys for the quarterback are seeking to obtain depositions from several team owners, as well as Commissioner Roger Goodell. ""Every day that goes by and he doesn't get signed is another nail in the NFL's defense,"" one of the attorneys, Mark Geragos, told The Post's Mark Maske earlier this month. Bennett's group, which also includes former Olympian John Carlos, famous for raising a black-gloved fist on the medal podium during the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City, is seeking to harness people power on behalf of Kaepernick. Other Athletes for Impact campaigns include initiatives on gun safety, mass incarceration, police violence, LGBTQ rights, immigration and climate change. In its statement Wednesday, the group traced a tradition of athletes protesting social injustices back to the 1960s, then through the 1996 anthem protests of former NBA player Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf and demonstrations last year by WNBA players, before Kaepernick began sitting, then kneeling, during renditions of ""Star-Spangled Banner"" ahead of preseason games. ""Kaepernick was clear in live interviews and in writing about the intentions of his protest,"" the group said, ""stating time and time again the specific reasons for his demonstration, and that it was not intended to disrespect the military but start a national conversation and action around issues of injustice."" ""It is now clear that because of his courage and willingness to speak truth to power, Kaepernick has not been signed by any NFL team,"" the statement claimed. ""As Seattle Seahawks star, Michael Bennett said of Kaepernick, 'if you look at the quarterbacks in the NFL right now, out of the backups, I can't name one better than him . . .' ""Legendary athletes such as Muhammad Ali, Tommy Smith and John Carlos were disparaged by many in their day for using their platform to speak out against racism and injustice. Today their statues stand proudly in the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., and they are widely celebrated as truth tellers ahead of their time. It is time we start celebrating our truth tellers from the start."" Bennett was among the first NFL players to stage anthem demonstrations this season. Including the preseason, he has sat on a bench on Seattle's sideline during the anthem before every game except two. Earlier this month, he stood along with every Seahawks player while the host Arizona Cardinals celebrated their ""Salute to Service"" night, and before an October game they all stood to honor the victims of the Las Vegas mass shooting. After Goodell said last month that his league believes ""everyone should stand"" for the anthem, but would not force players to do so, Bennett said, ""I plan on sitting down."" With talks occurring between the NFL and its players about how to negotiate an end to the protests, the two-time Pro Bowler said at the time, ""I think the first step to even being able to even have a conversation is to make sure that Colin Kaepernick gets an opportunity to play in the NFL. ""I think all of us are having opportunities to be able to speak to our employers, but to think about the guy who started everything not to be able to have a voice at this moment, it just doesn't seem very right to me,"" Bennett added. Last week, Geragos disputed a claim by an NFL spokesman that Kaepernick's camp had not responded to an offer from the league for the quarterback to have a one-on-one meeting with Goodell. The attorney said that Kaepernick ""would be happy to attend"" a meeting with the commissioner, but that the presence of a mediator would be required because of the grievance the quarterback has filed. In its statement, Athletes for Impact said, ""We call on all NFL owners, general managers and coaches with a positional need to summon the courage to sign Colin Kaepernick and to stand with us on the right side of history.""

We can spend hours debating the root causes, historical circumstances that compel people to commit crime. … But we do not have the luxury of time to stop the killers.” Rosenstein didn't go as far as President Trump, who has called the city a ""total disaster"" because of its violence.  And he didn't blame the violence on Chicago's status as a sanctuary city, as Attorney General Jeff Session has, linking policies on undocumented immigrants to soaring crime rates. But he did note that the more than 4,300 shooting victims and 760 homicides in the city last year translated into a person shot every two hours and two people killed each day. Rosenstein took issue with some recent decisions by the Chicago Police Department, including a requirement that officers fill out forms for routine investigative stops.  They were ordered after the American Civil Liberties Union released a study showing minorities have been predominately targeted for stops here. The information was intended to help a retired federal magistrate judge evaluate whether officers were following the constitution when they make street stops.  But the police union has claimed traffic stops declined 80 percent because officers found the forms burdensome.  They have since been streamlined twice. Rosenstein said the requirement contributed to a  “dramatic disruption in policing” that has contributed to the spike in violence crime.  “Deterrence is about fear,” he said. “If dangerous criminals are not afraid, then law-abiding citizens are not safe. “So when we see a surge in violent crime that follows a dramatic disruption in policing, as happened in Baltimore and Chicago, it’s obvious there is a lapse in the deterrent effect of law enforcement,"" he continued. ""The debate about what caused the lapse will endure, as will efforts to remedy the root causes and improve relationships between police officers and residents of high crime neighborhoods.” Rosenstein implored the law enforcement officials at the dinner to “rededicate themselves to nonpartisan principles of law enforcement” and their commitment to serving high-crime neighborhoods. “We must never give up on the people who live in those neighborhoods,” he said. ""The majority of the residents are not violent people. They struggle every day to survive violence that surrounds them. They are our people and it is our duty to protect them. Every city should be a sanctuary where people live in peace, not afraid.” Earlier in the day, Rosenstein met with Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson for two hours at a strategic decision support center in the Englewood police district, according to chief police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.  The department says the level of violence in Englewood has dropped to its lowest point since 1999, and it credits the decline to the expansion of gunshot detection technology and analytic tools. Rosenstein said he found the decrease “very encouraging” and praised the department proactive policing, including raids on people on a “strategic subject list,” a compilation of people most likely to commit or be targeted by violence. “Targeting dangerous repeat offenders is not a zero tolerance strategy. It does not involve arresting random people for minor offenses,"" Rosenstein said. Much of Chicago’s top brass, including Johnson, were not at Rosenstein’s speech because it coincided with a Chicago Police Board meeting. Many suburban police chiefs, including those from Maywood and Robbins, were among  several hundred law enforcement officials in attendance. Rosenstein’s appearance came after months of blistering criticism of the city from the Trump administration. After the mass shooting at a Texas church, Trump downplayed the need for gun control, incorrectly asserting Chicago has “the strongest gun laws in our nation.” He described the city as a “total disaster.” Rosenstein’s immediate boss, Sessions, has feuded with Chicago and other “sanctuary cities,” threatening to withhold grant money if local law enforcement doesn't cooperate with immigration agents. Rosenstein has been embroiled in controversy over much of Trump's tenure. Trump initially pointed to a memo from Rosenstein as a basis to fire FBI director James Comey, who had been overseeing the investigation into Russia interference in the 2016 election. Sessions later recused himself from the matter and Rosenstein, the department’s second-in-command, appointed former FBI director Robert Mueller as special counsel. Rosenstein joked about the audience he drew in Chicago, fielding questions from law students at John Marshall Law School in Chicago.  “I have not answered so many questions since my last congressional hearing,” he said.

Sugar Land man painted as ""King of Kush""  by Gabrielle Banks He stashed it in tote bags, spent it on properties and made nightly deposits but the cash from drug sales kept piling up at Muhammad Shariq Siddiqi's home in Sugar Land, federal investigators said. There was so much money police were summoned to his son's school because the boy was handing out $20 and $100 bills to classmates. FBI data indicate military rarely reports domestic violence By St. John Barned-Smith and Sig Christenson The U.S. Department of Defense -- now under scrutiny for failing to report a domestic violence conviction that could have stopped Devin Patrick Kelley from purchasing several guns used in the Texas church shooting -- reported just one domestic violence conviction to a national FBI database in all of 2016. Violence mounts around homeless camp as man shot to death By Alyson Ward and Margaret Kadifa In the latest in a series of violent acts near a Midtown homeless encampment, a man was found shot to death late Tuesday night after area residents heard gunfire. The encampment, which sprawls beneath the Interstate 69 bridge near the intersection of Caroline and Wheeler, has become a serious trouble spot for the city, with multiple reports of violence since late August. Texas colleges feeling effects of decline in international students By Lindsay EllisUniversity of Houston Clear Lake is among several universities around Texas that this year have seen a sharp drop in international enrollment, as the number of international student applications to four-year public universities has plummeted by more than 10,000 after three years of growth, according to recently compiled data.Experts and college administrators blame a number of factors, including President Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric during the 2016 campaign and in office, as well as the global economy. Church shooting again puts spotlight on domestic violenceBy St. John Barned-Smith, John D. Harden, and Keri Blakinger The mass shooting in Sutherland Springs last week left America shocked, searching for a cause, something to explain the brazen slaughter of 26 people as they prayed. They wondered what could have possessed Devin Patrick Kelley, the 26-year-old disgraced airman identified as the shooter, to act with such cruelty. One factor that surfaced early in the investigation - a chaotic past of domestic abuse and violence - has proved all too common in Texas in recent years. Domestic violence cases have risen sharply across the state, with more than 210,000 wives, girlfriends, husbands and others suffering death or injury at the hands of a family member in the past two years.GOP turnover gives Texas Democrats hope for opportunities in congressional racesBy Kevin Diaz and Mike Ward A wave of retirement announcements from Texas Republicans in both Congress and the Legislature already had sparked a lot of speculation that the pendulum of power might swing against the GOP, even possibly to some degree in a deep red state like Texas. ""We've worked from the beginning of this election cycle to expand the battlefield, and that means making sure there are strong candidates who fit their districts ready to capitalize on whatever environment 2018 brings,"" said Cole Leiter of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the campaign arm of the House Democrats. Keri Blakinger covered breaking news, prisons and the death penalty. She was hired at the Houston Chronicle through the Hearst Fellows program. She graduated from Cornell University and covered county and town government at the Ithaca Times before moving to breaking news at the New York Daily News. After three years at the Chronicle, she moved to The Marshall Project."

http://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/Blake-Trump-s-gun-control-stance-not-based-on-12339291.php,"Courtney Manwaring holds an AR-15 semi-automatic gun at Action Target on June 17, 2016 in Springville, Utah. Semi-automatics are in the news again. President Donald Trump has quickly shut the door on increased gun control in response to the mass shooting at a Texas church on Sunday. And on Tuesday he made a highly specific - and highly dubious - claim that will turn heads. During a news conference in Seoul, Trump was asked whether he might want to also apply the kind of ""extreme vetting"" that he advocates for immigration to the purchasing of guns. Turns out he does not. And he actually contends that stronger gun control might have multiplied the death toll in Sutherland Springs. Here's how he responded: ""If you did what you're suggesting, there would have been no difference three days ago, and you might not have had that very brave person who happened to have a gun or a rifle in his truck go out and shoot him, and hit him and neutralize him. And I can only say this: If he didn't have a gun, instead of having 26 dead, you would have had hundreds more dead. So that's the way I feel about it. Not going to help."" This claim echoes what the National Rifle Association often says about such tragedies: The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. And many Americans agree with that. The circumstances in Sutherland Springs, where the shooter was chased away by armed civilians, would certainly seem to bolster the claim that guns can also ward off tragedy or reduce its scope. But with this claim, Trump takes a plausible premise and stretches it beyond recognition, as he so often does. The president's penchant for hyperbole and ignoring inconvenient facts are present here. First, Trump's claim that hundreds more would have died if those two civilians who warded him off didn't have guns is highly suspect. The largest mass shooting in U.S. history - which took place in Las Vegas last month - left 58 dead. Trump is essentially arguing that the Texas shooting would have been at least eight times more deadly and four times worse than Las Vegas, which is very speculative at best and implausible at worst. And the fact that a U.S. president is so openly speculative about the scope of such tragedy is remarkable. Trump isn't suggesting this could have happened; he's saying it would have. Secondly, Trump seems to be getting ahead of the facts on the ground. Trump cites ""that very brave person"" who was able to ""hit (Devin Patrick Kelley) and neutralize him."" Kelley died, but it is not known whether he was killed by exchanging fire with the civilians or self-inflicted wounds, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety. Kelley was shot in the leg and torso before being shot in the head. And lastly, there is no real reason to believe the increased background checks would have prevented the armed civilians, Johnnie Langendorff and Stephen Willeford, from obtaining their own firearms that they used to engage Kelley. Background checks, after all, don't mean no one gets guns; they just mean it's perhaps a little more difficult to get guns - that there is more of a process involved. What we do know is that the alleged gunman was not supposed to have guns, and that the Air Force failed to follow the correct procedures to prevent him from obtaining them. As The Post's Alex Horton reports, ""Firearms retailer Academy Sports … confirmed Monday that Kelley purchased two weapons from its stores after passing federal background checks this year and last."" It's not clear whether those were the weapons used. So you can perhaps make an argument that the background checks that were already in place failed, and it's more a matter of enforcing existing laws rather than adding new ones. But Trump takes it much further than that, suggesting such background checks might have prevented the two men from obtaining their guns in the first place, resulting in an increased death toll at the Texas church. But he won't concede that shored-up background checks might have impeded the gunman, for reasons that aren't clear. Reasonable people can disagree, but Trump is making an unreasonable argument here.

While authorities have not publicly identified a motive for the attack, they emphasized that the shooting did not appear to be fueled by racial or religious issues, as has been the case involving other rampages at houses of worship. Instead, they said the gunman had sent “threatening texts” to his mother-in-law as part of this ongoing dispute. “This was not racially motivated, it wasn’t over religious beliefs,” Freeman Martin of the Texas Department of Public Safety said at a news briefing. “There was a domestic situation going on within the family and the in-laws.” While the gunman’s mother-in-law had attended the church, she was not there Sunday when the shooting occurred, officials said. Investigators have scoured the gunman’s background since he opened fire Sunday morning inside the First Baptist Church outside San Antonio, searching for clues as the stories of those massacred began to emerge. There were 26 people killed in the church attack, the latest in a seemingly unending series of mass attacks in supposedly safe public spaces. The dead included eight relatives spanning three generations in a single family. While authorities had said Sunday that the victims ranged in age from 5 to 72, they said a day later that those were the people who suffered injuries and were being treated at hospitals. “Inside the church, the deceased actually ranged from 18 months to 77 years of age,” Martin said. The family that lost eight relatives said one of them was a 1-year-old girl killed in the attack. Another 20 people were wounded at the church, 10 of whom remained in critical condition Monday, Martin said. Texas officials early Monday identified the attacker as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley of New Braunfels, about 35 miles north of Sutherland Springs. They said the former Air Force member shot at the churchgoers with a Ruger assault-style rifle before coming under fire from a local man. Martin praised the efforts of “two Good Samaritans” who responded to the shooting, saying that a resident who lives near the church heard what was happening, took his own rifle and began firing at the attacker, hitting him at least once. Kelley dropped his rifle, jumped in his Ford Expedition and fled, Martin said. “Our Texas hero” flagged down another young Texan, hopped into his vehicle and they chased Kelley, Martin said. It was “act now, ask questions later,” said the truck’s driver, Johnnie Langendorff. During the chase, Kelley called his father on his cellphone to say “he had been shot and didn’t think he was going to make it,” Martin said. Kelley shot himself, though the cause and manner of his death will be determined after an autopsy, Martin said. Joe D. Tackitt Jr., the Wilson County sheriff, said Monday that though Kelley’s in-laws had attended the church, they were not there during services Sunday, and instead came to the scene after the shooting. Three guns were recovered Sunday, according to authorities: A Ruger rifle and two handguns, one a Glock and another a Ruger, inside Kelley’s vehicle. He had purchased a total of four guns during each of the last four years, officials said. Precisely how Kelley obtained his guns remained a key question for investigators. Kelley had been court-martialed in 2012 and sentenced to a year in military prison for assaulting his spouse and child, making him the latest mass attacker or suspect with domestic violence in his past. He was reduced in rank and released with a bad-conduct discharge in 2014. Kelley had sought and failed to obtain a permit allowing him to carry a concealed weapon, officials said. He had an “unarmed private security license” akin to what a security guard at a concert would have, Martin said. In televised interviews, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, R, said it appeared the church was intentionally targeted, rather than chosen at random, but said there were “more unknowns than there are knowns” a day after the attack. “By all of the facts that we seem to know, he was not supposed to have access to a gun, so how did this happen?” Abbott said in an interview Monday morning on CNN. “We are in search of answers to these questions.” Kelley had worked briefly over the summer as an unarmed night security guard at a Schlitterbahn water park in New Braunfels, the company said. He passed a Texas Department of Public Safety criminal background check before beginning work there, a spokeswoman said, though she added that Kelley was fired in July – as the season was reaching its peak – because he was “not a good fit.” He was also able to pass a background check that allowed him to work for HEB, a Texas grocery chain, in New Braunfels. Company spokeswoman Dya Campos said he worked there for two months in 2013 and quit; she was unsure of his position there. The attack on Sunday left a staggering hole in a Texas town of fewer than 700 people located about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio. “Nearly everyone [inside] had some type of injury,” Tackitt said. “I knew several people in there. It hasn’t really hit yet, but it will.” Tackitt said the inside of the church was “a horrific sight,” adding: “You don’t expect to walk into church and find mauled bodies.” Between 12 and 14 of the people killed or injured in the attack were children, he said. Wearing a crisp white button-down shirt, jeans and a beige Stetson, Tackitt spent Monday morning speaking to reporters about what happened, which he called “part of the job.” He had been at the scene Sunday, returned home just long enough to shower, check in on his family and return to the scene. Tackitt said he knew people inside the church but had not begun to mourn yet. The massacre outside San Antonio added Sutherland Springs to the growing roster of places synonymous with a mass tragedy, and it came just a month after 58 people in Las Vegas were gunned down in the country’s deadliest modern mass shooting. In recent years, gunfire has cut short scores of lives in shootings at movie theaters, concerts, churches, nightclubs, schools and offices. After the church massacre Sunday, officials in some of the places that have endured their own tragedies – including Aurora, Colorado; San Bernardino, California; Orlando; and Las Vegas – issued public statements of mourning for Sutherland Springs, the newest member of this grim fraternity. President Donald Trump appeared to try to steer the debate away from gun control after the slayings. At a news conference in Tokyo, Trump said he thought “mental health” was a possible motive, adding that it appeared the shooter was “a very deranged individual, a lot of problems for a long period of time.” He did not provide further explanation. Trump’s reaction contrasted with his unrestrained calls for a death sentence for the Uzbek immigrant accused of killing eight people in an apparently Islamic State-inspired attack in Lower Manhattan last week. Trump said the Texas incident “isn’t a guns situation,” and added: “Fortunately someone else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction” or the rampage “would have been much worse.” No one inside the church was armed at the time of the attack, the sheriff said Monday, saying he was not surprised by that fact. “People from this community would never think this could happen,” he said. Witnesses and officials said the gunman in Texas, dressed in all black and wearing a tactical vest, began firing an assault rifle as he approached the church. Texas state officials said Monday he was also wearing a black mask with a white skull face on it. He killed two people outside before entering the church and spraying bullets at the congregation during morning worship, police said. Authorities on Monday said that Kelley was inside for some time. The attack tore apart families in this small community. Joe and Claryce Holcombe lost children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren all at once, a total of eight extended family members, the couple said in a phone interview with The Post. Their son, Bryan Holcombe, 60, and his wife, Karla Holcombe, 58, were killed. Bryan was associate pastor for the church and walking to preach at the pulpit when he was shot, Joe Holcombe said. Among the dead was also their granddaughter-in-law, Crystal Holcombe, who was pregnant. She died along with her unborn child and three of her children – Emily, Megan and Greg – according to Joe Holcombe. She was at church with her husband, John Holcombe, who survived along with two of her other children. Their grandson, Marc Daniel Holcombe, and his infant daughter, who was about a year old, also died, Joe and Claryce Holcombe said. Frank Pomeroy, the pastor of First Baptist, and his wife, Sherri, spoke to reporters through tears. Their 14-year-old daughter Annabelle – known as Belle – was among those killed in her father’s church, although both parents were out of town at the time. But the couple lost much more than their daughter, they said. “We ate together, we laughed together, we cried together and we worshiped together. Now most of church family is gone,” Sherri Pomeroy said. “Our building is probably beyond repair, and the few of us that are left behind lost tragically yesterday. As senseless as this tragedy was, our sweet Belle would not have been able to deal with all the family she lost yesterday.” She added: “Please don’t forget Sutherland Springs.” Berman reported from Washington.

https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/30/alexander-hamilton-founding-father-musical-lin-manuel-miranda,"Lin-Manuel Miranda’s musical about the founding father is set to storm London. Often mistaken for a president, its hero engineered America and Britain’s special relationship, was rocked by a harassment scandal and got his face on the $10 bill Last modified on Thu 26 Mar 2020 12.32 GMT It’s the end of the first act of Hamilton, Lin-Manuel Miranda’s runaway musical smash about the US founding father. The Americans have just won a decisive victory over the British at Yorktown, Virginia, in 1781. Alexander Hamilton and the Marquis de Lafayette meet at centre-stage and say: “We’re immigrants. We get the job done.”  Miranda’s parents migrated from the Caribbean to New York; Hamilton himself made that journey two centuries earlier. Born on Nevis in the British West Indies, he arrived on the American mainland aged 15. Aaron Burr, his future nemesis, begins the musical by asking how a “bastard orphan, son of a whore and a Scotsman”, could rise in life to help found a new nation. The answer is that, along the way, Hamilton, like so many immigrants, worked harder than most, becoming a soldier, lawyer, finance minister and then duelist. He excelled at all of these – except the last. The British historian Paul Johnson called Hamilton “a genius – the only one of the founding fathers fully entitled to that accolade”. But what does that mean? As a teenage pamphleteer, Hamilton agitated for American independence and then fought for it as a soldier for more than six years. His skills and performance as an artillery captain meant he was quickly promoted to principal aide de camp to General George Washington, and it’s fair to call theirs one of the most significant partnerships in all of American history. As an infantry commander, Hamilton led several hundred troops in a bayonet charge to capture the British position at Yorktown, which effectively marked the end of the war. During lulls in the fighting, Hamilton studied financial history, developing a deep admiration for the Bank of England and how Britain managed its huge national debt. He argued that, if America was to prevail, reforming its finances was more important than winning the occasional battle. He also contended that only a strong, national government could stabilise the finances of the fledgling nation. At this point in Miranda’s musical, George III trots out in robes and crown and trills to us rebellious Continentals that: “You’ll be back.” He’s wrong of course, but he almost steals the show. Hamilton began his career as one of Britain’s worst enemies and then ironically turned into one of the UK’s best friends. He became a lawyer in near record time – after just 10 months of study – and in some of his first cases he did the unthinkable: he defended Tories. American supporters of the British cause were facing persecution, and vengeful state laws were taking aim at their properties. But those state persecutions violated the Treaty of Paris, which the federal government had signed to end the war. As a knock-on effect, those new state laws were driving away some of America’s most accomplished citizens. While Hamilton was defending the Tories, he was rallying tirelessly for a constitutional convention. After the convention formed and drafted the constitution, he promoted its ratification by explaining and defending it in the now famous and foundational Federalist essays. Washington became the first president under the constitution in 1789 and appointed Hamilton the first secretary of the Treasury. For his financial innovations Hamilton is dubbed in the show “the ten-dollar founding father”. His face has graced the $10 banknote since the 1920s, leading some to assume erroneously that he must have been an early president. As finance minister, Hamilton engineered his own revolution, much like Britain’s a century earlier. He restructured America’s war debts to establish public credit; he founded the Bank of the United States as the country’s first central bank; and he set the dollar as the nation’s currency. His measures prompted state governments to charter more banks and other corporations and led traders to establish securities markets and stock exchanges, such as that in New York, founded in 1792. Central to Hamilton’s plan was peaceful trade with Britain. Import taxes supplied almost all of the federal government’s revenues, and most of America’s imports still came from the UK. But Britain was discriminating against American trade. Thomas Jefferson wanted to play hardball, but Hamilton prevailed by persuading Washington that getting tough would cause a trade war and another military engagement. January 2015 Hamilton, a new musical written by and starring Lin-Manuel Miranda, has its first performances off-Broadway at the Public theater in New York. Its subject is the US founding father who was the first secretary of the Treasury. February 2015 As the show opens officially, it wins praise from critics, particularly for its innovative blend of musical styles, from rap to operetta. In her four-star review, the Guardian’s Alexis Soloski calls the show ""brash, nimble, historically engaged and startlingly contemporary"". August 2015 After selling out its run at the Public, the show opens on Broadway at the Richard Rodgers theatre and there is huge demand for tickets. February 2016 The original Broadway cast recording wins a Grammy award for best musical theatre album. March 2016 Miranda visits the White House to perform songs from the musical and a video of him freestyling in the Rose Garden with President Barack Obama goes viral. First lady Michelle Obama calls the show “the best piece of art in any form that I have ever seen in my life”. April 2016 Hamilton wins the Pulitzer prize for drama. June 2016 The musical breaks records, winning 11 Tony awards – at a ceremony that takes place after news breaks of a mass shooting in Orlando, Florida. Miranda performs a sonnet in praise of his wife and son, ending with the words: “Now fill the world with music, love and pride.” July 2016 Miranda stops performing in the show to pursue other opportunities, including starring in a sequel to Mary Poppins. A spoof version of the musical, Spamilton, opens in New York. October 2016 A production of Hamilton opens in Chicago and runs concurrently with the Broadway version. November 2016 Vice-president-elect Mike Pence sees the show in New York. From the stage, actor Brandon Victor Dixon addresses him directly, saying: “We are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us.” On Twitter, Donald Trump condemns their “terrible behaviour” and says he hears the show is “highly overrated”. January 2017 The first cast members are revealed for a West End production of Hamilton. December 2017 The show opens to five-star reviews at the newly renovated Victoria Palace theatre in London. March 2018 The London production of Hamilton gets 13 Olivier nominations, making it the most nominated show in the history of the awards. July 2020 A filmed version of the Broadway production debuts on the Disney+ streaming service, warmly welcomed while the world is still in lockdown over the coronavirus crisis. So Hamilton laid the foundations of the special relationship between America and Britain. It has proved rocky from time to time, but it flowered beautifully during the two world wars and their aftermaths. Following Hamilton’s directives for maintaining strong markets, the Marshall plan after World War II, in its way, helped repay Britain for the revenues that had allowed Hamilton to revolutionise America’s finances. Not that he was without flaws. While treasury secretary, he had an affair with a woman named Maria Reynolds. In cahoots with her husband, she accused Hamilton of sexual harassment. He paid them off to keep quiet, but the affair came to light a few years later. Rather than bury it again, Hamilton wrote a lengthy pamphlet explaining everything. Admitting to adultery protected his public reputation, and his wife, Eliza, forgave him, but the musical reveals her inner sorrows. A year after coming clean, Hamilton became a major general and inspector general of the US army. Then came the presidential election of 1800. The two candidates were Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr. One, a former secretary of state seen by many as a dangerous leftwing radical who would stop at nothing to gain the presidency. The other, a self-absorbed narcissist and womaniser convinced that he couldn’t lose unless his opponent stooped to rigging the election. Sound familiar? Hamilton knew both men well. One was his enemy, the other his nemesis. “His politics are tinctured with fanaticism,” he said of Jefferson. “He is a contemptible hypocrite.” Burr didn’t fare any better: “This man has no principle, public or private.” Hamilton condemned him as “the most unfit man in the US for the office of president”. The election culminated in a tie. According to the rules of the time, the runner up became vice-president, but a tie triggered a runoff election decided by the House of Representatives. Hamilton supported Jefferson because he preferred a candidate with disagreeable principles rather than one without any at all. He executed a frenetic letter-writing campaign that ultimately put Jefferson in the White House. Four years later, upset by rumours that Hamilton had badmouthed him, vice-president Burr challenged Hamilton to a duel. They met on a duelling ground in New Jersey. Hamilton threw away his shot by firing into the air. Burr didn’t return the favour. Hamilton didn’t live to see Jefferson and Madison get tough with Britain, which, just as he had predicted, led to a trade war and then the War of 1812. But from humble beginnings, Hamilton had had a shot to help write history – and he didn’t throw that one away.  This article contains affiliate links to products.

http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/11/24/san-jose-sharks-in-vegas-a-close-call-with-tragedy/,"Trending: ​LAS VEGAS — The Sharks didn’t need any reminders about what they were thankful for Thursday. 
The last time they had looked upon the lights of the Strip, they were on a flight headed for San Jose after an Oct. 1 exhibition game against the Vegas Golden Knights. Less than an hour later, a gunman opened fire on thousands of concert-goers from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, killing 58 people in the largest mass shooting in modern American history. 
						
There but for the grace… 
​”I have no doubt if that had been an off night, we would have been at the concert,” Sharks coach Pete DeBoer said Thursday. DeBoer is a country-music fan, as are several of his players. It was a country-music concert. 	


“You feel fortunate,” DeBoer said, “but you don’t want to feel too fortunate because there were a lot of people who weren’t fortunate. It’s really a lot of mixed emotions. 
The Sharks had traveled round trip that October day — in and out, no hotel stay — and organizational decision that had disappointed many of the players. There was a lot of talk about the fun they might have had with a free night in Vegas. 
When they landed in San Jose, they learned how lucky they were. 
“I got texts, saying, ‘Are you OK?'” forward Ryan Carpenter recalled. “It was friends watching from back home in Florida. They thought we’d stayed the night there.” 
The logical next thought… 	


“What if we had spent the night there?” said defenseman Joakim Ryan. “Maybe some of the guys would have gone to that concert…. You’re just grateful that you’re still breathing. You realize how quickly it can all end.”

In the words of Chris Tierney, the Sharks returned to Las Vegas Wednesday with “heavy hearts”. 
​On the bus from the airport to their hotel, which is attached to Mandalay Bay, the driver pointed to the windows ​from which the gunman had sprayed the crowd with more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition. 
DeBoer,​Tierney and Joel ​Ward ​all used the same ​word to describe the bus ride: Eerie.

“Every time we come here now it’s going to be in the back of your mind,” Tierney said. “We’re all going to remember what happened and have heavy hearts. It’s just terrible. We’ve got to remember the victims and try to play around it.” 
​After checking into his room Wednesday night, Ward ​glanced out the window — and was jarred. 
“At first I was like, ‘There’s the Strip. But then I’m like, oh my God, there’s the big Mandalay Bay sign and there’s the site across the street​. I did close the drapes, actually. I just got on my laptop. I had to get away from thinking about it — I needed a distraction.” 
Ryan had a similar experience in his room. 
“I was looking out the window wondering what room that guy was in, I could see the concert venue that he shot up,” Ryan said. 
​This is a daily experience for the people of Las Vegas.  The Golden Knights, and their surprising performance, has provided a diversion.

The expansion team played its first-ever regular season game at T-Mobile Arena nine days after the shooting, honoring the shooting’s survivors and its first responders with an emotional pregame ceremony​. 
The Golden Knights won that game. They have won eight of nine at home and, at 13-6-1, they are in first place in the Pacific division. 
​The Sharks are rivals. But they also are fans of what the Golden Knights have brought this city. 
“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

​”I have no doubt if that had been an off night, we would have been at the concert,” Sharks coach Pete DeBoer said Thursday. DeBoer is a country-music fan, as are several of his players. It was a country-music concert. 	


“You feel fortunate,” DeBoer said, “but you don’t want to feel too fortunate because there were a lot of people who weren’t fortunate. It’s really a lot of mixed emotions. 
The Sharks had traveled round trip that October day — in and out, no hotel stay — and organizational decision that had disappointed many of the players. There was a lot of talk about the fun they might have had with a free night in Vegas. 
When they landed in San Jose, they learned how lucky they were. 
“I got texts, saying, ‘Are you OK?'” forward Ryan Carpenter recalled. “It was friends watching from back home in Florida. They thought we’d stayed the night there.” 
The logical next thought… 	


“What if we had spent the night there?” said defenseman Joakim Ryan. “Maybe some of the guys would have gone to that concert…. You’re just grateful that you’re still breathing. You realize how quickly it can all end.”

In the words of Chris Tierney, the Sharks returned to Las Vegas Wednesday with “heavy hearts”. 
​On the bus from the airport to their hotel, which is attached to Mandalay Bay, the driver pointed to the windows ​from which the gunman had sprayed the crowd with more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition. 
DeBoer,​Tierney and Joel ​Ward ​all used the same ​word to describe the bus ride: Eerie. 
Like our Sharks Facebook page for more San Jose Sharks news, commentary and conversation.
“Every time we come here now it’s going to be in the back of your mind,” Tierney said. “We’re all going to remember what happened and have heavy hearts. It’s just terrible. We’ve got to remember the victims and try to play around it.” 
​After checking into his room Wednesday night, Ward ​glanced out the window — and was jarred. 
“At first I was like, ‘There’s the Strip. But then I’m like, oh my God, there’s the big Mandalay Bay sign and there’s the site across the street​. I did close the drapes, actually. I just got on my laptop. I had to get away from thinking about it — I needed a distraction.” 
Ryan had a similar experience in his room. 
“I was looking out the window wondering what room that guy was in, I could see the concert venue that he shot up,” Ryan said. 
​This is a daily experience for the people of Las Vegas.  The Golden Knights, and their surprising performance, has provided a diversion.

The expansion team played its first-ever regular season game at T-Mobile Arena nine days after the shooting, honoring the shooting’s survivors and its first responders with an emotional pregame ceremony​. 
The Golden Knights won that game. They have won eight of nine at home and, at 13-6-1, they are in first place in the Pacific division. 
​The Sharks are rivals. But they also are fans of what the Golden Knights have brought this city. 
“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

“You feel fortunate,” DeBoer said, “but you don’t want to feel too fortunate because there were a lot of people who weren’t fortunate. It’s really a lot of mixed emotions. 
The Sharks had traveled round trip that October day — in and out, no hotel stay — and organizational decision that had disappointed many of the players. There was a lot of talk about the fun they might have had with a free night in Vegas. 
When they landed in San Jose, they learned how lucky they were. 
“I got texts, saying, ‘Are you OK?'” forward Ryan Carpenter recalled. “It was friends watching from back home in Florida. They thought we’d stayed the night there.” 
The logical next thought… 	


“What if we had spent the night there?” said defenseman Joakim Ryan. “Maybe some of the guys would have gone to that concert…. You’re just grateful that you’re still breathing. You realize how quickly it can all end.”

In the words of Chris Tierney, the Sharks returned to Las Vegas Wednesday with “heavy hearts”. 
​On the bus from the airport to their hotel, which is attached to Mandalay Bay, the driver pointed to the windows ​from which the gunman had sprayed the crowd with more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition. 
DeBoer,​Tierney and Joel ​Ward ​all used the same ​word to describe the bus ride: Eerie. 
Like our Sharks Facebook page for more San Jose Sharks news, commentary and conversation.
“Every time we come here now it’s going to be in the back of your mind,” Tierney said. “We’re all going to remember what happened and have heavy hearts. It’s just terrible. We’ve got to remember the victims and try to play around it.” 
​After checking into his room Wednesday night, Ward ​glanced out the window — and was jarred. 
“At first I was like, ‘There’s the Strip. But then I’m like, oh my God, there’s the big Mandalay Bay sign and there’s the site across the street​. I did close the drapes, actually. I just got on my laptop. I had to get away from thinking about it — I needed a distraction.” 
Ryan had a similar experience in his room. 
“I was looking out the window wondering what room that guy was in, I could see the concert venue that he shot up,” Ryan said. 
​This is a daily experience for the people of Las Vegas.  The Golden Knights, and their surprising performance, has provided a diversion.

The expansion team played its first-ever regular season game at T-Mobile Arena nine days after the shooting, honoring the shooting’s survivors and its first responders with an emotional pregame ceremony​. 
The Golden Knights won that game. They have won eight of nine at home and, at 13-6-1, they are in first place in the Pacific division. 
​The Sharks are rivals. But they also are fans of what the Golden Knights have brought this city. 
“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

The Sharks had traveled round trip that October day — in and out, no hotel stay — and organizational decision that had disappointed many of the players. There was a lot of talk about the fun they might have had with a free night in Vegas. 
When they landed in San Jose, they learned how lucky they were. 
“I got texts, saying, ‘Are you OK?'” forward Ryan Carpenter recalled. “It was friends watching from back home in Florida. They thought we’d stayed the night there.” 
The logical next thought… 	


“What if we had spent the night there?” said defenseman Joakim Ryan. “Maybe some of the guys would have gone to that concert…. You’re just grateful that you’re still breathing. You realize how quickly it can all end.”

In the words of Chris Tierney, the Sharks returned to Las Vegas Wednesday with “heavy hearts”. 
​On the bus from the airport to their hotel, which is attached to Mandalay Bay, the driver pointed to the windows ​from which the gunman had sprayed the crowd with more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition. 
DeBoer,​Tierney and Joel ​Ward ​all used the same ​word to describe the bus ride: Eerie. 
Like our Sharks Facebook page for more San Jose Sharks news, commentary and conversation.
“Every time we come here now it’s going to be in the back of your mind,” Tierney said. “We’re all going to remember what happened and have heavy hearts. It’s just terrible. We’ve got to remember the victims and try to play around it.” 
​After checking into his room Wednesday night, Ward ​glanced out the window — and was jarred. 
“At first I was like, ‘There’s the Strip. But then I’m like, oh my God, there’s the big Mandalay Bay sign and there’s the site across the street​. I did close the drapes, actually. I just got on my laptop. I had to get away from thinking about it — I needed a distraction.” 
Ryan had a similar experience in his room. 
“I was looking out the window wondering what room that guy was in, I could see the concert venue that he shot up,” Ryan said. 
​This is a daily experience for the people of Las Vegas.  The Golden Knights, and their surprising performance, has provided a diversion.

The expansion team played its first-ever regular season game at T-Mobile Arena nine days after the shooting, honoring the shooting’s survivors and its first responders with an emotional pregame ceremony​. 
The Golden Knights won that game. They have won eight of nine at home and, at 13-6-1, they are in first place in the Pacific division. 
​The Sharks are rivals. But they also are fans of what the Golden Knights have brought this city. 
“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

“At first I was like, ‘There’s the Strip. But then I’m like, oh my God, there’s the big Mandalay Bay sign and there’s the site across the street​. I did close the drapes, actually. I just got on my laptop. I had to get away from thinking about it — I needed a distraction.” 
Ryan had a similar experience in his room. 
“I was looking out the window wondering what room that guy was in, I could see the concert venue that he shot up,” Ryan said. 
​This is a daily experience for the people of Las Vegas.  The Golden Knights, and their surprising performance, has provided a diversion.

The expansion team played its first-ever regular season game at T-Mobile Arena nine days after the shooting, honoring the shooting’s survivors and its first responders with an emotional pregame ceremony​. 
The Golden Knights won that game. They have won eight of nine at home and, at 13-6-1, they are in first place in the Pacific division. 
​The Sharks are rivals. But they also are fans of what the Golden Knights have brought this city. 
“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

DeBoer,​Tierney and Joel ​Ward ​all used the same ​word to describe the bus ride: Eerie.

The logical next thought… 	


“What if we had spent the night there?” said defenseman Joakim Ryan. “Maybe some of the guys would have gone to that concert…. You’re just grateful that you’re still breathing. You realize how quickly it can all end.”

In the words of Chris Tierney, the Sharks returned to Las Vegas Wednesday with “heavy hearts”. 
​On the bus from the airport to their hotel, which is attached to Mandalay Bay, the driver pointed to the windows ​from which the gunman had sprayed the crowd with more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition. 
DeBoer,​Tierney and Joel ​Ward ​all used the same ​word to describe the bus ride: Eerie. 
Like our Sharks Facebook page for more San Jose Sharks news, commentary and conversation.
“Every time we come here now it’s going to be in the back of your mind,” Tierney said. “We’re all going to remember what happened and have heavy hearts. It’s just terrible. We’ve got to remember the victims and try to play around it.” 
​After checking into his room Wednesday night, Ward ​glanced out the window — and was jarred. 
“At first I was like, ‘There’s the Strip. But then I’m like, oh my God, there’s the big Mandalay Bay sign and there’s the site across the street​. I did close the drapes, actually. I just got on my laptop. I had to get away from thinking about it — I needed a distraction.” 
Ryan had a similar experience in his room. 
“I was looking out the window wondering what room that guy was in, I could see the concert venue that he shot up,” Ryan said. 
​This is a daily experience for the people of Las Vegas.  The Golden Knights, and their surprising performance, has provided a diversion.

The expansion team played its first-ever regular season game at T-Mobile Arena nine days after the shooting, honoring the shooting’s survivors and its first responders with an emotional pregame ceremony​. 
The Golden Knights won that game. They have won eight of nine at home and, at 13-6-1, they are in first place in the Pacific division. 
​The Sharks are rivals. But they also are fans of what the Golden Knights have brought this city. 
“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

“What if we had spent the night there?” said defenseman Joakim Ryan. “Maybe some of the guys would have gone to that concert…. You’re just grateful that you’re still breathing. You realize how quickly it can all end.”

In the words of Chris Tierney, the Sharks returned to Las Vegas Wednesday with “heavy hearts”. 
​On the bus from the airport to their hotel, which is attached to Mandalay Bay, the driver pointed to the windows ​from which the gunman had sprayed the crowd with more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition. 
DeBoer,​Tierney and Joel ​Ward ​all used the same ​word to describe the bus ride: Eerie.

“Every time we come here now it’s going to be in the back of your mind,” Tierney said. “We’re all going to remember what happened and have heavy hearts. It’s just terrible. We’ve got to remember the victims and try to play around it.” 
​After checking into his room Wednesday night, Ward ​glanced out the window — and was jarred. 
“At first I was like, ‘There’s the Strip. But then I’m like, oh my God, there’s the big Mandalay Bay sign and there’s the site across the street​. I did close the drapes, actually. I just got on my laptop. I had to get away from thinking about it — I needed a distraction.” 
Ryan had a similar experience in his room. 
“I was looking out the window wondering what room that guy was in, I could see the concert venue that he shot up,” Ryan said. 
​This is a daily experience for the people of Las Vegas.  The Golden Knights, and their surprising performance, has provided a diversion.

The expansion team played its first-ever regular season game at T-Mobile Arena nine days after the shooting, honoring the shooting’s survivors and its first responders with an emotional pregame ceremony​. 
The Golden Knights won that game. They have won eight of nine at home and, at 13-6-1, they are in first place in the Pacific division. 
​The Sharks are rivals. But they also are fans of what the Golden Knights have brought this city. 
“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

The expansion team played its first-ever regular season game at T-Mobile Arena nine days after the shooting, honoring the shooting’s survivors and its first responders with an emotional pregame ceremony​. 
The Golden Knights won that game. They have won eight of nine at home and, at 13-6-1, they are in first place in the Pacific division. 
​The Sharks are rivals. But they also are fans of what the Golden Knights have brought this city. 
“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

​On the bus from the airport to their hotel, which is attached to Mandalay Bay, the driver pointed to the windows ​from which the gunman had sprayed the crowd with more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition. 
DeBoer,​Tierney and Joel ​Ward ​all used the same ​word to describe the bus ride: Eerie. 
Like our Sharks Facebook page for more San Jose Sharks news, commentary and conversation.
“Every time we come here now it’s going to be in the back of your mind,” Tierney said. “We’re all going to remember what happened and have heavy hearts. It’s just terrible. We’ve got to remember the victims and try to play around it.” 
​After checking into his room Wednesday night, Ward ​glanced out the window — and was jarred. 
“At first I was like, ‘There’s the Strip. But then I’m like, oh my God, there’s the big Mandalay Bay sign and there’s the site across the street​. I did close the drapes, actually. I just got on my laptop. I had to get away from thinking about it — I needed a distraction.” 
Ryan had a similar experience in his room. 
“I was looking out the window wondering what room that guy was in, I could see the concert venue that he shot up,” Ryan said.

DeBoer,​Tierney and Joel ​Ward ​all used the same ​word to describe the bus ride: Eerie. 
Like our Sharks Facebook page for more San Jose Sharks news, commentary and conversation.
“Every time we come here now it’s going to be in the back of your mind,” Tierney said. “We’re all going to remember what happened and have heavy hearts. It’s just terrible. We’ve got to remember the victims and try to play around it.” 
​After checking into his room Wednesday night, Ward ​glanced out the window — and was jarred. 
“At first I was like, ‘There’s the Strip. But then I’m like, oh my God, there’s the big Mandalay Bay sign and there’s the site across the street​. I did close the drapes, actually. I just got on my laptop. I had to get away from thinking about it — I needed a distraction.” 
Ryan had a similar experience in his room. 
“I was looking out the window wondering what room that guy was in, I could see the concert venue that he shot up,” Ryan said. 
​This is a daily experience for the people of Las Vegas.  The Golden Knights, and their surprising performance, has provided a diversion.

The expansion team played its first-ever regular season game at T-Mobile Arena nine days after the shooting, honoring the shooting’s survivors and its first responders with an emotional pregame ceremony​. 
The Golden Knights won that game. They have won eight of nine at home and, at 13-6-1, they are in first place in the Pacific division. 
​The Sharks are rivals. But they also are fans of what the Golden Knights have brought this city. 
“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

“Every time we come here now it’s going to be in the back of your mind,” Tierney said. “We’re all going to remember what happened and have heavy hearts. It’s just terrible. We’ve got to remember the victims and try to play around it.” 
​After checking into his room Wednesday night, Ward ​glanced out the window — and was jarred. 
“At first I was like, ‘There’s the Strip. But then I’m like, oh my God, there’s the big Mandalay Bay sign and there’s the site across the street​. I did close the drapes, actually. I just got on my laptop. I had to get away from thinking about it — I needed a distraction.” 
Ryan had a similar experience in his room. 
“I was looking out the window wondering what room that guy was in, I could see the concert venue that he shot up,” Ryan said. 
​This is a daily experience for the people of Las Vegas.  The Golden Knights, and their surprising performance, has provided a diversion.

The expansion team played its first-ever regular season game at T-Mobile Arena nine days after the shooting, honoring the shooting’s survivors and its first responders with an emotional pregame ceremony​. 
The Golden Knights won that game. They have won eight of nine at home and, at 13-6-1, they are in first place in the Pacific division. 
​The Sharks are rivals. But they also are fans of what the Golden Knights have brought this city. 
“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

“At first I was like, ‘There’s the Strip. But then I’m like, oh my God, there’s the big Mandalay Bay sign and there’s the site across the street​. I did close the drapes, actually. I just got on my laptop. I had to get away from thinking about it — I needed a distraction.” 
Ryan had a similar experience in his room. 
“I was looking out the window wondering what room that guy was in, I could see the concert venue that he shot up,” Ryan said. 
​This is a daily experience for the people of Las Vegas.  The Golden Knights, and their surprising performance, has provided a diversion. 

Get top headlines in your inbox every afternoon. Get the free PM Report newsletter. 

The expansion team played its first-ever regular season game at T-Mobile Arena nine days after the shooting, honoring the shooting’s survivors and its first responders with an emotional pregame ceremony​. 
The Golden Knights won that game. They have won eight of nine at home and, at 13-6-1, they are in first place in the Pacific division. 
​The Sharks are rivals. But they also are fans of what the Golden Knights have brought this city. 
“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

Ryan had a similar experience in his room. 
“I was looking out the window wondering what room that guy was in, I could see the concert venue that he shot up,” Ryan said. 
​This is a daily experience for the people of Las Vegas.  The Golden Knights, and their surprising performance, has provided a diversion.

The expansion team played its first-ever regular season game at T-Mobile Arena nine days after the shooting, honoring the shooting’s survivors and its first responders with an emotional pregame ceremony​. 
The Golden Knights won that game. They have won eight of nine at home and, at 13-6-1, they are in first place in the Pacific division. 
​The Sharks are rivals. But they also are fans of what the Golden Knights have brought this city. 
“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

Get top headlines in your inbox every afternoon. Get the free PM Report newsletter. 

The expansion team played its first-ever regular season game at T-Mobile Arena nine days after the shooting, honoring the shooting’s survivors and its first responders with an emotional pregame ceremony​. 
The Golden Knights won that game. They have won eight of nine at home and, at 13-6-1, they are in first place in the Pacific division. 
​The Sharks are rivals. But they also are fans of what the Golden Knights have brought this city. 
“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

The expansion team played its first-ever regular season game at T-Mobile Arena nine days after the shooting, honoring the shooting’s survivors and its first responders with an emotional pregame ceremony​. 
The Golden Knights won that game. They have won eight of nine at home and, at 13-6-1, they are in first place in the Pacific division. 
​The Sharks are rivals. But they also are fans of what the Golden Knights have brought this city. 
“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

“I’ve dealt with some things in my past, and sports and hockey have always been my avenue to escape,” Ward said. “It’s isn’t 24 hours a day, but those one, two, three hours that you can just be free and get your mind off of things can be really powerful.” 
Friday, the Sharks will play a hockey game with heavy hearts and deep gratitude. 
“You start thinking about what you’re thankful for: your family, your friends, the people you love, what I get to do for a living right now — we’re all living out our dreams playing professional hockey,” Ryan said. “And then you just feel so bad for the people that aren’t around after that shooting.”

How I got this way I will continue to explore. One doesn't simply become cruel and abusive by accident. Can I repair myself, reclaim much of myself, and become a reasonable, civil human being? We will see, but I think that I can. I do wish to believe, and hope, that one's history does not imply one's destiny. ""My issues go much further than legal concerns — my transgressions, of course, have legal dimensions, but much more important, they have ethical, moral and humanitarian dimensions. I may never be able to undo and make right what I have done, but I vow to do everything I know how (legal and moral) to become a reasonable human being. And I will do all I can, and am permitted to do, to make recompense to those I've wronged and harmed. ""Thank you for permitting me to learn to do the right thing."" — Leon J. Hoffman, Chicago I am 15 years old, and I just started driver's education. For a class assignment, I had to observe an intersection and look for drivers' errors. I saw lots of people talking on their cellphones or texting while they were driving. I am shocked by how many people do this, because it is so dangerous. I wish people would get a hands-free answering device or just pull over. That way we could all be safer. — Michael Roth, Chicago The Republicans in Congress are completely and morally bankrupt. They do not have the guts to deal with long overdue serious gun control after the horrific massacres in Las Vegas, Newtown, Conn., and so many other assaults on innocents. And with the recent Texas church slaughter, their response has been sluggish, inert. In matters of science, they can't seem to process the fact that climate change is real and creating cataclysmic events in our country and worldwide. What will it take? When is the time right to do the responsible and right thing for them to meet these challenges? Our very lives depend on action with the greatest possible urgency. God help us — because our Republican legislators will not. — Dorothy Dumelle, Oak Park The processes of enacting meaningful legislation in the wake of gun violence or attempting to effectively replan cities to reduce the inevitable devastation caused by natural disasters have one thing in common: They're attempts to solve a problem in hindsight. This prompts the obvious question: Why don't we change our behavior to solve these knowable problems before tragedy comes knocking? This can be said for a variety of societal concerns, both foreign and domestic. It seems that our inherent altruistic sensors only go off when crises are happening on American soil, but why? Just because something doesn't appear to affect you doesn't mean you shouldn't care about it. As then-state Sen. Barack Obama once said, ""If there's a child on the South Side of Chicago who can't read, that matters to me, even if it's not my child."" Therefore, if there's a child who isn't allowed to go to school because she's a girl, that should matter to you, even if it's not your child. If there's a family of five struggling to live on less than 50 cents a day, that should matter to you, even if it's not your family. If there are a billion people across the world without access to clean drinking water, that should matter to you, even if your water is safe to drink. If a child is starving and has no choice but to turn to a terrorist organization for food, clean water and a living wage, that should matter to you too. And yes, there are problems in our own country, but it is also true that the livelihood of people living in developing nations has a direct impact on our economy and national security. The right kind of aid can increase standards of living for the world's poorest; it can provide stability to struggling families; it can help families climb out of the cycle of poverty and help reduce the political instability in some of the more vulnerable nations in the world. — Tim Sonnefeldt, Chicago Every time there is a mass shooting, politicians (and others) say that ""this is not the right time to discuss gun control."" What is the correct time? Police and the FBI spend days and weeks trying to determine what was behind a shooting. Let's assume that after their investigations, they have a 100 percent-correct profile of the shooter. What do they do with that information? Who gets it? Whom do they target based on this profile? How does this prevent the next shooting? It's a very safe bet that there will be another mass shooting. Only the time and place are not known. What if the next 10, 20 or 30 victims were U.S. senators or U.S. representatives? Would it then be the correct time? Or would it depend upon which victims received donations from the National Rifle Assocation? — John Fink, Huntley CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"

https://www.elitedaily.com/p/why-cant-congress-change-gun-control-laws-this-pattern-explains-it-all-3242586," After a gunman opened fire in a Sutherland Springs, Texas church on Sunday, Nov. 5, killing 26 and injuring dozens of others, a familiar pattern in American politics reemerged. A tragic event prompts a conversation on gun control, with prominent members of one major party calling for more it, while their counterparts insist a lack of gun laws isn't the problem. A stalemate ensues, and those in favor of new gun legislation question, again, why Congress can't change gun control laws. On Monday, Democratic senator Chris Murphy provided his own answer to that question in a statement that addressed the shooting in Sutherland Springs. Before getting elected to the Senate in 2013, Murphy represented the district where the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut took place. The senator has been outspoken about gun violence before â during an interview with Elite Daily in July, he warned about the pace of 2017 mass shootings â but the tone of his message heightened after the attack in Sutherland Springs. In a statement reaction to Sunday's shooting, Sen. Murphy said that the ""impotent helplessness that washes over you as news of another mass slaughter scrolls across the television screen"" is really just ""a fiction created and methodically cultivated by the gun lobby, designed to assure that no laws are passed to make America safer, because those laws would cut into their profits."" Murphy's Republican colleagues in the Senate would surely argue against the idea that their overwhelming lack of support for new gun legislation is simply down to protecting the gun lobby's profits, but the senator from Connecticut is right about one thing. Congress has indeed done nothing legislatively in response to the greatest mass shooting in modern American history â the Oct. 1 attack in Las Vegas, which killed over 50 people and injured over 500 others â nor has there been a signal in the House or Senate that any serious push for new gun laws will be made in response to the attack in Sutherland Springs. Despite the inaction, Sen. Murphy is still pushing for more laws. During a speech on the Senate floor on Tuesday, he told colleagues, Murphy's push comes despite the fact that (as his Sutherland Springs statement hinted) the prospects for successful gun legislation depends on Republicans' appetite for reform. The mere political reality is that appetite is low. It's that same reality that keeps other Democrats from making more pushes for tougher gun laws, one congressional aide tells Elite Daily. For now, the most realistic prospect for new gun legislation is a ban on bump stocks, which became a political talking point in the aftermath of the shooting in Las Vegas. A bump stock is an attachment that modifies a firearm, effectively enabling it to fire at a more rapid pace. Twelve such devices were found in the hotel room from which the Las Vegas shooter fired at concert goers at a country music festival. Last week, a bill that would ban bump stocks was unveiled via a joint effort by two Democrats and two Republicans in the House. ""We're just trying with both sides of the aisle to just get something done. It comes down to 'you can't let the perfect get in the way of the good' right now,"" the aide tells Elite Daily. ""Because maybe if we get the regulatory framework for bump stocks in law, the next time a guy tries buying 12 â maybe more â bump stocks, maybe some red flags will go up."" But even without aiming for the perfect, ""the good"" â as the aide put it â still seems difficult to accomplish. Bills that are meant to result in gun laws are typically discussed within either the Senate or House Judiciary Committee, before it can really be discussed before the whole of Congress. Despite the fact that a proposed bill that would ban bump stocks does exist, though, that proposal has not been brought up by consideration before the House Judiciary Committee. The same is true for the Senate Judiciary Committee, despite the fact that the highest ranking Democrat on the committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein (CA) introduced her own bill to ban bump stocks. When reached for comment on whether the committee's chairman, Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), would consider the bill in the near future, a spokesperson for the senator did not respond. The attack in Texas appears unlikely to alter this state of inaction, too. Even in 2013, gun legislation failed to pass with a Democratic Senate and a Democratic president, Barack Obama. Now, in 2017, the sitting Republican president has already decided that Sutherland Springs is ""not a gun issue."" Simply put, the current state of politics â the stances the majority of politicians take on gun control â make it near impossible to pass gun reform. That probably wonât change until something else does, which Obama hinted at two years ago, in a statement given after the Emanuel AME Church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina. ""It is in our power to do something about it,"" Obama said. ""I say that recognizing the politics in this town foreclose a lot of those avenues right now. But it would be wrong for us not to acknowledge it."" The former president then alluded to voters' attitude towards the issue of gun control. ""At some point, it's going to be important for the American people to come to grips with it, and for us to be able to shift how we think about the issue of gun violence collectively,"" Obama said. In other words, until there's a massive shift in terms of how much of a priority gun reform is for voters, the same political pattern â with more arguments, but a lack of actual legislation â is likely to repeat itself. If you want to voice your opinion on gun legislation, you can find the contact information for your elected representative in Congress here. You can also call the Capitol switchboard to be connected with your representative in Congress at 202-224-3121."
http://www.ocregister.com/2017/12/04/why-the-workers-comp-system-has-failed-survivors-of-san-bernardino-terror-attack/,"Trending: Struggles endured by survivors of the Dec. 2, 2015, San Bernardino terrorist attack throw an unflattering spotlight on California’s workers’ compensation system and San Bernardino County. Changes in workers’ comp laws led to big savings for insurance companies, but made it difficult for injured workers to get the help they need. And the county “put dollars ahead of people” and showed “ignorance and a complete lack of empathy” by denying or delaying some treatment, said state Sens. Jeff Stone, R-Temecula, and Hannah-Beth Jackson, D-Santa Barbara. The worker’s comp system just wasn’t designed to treat people injured in such attacks or other workplace violence. The survivors’ plight, which came to light a year ago, inspired newly elected Assemblywoman Eloise Reyes to introduce a bill to help them when she was sworn in Dec. 5, 2016.  “If we fail those employees and we can’t fix it, then we really have something wrong with the system,” said Reyes, D-Grand Terrace, who represents the 47th Assembly District. San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors Chairman Robert Lovingood declined to respond to those and other statements involving the handling of survivors’ workers’ comp claims. Under state workers’ compensation laws, when an employee is injured, the employer is required to immediately open a workers’ comp claim and send the employee for medical treatment. All California workers hurt on the job have a legal right to benefits including medical care, wage-loss compensation or temporary disability payments during recovery, vocational rehabilitation, death benefits and lost future earnings compensation or permanent disability payments, according to a state Legislative Analyst’s Office report. RELATED: How San Bernardino terror attack survivors are struggling with PTSD’s ‘invisible wounds’ 2 years later A crisis has evolved following legislative changes made in the past 10 to 15 years after the state’s insurance market deregulation in the 1990s led to insurance rate spikes. Employers pushed for legislative help, which included Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger introducing SB899 in 2004. Since that era, it’s been harder for employees to prove claims, medical treatments have been denied or delayed, and permanent disability compensation has dwindled. But it wasn’t until Dec. 2 survivors were shortchanged that the public and legislators took notice, said Santa Ana attorney Geraldine Ly, a workers’ comp law specialist for nearly 20 years who represents nine San Bernardino terror attack survivors. “It has gotten the legislators’ attention. Nothing like that has ever happened,” she said.  “While most would like to return to work, their permanent injuries prevent their return and have forced some, like Ray Britain, to medically retire from the county,” Geraldine Ly, workers’ comp attorney, says of her Dec. 2 survivor client at her Santa Ana office Thurs., Nov. 9. (Photo by Cindy Yamanaka, Orange County Register/SCNG)  Geraldine Ly’s Dec. 2 survivor clients have become friends. She pore through their files at her Santa Ana office Thurs., Nov. 9.

At left, survivor Julie Swann-Paez. (Photo courtesy of the Assembly Democratic Caucus)  Most employers buy workers’ comp insurance. San Bernardino County and others self-insure, setting aside reserves to cover costs. RELATED: Surgeries, therapy and pain: San Bernardino terror attack survivor details horrific journey to recovery Doctors treating workers must fill out forms to make written treatment requests for everything from surgery to physical therapy, medication or a special bed. The request for treatment is sent to a claims adjustor or “handler” — working for the insurer or employer’s risk management department — for approval. The adjuster can OK treatment or send the request to an outside company for utilization review when another physician weighs in. If the request is denied or modified, a worker can appeal to independent medical review. Many Dec. 2 survivors who weren’t shot in the attack by a Muslim co-worker and his wife didn’t learn they were entitled to trauma counseling, medication and other care under workers’ comp until Ly held an informational meeting in late January 2016. Some returned to work that month without counseling. That April, survivors began experiencing denials, delays and “modifications” or limits for surgeries, physical therapy, counseling, equipment and prescriptions, including painkillers, antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication. The state Workers’ Compensation division reported the county routinely approved nearly all requests until mid-April 2016. Survivors asked for assistance in private meetings with the county and from elected officials when that failed. As the attack’s one-year anniversary neared, survivors sought help publicly at San Bernardino County board of supervisors’ meetings. The county accepted workers’ comp claims from 59 people, including 57 survivors who were at the Inland Regional Center during the attack and a probation department employee who later helped survivors at the IRC. RELATED: After two years, San Bernardino County selects consultant for memorial to honor victims of terrorist attack The county reports 2,484 of 2,763 treatment requests, or 90 percent, were approved, which includes 137 modified, usually to reduce treatment. Two hundred were denied, 94 denials were appealed and 22 denials were overturned.  The county also denied psychological injury claims from 24 employees, who weren’t there for the attack. Ly said her clients’ approvals were far less than 90 percent. The county initially denied then later accepted the claim from the probation department employee. Delays and denials were still happening in July, when survivors Julie Swann-Paez and Sally Cardinale testified about their struggle to the state Senate Labor and Industrial Relations Committee during a hearing on Reyes’ bill, AB44, and shared that one survivor waited nine months for a bone graft. Another waited 19 months for trauma counseling. Some denials continue. Physical therapy to desensitize scars on a young male survivor shot in the abdomen, flank and knee, plus referrals to an orthopedist to evaluate the knee, were recently denied, said the worker’s Ontario attorney, Christel Schoenfelder.  Legislators and survivors’ attorneys say county officials didn’t recognize the need to quickly get their workers treatment for trauma and other wounds that Reyes and Stone said were akin to battlefield injuries. Jackson, who sits with Stone on the state Senate Labor and Industrial Relations Committee overseeing industrial safety and workers’ comp, was astonished the county didn’t do everything in its power to help. “Why in the world would the county of San Bernardino resist caring for its workers, who are the victims of an attack by a co-worker?” Jackson said by phone recently. “I’m still dumbfounded that that would be the attitude taken by any employer, let alone a government employer.” After 14 people (13 county workers) were killed, 22 wounded and at least 57 left with post-traumatic stress, county officials were legally required to inform survivors this was now a workers’ comp case but didn’t — the first time the county denied or delayed treatment, Ly said. RELATED: ‘We will never forget’ San Bernardino terror attack victims, mourners say on second anniversary County spokesman David Wert said the county provided information about workers’ comp benefits by Dec. 7 and 8, 2015. Survivor Ray Britain, the county Environmental Health Services division’s interim chief on Dec. 2, said that’s not true. At a Dec. 10, 2015, meeting the FBI set up to help survivors, county Risk Management staff who were asked about services neglected to tell survivors or relatives of those who were then “walking zombies” that they were entitled to workers’ comp benefits, Ly said. Risk management told survivors who knew to ask for claim forms they didn’t appear to need them and didn’t need to fill them out then because the county would send information packets with forms later – but no packets ever came, Britain said. When survivors’ doctors submitted requests for treatment authorization — basically, medical recommendations — to county risk management for approval, claims adjuster Christina Hurtado sent the requests to outside utilization review doctors who denied, delayed or modified requests. County officials later said they were required to send all treatment requests to outside utilization review. That’s not true, according to the state industrial relations department and Reyes, the assemblywoman. She’s an attorney who’s handled workers’ comp cases for 35 years. Irvine attorney Keith More, a three-time Workers’ Compensation Trial Lawyer of the Year who represents a survivor, said the county used utilization review to deny survivors “well-deserved” medical treatment when it could have approved “every ounce of treatment.”  The California Supreme Court ruled employers and insurers can approve treatment under internal utilization review. They can even OK treatment denied by outside review, said Jason Marcus, president of Sacramento-based California Applicants’ Attorneys Association, a group of injured workers’ lawyers. Utilization review was set up as a process for an employer or insurer who wants to deny or modify a doctor’s treatment request. While employers and insurers can OK treatment, only another physician can deny or change the primary doctor’s recommendation, Marcus said. County officials said many problems came from survivors’ doctors not submitting the right paperwork. Schoenfelder agrees. But More and Ly said the county adjuster often didn’t send utilization review all medical reports needed to support treatment, which led to denials, delays or modifications. Utilization review doctors can ask for more records but usually just deny, Schoenfelder said. In December 2016, county supervisors expanded the use of outside case managers to expedite claims. Survivors’ attorneys say some helped and some didn’t. Britain disagrees with former county CEO Greg Devereaux’s May 2016 statement the terrorists “win” unless the county comes out “stronger economically” afterward. Britain said county officials had a misguided focus on economics and disregarded their injured employees’ well-being to save money. “I think the terrorists win when you lose track of humanity,” Britain said. Legislators and Marcus say Dec. 2 survivors were treated like any other employees hurt on the job – highlighting a larger problem that injured workers statewide are having in obtaining medical treatment. Insurers and employers concentrate on disproving the need for care, yet 95 percent of claims are legitimate, Jackson said. “The system we have sadly assumes the worker did not get injured on the job,” she said. “Therefore, the whole focus is on denying care and claims, rather than addressing them immediately and trying to get them treatment.” Utilization review and other changes were designed to reduce treatment, she added. Survivors’ attorneys say utilization review doctors deny or modify 65 to 95 percent of treatment requests, and denials are usually upheld by independent medical review, then kept in place for a year. Many employers never send workers for treatment, Ly said. RELATED: Survivors of Sept. 11, Oklahoma City terror attacks share their stories, recovery Treatment requests are often handled mechanically without determining what’s needed to cure workers or considering the judgment of treating doctors who actually see patients, said Marcus. Adjustors also send treatment requests to out-of-state outside review physicians with the wrong specialty for a particular injury — a practice the insurance industry has fought to continue, More said. “It’s the abuse of the utilization review process,” he added. Survivors believe this happened because the county doesn’t want to “deal with a lifetime of having to accommodate them,” Ly said. As of Nov. 30, 29 out of 57 survivors had returned to work for the county at some point. Twelve now work full-time and 10 with doctor-required work restrictions work part-time, while five are out on medical leaves and two left the county, said Wert. Britain said when someone returns full-time without restrictions, they may relapse and be put on leave after a few months. Wert wouldn’t give details on how long the county would accommodate restrictions or allow survivors to work part-time. But Ly said state law allows employers to fire employees after accommodating their restrictions for one year – even Dec. 2 terrorist attack survivors.  The system was set up to get injured workers back to work, not for profit. Yet a Workers’ Compensation Insurance Rating Bureau analysis shows SB863 saved insurance companies $1.3 billion from 2012 through 2016 – mostly from decreased medical treatment through independent medical review’s introduction, said Diane Worley, California Applicants’ Attorneys Association’s policy director. Reyes introduced AB44 to allow attack survivors’ workers’ comp claims to skip utilization review and extend their benefits from two years to four and a half. The bill was gutted by the Assembly Insurance Committee. On July 12, an amended AB44 requiring employers to immediately provide attack survivors with case managers and treatment options passed out of the Senate Labor and Industrial Relations Committee and later passed both houses and became law. Jackson and Stone, the committee vice chairman, are now fired up to look closely at workers’ comp. Costs largely arise from workers not getting treatment soon enough, said Jackson. “The supervisor doesn’t have any comment at this time,” said county Policy Advisor Don Holland. Employers and insurers should once again face stiff fines for delaying benefits, Marcus said. Another key reform would require all necessary medical records be sent to outside utilization review and for utilization review doctors to be qualified in the specialty they review, More said by phone. At the AB44 hearing, Stone, a former Riverside County supervisor who lost friend Damian Meins in the Dec. 2 massacre, vowed to make “retooling” the worker’s comp system a “high priority” in 2018 after hearing survivors’ testimony, including that survivors were treated like they were suspected of fraud and a utilization review nurse denied survivors’ medication when only a doctor can. In a recent interview, Stone committed to ensuring there are no gaps in service for injured workers, especially survivors of workplace violence, and said problems are likely happening in other counties, too. “We pay the highest rates in the country. The least we deserve is for employees to get the care they need,” he said. Trauma experts and lawyers say Dec. 2 survivors were further harmed by secondary trauma from their struggles to get help. Acknowledging that, Stone described the delays and denials as “completely inappropriate.” “I don’t want to see a recurrence of the debacle that we witnessed in San Bernardino happen again,” he said.

https://www.inquisitr.com/4600740/obama-calls-texas-church-shooting-act-of-hatred-calls-for-violence-and-weaponry-to-be-reduced/,"Mere hours after gunman Devin P. Kelley opened fire on a Texas church, killing at least 26 and wounding dozens more, former President Barack Obama tweeted out his condolences to the victims and a reeling nation. As CNN reports, the ex-POTUS was quick to call the shooting an ""act of hatred,"" stopping short of using the words ""domestic terrorism."" However, when it came to singling out the issue behind the latest instance of senseless and deadly gun violence in the United States, Obama didn't hesitate before pointing out that ""weaponry in our midst"" is part of the problem. The former President also called upon a higher power to help provide the wisdom necessary to take ""concrete steps"" toward reducing both weaponry and violence in America. Throughout his presidency, Obama repeatedly called for tighter gun control, particularly better mental health screenings and more restrictions on assault-style rifles. It has been reported that the gun used in Sunday's church shooting was a ""Ruger AR assault-type rifle,"" which allowed him to fire off dozens of rounds in rapid succession. In his double-tweet expression of grief for the victims of the Texas church shooting, Barack Obama assured his social media followers that he and his are grieving alongside the community of Sutherland Springs, where the shooting occurred. He also vowed to stand with the injured as they move toward recovery from the physical and emotional trauma of the Sunday morning attack on their house of worship.  Tweeting from Japan, where he's in the midst of an Asian tour, Donald called on God to be with the people of Sutherland Springs. The current POTUS further claimed to be monitoring the situation from across the Pacific.  Unlike his response to the Manhattan truck attack, Trump didn't offer his thoughts on an appropriate sentence for the perpetrator of Sunday's church shooting. However, in the case of Devin P. Kelley, caucasian and ex-military, he didn't escape the scene of his alleged crime alive and was found dead of a gunshot wound miles from the Sutherland Springs First Baptist Church.  Like President Obama, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy responded to the Texas church attack with a call to action on gun control. Not surprisingly, calls for tougher gun laws were split along party lines. "

Sign up for our newsletters here. As Sunday worship services began, a man in black tactical gear parked his Ford Expedition at a gas station, grabbed his assault style rifle, marched across the street and killed 4 percent of this town's population and 100 percent of its quaint anonymity. Devin Patrick Kelley's first two victims were slain in the parking lot of First Baptist Church, the town's epicenter and the church attended by his mother-in-law, whom police say he had expressed anger toward and perhaps wanted to kill. Then the gunman, whose bad-conduct discharge from the Air Force and history of domestic violence should have kept him from purchasing the Ruger AR-556 he gripped, sprayed bullets indiscriminately into the church's façade. He entered, according to law enforcement who reviewed the church's weekly recording of the sermon, intent on killing everyone in the room. Read the full chronological account of the horrific mass shooting from reporters J. David McSwane and Lauren McGaughy. Politics: Vice President Mike Pence has scheduled a trip to meet with the families of victims and law enforcement personnel on Wednesday. Investigation: The Air Force is investigating why it didn't send Devin Kelley's court-martial and conviction for domestic violence to the FBI database used to approve gun buyers. Legislation: What are the gun laws in Texas? Faith: The former pastor of a Fort Worth church where a gunman killed seven people says forgiveness is not optional. Commentary: Offering prayers for Sutherland Springs is the opposite of doing nothing, writes contributor Mark Davis. Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez, a Democrat, is exploring a possible bid for governor. While she would be an underdog against Republican Gov. Greg Abbott if she were to run, Valdez told The Texas Tribune on Monday that she's ""in the exploratory process"" and studying election data. Abbott, who beat Democrat Wendy Davis by 20 percentage points in 2014, reported a campaign fund balance of $41 million in July. He faces no major GOP opponent and is expected to file his candidacy for a second term Saturday. ""Too much of one thing corrupts, and I'm a strong believer in a two-party system,"" Valdez told The Tribune. ""I'm hoping that enough people are seeing that too much one-sided is not healthy for Texas."" And: Former state Rep. Kenneth Sheets has begun a bid to replace Rep. Jeb Hensarling in Congress. Also: Candidate for Texas House speaker John Zerwas says he's a ""fresh person"" and not a Joe Straus clone. As Republicans march forward on a massive overhaul of the nation’s tax system, classroom teachers could end up feeling the pinch. The ""educator expense deduction"" is among the items that House GOP leaders have proposed to eliminate in order to simplify the tax system. The write-off allows teachers and administrators to deduct $250 for out-of-pocket expenses used in their classrooms and schools: items such as books, school supplies, decorations and computer software. Professional development expenses are also included in the deduction, which was made permanent by Congress in 2015. Thanks to shrinking budgets, teachers and administrators are increasingly being relied on to provide materials for their students. And: A tweak to the GOP's tax revamp would spare SMU and most — but not all — private schools from multimillion-dollar tax hits. Also: Dallas ISD is looking for community feedback this week on two big initiatives: setting the school calendar for the next two school years, and creating a five-year vision for curricula, technology and facilities. Cliburn Silver Medalist Kenny Broberg performed for students and teachers at South Hills Elementary School in Fort Worth on Monday. A native of Minneapolis, 23-year-old Broberg won the silver medal at the Fifteenth Van Cliburn International Piano Competition in Fort Worth in 2017. Kenny appeared at the school in May 2017 just prior to the competition and promised students he would be back. Watch the performance here.

http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2017/11/texas_church_gunman_devin_kell.html,"NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas -- The man authorities have identified as the gunman in a mass shooting at a Texas church was discharged from the Air Force for allegedly assaulting his wife and child, according to an Air Force spokeswoman. The spokeswoman, Ann Stefanek, said Sunday that Devin Kelley was sentenced to 12 months' confinement after a 2012 court-martial. He ultimately received a bad conduct discharge and reduction in rank. She said Kelley served in Logistics Readiness at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge in 2014. Authorities did not announce his name at a news conference on the shooting, saying only that the suspect was a white male in his 20s. But a U.S. official and a law enforcement official identified Kelley as the person who opened fire Sunday at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas, killing 26 people and wounding about 20 others. The U.S. official told The Associated Press that Kelley lived in a San Antonio suburb and that he doesn't appear to be linked to organized terrorist groups. The official said investigators are looking at social media posts Kelley may have made in the days before Sunday's attack, including one that appeared to show an AR-15 style semiautomatic weapon. The official requested anonymity because the person did not have authorization to speak publicly. An address listed in online records as belonging to Kelley is located in New Braunfels, Texas, just outside San Antonio and about 35 miles (56 kilometers) from Sutherland Springs. Local records of an August traffic ticket issued in New Braunfels, Texas, for an expired registration and not having auto insurance give a birthdate that would make him 26 years old. NEW: Devin Kelley was in logistics readiness at Holloman Air Force Base, NM, from 2010 until his discharge in 2014 https://t.co/7TjuAwjuwm pic.twitter.com/LfqwiMKTp6 At the address listed for Kelley in New Braunfels, two sheriff's vans were parked outside and police officers stood at the gate of a cattle fence surrounding the property. Law enforcement officials gathered at the property declined to comment on why they were there. Several messages left for his relatives went unreturned. Neighbors said that they heard intense gunfire coming from the direction of the address listed for Kelley in recent days. ""It's really loud. At first I thought someone was blasting,"" said Ryan Albers, 16, who lives across the road. ""It had to be coming from somewhere pretty close. It was definitely not just a shotgun or someone hunting. It was someone using automatic weapon fire."" A person matching Kelley's name and date of birth also registered in 2014 to vote in Colorado, with an address listed in Colorado Springs, home of the U.S. Air Force Academy. The Colorado Secretary of State's office lists his registration now as inactive. According to Texas Department of Public Safety regional director Freeman Martin, the gunman arrived at a Valero gas station near the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs at around 11:20 a.m. Sunday. He was dressed in black, wearing tactical gear and a ballistic vest. He crossed the street to the church, left his vehicle and started firing a Ruger AR assault-type rifle at the church. Then he entered the church and fired. As he left the church, the shooter met an unidentified area resident with his own rifle who pursued him. The suspect was found dead in his vehicle near the border between Wilson and Guadalupe counties. Martin says it's unclear if he died of a self-inflected wound or was shot by the resident. -- By Nomaan Merchant and Paul J.

http://www.ocregister.com/2017/11/07/we-already-had-the-tools-to-prevent-the-texas-church-shooting/,"Trending: With Sunday’s tragic mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, the nation is once again confronted with serious questions about what, if anything, can be done to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future. Like the rest of the nation, we mourn the loss of the 26 lives lost on Sunday and want to see serious answers to the question of what can be done to prevent future tragedies. The loss of 26 people in a single act of extreme, senseless violence cannot and should not be reduced to a political football for politicians to grandstand and pontificate hollow solutions about. An obvious starting point is assessing whether what happened on Sunday might have been preventable within the scope of current laws. As a nation with laws on the books intended to keep guns out of the hands of people who can’t be entrusted to responsibly exercise the right to own a firearm, the least we can do is ensure such laws are being fully implemented. In this case, it appears that a failure to implement existing gun control laws allowed the killer to acquire weapons he should not have been able to purchase or possess. The shooter, a former U.S. Air Force airman, was convicted by court martial in 2012 for assaulting his spouse and his infant step-child, and received a punishment of 12 months confinement, a reduction in rank and a bad-conduct discharge. Since federal law prohibits felons and people convicted of domestic violence from purchasing weapons, the shooter should never have been able to do so, and his criminal record should have been flagged in a background check. Yet it appears the Air Force never even shared the shooter’s criminal record with civilian authorities. This is not a new problem. A 2015 Inspector General Report assessment of how military authorities dealt with the cases of 1,102 Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps service members convicted of offenses reportable to the FBI’s Criminal Justice Information Services Division found that final disposition reports for 334 were not in the FBI’s criminal history database and fingerprints for 304 were also not submitted. While military authorities responded to the report with promises to do better, such a high rate of failure to turn over information cannot be tolerated. Perhaps some tangible solution is on the way, with U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, announcing on Tuesday plans to introduce legislation to ensure federal agencies, including the military, upload the criminal records they are supposed to upload. “According to the Department of Justice, the number of these records that are actually uploaded is staggeringly low,” he said. “That is unacceptable and it must change.” Indeed it must. The least we can do is ensure that current gun control measures are fully and appropriately enforced, as the failure to do so can clearly have tragic consequences. While we mustn’t allow politicians to trample on our Second Amendment rights, we should be open to reasonable, limited measures to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn’t have them and be willing to have further discussions.

https://www.inquisitr.com/4601482/devin-patrick-kelley-facebook-profile-antifa-hoax-shooter-added-texas-facebook-friends-abused-ex-wife-tessa/,"There are plenty of rumors and theories flying around the world wide web in the wake of the tragic mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Devin Patrick Kelley is that name of the 26-year-old man who is being pegged as the shooter who wreaked havoc inside the First Baptist Church on Sunday morning, wherein at least 26 people died. According to BuzzFeed, a Facebook page that has been attributed to Devin was a fake Facebook page that was set up in the wake of the shooting and taken down - even though the publication does not explicitly specify how the Facebook page was determined to be fake, outside of the fact that the screenshots show that the Facebook page was updated ""28 minutes"" ago and ""24 minutes"" ago, which would have been impossible for the Texas shooter to accomplish after his death. In spite of the news about the fake Facebook profile, as reported by the Washington Post, Devin recently began adding Facebook friends from the Sutherland Springs area over the past few months, then picking fights with those strangers. The now-deleted Facebook page allegedly showed Kelley's name along with a Ruger assault-style rifle. As indicated by Google Trends, plenty of questions and queries are being typed into Google about Devin, including folks looking for Kelley's real Facebook profile. Searches for ""Devin Patrick Kelley ISIS"" have risen 300 percent, along with searches for ""Devin Patrick Kelley terrorist,"" which have gone up 200 percent. Notably, searches for ""Devin Patrick Kelley Antifa member"" searches are up 110 percent, along with searches for Devin allegedly being an atheist or potentially an Antifa member who followed the pledge to wreak havoc on November 4, although Devin's actions would have been one day late, according to that theory. As reported by Newsweek, the far-right media is claiming that Kelley was an Antifa member. Although authorities have not officially released Devin's motive for committing the mass shooting, ""American nationalist"" Mike Cernovich wrote that because Kelley killed people in a church with mostly a ""white denomination,"" Cernovich asked, ""Antifa terrorist attack?""  Kelley lived for more than 10 years with his current wife and 2-year-old son in a barn behind an $800,000 home that was a 3,700-square-foot house owned by Devin's parents. Plenty of Devin's neighbors expressed shock that he would commit such a crime. [Featured Image by Erich Schlegel/Getty Images]"
http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/uproxx/features/~3/4QObSKO0ZhQ/,"In the wake of the deadly mass shooting at Sutherland Springs Baptist Church by former Air Force serviceman Devin Patrick Kelley, the Air Force revealed that Kelley’s court-martial that resulted from a domestic violence conviction was never reported to the national background check database. If done properly, it would have been a move that may have prevented Kelley from acquiring the gun he used in the shooting. Following an internal review, the Air Force has found “several dozen” instances of service members’ charges or convictions for serious crimes going unreported to the national background check database. The Air Force says they aren’t finished with their review, so more unreported service members could be added to the database: Although officials have examined only a portion of the cases across the Air Force that should have been reported, several dozen cases have already surfaced that were not reported as required. In the weeks since the review began, those cases have been corrected and reported, Air Force officials said. “The error in the Kelley case was not an isolated incident and similar reporting lapses occurred at other locations,” the Air Force said in a statement. “Although policies and procedures requiring reporting were in place, training and compliance measures were lacking.” According to the Air Force, they are reviewing around 60,000 cases to determine if they should have been reported by law. Newly discovered incidents will be reported on a rolling basis, the Air Force said. After the shooting, bipartisan legislation was introduced in the Senate that would have compelled the Air Force and other agencies to conduct similar reviews, but that bill quickly stalled in Congress.

Davis and the tea party Republican politicians he so reveres have once again responded to the horror of a mass shooting by offering their ""thoughts and prayers."" Davis belittles those who criticize the use of those meaningless words while defending unlimited access to any type of weapon. Like so many gun-loving conservative Christians of today, they have expunged from their Bibles the book of James, which specifically condemns those who use pious platitudes with no effort to correct the problem (James 2:14-17). To protect the lives of unborn children they are willing to put restrictions on women, but God forbid that we put restrictions on access to military weapons. For many Americans who own guns, those firearms seem to be their ""gods"" to be revered above all else. Until the majority of Americans who do not worship at the altar of the NRA begin to vote for politicians who are willing to place reasonable restrictions on access to military weapons the carnage, what we have experienced in Nevada and Texas, will only continue to increase. Cecil Larry Pool, Midlothian Mark Davis is righteously indignant because some commentators have condemned the false piety of House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republican leaders calling for prayer but not changes in gun policy. Davis, like most right wing idealogues, hides behind religion to hide the evil among men. The real evil in this debate is the refusal of the Republican leadership to address the need for meaningful change in gun control policy in this country, while thousands of innocents continue to die in mass shootings. A recent study shows that the only factor significantly correlated with the number of mass shootings is gun ownership, not mental illness, race or crime. According to this study, only Yemen has a higher rate of mass shootings in countries with more than 10 million people. Yemen has the world's second-highest rate of gun ownership after the U.S. Also according to this study, only 4 percent of American gun deaths could be attributed to mental health issues. Australia has virtually solved its mass shooting problem by passing strict gun laws banning semiautomatic rifles and shotguns, and strictly regulating gun ownership, producing a radical drop in mass shootings. The U.S. must do the same. Jim Barber, Dallas/Uptown I think we are going to have to agree to disagree on this one. Our God is great, our God is mighty and our God is powerful. We are created in His image to do His will and we are commanded to act justly, love mercy and walk humbly.  We are created to help the poor, comfort the sick and bring about change that is in line with what Jesus would do. ""Thoughts and prayers"" are vital as we meditate on society's problems and pray for God to intervene and show us His mercy, but to stop there and fail to do what we are called by God to do makes us idle and impotent in a world that needs action. Action is needed on mental illness and more importantly on keeping guns out of the hands of those who want to kill others. I believe God calls us to hash this out and find a way instead of simply hiding behind the Second Amendment and doing nothing. I'm not ""kneel[ing] at the altar of government."" I am committed that God calls us to lives of action to help His people and our ""thoughts and prayers"" may not be enough without also choosing to live by God's will. Melanie Lake, Dallas Re: ""The gunning down of  America -- Paxton's dismissive take: You're on your own,"" by Jacquielynn Floyd, Tuesday Metro & State column. Once again, when evil manifests itself in a tragic shooting such as in Sutherland Springs, platitudes like ""smarter laws"" abound and those who offer (pro-gun) truths are vilified. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton did not say or even imply that being ""on your own,"" as in being self-armed in such situations, is the only answer. But he did offer the truthful reminder that evil can occur suddenly and when professional first responders are not there in those immediate first minutes, then we citizens are the first responders. And as such, we citizens stand a much better chance of ending such evil at the earliest opportunity if we are an armed first responder.

Earlier in the day the singer, 24, posted a message calling for gun control after a gunman killed 26 people, including eight members of one family, and injured more than 20 others during a church service in the small town of Sutherland Springs. “My dreams have become nightmares & those nightmares , reality … This isn’t fair , this isn’t right , this isn’t just , this isn’t human! This is a TERRORIST act by a WHITE AMERICAN MAN!” the Grammy nominee wrote. “I am heartbroken & embarrassed. Mortified by our country & its s–tty system , lack of control/laws! This does NOT HAVE or NEED to happen! It’s devastatingly disgusting!” Referencing the lyrics to her song “Bad Mood,” she continued, “I wanted to bring awareness to the fact that everyday we are waking up to more terrifyingly painful information that makes it nearly impossible to feel optimistic that things are going to change! They say it gets worst before it gets better in some cases & I wish on every star that this is the worst of it!

A post shared by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on Nov 6, 2017 at 5:55am PST  While several fans commented positively on her post (and it attracted more than half a million likes), others took issue with her pointing out that a white American male was responsible for the attack. But the “Malibu” singer didn’t back down and returned to Instagram with another post defending her comments. I'd like to believe that EVERY person who takes the life of another being is "" mentally ill "" …. it's hard to conceptualize that a sane human could commit such a hideous crime. BUT I am sorry Donald Trump this absolutely is a "" GUNS SITUATION"" I am aghast by the reaction of my latest post , it is completely amazing to me how defensive and in denial this country really is! You are not focused on the horrific tragedy I addressed but more angered that I am putting a BIG bright spotlight on the fact it was a ""WHITE AMERICAN MALE"" terrorist that walked in & killed 26 people (including children) leaving 20 severely injured ! All of a sudden …. "" we are all equal "" ""human is human"" ""skin color doesn't matter "" (NOW neither does gender) ""makes no difference if they were male or female"" …… BUT those things absolutely matter when … someone completely legitimate is running for president (versus someone who isn't) , when a car runs over innocent people while professing their love to a GOD  different from yours , it sure matters to the cops when they beat or even kill innocent people of color , it even matters at the airport/on an airplane or in immigration when folks are completely profiled & judged for their background . NOW it doesn't matter if someone is a man or woman? Well that's news to me and the HH foundation because it's been years of fighting for gender equality and the right to be the sex you identify with or marry the one you love! There has ALWAYS been an issue with these subjects until NOW. So since this tragedy has occurred (coming off the cusp of Vegas, another terroristic act by a white American male)  DONT START to be all innocent! Gender , race , & religion HAS and continues to matter for all the wrong reasons & that's only the beginning of how backwards this country is! All of you are so focused on protecting yourself, you've completely forgotten that you're not the only one that has to live in this country or on this planet!  Aren't you exhausted?

http://www.ibtimes.com/who-devin-kelleys-wife-danielle-shields-texas-church-shooter-had-domestic-dispute-2611103,"Following the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history, Danielle Shields was identified as the wife of alleged gunman Devin Kelley. She was Kelly's second wife, after he divorced his first wife, Tessa, in 2012 in New Mexico and married again in Texas in 2014, NBC News reported. Danielle is the daughter of Michelle and Ben Shields, and all three of them reportedly had ties with the Texas church where Kelley went on a shooting rampage. Kelley, 26, was identified by officials as the man responsible for Sunday’s mass shooting at a community church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Armed with a Ruger AR-556 assault rifle and dressed in black tactical gear, Kelley opened fire during the church’s morning worship, killing at least 26 people and injuring 20 more. Among the dead was Lula White, Danielle's grandmother. Authorities said during a press conference Monday that Kelley was involved in some kind of domestic dispute with his relatives. “This was not racially motivated,” said Texas Department of Public Safety regional director Freeman Martin. “There was a domestic situation going on within the family and the in-laws.” Kelley’s in-laws had attended the First Baptist Church in the past, though they were not there on the day of the shooting, officials said. “The mother-in-law attended the church,” Freeman confirmed. “We know he sent threatening … that she had received threatening text messages from him.” Kelley, a former United States Air Force airman, was reportedly court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his then-wife Tessa and their child. He was sentenced to 12 months confinement and received a “bad conduct” discharge in 2014, Reuters reported, citing chief of Air Force media operations Ann Stefanek. “She’s very upset,” Tessa's mother told NBC, noting that his former wife did not want to speak publicly about the situation until law enforcement had interviewed her. He was very sick in the head,” Kelley’s former girlfriend Katy Landry told NBC News. Landry also said he stalked her after they broke up, “repeatedly calling” and “even prank calling” her, “saying really weird stuff.” Kelley’s uncle weighed in on Facebook after the shooting, stating that he “never in a million years could of believed Devin could be capable of this kind of thing.” “I am numb,” Dave Ivey wrote. “My family will suffer because of his coward actions. I am so sorry for the victims in Texas.” Law enforcement officials gather near the First Baptist Church following a shooting, Nov. 5, 2017, in Sutherland Springs, Texas.  Photo: Getty Images"
https://www.inquisitr.com/4600750/jinger-duggar-and-jeremy-vuolo-celebrate-anniversary-texas-church-shooting-casts-dark-shadow-over-happy-day/,"Jinger Duggar and Jeremy Vuolo celebrated their first wedding anniversary on Sunday, but a tragedy that hit close to home for the couple cast a dark shadow over what should have been a joyful day for the Counting On stars. Jinger and Jeremy marked a major relationship milestone on November 5. One year ago, they tied the knot in front of hundreds of family members and friends at a large church in Arkansas. Their wedding was filmed for Counting On, and they quickly became one of the most admired couples on the show. Fans of the Duggar family's TLC series enjoy keeping up with the Laredo, Texas residents even when they aren't on TV, so many of them were thrilled when Jinger shared a special anniversary message for Jeremy on her Instagram page. It included a romantic wedding picture and plenty of praise for her husband. ""It's been 1 year since the day we said 'I do'...it's been the best year of my life! Jeremy, you have shown me such love that is too amazing for words,"" Jinger wrote. The Duggar daughter's post also included a few references to her pastor husband's faith.  As reported by the Dallas Morning News, many gun control advocates are frustrated by responses to mass shootings like the one Jeremy shared with his Twitter followers. They believe that the social media posts sending out ""thoughts and prayers"" are an easy out for those who don't want to take any meaningful steps to reduce gun violence. Jeremy Vuolo and Jinger Duggar have not shared their thoughts on gun control, but it's clear that they're not completely opposed to firearms. As reported by In Touch Weekly, the couple visited a gun range a few months ago, and Jeremy posed for the photo below. "
http://www.ibtimes.com/texas-church-shooting-victims-include-8-members-single-family-2611020,"UPDATE: 4:55 p.m. EST –  The family who lost eight people in Sunday’s mass shooting at a Texas church was identified as the Holcombe family. Eight members of the family spanning three generations were killed after Devin Kelley opened fire inside the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, the Washington Post reported. Bryan Holcombe was walking to the pulpit to lead worshippers when Kelley started shooting. Bryan and his wife were both killed, as were multiple other members of the family, including an infant girl and an unborn child.  Original story: The victims of Sunday's mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas included eight members of a single family. At least 26 people were killed during a Sunday morning when gunman Devin Kelley opened fire inside the First Baptist Church in the town, about 30 miles east of San Antonio. The rampage left about four percent of the town’s population dead, according to Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt. Among those at the church that morning, almost nobody was unharmed. “I think nearly everyone had some type of injury,” Tackitt told reporters Monday. Of the 26 people killed, eight victims were members of the same family, a relative and community leader confirmed to CNN. The relatives spanned three generations and included a woman who was five months pregnant as well as three of her children. The identities of the victims had not yet been officially released, pending notification of their next of kin. The victims of the shooting ranged in age from 5 to 72 years old, Texas Department of Public Safety regional director Freeman Martin confirmed Monday. Among those killed was the 14-year-old daughter of the church’s pastor. Authorities were still working to determine Kelley’s motive but said there were domestic issues at play. Kelley’s mother in law apparently attended the church and had previously received threatening messages from him, Martin said during a Monday morning press conference. “We know that his ex-in-laws or in-laws came to church here from time to time,” Tackitt told CNN Monday. “They were not here yesterday. So we don’t know why he actually showed up yesterday.” Kelley was a former member of the United States Air Force but was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his spouse and child, Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek told reporters. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called the shooting the worst in the state’s history. “I don’t think this was just a random act of violence,” Abott said on “Good Morning America” Monday. “It was two things: one is a very deranged individual who, I understand, long before he was dishonorably discharged from the United States military was demonstrating some mental illness challenges.” Authorities said they were looking into Kelley’s social media activity to glean additional information.

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/490070910/0/phoenix/nation~Florida-school-selling-bulletproof-panels-for-studentsapos-backpacks/,"A private school in Miami, Florida, is offering parents an unusual item: A bulletproof panel for their student's backpack. Florida Christian School's website lists the ballistic panel for $120. The school began offering the panel, designed to turn a backpack into a shield, in the wake of the Sutherland Springs shooting last weekend, the fifth deadliest mass shooting in the nation’s history. The nondenominational K-12 school has never had a shooting incident, but a school security official says they would rather be safe than sorry. ""It’s just a tool,"" George Gulla, head of school security told the Miami Herald. ""I’d rather be prepared for the worst than be stuck after saying 'Wow, I wish we would’ve done that.' ""We thought, yeah, let’s offer it to anyone who wants it. It’s not required. But if it gives you extra peace of mind&mldr"" The slim inserts from Applied Fiber Concepts weigh less than one pound. The company is owned by Alex Cejas, who has two children who attend Florida Christian. ""While books and stuff in your backpack may stop a bullet, they’re not designed to,"" Cejas told the Herald. ""I wouldn’t bet my life on it."" The binder-sized piece of armor can withstand bullets from a .44 Magnum and a .357 SIG, according to the Herald. However, bullets from a rifle would require a heavier piece of armor. When your schools sell bullet proof school bags, it’s probably time to have a think about your gun laws https://t.co/yILf6kW9jT This is not the first bulletproof school product to hit the market. Cejas has been in the industry for 25 years and says the bullet resistant school supply industry spiked after the Columbine shooting in 1999, where two high school teens killed 11 other students. The founder of the popular body armor company Bullet Blocker told Marketplace that sales jumped from 20 backpacks a week to around 10,000 following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, where a gunman killed 20 students and six staff members. The company started developing bulletproof accessories, including briefcases, folders and binders, after the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007 that left 32 people dead. School security expert Kenneth Trump thinks ballistic armor for students is not the answer. ""Focus on fundamentals and get back to the basics,"" Trump told NPR. ""There is a security product for every possible need that your budget will buy. The question is, is that the best use of limited resources?” However, Florida Christian School thinks the option should be available to parents, in addition to other safeguards like sound-enabled surveillance cameras, active shooter drills and uniformed security guards patrolling the campus. Bulletproof inserts are ""out of the norm, but what is the norm?"" Gulla added. Here's how some are responding to the news: Unreal.Kit kids out in 120$ bullet-proof backpack pads at school. Sure!Gun control. No way! https://t.co/udajHZY04C While you're inserting a bulletproof pad into your 5 yr old's Princess/Pokémon backpack...ask yourself if that isn't the least bit messed up https://t.co/hb3ms9yfRS Struggling to decide on the worst bit of this.After some thought, I think it may be ""selling"" https://t.co/fWcSzXnqps "

To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. His press conference in Seoul this morning (our time, as American slept) was an obvious topic for the morning cable news shows, where no shortage of ignorance was exhibited aggressively and bombastically by President Donald Trump—the three major shows weren't a whole lot better—as he claimed the Texas church shooting does not justify greater gun control laws. Trump repeated a White House line, most recently articulated at a daily briefing by Sarah Huckabee Sanders, that Chicago has the nation's strongest gun laws but “Chicago is a disaster,” he said. On Trump & Friends, they quickly parroted that line after co-host Ainsley Earhardt said, “I didn't know that, Chicago had the toughest gun laws.” Chimed in co-host Steve Doocy, “Oh, yeah,” prompting Earhardt to continue, “They're reporting murder after murder. They've had more murders, I believe, than any city in the country.” “Which goes to the president's point,” concluded Doocy. “Here's a town with all these guys and it ain't working.” Stop, everybody, pretty please. The one very strict Chicago law was a total ban on handguns that the U.S. Supreme Court threw out as a violation of the Second Amendment in 2010. It was a 5-4 decision written by Justice Samuel Alito. The reality is that it was largely unenforceable and never enforced. Other state laws aren't that broad and, in what's a real problem, the laws in nearby states aren't strong at all, like Indiana. Lots of guns flow from outside the city. There's also an issue of a largely spineless judiciary on gun crimes. New York City, by comparison, has tougher laws, enforces them more diligently and has less crime (for many reasons). After 2015's mass shooting at an Oregon community college, then-Republican presidential candidates Trump, Chris Christie and Carly Fiorina all blabbed the same line. It's baloney. As the Chicago Tribune noted amid the Republicans citing Chicago as evidence of gun controls' failure, “But Chicago's gun laws aren't as tough as their reputation suggests. They once were, but courts have overturned or gutted many of them in recent years, forcing a city that once banned handguns and gun shops to allow both.” It's something that folks at CNN and MSNBC, if not Fox, at least might correct next time Trump or surrogates repeat the claim. Nobody did that today. It's either agreeing with Trump or debating the whole issue of gun control. When Chicago is referenced, a few facts could be inserted, whatever your view of the underlying issue. How Vietnam's president was murdered with U.S. approval The press was all over the release of several thousand long-classified government documents, notably C.I.A records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. That was totally understandable. But, in the process, it appears to have missed some head-turning documents about another assassination—this one essentially approved by the government itself. They involve the Vietnam War, the deadly mistake that took more than 50,000 lives and is subject of the great Ken Burns-Lynn Novick PBS documentary.  A national security expert in the government brings the documents to my attention. That event was the Nov. 2, 1963 coup that resulted in the murders of Ngo Dinh Diem, the president of South Vietnam and long an Americans-supported despot, and Ngo Dinh Nhu, his brother and most influential adviser. The documents comprise an internal government report on CIA and other agencies relationship to the coup. It's always been known that the Kennedy administration debated overthrowing Diem. As the PBS documentary underscores in Part 2, Kennedy's advisers were divided though Kennedy ultimately (and mistakenly) signaled that he wouldn't thwart a coup because he thought his own advisers approved such a move. So the White House knew full well of the pre-existing plotting of generals against the two men, who were despots and the objects of growing domestic protests. The most vivid were staged by Buddhist monks who burned themselves to death for all the world to see due to Diem's despotic ways toward them and fellow countrymen. The U.S. had backed Diem in his fight against the Viet Cong and its benefactor, North Vietnam. There were 16,000 Americans there at the time, both training South Vietnamese troops and accompanying them on helicopter raids into enemy territory. The documents show how the most aggressive proponent of a coup was Henry Cabot Lodge, the ambassador to South Vietnam. He was was a former U.S. senator from Massachusetts and Richard Nixon's 1960 running mate against the Democrats' Kennedy-Lyndon Johnson slate. They assert that the ""CIA was not in favor of the decision to abandon the Diem regime, but faithfully carried out instructions,"" with two CIA officers serving as the U.S. government's conduits to the generals. The documents note that a CIA source was present when the plotters ""debated the ultimate disposition of the brother, accompanied the force that apprehended them, and witnessed the events immediately after their deaths."" Indeed, there'd been ""a lengthy argument"" about whether they should be killed, ""with most of the generals favoring their execution."" The documents indicate that Captain Nguyễn Văn Nhung, the bodyguard of a key general who plotted the overthrow, ""was designated as executioner."" Then, one finds two paragraphs about the Military Revolutionary Committee, namely the plotters: ""On the morning of 2 November, the Committee received a phone call from a casual informant telling where Diem and Nhu could be found. A force was dispatched to apprehend them. This appears to conflict with (a CIA operative's) report that the phone had been pulled out. Shortly after 10:00 a.m., Diem and NU entered the personnel carrier with Captain Nhung."" The not-fit-for-family breakfast details include these concerning the event that preceded by only three weeks the Kennedy assassination itself. ""Nhu had been stabbed 21 times in the back with a carbine bayonet and shot five times. Diem had been shot twice in the chest. Nhung leaped from the M-113 with the bayonet in hand and proudly displayed it to all observers. His arms were soaked with blood. From the photos, it looks as if Diem and Nhu had their hands tied behind their backs."" The key document concludes, ""CIA had no hand in the assassinations and had no foreknowledge of them."" The generals proved inept, a succession of governments followed and the war was ultimately lost. Most people don't recall Diem and Nhu. And, of course, most Americans still can't find Vietnam on a map. But, at minimum, this reminds how often there is only so much that journalists (and historians) can really know about important events. And probably how no government is to be reflexively trusted—certainly not by journalists with even a modicum of skepticism. The Paradise Papers (cont.) The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists got play worldwide with its latest exclusives on the use of tax havens by the wealthy, based on 13.4 million records and the labor of 380 journalists from 96 news organizations working on six continents in 30 languages. Vice ran a terrific behind-the-scenes one-hour special on HBO last night, starting with reporters and editors from all over the world meeting at the Suddeutsche Zeitung in Munich, to whom the documents were leaked, and the group coming up with a collaborative battle plan marked by amazing discretion, a division of labor and a heavy reliance on data-crunching geeks. That nobody, anywhere, broke the November 5 embargo is itself impressive. The stories are more impressive. Many have now followed the initial weekend disclosures. Did you watch Apple chief Tim Cook talk the talk on tax reform with NBC's Lester Holt in an ""exclusive"" last week? Well, now see how, as governments shut down tax loopholes, how Apple found new ways to keep its rates nice and very low. It helps explain its accumulation of a Mount Everest of $252 billion in cash offshore. And see how ""Ireland tied itself in knots hoping to retain Apple, its biggest source of corporate taxes."" And if you're into jets and yachts, see how ""Private jet owners touch down in the Isle of Man and avoid millions in sales taxes."" Indeed, the United Kingdom outpost in the Irish see ""has registered roughly 1,000 aircraft since it started in 2007,"" while also registering luxury yachts for the United Arab Emirates and Microsoft founder co-founder Paul Allen,"" owner of the Seattle Seahawks in the NFL and the Portland Trail Blazers in the NBA. ""New meaning to Nude Chef"" From Conde Nast Traveler: ""France already boasts hundreds of beaches, campsites, and spa centers meant to be enjoyed in the nude, and now, the famously clothing-optional country is breaking new ground in naturism. According to local newspaper Le Parisien, the first nude restaurant in Paris opened to the public on Friday—and local naturists are already big fans of the new spot."" As David Friend, a friend and a Vanity Fair editor tweeted, ""Brings new meaning to the term Naked Chef."" A great photographer near the top of a key authors list When Barack Obama was a new U.S. senator, the Chicago Tribune dispatched reporter Jeff Zeleny and photographer Pete Souza to cover a European trek he was taking to Europe with Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana to assess the state of post-Cold War ""loose nukes."" It was Obama's first foreign trip as a senator and the two senators inspected ""how weapons of the past can present a danger for the future,"" as Zeleny, who is now with CNN, wrote at the time. When Obama was elected president, he paced Souza to be official photographer, his second such tour since he was also a Ronald Reagan White House photographer. Souza has a photo-heavy new book on Obama that's out Tuesday and is already No. 2 on Amazon's best-seller list. News quiz Is this from The Washington Post editorial page or The Onion? ""'No Way To Prevent This,’ Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens"" Bzzzz. Time's up: It's The Onion. But you wouldn't be surprised to see it elsewhere, would you? Virginia's big elections Here's what political journalists will be looking for Tuesday in Virginia: Does ""Trumpism"" win both in the governor race and the overall battle in the state legislature. A tip for economics writers The issue of productivity is a critical one if you're writing about the economy. Everybody knows that technology dramatically increased productivity but that such growth has slowed for around a decade. University of Chicago economist Chad Syverson offered a lecture and video confronting the thesis that the slowdown partly reflects a measurement challenge, namely that standard data isn't up to measuring transformative technologies. ""I show that, in several different ways, the data do not support this ‘mismeasurement hypothesis.’ "" News from the Joseph Stalin School of Management There's word from DNAInfo that ""Mayor: Terror Suspect Should 'Rot in Prison' But Not Face Death Penalty."" But isn't that word from New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio a bit late? Yes and no. It's the lead story on the New York site. It's from last week, obviously. And it follows word that Omaha billionaire Joe Ricketts was closing the 115-person operation nationwide. He scrubbed the site initially of everything on it, except his announcement.  That outrage was noted and now you can again find the handiwork of many good journalists, albeit now unemployed journalists. Hard to teach some old dogs new tricks From Nate Cohn of The New York Times: ""A year after polls broadly overestimated Hillary Clinton’s strength in the decisive Rust Belt battleground states, top pollsters and analysts across the survey industry have reached a broad near-consensus on many of the causes of error in the 2016 presidential election."" ""But so far, public pollsters — typically run by news outlets and colleges — have not changed much about their approach. Few if any of the public pollsters that conducted surveys ahead of Tuesday’s elections for governor in Virginia and New Jersey appear to have adopted significant methodological changes intended to better represent the rural, less educated white voters who pollsters believe were underrepresented in pre-election surveys."" On death in a church As Ainsley Earhardt, a co-host of Trump & Friends, put it after talking to Fox colleagues Monday: ""We were saying there’s no other place we would want to go other than church, because I’m there asking for forgiveness. I feel very close to Christ when I’m there. So, I’m trying to look at some positives here and know that those people are with the lord now and experiencing eternity and no more suffering, no more sadness anymore.” Hmmmm.

http://www.ibtimes.com/carrie-underwood-shares-update-after-injury-thanks-husband-support-during-recovery-2613694,"Carrie Underwood is feeling better after she fell outside her home, thanks to her husband, Mike Fisher. On Friday, Underwood suffered multiple injuries, including a broken wrist, after falling outside of her home in Nashville. On Saturday, she gave fans an update regarding her condition and thanked her husband for looking after her. ""Thanks so much for all the well wishes everybody...I'll be alright...might just take some time...glad I’ve got the best hubby in the world to take care of me,"" Underwood wrote on Twitter.  ""On Friday night, Carrie Underwood took a hard fall on some steps outside her home,"" Underwood's rep said in statement to Us Weekly. ""While there were no life-threatening injuries, she was taken to the hospital to be treated. She sustained multiple injuries including a broken wrist and some cuts and abrasions from the fall."" The rep added that Underwood's husband made it back in town the same night that the ""American Idol"" winner was released from the hospital. The statement also said that Underwood's recovery will take time, but she is thankful for the prayers and well-wishes. Due to her injuries, Underwood failed to perform at the Country Rising concert for the victims of the Las Vegas shooting in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and the Caribbean on Sunday in Nashville. The accident came just two days after Underwood hosted the Country Music Awards with Brad Paisley. During the event, the ""Before He Cheats"" singer cried when she performed a moving tribute for over 50 men and women who were killed after a gunman opened fire during the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival in Las Vegas on Oct. 1. Underwood gave the most powerful performance of the night when she sang the song ""Softly and Tenderly"" for the mass shooting victims. In related news, Underwood's husband announced his retirement from NHL in August. The ""Jesus, Take the Wheel"" singer expressed her support for the athlete on Instagram after he wrapped up his career in hockey. ""Captain @mfisher1212 I sure am going to miss watching you play and cheering you on with the rest of Smashville, but I so look forward to seeing what God has in store for you in this next chapter of your life,"" Underwood wrote.

https://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/2017/11/06/yet-another-us-mass-shooting-left-many-americans-feeling-numb-others-turning-totheir-faith,"newsCrime By Michael Granberry and Leslie  Barker 8:47 PM on Nov 6, 2017 CST Yet another mass shooting has left many Americans feeling a sense of numbness. The body count and grisly details from Sunday’s attack, this time in a small Texas town, carried with them an all-too-predictable sameness. Author David Freed was among those who found himself fighting a sense of disbelief as he reacted to what he saw on social media. As he wrote on Facebook Sunday afternoon: “Surreal reading my FB feed in the wake of the Texas church slaughter. Amid sporadic cries and prayers for the victims, I’m reading posted chili recipes and complaints about NFL games played today, and watching cute dog videos. These events have become so commonplace, it’s like we’ve all grown numb.” In the wake of the Sutherland Springs church shootings, the minute-by-minute updates are always there on TV and social media, often just a swipe away on our phones. That's leaving some people confused and feeling helpless. And while some may feel fear and anxiety around such mass shootings, many others say they are feeling desensitized to the violence. That numbness is concerning, said Dr. Catherine Fontaine, medical director of Greenhouse Treatment Center in Grand Prairie. People who feel numb in response to a traumatic event may be experiencing ""acute stress reaction"" or ""shock"" as they switch to ""survival mode,"" in which they shut down feelings and do what they need to do to survive, she said. It's important to be attentive to people who don't express or seem to be in touch with their feelings following a tragedy because sadness and, possibly, post-traumatic shock can follow in a period of three days to a month. ""They haven't gotten to the sadness stage,"" she said. ""They're not yet able to process that this really happened."" Dr. Philip Korenman, a Plano psychiatrist, said his patients bring up the shooting, ""but consistently say that they are numb from all these stories. They feel guilty, yet have heard these stories so much that they aren't surprised. They seem to feel powerless, helpless, so are using mostly healthy defense mechanisms like turning off the news."" Dallas actor Michael Federico, who in December starred in the Dallas Theater Center production of Gloria, about an angry employee gunning down co-workers in an office setting, said David Freed's Facebook post ""captures it perfectly.""  “I find myself asking, ‘Am I actually doing anything to try to make things better or help?’ I don’t know that the answer is yes,” he said. “Sometimes we post, and get rightfully angry or whatever, but it just exists in this vacuum online.” Members of her congregation have told Valarie Englert, senior pastor at First United Methodist Church of Garland, they are “confused and bewildered.” She has no answers for why the mass shootings keep happening. She only knows that “something has to change. These are repeated shootings and there seems to be so much rage, and I mean true rage, running amok in our culture. But the place to start with rage is inside us, not outside us.” Jeanne Stevenson-Moessner, professor of pastoral care at Perkins School of Theology at Southern Methodist University, disputes the idea that such tragedies have desensitized us. They've made us ""more alert and vulnerable,"" she said, ""because we're so worn down by other disasters. A lot of people are in shock at different levels."" Federico and Freed, an adjunct professor at Colorado State University, admit to feeling annoyed, even angry, politically. Federico says he’s weary of legislators mouthing the words “thoughts and prayers” in well-intentioned sympathies for victims and their families. He wonders how that fixes the very real problems that demand to be addressed. But Englert finds prayer valuable for many reasons. “When you think about our culture and how fearful it is, and when we’re in a fearful state, what does that do to a person’s breathing? It’s constricted and shallow. It’s almost like we’re limiting the presence of God by not attending to how close God is to us in our breathing.” Taking even 10 minutes to pray or meditate, “I’m less reactive,” she said. “There’s a lot more God can do with those people who are less reactive.” David Rejebian of Dallas said the night after hearing about the church massacre, he woke up and couldn’t go back to sleep. “Where does this end, where people don’t value fellow human beings? That’s what I can’t get past,” said Rejebian, 62 of Dallas. “How do we change people’s attitudes about how they feel about other people? I don’t know. I don’t know.” Staff writer Nancy Churnin contributed to this report. Dr. Jeanne Stevenson-Moessner, professor of pastoral care at Perkins School of Theology at SMU, offers suggestions on how to deal with emotions that such tragedies evoke. Take a break from watching or listening or reading about disasters. Switch the channel, turn off the TV. “For me, I’m going to work in the garden,” she said. “When someone comes into the office showing anxiety, I ask them to drink water or eat something, so they can feel the water going down their throat and be connected to their body.” “It sounds selfish, but it’s absolutely imperative,” she said. Only then can you look after the needs of others, too, she said. ""Today,"" she said, ""I saw someone walk into the SMU library and they had a really big briefcase and I was a little more vigilant.” “We have to pool our resources and not take this alone,” she said. “This was a sanctuary and has been defiled,” she said. “When Jesus saw the temple defiled, he got so angry he turned tables over.” The hardest question that religious leaders get, she said, is how a good God could let tragedies like this happen. “I don’t understand God’s ways, but I know God’s heart is broken and still beats.” Michael Granberry, Arts Writer.

Between his junior and senior years, he interned at The Washington Post during ""the Watergate summer"" of 1973. He spent 19 years at the Los Angeles Times before returning to Dallas.

http://www.ocregister.com/2017/11/11/addressing-mass-shootings-every-idea-on-the-table/,"Trending: For some children of the ’60s, the decade’s most traumatic crimes weren’t the assassinations of John and Robert Kennedy or the martyrdom of Martin Luther King — or even the appalling 1963 Klan church bombing that killed four black girls in Birmingham. It wasn’t even the rape, torture and strangulation of eight student nurses by a psycho named Richard Speck in Chicago in mid-July of 1966. The most terrifying violence came two weeks later when a former U.S. Marine named Charles Whitman killed his wife and mother before taking an arsenal to the University of Texas tower and shooting everyone he saw. By the time an Austin cop took him out, Whitman had killed 16 people and wounded 31. As a kid growing up the Bay Area, I viewed Stanford’s Hoover Tower and the Campanile at UC Berkeley differently after that. One day, while walking by Saints Peter and Paul Church in North Beach, my dad said that Joe DiMaggio had gotten married there. My kid brother asked if a madman had ever used the cathedral as a perch to shoot people below in Washington Square. Parents assured their children with the only logic they could muster: Such crimes are rare, they said. This was true then. It’s not true anymore — and hasn’t been for a while. As a cub police reporter in San Diego in 1979, I was on the scene for the first mass shooting at an American elementary school. The anomaly wasn’t only the choice of target, Cleveland Elementary School, but also that the shooter was a girl, 16-year-old Brenda Spencer. The first mass shooting in a church took place the following year when a 46-year-old atheist walked into the First Baptist Church in Daingerfield, Texas, yelling “This is war!” It wasn’t war, but it seemed like hell to the parishioners cowering in the pews. Daingerfield and the Cleveland Elementary School revealed that no place was a sanctuary. Since then, America has suffered through at least eight other such attacks on places of worship, one of them a Sikh temple in Wisconsin. Three of these killers have professed racist, homophobic or white supremacist views; another hated Baptists. One was a Muslim angry about the killings at Temple Emanuel in Charleston, S.C. The litany of colleges devastated by such crimes grows yearly. Everyone remembers the carnage at Virginia Tech, but have we forgotten the mass shootings at Northern Illinois University, Arizona, San Diego State, Umpqua Community College and Santa Monica College? Yes, Columbine High School and Sandy Hook Elementary were shocks to the national psyche, but killers have slaughtered innocents at a host of other schools, including another Cleveland Elementary in California, this one in Stockton. In 2012, after 12 movie-goers were gunned down in Aurora, Colorado, I wrote a four-part series examining the issue. Since then, four of the five deadliest shootings in U.S. history have taken place. Twenty-six dead in Newtown, Connecticut, including 20 kids ages 6 and 7. Forty-nine at the Pulse club in Orlando; 58 killed and more than 500 wounded in Las Vegas last month; 26 killed a week ago at a small Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Speaking for millions of Americans, the time for business-as-usual is over. We need a national dialogue on this plague, followed by concrete action. It’s time to put everything on the table, and I do mean everything. Mass shootings are not a new phenomenon. But the death toll has become staggering, and the ripple effects to the society potentially debilitating. The entrenched battle lines between Democrats and Republican are killing this country. Resuscitating it will require liberals and conservatives to put their fellow Americans ahead of stale ideologies and mindless talking points. In 1903 the streets of Winfield, Kansas were turned red by Spanish-American War veteran Gilbert Twigg. Twigg killed nine people and wounded many more at an outdoor concert before turning a revolver on himself. “The boys around town had referred to him as ‘Crazy’ Twigg,” the local paper reported later, “but no one thought he was dangerous.” Today, we all know that mentally ill men with a proficiency with firearms, no job and a seething anger toward society are quite dangerous. So why such easy access to firearms? One reason is that our laws are too deferential to the rights of the mentally ill. Charles Whitman suspected, correctly, that he had brain damage. He told his shrink he fantasized about shooting people from a tower. His therapist told no one. Aurora multiplex killer James Holmes told his psychiatrist that he had “homicidal thoughts” three or four times a day and that it was getting worse. She told no one. Jared Loughner, the Tucson shooter who wounded Congresswoman Gabrielle Gifford and 13 others while killing six, acted so oddly that some students and teachers refused to be in the same class with him. But he could buy guns. Let’s change that. Here are other steps to consider: • You don’t like how Donald Trump speaks about Muslim immigrants? I don’t, either. But let’s not pretend we don’t know who attacked the Pulse nightclub, Fort Hood, two Chattanooga military bases, the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, or who drove the deadly truck in New York City. The answer is Muslim immigrants or first-generation Muslims radicalized by Islamic extremist groups. The Trump administration wants stricter vetting of such people? Isn’t that an obvious need? • You like the Second Amendment? I once did, too. But the arsenal Stephen Paddock took to the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas included weapons for a battlefield. If the National Rifle Association keeps defending the unlimited right of Americans to hoard such weapons, millennial generation voters already flocking to liberal candidates and causes will eventually repeal it. Take heed, NRA. • What about existing gun laws — why aren’t they enforced? How was a dangerous convict like Devin Patrick Kelley able to purchase his guns after being cashiered from the U.S. Air Force and serving time for beating his wife and stepson? Slipped through the cracks, did he? We should have laws making such negligence a criminal offense. • The Second Amendment isn’t the only constitutional hurdle we must confront. I’m a journalist who relies on the First Amendment for my livelihood. But is it time to set limits? Social scientists have known for 50 years that Americans’ unfettered access to violent programming contributes to aggressive behavior and copy-cat crimes. The Aurora shooter attended a midnight showing of “The Dark Knight Rises” with dyed hair and guns, having left chemical booby traps back in his apartment adorned with Batman posters. He told cops he was the Joker. So far, lawsuits targeting studios — and video game manufacturers — have not dented the production of such nihilistic fare. Plaintiff lawyers must keep trying. Remember, it took a while to bag Big Tobacco, too. • Finally, what about the wall-to-wall news coverage of such events? It’s become clear to criminal justice experts that some sort of grim competition exists with these killers. Covering their crimes — covering the news — is not the same thing as producing mindlessly violent video games and is certainly protected by the First Amendment. Yet not everything that the news media can do is something it should do. Food for thought, colleagues. Carl M. Cannon is executive editor and Washington Bureau chief of RealClearPolitics.

http://uproxx.com/news/what-was-stephen-paddock-motive-las-vegas-shooter/,"Following the senseless Las Vegas massacre — which killed at least 59 people and left another 525 injured — carried out by Stephen Paddock, authorities are left with the insurmountable task of making sense of it all. Initial details in the hours after the shooting touched upon Paddock’s background and home life. More information is now trickling forth and paints a confusing picture of what could have motivated the 64-year-old Paddock (one of the oldest mass shooters in modern history) to commit such an atrocity. In other words, these new details yield clues and prompt more questions than answers. A Vast Arsenal: Within Paddock’s hotel room and Mesquite retirement-community home, investigators discovered 42 firearms along with explosives and thousands of ammo rounds. Since Paddock didn’t have a criminal record, Nevada’s gun laws would allow him to amass such a collection, which included automatic rifles that may have been converted from semiautomatic weapons. His stash included “AR-15-style and AK-47-style rifles.” A Recent Retiree Who Gambled Big: According to brother Eric Paddock, Stephen — a recently retired accountant — spent much of his time in Vegas, where he regularly dropped tens of thousands of dollars in a day. Eric told reporters that “he was a gambler, that was his job,” and their family wasn’t concerned about how Stephen “lived in a hotel room” for months at a time. In the days leading up to the massacre, Paddock conducted a number of large transactions, although it’s not known whether these were wins or losses. Investigators noted, however, that Paddock could have lost a million dollars in Vegas, and it wouldn’t have impacted his lifestyle, which rules out a spur-of-the-moment crime of passion after losing big at a casino. A Quiet Multimillionaire Who Didn’t Flaunt His Wealth: Neighbors in Mesquite knew Paddock as a quiet man who referred to himself as a pro gambler. Although he was worth at least $2 million at the time of his death, Paddock’s unassuming presence — polos, khakis, and a simple car — didn’t attract attention, and he didn’t spend much time at home. That impression was aided by the fact that Paddock also owned properties in California, Florida, and Texas. In fact, the only detail of note for one Mesquite neighbor was that Paddock’s garage held an enormous safe, which may have been where he stored much of his arsenal. A “Normal, Average” Guy, According To A Gun Shop Owner: Chris Mitchel of Dixie GunWorx awoke to news of the mass shooting and felt completely gutted upon remembering that he had sold a shotgun (which was not used in the Vegas massacre, since Paddock’s targets were hundreds of yards from his Mandalay Bay window) to Paddock. Yet as Mitchel recalled, Paddock seemed like “a normal customer” — sort of a “Joe Blow” type of guy — who shopped with them a few times but never set off alarm bells. A Baffling Mystery Of Intent: While Paddock’s father sat atop the FBI’s Top 10 Most Wanted list for nearly a decade (in connection with bank robberies), Stephen never ran afoul of the law until Sunday night in Vegas. Eric Paddock still can’t wrap his head around why his brother — who publicly held no political or religious affiliation — would commit mass murder. “There’s absolutely no sense, no reason he did this,” said Eric. “He’s just a guy who played video poker and took cruises and ate burritos at Taco Bell.” Investigators will continue to dig into Stephen Paddock’s homes and affairs for some time to come, but all clues from Paddock’s hotel room indicate a meticulously planned act of mass murder. His long-time companion, Marilou Danney, was also out of the country this weekend, which may prevent her from providing additional insight into why her partner plotted such a horrific crime. So for now, the mystery deepens, but questions shall continue. (Via New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Newsweek, USA Today & Atlanta Journal-Constitution)"
http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/11/07/strangers-hailed-as-heroes-for-helping-stop-texas-church-killer-are-forever-bonded-by-their-actions/,"Two men who heard gunshots ring out Sunday inside a tiny Texas church sprang into action and helped bring an end to the massacre that left dozens dead in Sutherland Springs. On Monday evening, they hugged during a candlelight vigil held for the 26 killed and 24 wounded during the gunman's rampage at the First Baptist Church. Oddly, in a town of about 600 where nearly everyone knows each other, Stephen Willeford and Johnnie Langendorff did not. Now, they are forever bonded through their tragedy and heroism.  Willeford's daughter alerted him to the shooting, according to People. The former NRA instructor, who lives about a block from the church, grabbed his rifle and ran out the door barefoot to confront the gunman.  ""I kept hearing the shots, one after another, very rapid shots — just 'pop pop pop pop' and I knew every one of those shots represented someone, that it was aimed at someone, that they weren't just random shots,"" Willeford told KHBS-TV.  Willeford loaded his magazine as fast as he could, his cousin, Ken Leonard, told CNN, and he exchanged fire with the shooter. ""I know I hit him, I don’t know where I hit him, but I know I hit him,” Willeford said during the interview. “And he [the shooter] got into his vehicle and he fired another couple of rounds through his side window.”  “And I fired when the window dropped,” Willeford added, “I fired another round at him again. And one as he was pulling away and he turned down 539, and he sped away.” Willeford noticed Langendorff's pickup nearby and ran over to him. ""I said, 'That guy just shot up the Baptist church. We need to stop him,'"" Willeford told KHBS. ""We gotta get him,"" Willeford said to Langendorff. ""I said, ‘Let’s go,"" Langendorff told People. Langendorff opened his door, Willeford jumped in and they chased the shooter as he tried to get away. Eleven miles later and speeds up to 95 miles an hour, the pursuit finally ended when the killer lost control and crashed his Ford Explorer into a ditch. Both men jumped out of Langendorff's truck and took refuge behind it. Willeford turned his rifle onto the gunman and yelled at him to get out of his truck, Langendorff said during his interview with People. “There was no movement at the time, traffic was coming around. I went to direct traffic just in case there was crossfire. After that, police showed up.” Police found the gunman dead with multiple gunshot wounds. Two of Willeford's bullets struck the shooter and a third was self-inflicted, according to authorities during a press briefing Monday.  ""Because that's what you do, you chase a bad guy,"" Langendorff said. “I’m no hero, I am not,” Willeford said in the latter part of his interview with CNN. “I think my God, my Lord protected me, and gave me the skills to do what needed to be done.”  Sutherland Springs is about 30 miles east of San Antonio. About 4 percent of the town's population was killed in the shooting. It is ""the largest mass shooting"" in the state's history, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said, who ordered flags to be flown at half-staff across the state on Monday. We use cookies to better understand website visitors, for advertising, and to offer you a better experience.

http://uproxx.com/life/gun-control-las-vegas-texas/,"On October 1, a gunman opened fire from a hotel room in Las Vegas — leaving 58 dead and 546 wounded. It was the worst mass shooting in American history, though you’d be forgiven for forgetting that. After all, the distance between mass shootings seems perfectly calibrated to fit our nation’s collective short-term memory: Day 1: “Thoughts and prayers.”
Days 2-7: “TOO SOON TO POLITICIZE!”
Days 8-14: “We have a lot to focus on as a nation; yes, this is an issue, but something something mental health and… Look over there! Is that a celebrity?!”
Days 15-34: “What shooting? Oh, that old thing? I can’t believe you even remember –”
Day 35: Rinse. Repeat. There were 35 days between Las Vegas and Sutherland, Texas. That seems particularly short, but not enough to shock me. Since I started at Uproxx on June 1, 2015, there have been eight mass shootings in the United States — including the #1 and #2 deadliest in history — so I’ve had plenty of chances to ponder the subject: Each of these pieces stimulated conversation about guns, their place in America, and the nation’s futile quest to have less violence while also refusing to enact meaningful legislative change. And in all of these conversations, I was taken to task over the terms with which I wrote about guns. Commenters chewed me to pieces over my wobbly usage of the phrases “semi-automatic weapon,” “high capacity clip,” and “assault rifle.” For what it’s worth, they were right. The layperson’s vision of a semi-automatic is a rapid-repeating rifle — something akin to an AR-15 — but most handguns today also fulfill the definition of semi-automatic, in that the user is not chambering cartridges manually. High capacity magazines are even more murky. AR (which stands for Armalite rifle, not “Assault Rifle”) magazines come standard at 30 rounds. So a “high capacity” AR magazine would be greater than 30 rounds, far exceeding the typical legislative definition of “high capacity magazines” in states where such laws have passed (which is usually set at 10 or 15 rounds). Even the term “assault rifle” is embedded with shades of gray. Though it seems like an easy catch-all term for non-gun types, the military definition of an assault rifle would actually exclude weapons like the AR-15 — since that gun doesn’t have a “selective fire” feature, which would allow it to be shot automatically or in burst mode. Even if you know guns, even if you’re cleared for CCW (carrying a concealed weapon) with a FFL (Federal Firearms License), you can see how the jargon of America’s most beloved toys can get disorienting. The terms are tricky and the scale for how they apply to different sized weapons is a sliding one — so it’s hard for lawmakers to create bills that don’t get quagmired in semantics. (Which explains why the NRA wisely pushes small laws that conspire together to achieve something bigger, rather than trying to enact sweeping change all at once.) The question then is this: Do you have to “get guns” to be a part of substantive conversations about weapons in this country? Can a confusion of terms or a jumbling of specs identify someone as not deserving a seat at the table when it comes time to talk gun control? Answer: Hell no. And yet, that’s the common retort, over and over. “Don’t know your Glock from your Desert Eagle? Go sit with the other hippies, while the adults talk.” The implication when you watch Tucker Carlson heckle a pro-gun reform writer  about his experience handling an AR-15 is simple: “People who don’t know about things from experience should not speak about them with any level of authority.” What a nice thought, especially from a man who talks about politics for a living without ever having held a public office. If only we could use Carlson’s idea as a gold standard for issues of abortion, the constitution, and religion. Alas, this is never going to happen. Because as Americans, there’s only one thing we value more than our beloved gun rights: Talking without having a complete handle on what in the world we’re talking about. Only a quarter of Americans know all three branches of government, but god knows that doesn’t stop us from holding (and sharing) strong convictions about them; our president has literally no idea where Puerto Rico is, but he’s still managing our disaster relief effort; and Idaho State Representative Vito Barbieri fights abortion tooth and nail without the ability to fathom that a woman’s digestive and reproductive tracts aren’t connected. Is it tragic that people with a knowledge gap still get to pop off on those issues of which they know little? That depends on how much power the uneducated parties have and how much knowledge is lacking. Discussing things is one of the ways that people learn about them. Debate, at its best, can be instructive. And inviting only experts to speak on issues that affect all of us is how those in power consolidate and horde it — remember that literacy tests were the ultimate voter suppression technique in the Jim Crow south. Besides, how much do you have to know about magazine sizes to declare with confidence that the website StackingBodies.com shouldn’t be allowed to sell a Surefire 100-round magazine via the internet? How versed in ballistics do you need to be to recognize that the AR-556 — used by Devin Patrick Kelley in Sutherland Springs — is a weapon for people who are trying to kill living things very efficiently in a non-sporting manner? Do you have to know the mechanics of trigger tension and bump stocks before you can feel confident stating that people should only own guns after applying for a license, passing a safety test, and filing for the legal title to their weapons (like we do with cars)?

At some point, asking people to parrot statistics to engage in the gun violence discussion is the ultimate straw man gambit: “Let’s pretend this conversation is about guns, and debate your authority to speak about them; rather than concede that this conversation is actually about human lives lost to guns.” When Tucker Carlson mocks gun-control activists because they don’t regularly handle the rifles they despise, he’s missing the point by light-years (while seeming absolutely assured of his moral high ground): You don’t have to know about something in order to not want to be killed by it. I know very little about how venom affects the body, but if someone wanted to let their pet cobra roam my yard, I feel like I could make a strong argument to the neighborhood association about why they shouldn’t be allowed to do so. Perhaps the metric for who should get to talk about certain subjects and what level of baseline knowledge is required should be linked to how much the topic in question affects us and the power being wielded by those doing the talking. Should I have had all my terms buttoned up before jumping into the gun-discussion on a platform this size? Probably. Should lawmakers be able to cite their facts about guns and talk about them with confidence on the Senate floor or to smug TV hosts? Yep. But do lay people need to understand the difference between a clip and a magazine in order to advocate, march, and call their representatives about gun control? That’s ridiculous. This is an issue that touches human lives, and humans have every right to respond to it. Sure, the conversation needs more active, involved, knowledgeable participants, but that knowledge might be about guns or it might be about utilitarian ethics (which often comes to bear on this topic). Besides, anyone who’s ever read up on the thousands of accidental shootings we have per year in this country knows that not even gun owners know much about their beloved weapons (like, for instance, how to make them inaccessible to toddlers). It’s been said that doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results is the very definition of insanity. Through this prism, it’d be hard to call our response to mass shootings anything less than insane. Our actions haven’t changed significantly in years and probably won’t this time around — but the suggestion that you have to know about guns in order to be repulsed by the destruction they wreak is yet another absurd roadblock thrown up by those interested in stalling the conversation. Will our nation change course after yet another mass shooting? Doubtful. But letting 2nd amendment loyalists twist the issue to make it about gun knowledge rather than a desire by gun safety advocates to have less people die pushes us into the theater of the bizarre and ought not be tolerated for a second. After all, it doesn’t take a working knowledge of hollow-tipped versus full metal jacket bullets to know that this Texas family didn’t deserve to have three generations decimated by them."

Trump shadowed by Texas massacre during Asia trip — -- President Trump said Tuesday that new gun laws would have made ""no difference"" in preventing the massacre at a church service in Sutherland Springs, Texas, that left 26 people dead. Trump was asked during a press conference in South Korea about his recent comments calling for ""extreme vetting"" immediately following the New York City terror attack, and whether he would favor similar scrutiny for those looking to purchase firearms. ""If you did what you're suggesting, there would have been no difference three days ago,"" Trump said, before turning to praise the actions of a bystander who engaged the shooter following his rampage. ""You might not have had that very brave person who happened to have a gun or a rifle in his truck, go out and shoot him and hit him and neutralize him."" The president added, ""I can only say this. If [the neighbor] didn't have a gun, instead of 26 dead, you would have had hundreds more dead. So that's the way I feel about it, not going to help."" The suspected shooter, Devin Kelley, 26, served in the Air Force but was court martialed in 2012 on charges of assault and aggravated assault on his spouse and a child. Authorities said Monday that his gun purchases were allowed because there was no prohibited info in the federal background check system, the Air Force has since acknowledged it did not report Kelley's convictions to the FBI. The president was briefed on developments in the shooting while in Japan, and said soon after that it should be credited to a ""mental health problem"" and not U.S. gun laws. He and the White House urged restraint in jumping to conclusions similar to the reaction following the mass shooting in Las Vegas in October. The White House later said the president would be willing to work with Congress on potentially regulating the ""bump stock"" device used by the shooter to increase his rate of fire, though those efforts have seemed to fade in recent weeks. The president's response to the Texas mass shooting has been compared with his reaction to the terror attack in New York City just last Tuesday, where he waited only hours before stating he had directed the Department of Homeland Security to institute strict vetting procedures and called for Congress to change immigration policy. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the tweets were not ""factual"" and ""tended to point fingers and politicize the situation,"" though the White House disputed he was taking advantage of the tragedy for political gain. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/local-reports-church-shooting-sutherland-springs-texas,"Once the shooting started Sunday at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, there was likely “no way” for congregants to escape, said Wilson County Sheriff Joe D. Tackitt Jr. Officials said about 20 others were wounded. “He just walked down the center aisle, turned around and my understanding was shooting on his way back out,” said Tackitt, who said the gunman also carried a handgun but that he didn’t know if it was fired. Tackitt described the scene as “terrible.” “It’s unbelievable to see children, men and women, laying there. Defenseless people,” he said. Authorities didn’t identify the attacker during a news conference Sunday night. But two other officials — one a U.S. official and one in law enforcement — identified him as Devin Kelley. They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the investigation. The U.S. official said Kelley lived in a San Antonio suburb and didn’t appear to be linked to organized terrorist groups. Investigators were looking at social media posts Kelley made in the days before the attack, including one that appeared to show an AR-15 semiautomatic weapon. Kelley received a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force for assaulting his spouse and child, and was sentenced to 12 months’ confinement after a 2012 court-martial. Kelley served in Logistics Readiness at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his 2014 discharge, Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said. At the news conference, the attacker was described only as a white man in his 20s who was wearing black tactical gear and a ballistic vest when he pulled into a gas station across from the church, about 30 miles (48.28 kilometers) southeast of San Antonio, around 11:20 a.m. The gunman crossed the street and started firing the rifle at the church, said Freeman Martin, a regional director of the Texas Department of Safety, then continued firing after entering the white wood-frame building, where an 11 a.m. service was scheduled. As he left, the shooter was confronted by an armed resident who “grabbed his rifle and engaged that suspect,” Martin said. A short time later, the suspect was found dead in his vehicle at the county line. Federal agents, including ATF investigators and the FBI’s evidence collection team, swarmed the small rural community of just hundreds of residents. Several weapons were found inside the vehicle and Martin said it was unclear if the attacker died of a self-inflicted wound or if he was shot by the resident who confronted him. He said investigators weren’t ready to discuss a possible motive. Martin said 23 of the dead were found in the church, two were found outside and one died after being taken to a hospital. The man who confronted Kelley had help from another local resident, Johnnie Langendorff, who told KSAT TV that he was driving past the church as the shooting happened. He didn’t identify the armed resident but said the man exchanged gunfire with the gunman, then asked to get in Langendorff’s truck and the pair followed as the gunman drove away. Langendorff said the gunman eventually lost control of his vehicle and crashed. He said the other man walked up to the vehicle with his gun drawn and the suspect did not move. He stayed there for at least five minutes, until police arrived. “I was strictly just acting on what’s the right thing to do,” Langendorff said. Among those killed was the church pastor’s 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle Pomeroy. Pastor Frank Pomeroy and his wife, Sherri, were both out of town when the attack occurred, Sherri Pomeroy wrote in a text message. “We lost our 14-year-old daughter today and many friends,” she wrote. “Neither of us has made it back into town yet to personally see the devastation. I am at the charlotte airport trying to get home as soon as i can.” Church member Nick Uhlig, 34, who wasn’t at Sunday’s service, told the AP that his cousin, who was 8 months pregnant, and her in-laws were among those killed. He later told the Houston Chronicle that three of his cousin’s children also were slain. President Donald Trump, who was in Japan, called the shooting an “act of evil,” later calling the gunman “a very deranged individual.” Sunday evening, two sheriff’s vans were parked outside the gate of a cattle fence surrounding the address listed for Kelley on the rural, western outskirts of New Braunfels, north of San Antonio. Ryan Albers, 16, who lives across the road, said he heard intensifying gunfire coming from that direction in recent days. “It was definitely not just a shotgun or someone hunting,” Albers said. “It was someone using automatic weapon fire.” The church has posted videos of its Sunday services on a YouTube channel, raising the possibility that the shooting was captured on video. In a video of its Oct. 8 service, a congregant who spoke and read Scripture pointed to the Oct. 1 Las Vegas shooting a week earlier as evidence of the “wicked nature” of man. That shooting left 58 dead and more than 500 injured. Gov. Greg Abbott called Sunday’s attack the worst mass shooting in Texas history. It came on the eighth anniversary of a shooting at the Texas’ Fort Hood, where 13 people were killed and 31 others wounded by a former U.S. Army major. The previous deadliest mass shooting in Texas had been a 1991 attack in Killeen, when a mentally disturbed man crashed his pickup truck through a restaurant window at lunchtime and started shooting people, killing 23 and injuring more than 20 others. The University of Texas was the site of one of the most infamous mass shootings in modern American history, when U.S. Marine sniper Charles Whitman climbed the Austin campus’ clock tower in 1966 and began firing on stunned people below, killing 13 and wounding nearly three dozen others. He had killed his wife and mother before heading to the tower, one victim died a week later and medical examiners eventually attributed a 17th death to Whitman in 2001. ___ Associated Press writers Sadie Gurman and Eric Tucker in Washington, Nomaan Merchant in Houston, Will Weissert in Austin, Diana Heidgerd in Dallas, Michael Balsamo in Los Angeles and Paul J. Weber in New Braunfels, Texas, contributed to this report. Sen. Angus King (I-VT), who caucuses with Democrats and is a member of the Senate Rules Committee, on Sunday said… Sen.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/uproxx/features/~3/JARhVIUQFsw/,"We know that the horrific Las Vegas mass shooting that took place in October was carried out by Stephen Paddock, but some people feel that the gunman isn’t the only party at fault. “Bump stock” manufacturers are being sued, and now, so are Live Nation Entertainment — which hosted the Route 91 Harvest Festival where the shooting happened — and MGM Resorts International — the parent company of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, where the shooter was located. The Los Angeles Times reports that lawyers representing more than 450 victims filed multiple lawsuits in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Monday, with the contention that concert officials and hotel staff did not do enough to prevent this tragedy from happening. Houston-based lawyer Chad Pinkerton summarized his view of the situation bluntly (via the Associated Press): “We know in this day and age that evil does happen, and we have to protect against that. This was the largest venue security failure in US history.” The victims’ attorneys said on Monday that “the festival did not have adequate exits or properly trained employees for when the crowd began trying to evacuate, resulting in additional injuries and exposure to the gunman’s fire.” Pinkerton further detailed what he saw as shortcomings in how the situation was handled: “There was a decision made not to make that phone call to 911 immediately. My instinct tells me that’s going to be because they wanted to control the environment and control the message before the public and the media was involved. Certainly they didn’t know they were going to have an evil act such as this, but they could have anticipated it, they could have foreseen it.” MGM has responded to these legal actions, saying in a statement, “The incident that took place on Oct. 1 was a terrible tragedy perpetrated by an evil man. These kinds of lawsuits are not unexpected and we intend to defend ourselves against them. That said, out of respect for the victims, we will give our response through the appropriate legal channels.” Live Nation declined to comment about the lawsuit, but said they’re cooperating with an active FBI investigation and expressed sorrow for the “countless people forever impacted by this senseless act of violence.” Read more about the shooting here, and find Jason Aldean’s first-person account of the event here."
https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2017/11/08/choose-see-freaks-among-us-surprised-kill,"By Joshua J. Whitfield 7:39 AM on Nov 8, 2017 CST The reason why Flannery O'Connor and other Southern writers often wrote about ""freaks,"" she said, was because ""we are still able to recognize one."" Writing about murderers, racists, traveling Bible-selling hypocrites, O'Connor was a master of her art, the strange genre she called grotesque. It was her way of telling the truth through lies and good through evil. Such writing was possible, she said, because for the most part, Southern writers still held ""some conception of the whole man,"" a faint notion of the imago Dei, the idea that God still bore his stamp upon us, his preternatural grace still present like a shadow cut across our souls. It's what makes our pathetic evil visible at all, this countervailing figure. It's why she wrote about freaks so well, because she knew the original form. Today's ""freaks,"" as O'Connor called them, are harder to recognize. Blind, unable or unwilling, we just don't see them. Nondescript mass murders, abusers, the deranged: I am struck how we don't see them, or won't see them, until after the fact. Until they break out a 32nd floor window or walk down the aisle of a little country church and start shooting. Blind like this, this danse macbre continues, and will continue unabated. Hence the maddening script, the lines we all now know by heart. Lines we're forced to rehearse every time, because we know nothing else to say. Hence our politicians, from the president down, remain bought and stupid, their slogans predictably recycled. Gun reform will do nothing, they say. It's all about mental health, they say; and besides, who can do anything about that? Really, it's the immigrants you should watch out for, they say, the brown ones especially, wherever they're from. Regurgitating non sequiturs: that's where we are, all of us, along with the mindless left and the mindless right, faithfully reciting this absurdist script like something out of Samuel Beckett, stopping only for the commercials. We no longer recognize our freaks, because we refuse to look. Like an abused spouse who just won't see him for what he is, or a drunk who just won't own up, or that pathetic friend who keeps blaming others for the failures of his life, we seem particularly unwilling to look at what might literally be killing us. We are unwilling to talk about our freaks. Maybe because we'd have to look at ourselves. Doing so, we'd have to think about how uncomfortably close we are to the horrible people who committed these crimes. We might have to see how like us they were, how the world we live in made both them and us. We'd have to think about the society we've made, which has made such men. This shallow advertised happiness, which is really just purchased emptiness, leaves so many unfulfilled; this incessantly screened bitterness has made disagreements inhuman and hateful; this nonsensical puerile rage has made enemies absolute and compromise taboo. It's a world that has made so many of us angry and some even violent. For me, the chilling thought is that from Columbine to Sandy Hook to Sutherland Springs, all of it makes sense. All of it is simply the dividends of this rancorous world. A world for which we are all responsible, every last one us. Which is why I think we repeatedly tell ourselves the same lies. It's why after every mass shooting, more and more emotionless, we simply fall in line to play our same tired parts. Because we no longer recognize our freaks. Because we no longer recognize ourselves. Joshua J. Whitfield is pastoral administrator for St. Rita Catholic Community in Dallas and a frequent contributor to The Dallas Morning News.

https://www.inquisitr.com/4665074/chelsea-handler-feud-sarah-huckabee-sanders-insult/,"Chelsea Handler, the comedian-turned-activist, hurled insults at White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders over the weekend. In an interview on Friday's episode, Sarah Sander's name came up during the conversation. Handler proceeded to interrupt her guest and call Sanders a ""harlot,"" ""trollop"" and ""w****."" When asked about Sanders, Handler exclaimed, ""That Harlot that they're dressing up and trolloping out every day?"" according to Fox News.  One particular commenter on social media posted an old quote from Handler on the importance of women respecting other women with open arms. Others on social media made it clear that they took notice of Handler's disparaging comments about Sanders.  Another user noted that Handler practices many of the beauty tactics that she's chastising Sarah Sanders, ""before you call Sarah Huckabee Sanders a w**** maybe you should check some of the stuff you have posted on Instagram."" Another mocked the double standard that Handler appeared to illustrate on social media saying, ""Just an FYI to everyone… APPARENTLY Chelsea Handler can call Sarah Huckabee Sanders a W**** and keep tweeting, but if you return the favor to her, you are suspended.""  Handler said that she will continue her partnership with Netflix by creating a documentary in which she will engage with people she does not speak to enough. Handler said this includes people of different ethnicities, religions, and political philosophies. Chelsea has made a name for herself as a prominent critic of the Trump administration and her newest comments against Sanders are just the latest in a long line of jabs at the White House. Chelsea's comments against Sanders come about 28 minutes into the latest episode of Chelsea, titled ""Dinner Party: Scandalous.""  The former Chelsea host has gone after the GOP before on issues surrounding gun control.  Chelsea Handler's comments received criticism throughout social media. Many chastised the star for politicizing the event while it was ongoing. One Twitter user wrote, ""Does your career depend on you being a vile, callous person, or is that a personal choice?"" While another commented, ""You are a terrible human being,"" and another added, ""Are you really that ignorant?"" Handler also posted a photo on Instagram demanding gun reform and discussing various mass shootings around the country including Virginia Tech, Tuscon, San Bernardino, Charleston, Orlando, Las Vegas, and more currently Sutherland Springs. Chelsea also went after President Donald Trump after he tweeted, ""May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan."" The comedian responded in a negative manner to Trump by saying, ""You have no capacity to monitor anything that doesn't involve lining your pockets."""
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-texas-shooting/gunman-opens-fire-at-texas-church-killing-at-least-20-idUSKBN1D510F?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Jon Herskovitz, Lisa Maria Garza 7 Min Read SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas (Reuters) - A former U.S. serviceman who shot 26 worshipers to death during Sunday prayers in Texas was embroiled in a domestic dispute with his in-laws and had sent threatening text messages to his wife’s mother before the massacre, officials said Monday. The Pentagon separately disclosed that it had failed to furnish information about the gunman’s criminal record from his U.S. Air Force service to a national database that should have prevented him from legally purchasing the firearms he bought. The killer, Devin Kelley, 26, was convicted by court-martial of assaulting his first wife and step-son while serving in an Air Force logistics readiness unit and spent a year in detention before his bad-conduct discharge in 2014, according to the Pentagon. The Air Force acknowledged on Monday that Kelley’s 2012 conviction on two counts of domestic violence were never entered into the National Criminal Information Center (NCIC) system, a U.S. government data bank used by licensed gun dealers for conducting background checks on firearms purchasers. Federal law forbids anyone from selling or giving a gun to someone convicted of a crime involving domestic violence. A sporting goods retail chain has said Kelley passed background checks when he bought a gun in 2016 and a second firearm the following year. Christopher Combs, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s San Antonio division, said there was nothing in the NCIC or two related databases that would have barred Kelley from legally buying any of three weapons police recovered from their investigation of the slayings. Details of a background of violent, disturbing behavior emerged a day after Sunday’s rampage in southeastern Texas, which ranks as the deadliest mass shooting by a lone gunman in the state and one of the five most lethal in modern U.S. history. Kelley was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head after a failed attempt to make his getaway from the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, authorities said. Related Coverage   See more stories Stepping out of the church, Kelley was confronted and shot twice - in the leg and torso - by an armed area resident later identified as Stephen Willeford. Still, Kelley managed to flee in a sport utility vehicle as Willeford waved down a passing motorist, Johnnie Langendorff, in a pickup truck. The two good Samaritans then chased after the suspect at high speeds, before the gunman’s vehicle crashed in a ditch, authorities said. Freeman Martin, a spokesman for the state Department of Public Safety, hailed Willeford as “our Texas hero,” crediting him with preventing further carnage. Authorities said Kelley had called his father during the pursuit to say he had been shot and might not survive. It appeared family problems may have been a factor in Sunday’s bloodshed. Kelley was involved in a domestic dispute with the family of Danielle Shields, a woman he married in 2014, and the situation had flared up, according to officials and public records. “There was a domestic situation going on within the family and the in-laws,” Martin told reporters outside the church on Monday. “The mother-in-law attended the church ... she had received threatening text messages from him.” Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said the family members were not in the church during Kelley’s attack. Martin put the number of victims killed in the attack at 26, including the unborn child of a pregnant woman who died. The dead otherwise ranged in age from 18 months to 77 years. Ten of the wounded in Texas remained in critical condition, officials said. ‘VIOLENT TENDENCIES’ Wearing a black bullet-proof vest and skull mask, Kelley used a Ruder AR-556 semi-automatic rifle in the attack, authorities said. They recovered two other weapons, both handguns, from his vehicle. The gunman walked up and down the church aisles shooting people on the ground in between the pews, according to an account related to CNN by David Brown, the son of one of the wounded survivors, 73-year-old Farida Brown, who was shot in both legs. Brown said his mother told him the first shots came through the windows, then the assailant walked through the front door and started shooting, opening fire even at those diving on the floor for cover or attempting to flee. Farida Brown was in the last pew, beside a woman who was shot multiple times, her son told CNN. “She was pretty certain she was next, and her life was about to end. Then somebody with a gun showed up at the front of the church, caught the shooter’s attention. He left and that was the end of the ordeal,” David Brown said. The attack came about a month after a gunman killed 58 people in Las Vegas in the deadliest shooting by a lone assailant in modern U.S. history. Martin said investigators found hundreds of spent shell casings inside the church after the church, as well as 15 30-round ammunition magazines, all of them empty. In rural Texas and in other states, gun ownership is a part of life, and Republican leaders for years have balked at gun control measures, arguing that responsible gun owners can help deter crime. Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott told CBS News there was evidence that Kelley had mental health problems and had been denied a state gun permit. “It’s clear this is a person who had violent tendencies, who had some challenges,” Abbott said. Abbott and other Republican politicians said the mass shooting did not influence their support of gun ownership by U.S. citizens - the right to bear arms protected under the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Vice President Mike Pence said on Twitter that he will travel to Sutherland Springs on Wednesday to meet with victims’ families and law enforcement. “This isn’t a guns situation. I mean we could go into it but it’s a little bit soon,” U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters while on a trip to Asia. “Fortunately somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction, otherwise ... it would have been much worse.” Democrats renewed their call to restrict gun ownership. “How many more people must die at churches or concerts or schools before we stop letting the @NRA control this country’s gun policies,” Democratic U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Twitter, referring to the powerful gun lobby the National Rifle Association. The attack stunned Sutherland Springs, a community of about 400 people with just one blinking yellow traffic light. One family, the Holcombe, lost eight people from three generations in the attack, including Bryan Holcombe, an assistant pastor who was leading the service, a relative said. John Stiles, a 76-year-old retired U.S. Navy veteran, said he heard the shots from his home about 150 yards (137 m) away: “My wife and I were looking for a peaceful and quiet place when we moved here but now that hasn’t worked out.” Reporting by Lisa Maria Garza; Additional reporting by Jane Ross in Sutherland Springs, Texas; Bernie Woodall in Fort Lauderdale, Florida; and Peter Szekely in New York; Writing by Scott Malone and Steve Gorman; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Lisa Shumaker Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

This time in the small community of Sutherland Springs, Texas. Another opportunity to not speak about common sense gun regulation.

BOAS: After church shooting, here's the question we should ask ROBERTS: After church shooting, God help us President Donald Trump said he is “monitoring” the situation in Texas from Asia, where he is on a trip. Trump monitored the Las Vegas shooting, too. He said there would be time to speak about firearms after a period of mourning and reflection had passed. And that time passed. And nothing happened. Until today, when at least 20 individuals were killed at a church outside of San Antonio. And we will be told, again, that we must wait. We must allow time for mourning. For reflection. As if it would be impossible to mourn AND talk. It would not. Likewise, Congress can mourn AND act. We could ask ourselves a few questions. Should there be a universal background check on each gun sale, public or private? Should certain weapons be banned? Should we restrict the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines? Should we prohibit internet sales of guns and ammunition? We can talk about it. Lawmakers in Washington, D.C., can vote on it. Our politicians – as well as the rest of us – should stop with the false piousness and the well-rehearsed empathy and instead honor the dead in a truly fitting way. Not only with words. With action.

https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/2017/11/11/reactions-mass-shooting-texas,"By Letters to the Editor 1:30 PM on Nov 11, 2017 CST Re: ""'Horrific tragedy' — Gunman kills 26 congregants at Sunday service,"" Monday news story. Once again, I turn on the morning news. Once again, I hear of yet another horrific mass shooting, this time at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Once again, I am saddened by the anguish and grief on the faces of those who survived and of those who have lost loved ones. Once again, I hear the worn-out platitude, ""Our thoughts and prayers are with you."" Once again, I see a disgusting photo of the person who committed this hideous act. Once again, I hear the president say, ""It's too soon ... "" in regard to a possible ban on assault rifles. Once again. I see this. I am weary. My heart breaks. When, Mr. President? For God's sake, we have to do something! Polly J. Shaw, Denton What a sad day for the small town of Sutherland Springs. And what a sad day for this country that yet again we find ourselves offering prayers and condolences to those affected by gun violence. Earlier today, I read a piece in The Washington Post full of ideas to help heal our country. One of the suggestions was to require gun insurance — an idea I'd not heard before, but one I believe deserves attention. Apparently, Australia has instituted this. Just imagine if insurance companies were financially responsible for the violence inflicted by weapons they had insured. I imagine that criminal background checks and other forms of due diligence would be well-enforced, if profit-making enterprises had to put money on the table. I will be contacting my congressional representatives about this idea, but would love to see some information about this in The Dallas Morning News.  Eleanor Goodwin, Coppell Mass killings are now a fact of life in America. Stop sending condolences to the victims' families and friends. Stop thanking the heroic first-responders. It's sadly getting old. Just get used to it. John Nesbitt, Calgary, Canada Those who are criticizing President Trump's sending thoughts and prayers when those who were in the church in Sutherland Springs were probably in prayer miss the point. Trump was probably referring to prayers for the survivors and the families of the victims, that God give them strength to either recover or cope with their losses. Years ago, my son was shot, and on the way to the hospital in the ambulance silently prayed and asked God to let him live. He heard a voice say, ""You will live, my son."" And he did. The doctor told me afterward even with all the medical science, my son had had only a 20 percent chance of surviving. As people gave their prayers for my son and for me, I felt the strength of prayer as if hands were under my arms, lifting me up. My son did survive, and we both know the power of prayer. Kathy Smith, Northwest Dallas CORRECTION: This letter incorrectly said Kathy Smith had silently prayed to God to allow her son to live. It was her son who said that silent prayer. There was a time when a church was a place of safety or refuge, either by law or by convention, and at times people could ""hide"" in a church building. They considered themselves safe because no one would commit violence in a holy place. This idea of a safe haven has come under attack both literally in Texas and metaphorically around the world. It's not just a matter of who can have guns and certainly not the horrifying suggestion of bringing more guns for more safety. It's a worldwide issue of many people needing a place of safety and a right to be safe. We have a long way to go till we really feel safe. Dennis Fitzgerald, Melbourne, Australia Well, here we are again. Twenty-six dead and a dozen seriously wounded just weeks after over 50 were killed and hundreds wounded in Las Vegas. I'm pleading for the women of our country to demand sensible gun legislation banning assault weapons, bump stocks and extend clips. We men will not do it; our testosterone-driven love of guns won't allow us to be sensible. I realize that people kill people, but assault weapons allow them to do it in mass and very efficiently. Often, this gun violence is done by a man and perpetrated against women and children as was this last case — a man apparently mad at his mother-in-law. Most of the dead were women and children. Our last hope to end this type of gun violence is for mothers, wives and sisters to say enough. Tell your men, tell your representatives and senators, that enough is enough. Guns were designed to kill, period. If you have one in your home, there is a higher probability that it will end up harming your child, a friend or you. How many more mass shootings will it take? How many innocent lives will it take? I hope if my mother, sister or nieces read this that they will call their representatives, NOW. Enough! Keith Jones, Dallas/Knox-Henderson So long as we love our guns more than we love our children, these massacres will continue. Michael Rosenthal, Plano These issues have seemingly become even more politicized than before, as Congress has struggled to pass a ban on bump stocks, like the one Stephen Paddock used during the incident in Las Vegas. The massacre in Sutherland Springs sparked even greater pressure from those in favor of gun control for politicians to do something about it. Personally, I am most upset that as a nation, we have become desensitized and complacent in watching these tragedies unfold. Even worse is the divisive nature that hovers above any conversation about gun control here. I do not believe that gun control should be a partisan issue. However, I do believe it is important that we thoroughly evaluate how we can prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future, whether or not that means banning certain weapons, or strengthening the vetting process for those attempting to purchase weapons. Oftentimes, as now, there are no clear answers, but as a country we must be willing to listen to one another, and collectively understand that gun violence is an issue that needs to be resolved in one way or another. Marissa Mosley, Arlington Seems every tragic event is simply another opportunity for majority of people to reinforce their existing beliefs. James C. Francis, Carrollton Re: ""We must plan how to stop the next killer — States shouldn't limit people's ability to protect against evil, says Ken Paxton,"" Wednesday Viewpoints. To my amazement, I find myself in complete agreement with Ken Paxton. If you start with the premise that there's no way of keeping even the most sophisticated and deadly firearms out of the hands of bad guys, then the only real solution is for the rest of us to arm ourselves to the teeth. We need to insist on our right to carry firearms in churches, schools, grocery stores, mass gatherings, nightclubs, courtrooms, police stations, even on private property. And we need to be vigilant in consistently carrying our arms everywhere we go, even to the bathroom. It only takes one time when we're not prepared. Obviously the police understand and agree completely, as they've adopted military preparation, tactics and firepower over the last several years. They want to be sure they are never surprised or outgunned by the bad guys. Merle Walker, Athens Believe it or not, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's nemesis, President Barack Obama, was spot-on in his assessment of small-town Midwesterners (well, Southwesterners; read: Texans), when he said ""they cling to guns."" Indeed, Paxton recommends Texas parishioners ought ""cling to their guns and their Bibles"" simultaneously, i.e., pack heat at the church house. So, let us pray. ""God is great, God is good, let us thank him for our bullets"" or ""Give us this day our daily lead."" Amen. Kelly Akins, Dallas/Preston Hollow Like all Texans, I am deeply saddened by the events that took place in Sutherland Springs on Sunday. As of this writing, 26 people are confirmed dead. I called all three of my representatives Monday morning and asked one simple question: Can you give me the bill numbers for legislation my representative has either authored or sponsored since the Las Vegas shooting that relate gun violence? Rep. Michael McCaul: Nothing 
Sen. John Cornyn: Nothing 
Sen. Ted Cruz: Nothing   Nothing. Nothing has been done, or even attempted by these men. Over the years, I have petitioned my representatives, I have donated money, I have written articles and I have voted to enact common-sense gun regulation. That's a hell of a lot more than my elected officials have done. They have done nothing. Absolutely nothing. So here we are, once again. Senseless, horrific violence facing us, and once again, we will do nothing. I can only hope that Cruz, Cornyn and McCaul have deep difficultly sleeping at night, wrestling with the guilt that their continued inaction has contributed to the slaughter of 26 Texans, while they sit idly by, doing nothing.

              since Hundreds of victims of the October 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas filed five lawsuits on Monday in a California court against the operators of the hotel from which the gunman fired, the organizers of the country music festival he targeted, and the killer’s estate. The largest of the lawsuits was filed on behalf of 450 people who either were injured in or witnessed the shooting, while the other four were brought by families of people who were killed or severely injured. All five cases were filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Muhammad Aziz, a Houston-based lawyer heading the lawsuits, said they were filed in California because nearly all the plaintiffs were from the state and had been treated there. He noted that Live Nation Entertainment Inc., the event organizer, was a California-based company. Stephen Paddock, 64, fired into the crowd gathered for the Route 91 Harvest Festival from a 32nd-floor hotel suite at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas on October 1, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more, the worst mass shooting in modern US history. Paddock also killed himself. The victims accused the hotel operator MGM Resorts International and its subsidiary Mandalay Corp., which owns the hotel, of failing to properly monitor Paddock's activities, train staff members, and employ adequate security measures. The festivalgoers also accused Live Nation of being negligent, saying it failed to provide adequate exits and properly train staff members for an emergency. Several lawsuits have previously been filed in the shooting, mostly in Nevada state court. One of those filed Monday was brought by a college student named Paige Gasper, who brought the first lawsuit over the mass shooting. Gasper voluntarily dismissed the Nevada lawsuit on Friday. Live Nation and MGM did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The companies have previously declined to comment on lawsuits. Plaintiffs also sued the shooter's estate for battery and assault. The reportedly wealthy shooter is thought to have had multimillion-dollar real-estate investments across Texas and California. A court hearing about who will be appointed to administer Paddock's estate is set for December 7. Slide Fire Solutions, the maker of the so-called bump-stock device Paddock used to achieve a near-automatic rate of fire, was named in previous lawsuits over the shooting but not in any of the suits filed Monday. Aziz said Slide Fire was not named because most of his clients supported the right to bear arms. ""We want to focus on hotel and venue security, not turn this into a gun-rights case,"" he said.

http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/11/nj_moves_closer_to_banning_this_gun_accessory_used.html,"A ""bump stock"" is shown attached to a semi-automatic rifle.(Rick Bowmer | The Associated Press) New Jersey on Thursday got one step closer to banning a firearms accessory allegedly used by the gunman in the Las Vegas mass shooting. The state Assembly's law and public safety committee voted 8-0, with one abstention, to advance a Democrat-sponsored bill that would prohibit the sale and possession of ""bump stocks"" in the state. Bump stocks can be affixed to semiautomatic riffles to allow them to fire bullets more rapidly, mimicking automatic weapons, which are mostly illegal in the U.S. A fierce national debate over the accessory emerged in the wake of the Las Vegas massacre. The gunman had 12 of the devices in his hotel room, allegedly helping him to kill 58 people and injure 500 more in a matter of minutes. WHAT THE BILL WOULD DO: The legislation (S3477/A5200) would prohibit the sale and possession of bump stocks in New Jersey and set up criminal penalties for those who violate the ban. Violators could face three to five years in prison, a fine of up to $15,000, or both. WHAT PROPONENTS SAY: Sponsors of the bill say there's no need for anyone in New Jersey to be able to mimic automatic fire. ""Our law enforcement officials and residents will be in greater danger if they are allowed in New Jersey,"" Assemblywoman Annette Quijano, D-Union -- a sponsor -- said Thursday. Dolores Phillips, legislative director for gun-control group Ceasefire New Jersey, added: ""We are not under any illusion this bill will solve mass shootings. But it's a step forward."" WHAT OPPONENTS SAY: The biggest argument is that bump stocks are already technically illegal to use in New Jersey. While you're permitted to sell, buy, and own them, state law prohibits people from possessing them if they are used on a firearm or in the vicinity of a firearm. ""There really isn't a whole lot for this bill to do,"" Rob Nixon of the Association of New Jersey Rifle and Pistol Clubs said Thursday. ""This isn't really a New Jersey-related issue."" This measure would create an outright ban on the accessories and make it a third-degree crime with specific punishments. Alexander Roubian, president of the New Jersey Second Amendment Society, added that people can still use 3D printers to create their own bump stocks. ""It's grandstanding on the issue,"" Roubian said of the bill. THE VOTE: All six Democrats on the panel voted in favor Thursday. Two of the three Republicans voted yes: Michael Patrick Carroll of Morris County and Edward Thomson of Monmouth County. Republican Erik Peterson of Hunterdon County abstained. WHAT'S NEXT: For the bill to become law, the full Assembly and state Senate -- both of which are controlled by Democrats -- must pass it and the governor must sign it. Republican Chris Christie will be governor until Jan. 16. He has often opposed new gun laws in the state, but he said last month he'd be open to ""further regulations"" on bump stocks, noting that ""it's an accessory ... not a gun. It's not an infringement on anybody's Second Amendment rights."" Brent Johnson may be reached at bjohnson@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @johnsb01. Find NJ.com Politics on Facebook.

https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2017/11/07/can-gun-violence-scream-least-scream,"By Andrew M. Paley|Contributor 5:58 AM on Nov 7, 2017 CST When is enough, enough? I have been asking myself this question, in some form or another, for the past 30 years. ""Surely,"" I say to myself, ""this time will be the one that makes a difference."" And then, again, I am soundly disappointed. My heart barely had time to take a first healing breath after the devastation of the mass murder in Las Vegas, when another shooting, this time at another church, took place, where 26 more people were senselessly murdered. When will it stop? Since 1982, there have been 95 mass shootings in the U.S. resulting in 706 fatalities and 684 injuries, according to a report by Mother Jones. What is the threshold for action to prevent more casualties? I actually believed that shootings at schools would prompt a national outrage and mobilize our American exceptionalism to solve a public health problem. But then I discovered that since 1966, the first school mass shooting at the University of Texas, there have been 19 mass shootings at schools; 145 people have been killed and 181 injured. The three biggest; Columbine High School — 13 killed, 24 injured; Virginia Tech — 32 killed, 23 injured; Sandy Hook Elementary — 27 killed, two injured. Workplace shootings, military base shootings, church shootings and even school shootings are no longer a surprise. Even when more than 58 people are killed and almost 500 injured in Las Vegas, that doesn't seem to surprise us, either. What must happen to shock our sensibilities? In response to these events, we cry, we mourn, we protest, we write letters, we call our elected officials, we worship and we send the ubiquitous, ""prayers of our hearts"" to those we feel are in need. And yet, nothing seems to change. I feel numb, frustrated, impotent and exhausted. Most often, I cry in the anguish of my heart, feeling the sadness of the loss and feeling even sadder that I am so familiar with that feeling. While sadness and frustration might be quick to overtake us, I am reminded of the teaching by Rabbi Jeffrey Salkin, who explains the powerful Jewish response to these moments of tragedy. When a death occurs, we tear our clothes — a physical response to the anger and sadness we feel. And then, we scream, as the biblical characters did when confronting the tragedies of their lives. Esau, Jacob, the Israelites — all let out the deepest wailings in their hearts, hoping that someone would listen, hoping that something would change. Elie Wiesel told the story of a righteous man who came to Sodom and Gomorrah and pleaded with the people to change their ways. No one listened. Finally, he sat in the middle of the city and simply screamed. Someone asked him, ""Do you think that will change anyone?"" ""No,"" said the righteous man. ""But at least, they will not change me."" In the face of these ever-unfolding tragedies, we cannot give up on our sacred task to scream until something changes. We cannot allow the numbness to overtake us, robbing us of our basic humanity. Enough is enough. I hope you will join with me to write letters, to protest, to pray, to cry, to mourn and continue to send prayers of hope and healing to all who have been affected by gun violence. Most of all, I hope you will join with me as we scream until someone takes notice. We will not be changed into an uncaring community. Not now, not ever. Andrew M.

https://www.inquisitr.com/4603076/chelsea-handler-blames-republicans-for-texas-church-shooting/,"Chelsea Handler blamed Republicans for the south Texas church shooting which left more than 20 people dead, according to Fox News. Many details about the massacre and the gunman's identity were still unclear after the deadly mass shooting. Following her comments, Handler received some major backlash. The liberal comedian, who hosts a talk show on Netflix, was assumed to be referring to Republican support for the Second Amendment and opposition to gun-control legislation. The former Chelsea host has gone after the GOP before on issues surrounding gun control.  Chelsea Handler's comments received criticism throughout social media. Many chastised the star for politicizing the event while it was ongoing. One Twitter user wrote, ""Does your career depend on you being a vile, callous person, or is that a personal choice?"" While another commented, ""You are a terrible human being,"" and another added, ""Are you really that ignorant?""  Chelsea also went after President Donald Trump after he tweeted, ""May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan."" The comedian responded in a negative manner to Trump by saying, ""You have no capacity to monitor anything that doesn't involve lining your pockets.""

http://www.ocregister.com/2017/11/14/how-to-fight-extremist-hate-and-violence-start-by-pulling-out-politics-experts-say/,"Trending: LOS ANGELES — Removing polarization and politics from the conversation might be the key to stopping homegrown violent extremism, experts said Tuesday, Nov. 14, as they attempted to deconstruct a problem that has flummoxed cities and nations around the world. “The extremist mindset is all about positing superiority over another,” said Sasha Havlicek, director of the London-based Institute of Strategic Dialogue, speaking at the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy’s Global Summit on Homegrown Violent Extremism. “The ‘othering’ of people, the dehumanizing of groups of people, is the precursor to mass murder and turns mentally able people into killers.” While governments and non-governmental organizations have tried programs to counter violent extremism, experts view such efforts as a narrow approach to a much larger problem. “People don’t start out as lone wolves, they start out angry and bitter,” said Tony McAleer, co-founder of Life After Hate, a support group for former extremists. Before he started working to pull people away from violence, McAleer was a skinhead recruiter and manager of a white supremacist rock band, Odin’s Law. McAleer compared himself to Dylann Roof, the self-proclaimed neo-Nazi who in 2015 gunned down nine people at the Emmanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., ostensibly to start a race war. “He had rage, which is a big part of the radicalization process,” McAleer said. “He found an ideology that gave him justification, which is what I did.” Dehumanizing others is also one of the first baby steps extremists take, McAleer said. “But it’s important to understand that we dehumanize others because we feel dehumanized ourselves,” he said. “In the neo-Nazi movement, I found power where I was powerless and found acceptance where there was none.” What’s even more frightening in today’s world is the mainstreaming of extremism, said Havlicek, whose organization partners with the Newport Beach Gen Next Foundation, a group of entrepreneurs who help connect grass-roots organizations with resources that provide alternative ideas for people who might be susceptible to radicalization. “Different variants of these extremist ideologies are on the rise and playing a symbiotic role with each other,” Havlicek said. “For example, the Islamist and far-right extremists are wonderfully mobilizing each other’s fan bases.” She noted that the far right has started to use terms such as “white jihad,” which mirrors the terminology favored by people in Islamist jihad or “holy war.” Experts at USC also spent time discussing the differences between a “terrorist attack” and a “mass shooting.” “If there is no clear ideology at work, I’m not counting those as homegrown terrorism,” said Erroll Southers, a former FBI agent and director of Homegrown Violent Extremism Studies at USC’s Safe Communities Institute. But Southers noted that the nearly three out of four deadly extremist attacks in the United States since Sept. 11, 2001, have been perpetrated by white supremacists. The Trump administration’s version of the Countering Violent Extremism program, which has been widely criticized for its focus on Islamist extremism, won’t help address the issue of radicalization, some experts said. “If you use the words ‘radical Islamic extremism,’ you’ve lost me and you’ve lost my community,” said Mohamed Amin Ahmed, a Somali refugee who founded Average Mohamed, an organization that promotes counterterrorism through cartoons and by speaking directly to Muslim youths. Ahmed says when he speaks to young people, he uses the word “intolerance” instead of “terrorism.” “Our children are fatigued by that word,” Ahmed said. “As soon as I say it they think ‘he’s going to tell us we’re bad people.’ ” But Ahmed also emphasized that government has an important role to play in countering extremism, especially when it comes to providing resources to grass-roots organizations such as his and to help them “scale up” their message. Southers suggested there is no single solution to homegrown extremism and the violence it often inflicts. “We cannot arrest our way out of this problem,” he said. “The successful programs, in countries like Germany and the United Kingdom, involve a range of approaches, from prosecution to counseling and everything in between. It depends on where the individual is on the radicalization pathway. Can we involve that person’s family members, friends or co-workers? Can we counsel them out of this mindset?” Get the latest news delivered daily! We invite you to use our commenting platform to engage in insightful conversations about issues in our community.

http://rssfeeds.cincinnati.com/~/486951394/0/cincinnati-home~Sutherland-Springs-church-shooting-What-we-know-now/,"A gunman opened fire Sunday at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas, in a rural area outside of San Antonio. Here's what we know: Some key points: Of the 26 people killed, 23 died inside the church, two were killed outside the church and another victim was transported to a hospital and died, Martin said. More: Explore the data: U.S. mass killings since 2006 Sheriff Joe Tackitt of Wilson County, where Sutherland Springs is located, told the USA TODAY Network that 12 to 14 children were among the victims. When asked whether he expects the death toll to rise, Tackitt said he believes most of the people at the hospital are in stable condition. “It’s just a horrific sight,” Tackitt said of the scene inside the church. “You don’t expect to walk into a church and see something like that, especially when all the bodies were there, and seeing the children. That’s what hurts the most.”  Suspect in Sutherland Springs shooting confirmed to be Devin Patrick Kelley, 26, of New Braunfels, TX. More info to be released later today. Kelley was dressed in black and wore a mask and ballistic vest, Martin said. He began firing outside the church and then entered the building and continued spraying bullets. As he left the church, a local resident with a rifle confronted the gunman, who dropped his Ruger AR assault-type rifle and fled.  The killer was pursued by residents for about 12 miles at speeds of up to 95 mph before he crashed his vehicle. Sheriff Tackitt said Kelley died from a self-inflicted gunshot. Martin described the tragedy as possibly arising from a ""domestic situation"" involving the shooter's mother-in-law, a congregant at the church. He said the in-laws were not present at the time of the massacre, but came to the church after hearing about the shooting.  Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek told USA TODAY that Kelley served in the 49th Logistics Readiness Squadron at Holloman Air Force Base in southern New Mexico from 2010 until he was discharged. Kelley was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his spouse and their child. He received a bad-conduct discharge, was confined for 12 months and busted to the grade of E-1. He was discharged in 2014. Annabelle Renee Pomeroy, the 14-year-old daughter of the church's pastor, Frank Pomeroy, was one of the victims. She was remembered as ""a beautiful child"" by Pomeroy. He his wife were out of town when the rampage took place. Also among those killed: Eight members of one family spanning three generations — including a mother who was eight months pregnant — and a visiting pastor who was about to address the church.      President Trump tweeted from Japan: ""May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan."" May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan. Trump has been briefed several times about the tragic shooting and continues to receive regular updates, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. Trump also spoke with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, she said. In a news conference with  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, Trump said Monday that better mental health care — not gun control — is the key to understanding the mass shooting. ""This isn't a guns situation,” he said. More: Trump: 'Mental health' is the issue behind the Texas shooting, not guns Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, tweeted that he spoke with to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott about the ""horrific shooting,"" and that state and federal law enforcement were working closely. ""Prayers for all harmed. Truly evil,"" Cruz said. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., tweeted that prayers are not enough. ""After another unspeakable tragedy, Congress must act — or be complicit,"" he said.

              since Hours after a gunman killed more than 20 people in a Texas church, Sen. Chris Murphy issued a scathing statement blasting his colleagues in Congress for accepting money from gun lobbyists and what Murphy said was not doing enough to prevent the attack. ""The paralysis you feel right now — the impotent helplessness that washes over you as news of another mass slaughter scrolls across the television screen — isn't real,"" Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, said in the statement. ""It's a fiction created and methodically cultivated by the gun lobby, designed to assure that no laws are passed to make America safer, because those laws would cut into their profits."" He continued: ""As my colleagues go to sleep tonight, they need to think about whether the political support of the gun industry is worth the blood that flows endlessly onto the floors of American churches, elementary schools, movie theaters, and city streets. ""Ask yourself — how can you claim that you respect human life while choosing fealty to weapons-makers over support for measures favored by the vast majority of your constituents,"" he said. Murphy is one of the Democratic Party's most outspoken proponents of preventing gun violence. Before he was a senator, he represented a district that includes Newtown, Connecticut, where a 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School left 26 people dead, including 20 children. He and other Democratic leaders have previously criticized Republican members of Congress for failing to pass gun-control legislation after mass shootings. In his statement, Murphy mentioned several other recent shootings in the US, including those in Las Vegas last month, at Pulse nightclub in Orlando last year, and at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. ""The terrifying fact is that no one is safe so long as Congress chooses to do absolutely nothing in the face of this epidemic,"" Murphy said. ""The time is now for Congress to shed its cowardly cover and do something."" ""The paralysis you feel right now — the impotent helplessness that washes over you as news of another mass slaughter scrolls across the television screen — isn't real. It's a fiction created and methodically cultivated by the gun lobby, designed to assure that no laws are passed to make America safer, because those laws would cut into their profits. My heart sunk to the pit of my stomach, once again, when I heard of today's shooting in Texas. My heart dropped further when I thought about the growing macabre club of families in Las Vegas and Orlando and Charleston and Newtown, who have to relive their own day of horror every time another mass killing occurs. ""None of this is inevitable. I know this because no other country endures this pace of mass carnage like America. It is uniquely and tragically American. As long as our nation chooses to flood the county with dangerous weapons and consciously let those weapons fall into the hands of dangerous people, these killings will not abate. ""As my colleagues go to sleep tonight, they need to think about whether the political support of the gun industry is worth the blood that flows endlessly onto the floors of American churches, elementary schools, movie theaters, and city streets. Ask yourself — how can you claim that you respect human life while choosing fealty to weapons-makers over support for measures favored by the vast majority of your constituents. ""My heart breaks for Sutherland Springs. Just like it still does for Las Vegas. And Orlando. And Charleston. And Aurora. And Blacksburg. And Newtown. Just like it does every night for Chicago. And New Orleans. And Baltimore. And Bridgeport. The terrifying fact is that no one is safe so long as Congress chooses to do absolutely nothing in the face of this epidemic. The time is now for Congress to shed its cowardly cover and do something."" For you For you"
https://www.inquisitr.com/4627865/the-punisher-showrunner-talks-mass-shootings-effects-on-his-marvel-netflix-series/,"Initially, the Marvel Netflix series, The Punisher, had a planned surprise release in October, as well as a special screening of the first episode at the New York City Comic-Con event. Marvel and Netflix chose to postpone the debut and cancel the screening after the tragic shootings in Las Vegas. Now, one day before the official release of The Punisher Marvel Netflix series, Wired reported that showrunner Steve Lightfoot spoke out about the shootings taking place across the United States and the effects they have on his new comic book series.  Now, one month later, The Punisher hits Netflix as the seventh season of Marvel entertainment on the streaming service. This series follows The Defenders, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Jessica Jones and two seasons of Daredevil. The Punisher made his first appearance in the second season of Daredevil. However, The Punisher also comes out just two weeks after another senseless mass shooting where a man killed 26 people and wounded 20 more in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Fifty-eight people died with over 500 injured in the Las Vegas shooting last month. When asked if the shootings made it the wrong time to make a show like The Punisher, Steve Lightfoot said that these shootings never factored into the creation of the series. They began working on making the Marvel Netflix series last year, before the U.S. presidential election. In 2017, there is an average of one mass shooting every day in the United States; making it hard to find a time that is suitable to release a television show about the Marvel Comics character that has an arsenal of guns and kills his enemies.     Jon Bernthal was a little more to the point in an interview with the L.A. Times, Bernthal said that the series is not about the exploitation of gun violence in America. Instead, it is about Frank Castle, the man who is The Punisher, and how he deals with the ""unbelievable pain and... unbelievable cost to the violence that he's gone through in life."" Instead of a Marvel Netflix series about gun violence in America, Bernthal said that The Punisher is about how a person deals with personal pain. He also noted that The Punisher is not a hero, and if anyone looks at him as a hero, he has ""failed miserably"" in his job as an actor. [Featured Image by Netflix]"

https://www.inquisitr.com/4609017/jon-bernthal-finally-confirms-the-punisher-was-pushed-back-because-of-las-vegas-shooting/,"The Punisher star, Jon Bernthal, has finally confirmed the rumors: the series premiere was pushed back because of the Las Vegas shooting. The show's protagonist is a trigger-happy vigilante who uses high powered guns to exact his own brand of justice. Unfortunately, that description is very close to the profile of mass-shooters, so a premiere so close to the Vegas tragedy seemed disrespectful to the victims. ""We put the premiere of this show off because of the tragedy that happened in Las Vegas. We did that out of respect. I think it was the right decision,"" Bernthal said in an interview with Indiewire. On October 1, a gunman opened fire at a country music concert at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival on the Las Vegas strip. The attack left 48 dead and 546 people wounded. As Indie Wire notes, at the time The Punisher's premiere date had not been announced. However, the cast had been scheduled to appear on a panel at New York City Comic-Con. In light of the Vegas incident, the panel was cancelled. Then Netflix announced that the premiere would happen on November 17 with a red-carpet event scheduled for November 6. But another mass shooting has taken place before the premiere. This time it happened on Sunday November 5 at a church in Texas. Twenty-six people were killed.  Will you be binge-watching The Punisher? Or do you think it's not the right show for America's current political climate? [Featured Image by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images]"

http://www.nationalmemo.com/texas-governor-mass-shootings-nra/,"Reprinted with permission from Alternet. The day after a gunman massacred 26 churchgoers in his home state, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said, when asked during a televised interview how America might stop the regularity of mass shootings, “You do that by working with God.” It’s interesting that Abbott can’t seem to think of anyone else who can work on reducing gun violence in this country, especially since God’s collaboration has yielded such poor results so far. Abbott is no stranger to collaborating with real, live, terrestrial humans in and out of politics to achieve legislative goals. He worked with his “blood brother” Ted Nugent, the openly racist author of songs about sex with 13-year-old girls, on his gubernatorial election campaign. He worked with North Carolina ex-governor Pat McCrory to scaremonger about transgender people’s right to go to the nearest bathroom. For quite a long time, Abbott has worked with Big Oil and Gas—huge spenders on his campaigns—to deregulate both industries, prohibit local fracking bans and ignore impending dangers of climate change such as Hurricane Harvey. He has also worked tirelessly with, and on behalf of the NRA to oppose anything remotely approximating even the most benign gun control. Partnership is a thing Abbott is totally familiar with. So when he—and the entire GOP—pretends he doesn’t have the faintest idea of how we might start tackling this mass shooting issue, it sounds like the gigantic lie that it is. Abbott has done nothing but bolster the gun lobby’s efforts since he entered politics, dating back to when he was Texas attorney general, and he has done so without shame or compunction. So as the governor acts confused and regurgitates NRA lines about “evil” (but not “terror”; that’s saved for when the attacker is brown) let’s look back at eight times Abbott helped push the NRA agenda. 1. He cynically exploited children murdered at Sandy Hook to further his pro-gun agenda. After 20 children and eight adults were killed in the mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, legislators in New York decided to take the obvious and rational step of passing gun control legislation. In response, Abbott bought up Google ads targeting New Yorkers and encouraging them to move to nearly gun-law-bereft Texas. “Wanted: Law abiding New York gun owners looking for lower taxes and greater opportunity,” read one ad, according to the Austin-American Statesman. “Is Gov. Cuomo looking to take your guns? Sick of the media outing law abiding gun owns? Are you a lawful NY gun owner seeking lower taxes?” another asked. “Here in Texas, you will have the liberty and the opportunity to achieve your dreams,” the ad continued. “You’ll also get to keep more of what you earn and use some of that extra money to buy more ammo. I hope to see you soon in Texas. In the meantime, sign up to show your support for our second amendment rights.” 2. Joked about shooting reporters. As part of a statewide legislative effort that trades NRA dollars for the endangerment of lives, Abbott signed a bill in May that significantly makes gun licenses cheaper. According to the Texas Tribune, the law “reduces the first-time fee for a license to carry from $140 to $40 and the renewal fee from $70 to $40.” The bill signing was held at an actual shooting range, which is like pistol-whipping us all with overt symbolism. Afterwards, Abbott proved that while he loves the Second Amendment, he’s not so keen on the First. “I’m gonna carry this around in case I see any reporters,” the governor “joked.” The incredibly unfunny remark came just days after another Republican politician body slammed a reporter, which only upped his favorables with the GOP base. Abbott later tweeted a photo of himself “celebrating” the bill’s passage by firing a gun at human-like shapes. 3. Suggested America needs more Bibles and guns. Back when he was still attorney general, but gearing up his pandering machine for a gubernatorial run, Abbott posted this ridiculous ad on his Facebook page. Aside from being wrong in a way that somehow manages to embody everything wrong with this country, it also manages to flub basic grammar rules. Just sayin’. 4. Was ’embarrassed’ Texas was second in gun sales. In 2015, Abbott tweeted this (it turns out, erroneous) article claiming that Texas was second to California in background check requests for new gun purchases. Along with the link, Abbott wrote, “I’m EMBARRASSED: Texas #2 in nation for new gun purchases, behind CALIFORNIA. Let’s pick up the pace Texans. @NRA blog.chron.com/narcoconfident…” The message includes a shoutout to the NRA, because passing laws to put guns in the hands of every Texas man, woman and child isn’t enough, apparently. When the NRA buys a politician, they want a little something extra to show for their money. 5. Expanded open-carry, made it easier for mass shootings to take place on college campuses. During another dignified bill signing held at a shooting range (you know, just like the Founding Fathers envisioned), Abbott passed two pro-gun laws in a single sitting. The first bill allowed licensed gun owners to openly carry their weapons. The second helped ensure that Texas college students will forever have to worry that being shot on campus is a distinct possibility. “I don’t think there are any groups in this state—or in this nation—who worked as profoundly to ensure that the Constitution is lived up to,” Abbott said of his masters at the NRA. 6. Proudly used social media to announce you can be shot at any moment in Texas. 7. Also used social media for this kind of toxic ammosexual macho posturing (and conspiracy mongering) because President Obama proposed we consider reducing the number of killing machines in this country. 8. Actively stopped a Texas county from trying to keep guns out. The Center for American Progress recounts this story from Abbott’s days as Texas Attorney General, when he made it impossible for a county to implement commonsense protections against gun violence. Travis County, Texas was recently considering a proposal to keep gun shows out of county-owned facilities such as the convention center in Austin. A concerned citizen had warned the county commissioners in December 2012 that more guns could flood the area due to the “gun show loophole,” which allows purchasers of guns at gun shows to avoid federally mandated background checks. Abbott warned the county to “be ready for a double-barreled lawsuit” if they declined to host the gun shows, so the county backed off; the Austin convention center hosted the first of a series of gun shows on January 26, 2013. And this: Abbott also spearheaded an amicus brief on behalf of dozens of state attorneys general in McDonald v. Chicago, a case in which the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Chicago’s law banning handguns. Kali Holloway is a senior writer and the associate editor of media and culture at AlterNet. Know first.

WEBER and EMILY SCHMAL The Associated Press SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas — The Texas church where more than two dozen people were killed by a gunman during Sunday services will be demolished, the pastor said. Pastor Frank Pomeroy told leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention earlier this week that it would be too painful to continue using First Baptist Church as a place of worship. Pomeroy discussed the plan with the denomination’s top executives, who traveled to the rural community in a show of support, a national Southern Baptist spokesman said. The pastor described the building as “too stark of a reminder” of the massacre, spokesman Sing Oldham said. Pomeroy expressed hope he could turn the site into a memorial for the dead and put up a new building on property the church owns, Oldham said. Charlene Uhl, mother of 16-year-old Haley Krueger, who died in the attack, agreed that the church should come down. “There should still be church but not here,” she said Thursday as she visited a row of white crosses commemorating the victims in front of the church. She said her daughter attended worship services and a weekly Thursday night youth group meeting held by another victim, Karla Holcombe. Jeannie Brown, visiting from Indiana, stopped at the site with her daughter, who used to live in Sutherland Springs but left decades ago for San Antonio. Asked whether the church should be destroyed, Brown said: “Yes. Who would want to go back in there? But then if it is destroyed, does that mean he (the gunman) won?” Other sites of mass shootings have been torn down, including Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, where a gunman killed 20 children and six adults in December 2012. A new school was built elsewhere. A one-room Amish schoolhouse near Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was torn down in 2006, 10 days after an assailant took children hostage and shot and killed five girls ages 6 to 13. The previous site of the school is now a pasture. A nearly identical schoolhouse with a security fence was erected nearby and named New Hope School. The father of the gunman broke the family’s silence and said his relatives are grieving. Michael Kelley spoke to ABC News on Wednesday from his home in New Braunfels, about 35 miles  north of Sutherland Springs. He said he does not doesn’t want the “media circus” surrounding the attack by Devin Patrick Kelley to destroy “our lives, our grandchildren’s lives.” A motive remains unclear, but the younger Kelley appears to have targeted the church because it was attended by his wife’s family. He died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after being shot and chased by two residents when he was leaving the church, authorities said. On Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence joined Texas Gov. Greg Abbott at a memorial service for the victims of the gunman. Pence told the crowd that the attack was the worst mass shooting at a church in American history and called the gunman “deranged.” “Whatever animated the evil that descended on that small church, if the attacker’s desire was to silence their testimony of faith, they failed,” the vice president added. Pence also visited with wounded congregants at a San Antonio hospital and met with families of the dead in Floresville, not far from Sutherland Springs. He went from table to table at a high school library, attempting to console devastated family members. “The whole country is praying over you,” he told one man who lost his sister-in-law. Earlier Wednesday, Pence said President Donald Trump had ordered federal agencies to provide extensive help to the investigation, including 100 on-site FBI agents. The Texas Department of Public Safety has released an official list of those killed in the rampage. The eight male victims and 17 female victims ranged in age from 1 to 77. Authorities said the 26 dead also included the unborn baby of a woman who was killed. All the victims died at the scene, except for one child who died at a hospital. Eleven people remained hospitalized Thursday with wounds they suffered in the attack.

https://www.thewrap.com/hbo-executive-nancy-lesser-sues-tv-academy/,"Nancy Lesser seeks upward of $1 million Nancy Lesser/Getty Images HBO executive vice president of media and talent Nancy Lesser filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against the Television Academy over a fall she suffered at the 2016 Emmy Awards. Lesser says in the suit, which was filed in L.A. Superior Court, that adequate and safe exits were not set up for the Emmys at the Microsoft Theater. Her fall caused her to miss the HBO after-party and take an eight month leave to recover, according to the filing. The suit names the Television Academy, the City of Los Angeles and Anshutz Entertainment as defendants in the case, stating the organizations should have known from past experience leaving the show would be “throng-like” for guests, “which would create extreme congestion and severely diminish any forward visibility and certainly diminish and preclude visibility of conditions that may exist on the walkway itself.” Also Read: HBO Hacker Charged Over $6 Million Extortion Attempt, 'Game of Thrones' Script Leak Also Read: HBO Hacker Charged Over $6 Million Extortion Attempt, 'Game of Thrones' Script Leak The HBO exec said in the suit that because of “the fashion of the day” and women wearing high heels, the “entire walkway area should be properly illuminated to give the best visibility to all of the attendees and other persons using the walkway to which they were directed to go to the Governor’s Ball or the celebrity and limousine parking.” Lesser described not being able to see a dirt cut-out in concrete when she tried to leave via a side exit to avoid the “throng” of people leaving by the red carpet. “These concrete cut-outs were with dirt and trees, the poor lighting of the area and the creation of a throng of people overloading the walkway that attendees were directed to were each a dangerous condition created by defendants and each by themselves, and together, caused the plaintiff’s accident to occur,” the lawsuit reads. She ended up falling backwards and injuring her right hip, causing her to miss HBO’s large after-party, which she coordinated, according to the lawsuit. Lesser spent two weeks at Cedars-Sinai hospital and needed 24 hour care preventing her from her work at HBO, it went on to say. Lesser is suing for negligence and is seeking upward of $1 million in damages to cover her medical costs. 14 Shows Delayed or Changed Because of Real-World Violence, From 'Mr Robot' to 'Heathers' (Photos)






It's a drastic step when a television network changes its programming in the wake of a national tragedy. But nowadays it's all too common to see a show pulled, delayed, or even changed out of sensitivity for current events. In the wake of the recent massacre in Las Vegas that left nearly 60 dead and hundreds more injured, FX has a scheduled episode of ""American Horror Story"" that features a mass shooting set to air Oct. 10. Will the network make changes around the episode? Here TheWrap recalls 12 other shows that have altered programming in the face of real-world violence.






40th Annual Academy Awards  
The awards show was originally scheduled for April 8, 1968, but was postponed two days out of respect for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,  who was assassinated four days earlier. A number of attendees, including Sidney Poitier and Sammy Davis Jr., planned to attend the slain civil rights leader's funeral -- held on the same day as the original Oscars date -- and had said they wouldn't attend the awards show.

""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""  
The Joss Whedon supernatural drama was affected not once but twice by real world events, specifically the Columbine massacre. The show's third season had two episodes that featured school violence. One, called ""Earshot,"" featured a plot concerning a student who goes to the top of a tower with a rifle. It was set to run a week after Columbine, but was pulled and postponed.
Wb





""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""  
The Season 3 finale ""Graduation Day, Part Two"" also featured violence on school grounds. Specifically (and spoilers for a nearly 20-year-old episode), the school is destroyed. Two hours before it was set to air, the WB postponed the episode, fearing fallout from Columbine. The finale's airing was delayed for two months, but fans were furious about the decision and the network ended up posting it online.
WB





53rd Annual Emmy Awards  
That year's Primetime Emmys were set to air on Sept. 16, 2001, but the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 caused it to be postponed. The awards were postponed a second time after the U.S. launched airstrikes against Afghanistan. The ceremony was eventually held in November, with Ellen Degeneres hosting, but it still marks the first and only time a major awards show had to be postponed twice.

""Friends""  
In the Season 8 episode ""The One Where Rachel Tells..."" a scene that originally had Chandler joking about a bomb in an airport -- leading to him and Monica getting detained -- was changed following Sept. 11. The scene was reshot with Monica complaining about another newlywed couple that got perks.

""Hannibal""  
The Bryan Fuller series about Hannibal Lecter never shied away from gore and viscera, but the show's fourth episode, ""Oeuf"" was pulled completely from the airwaves. The plot revolved around a woman who was brainwashing children to kill their families. While the episode was set to air in April 2013 -- four months after the Sandy Hook shooting -- NBC delayed airing it indefinitely due to the subject matter. The episode has never aired.
NBC





""Castle""  
""Castle"" made a small change following the Boston Marathon bombings in April 2013 since the episode ""Still"" involves the team looking and trying to dismantle a time sensitive bomb. It was eventually switched with the next episode in the lineup, delaying its airing by one week.
ABC





""The Cosby Show""  
When the Bill Cosby sexual assault scandal hit a peak in 2015, many networks and people moved quickly to separate themselves from the comedian. This included TV Land, BET, Bounce TV and other networks refusing to air reruns of his sitcom ""The Cosby Show."" However, the real loss was from NBC, which decided to cancel plans to develop a new Cosby show.

""19 Kids and Counting""  
Josh Duggar, the eldest of the titular 19 kids, became the focus of a sexual molestation scandal. However, TLC took a few weeks to issue a decision on the reality show's fate. The network eventually decided to cancel the show.
TLC





""Mr. Robot""  
The Season 1 finale of USA Network's hacker thriller had to be postponed because it contained a scene similar to the events that occurred on the same day. In Roanoke, Va. on Aug. 26, 2015, a former reporter killed two of his colleagues live on air. The shooter died from self-inflicted gunshot wounds. In the ""Mr. Robot"" finale, somebody commits suicide during a broadcast. USA aired the episode the following week.
USA Network





""Documentary Now!""  
An episode of the IFC mockumentary series starring Bill Hader and Fred Armisen was also postponed due to the Roanoke shootings. ""Dronez: The Hunt for El Chingon,"" was about two journalists who decide to track a notorious drug kingpin despite safety concerns. The episode was replaced with ""Kunuk"" and aired it a week later.
IFC





""The Last Ship""  
The Season 3 premiere of ""The Last Ship"" was postponed following the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando. The episode featured a shooting at a Vietnamese nightclub.
TNT





""Shooter""  
USA Network shelved the 2017 series premiere of its Ryan Phillippe-led sniper series ""Shooter"" for a number of months following a mass shooting in Dallas, Texas, which saw 12 police officers and two civilians shot by a sniper during an otherwise peaceful protest.

""Heathers"" 
The Paramount Network delayed the launch of its 2018 sitcom based on the 1998 high school-set dark comedy ""out of respect"" for the victims of the deadly mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida. The original film featured multiple high schoolers killing themselves and each other.
Paramount Network





""Alternatino with Arturo Castro""
The Comedy Central sketch show's seventh episode featured a sketch about mass shootings, and was pulled after a gunman killed three people at a garlic festival in Northern California two days before it was scheduled to air. In the sketch, Castro played a Guatemalan immigrant who is confused by the prevalence of gun violence in the United States. The network originally planned to play the episode one week later, on August 6, but after mass shootings in Texas and Ohio killed 30 people on August 3 and 4, it is possible that the episode will be postponed again.

""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" The Joss Whedon supernatural drama was affected not once but twice by real world events, specifically the Columbine massacre. The show's third season had two episodes that featured school violence. One, called ""Earshot,"" featured a plot concerning a student who goes to the top of a tower with a rifle. It was set to run a week after Columbine, but was pulled and postponed. ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" The Season 3 finale ""Graduation Day, Part Two"" also featured violence on school grounds. Specifically (and spoilers for a nearly 20-year-old episode), the school is destroyed. Two hours before it was set to air, the WB postponed the episode, fearing fallout from Columbine. The finale's airing was delayed for two months, but fans were furious about the decision and the network ended up posting it online. 53rd Annual Emmy Awards That year's Primetime Emmys were set to air on Sept. 16, 2001, but the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 caused it to be postponed. The awards were postponed a second time after the U.S. launched airstrikes against Afghanistan. The ceremony was eventually held in November, with Ellen Degeneres hosting, but it still marks the first and only time a major awards show had to be postponed twice. ""Friends"" In the Season 8 episode ""The One Where Rachel Tells..."" a scene that originally had Chandler joking about a bomb in an airport -- leading to him and Monica getting detained -- was changed following Sept. 11. The scene was reshot with Monica complaining about another newlywed couple that got perks. ""Hannibal"" The Bryan Fuller series about Hannibal Lecter never shied away from gore and viscera, but the show's fourth episode, ""Oeuf"" was pulled completely from the airwaves. The plot revolved around a woman who was brainwashing children to kill their families. While the episode was set to air in April 2013 -- four months after the Sandy Hook shooting -- NBC delayed airing it indefinitely due to the subject matter. The episode has never aired. ""Castle"" ""Castle"" made a small change following the Boston Marathon bombings in April 2013 since the episode ""Still"" involves the team looking and trying to dismantle a time sensitive bomb. It was eventually switched with the next episode in the lineup, delaying its airing by one week. ""The Cosby Show"" When the Bill Cosby sexual assault scandal hit a peak in 2015, many networks and people moved quickly to separate themselves from the comedian. This included TV Land, BET, Bounce TV and other networks refusing to air reruns of his sitcom ""The Cosby Show."" However, the real loss was from NBC, which decided to cancel plans to develop a new Cosby show. ""19 Kids and Counting"" Josh Duggar, the eldest of the titular 19 kids, became the focus of a sexual molestation scandal. However, TLC took a few weeks to issue a decision on the reality show's fate. The network eventually decided to cancel the show. ""Mr. Robot"" The Season 1 finale of USA Network's hacker thriller had to be postponed because it contained a scene similar to the events that occurred on the same day. In Roanoke, Va. on Aug. 26, 2015, a former reporter killed two of his colleagues live on air. The shooter died from self-inflicted gunshot wounds. In the ""Mr. Robot"" finale, somebody commits suicide during a broadcast. USA aired the episode the following week. ""Documentary Now!"" An episode of the IFC mockumentary series starring Bill Hader and Fred Armisen was also postponed due to the Roanoke shootings. ""Dronez: The Hunt for El Chingon,"" was about two journalists who decide to track a notorious drug kingpin despite safety concerns. The episode was replaced with ""Kunuk"" and aired it a week later. ""The Last Ship"" The Season 3 premiere of ""The Last Ship"" was postponed following the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando. The episode featured a shooting at a Vietnamese nightclub. ""Shooter"" USA Network shelved the 2017 series premiere of its Ryan Phillippe-led sniper series ""Shooter"" for a number of months following a mass shooting in Dallas, Texas, which saw 12 police officers and two civilians shot by a sniper during an otherwise peaceful protest.

Next Week’s ‘American Horror Story’ Opens With Mass Shooting, FX Silent on Plans ""Heathers"" The Paramount Network delayed the launch of its 2018 sitcom based on the 1998 high school-set dark comedy ""out of respect"" for the victims of the deadly mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida. The original film featured multiple high schoolers killing themselves and each other. ""Alternatino with Arturo Castro"" The Comedy Central sketch show's seventh episode featured a sketch about mass shootings, and was pulled after a gunman killed three people at a garlic festival in Northern California two days before it was scheduled to air. In the sketch, Castro played a Guatemalan immigrant who is confused by the prevalence of gun violence in the United States. The network originally planned to play the episode one week later, on August 6, but after mass shootings in Texas and Ohio killed 30 people on August 3 and 4, it is possible that the episode will be postponed again. ”Alternatino with Arturo Castro“ is the latest show impacted by stories on the news. It's a drastic step when a television network changes its programming in the wake of a national tragedy. But nowadays it's all too common to see a show pulled, delayed, or even changed out of sensitivity for current events. In the wake of the recent massacre in Las Vegas that left nearly 60 dead and hundreds more injured, FX has a scheduled episode of ""American Horror Story"" that features a mass shooting set to air Oct. 10. Will the network make changes around the episode? Here TheWrap recalls 12 other shows that have altered programming in the face of real-world violence.

http://uproxx.com/news/las-vegas-shooter-home-explosives-ammo/,"Following the Las Vegas mass shooting that left 59 people dead and over 525 injured, countless details began to pour forth on Stephen Paddock. The 64-year-old gunman, a white male who carried out the attack alone, reportedly used the credit card of his “companion,” Marilou Danley, to book his 32nd-floor hotel room at Mandalay Bay Resort. And at Paddock’s home — situated within a retirement community in Mesquite, Nevada — authorities uncovered a sobering amount of weaponry to add to what he toted to Vegas. When Paddock was located by authorities (after one confusing timeline), police found over 23 firearms, including some that were fully automatic, according to the Wall Street Journal. Police reported that the room contained “AR-15-style and AK-47-style rifles” and a wealth of ammunition. In Paddock’s home and car, investigators found more guns and some explosives: Investigators searching Paddock’s home in Mesquite, Nev., retrieved 19 firearms and thousands of rounds of ammunition, Las Vegas police officials said Monday. The sheriff said they also found Tannerite, an explosive that detonates when shot by bullets and is used in target practice. In Paddock’s car, authorities found more ammunition and ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer that can be used to make explosive, Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said. CNN confirms the number of total firearms (42) within Paddock’s known arsenal. In addition, investigators are digging into whether the automatic rifles used in the massacre were “converted from semiautomatic guns or purchased that way.” Beyond that, it’s difficult to imagine how someone acquired so many firearms without setting off alarm bells, but Paddock didn’t have a criminal record to deter his pursuit. While his hunting license in Alaska still wouldn’t explain the cache, Nevada’s gun laws don’t make it difficult to build a collection. (Via Wall Street Journal, Deadline & CNN)"

http://www.mlive.com/news/us-world/index.ssf/2017/11/trump_dismisses_gun_control_qu.html," Jung Yeon-Je | AP Photo While President Donald Trump continues his tour of Asia Tuesday, he once again said that gun control would solve the problems in the U.S. that have led to two of the biggest mass shootings in the country's history over the last month. Speaking during a press conference in South Korea, Trump dismissed the idea of extreme vetting for people who want to buy guns, according to the Associated Press. ""If you did what you're suggesting, there would have been no difference three days ago and you might not have had that very brave person who happens to have a gun or a rifle in his trunk."" Trump is referencing the man who shot Devin Kelley -- the man suspected of killing 26 people in a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas Sunday -- before Kelley was able to inflict more damage. Trump believes that because the neighbor had a gun, he was able to stop Kelley and if gun control laws were in place, that neighbor may not have had a gun to save lives with. ""Instead of having 26 dead, you would have had hundreds more dead,"" Trump said. Trump stood strong against gun control advocates last month following the largest mass shooting in U.S. history at an outdoor country music festival in Las Vegas. Although Trump did offer his opinion on Sunday's killings, he also said the issue shouldn't be discussed too much right now because he was ""deep in the heart of South Korea."" Trump has repeatedly said the problems has less to do with limiting the rights of gun owners and more to do with improving mental health care in the U.S. Trump has maintained that while there are a few people who've used guns improperly, that shouldn't impede on the rights of those who do not break the law with their guns. And while Trump said he didn't have too much time to talk about gun control, he did take to Twitter Tuesday to tout the rise of the economy and to weigh in on governor's races across the U.S. Stock market hit yet another all-time record high yesterday. There is great confidence in the moves that my Administration.... ....is making. Working very hard on TAX CUTS for the middle class, companies and jobs! Ralph Northam will allow crime to be rampant in Virginia. He’s weak on crime, weak on our GREAT VETS, Anti-Second Amendment.... ....and has been horrible on Virginia economy.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/uproxx/features/~3/Y_Lepu32_YE/,"Donald Trump announced his return from his trip to Asia with a pair of tweets on Tuesday night. The second tweet said it was great to be back in the USA — like the famous Chuck Berry tune — and was a positive way to end his Asian adventure. But it was unfortunately undermined by the preceding tweet sent from the president’s account that sent condolences about the wrong mass shooting. While sending well wishes to the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas is a good thing for the president to do, the shooting did happen close to a week ago. Not mentioned is Tuesday’s shooting in Northern California that left five dead and ten injured after a domestic dispute, though most hope that the president just make a slight mistake. The tweet was still live as of publication, staying live for at least two hours that led to plenty of speculation for people online who had dreams of covfefe dancing through their heads. While the response to this gaffe doesn’t seem to be as large, you could also chalk it up to the general exhaustion with the Trump parade at this point.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 5, 2017  The one theory that seemed to make the biggest impact is that the president or his team keep a template ready for these type of events, literally just copying and pasting a previous message: Donald's template for a white male shooter, usually with history of domestic violence:May God be with the people of <City, State>. The FBI and Law Enforcement has arrived. — Mother Resister ?⚖️✊? (@MotherResister) November 15, 2017  My God be with the people of [insert next mass shooting location here].

The president and his team will be sure to do something new tomorrow to cause outrage, plus there’s the announced big announcement that’s about to happen and the eventual comment by Trump on the Roy Moore scandal. Still, this is the type of small mistake that just defines a moment it seems and how the people in charge actually view that moment. (Via The Wrap)"

https://www.inquisitr.com/4645088/las-vegas-shooting-survivor-roy-mcclellan-dies-in-hit-and-run-just-weeks-after-deadly-mass-shooting/,"Just seven weeks after the October 1 mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival near Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas left 57 dead and hundreds more injured, 52-year-old survivor Roy McClellan lost his life in a senseless hit-and-run in Pahrump, Nevada. The accident took place on November 17 on Homestead and Highway 160, and has left Denise McClellan, Roy's widow, heartbroken and angry. According to the widow McClellan, she doesn't understand why her husband's life was spared during the October 1 mass shooting, only to be taken so tragically just weeks later.  Police also made it known that Roy McClellan had been illegally walking, likely hitchhiking, on the roadway at the time of the hit-and-run.  It is unclear what led Roy McClellan to be hitchhiking just weeks after the deadly Las Vegas mass shooting. What is more clear is the devastating toll the mass shooting had on the 52-year-old. Roy and Denise McClellan reportedly attended the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival together and were both in the 20,000-strong crowd when bullets began to ring out on October 1. As hundreds of rounds were unleashed, allegedly by ""lone wolf"" gunman Stephen Paddock from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay, the couple ran for their lives. According to Denise, her husband stopped to help others in the crowd as the pair fled gunfire. Denise McClellan added that the aftermath of the shooting had been difficult for her husband psychologically. She claimed that being a Las Vegas shooting survivor had begun ""messing with his head,"" going on to say that Roy had been attending therapy as a result of the trauma he endured.  ""As we were running, we kept changing direction, because it felt like no matter what direction we took, we were being followed.""  ""As we were running, we kept changing direction, because it felt like no matter what direction we took, we were being followed.""  The family of Roy McClellan have established a GoFundMe campaign to help pay for his final expenses. As of November 25, investigators including the FBI and Las Vegas Police Department have failed to determine (or divulge) a motive for the Las Vegas mass shooting. "

http://www.ibtimes.com/trump-defends-us-gun-laws-while-calling-texas-shooting-act-evil-2610872,"President Donald Trump refused to blame guns for the shootings inside a church in Texas which claimed 26 lives Sunday, saying it was rather a ""mental health"" issue. According to the USA Today, during a joint news conference Monday with Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo, Trump said, “I think mental health is the problem here. This isn't a guns situation.” He said that the shooter in Texas was a disturbed man, who should have received treatment. Trump called the shooting in the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Wilson County, as an ""act of evil"" and condemned violence in a sacred place. He assured full support of the federal government to the victims. He said that in a time of grief “Americans will do what we do best: we pull together and join hands and lock arms and through the tears and sadness we stand strong.”    Abe also offered condolences to the victims of the mass shooting, saying he was in ""solidarity"" with Americans. According to the Economic Times, Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek identified the shooter as Devin Patrick Kelley, 26, who was discharged from the Air Force in 2014. He was responsible for moving passengers, cargo and personal property in military transportation. He was also responsible for assaulting his spouse and a child. The report, however, said that no officials have publicly questioned Kelley’s mental health. According to CNN, Freeman Martin, a regional director with the Texas Department of Public Safety, described Kelley as a young white male dressed in an all-black tactical-type gear and wearing a ballistic vest. The Economic Times quoted Trump as saying, ""Fortunately somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction otherwise it (wouldn't) have been as bad as it was. It would have been much worse. But this is a mental health problem at the highest level. It’s a very, very sad event.” The Straits Times reported Texas Governor Greg Abbott as saying, “We are dealing with the largest mass shooting in our state’s history. The tragedy of course is worsened by the fact that it occurred in a church, a place of worship where these people were innocently gunned down.” Former president Barack Obama, who responded to 14 mass shootings during his administration, expressed his condolences and called for action to stop gun violence through social media.    Former vice-president Joe Biden also showed concern over the matter and tweeted in support of a gun control debate.    Last month, a gunman opened fire at an outdoor music festival on the Las Vegas Strip from the 32nd floor of a hotel-casino. The shootings had killed 58 people and more than 500 were injured. Trump had visited Las Vegas soon after the shooting to meet the families of the victims. However, Trump and his aides had then refused to talk about the possible changes that could have been made to gun laws to prevent such shootings, claiming it was too early to discuss policy in the wake of such a tragedy.

http://www.ocregister.com/2017/11/05/small-town-texas-church-where-mass-shooting-occurred-was-center-of-community/,"Trending: By JIM VERTUNO, NOMAAN MERCHANT, and DIANA HEIDGERD SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas — The most recent sermon posted on You Tube by the pastor of the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas, shows him explaining why he had parked a motorcycle in front of his lectern. As he walked side to side on stage, Frank Pomeroy explained in the video posted Oct. 29 that he wanted to discuss having faith in forces that can’t be seen, be they gravity during a sharp turn or God. RELATED: Man opens fire in Texas church, killing more than 20 people “Just as leaning into a turn may not make sense, leaning into God is the way we should go, because God’s got it figured out, whether we do or not,” Pomeroy said. The white wood-frame church where a gunman opened fire Sunday was at the center of life in Sutherland Springs, one of the hundreds of tiny towns that dot rural Texas. A week after the video was posted, one of those killed was Pomeroy’s 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle.

(AP Photo/Darren Abate)  Local and federal law enforcement swarmed the community and blocked off access to the church hours after residents reported hearing gunfire. Regina Rodriguez walked up to the police barricade a few hours after the shooting and hugged a person she was with. Her father, 51-year-old Richard Rodriguez, attends the church “every Sunday.” She had not yet been able to reach him. She said she feared the worst: “I just lost my father.” Nick Uhlig, 34, is a church member who did not go to a service Sunday morning. He said he has several cousins who were at the church and family has been told at least one of them, a woman with three children and pregnant with another, is among the dead. He said he has not heard about the fate of the others. “Somebody went in and started shooting,” he said, shaking his head and taking a long drag on a cigarette. U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Democrat who represents part of the area, said in a statement that he could recall holding fundraisers at the local volunteer fire department “where basically everyone in the entire area would come out to support those volunteers. “The people of Sutherland Springs are as fine an example of Texans and Americans as you will find anywhere in the country,” Cuellar said. Frank Pomeroy’s wife, Sherri Pomeroy, said in a text message to The Associated Press that her daughter was among the “many friends” they lost Sunday. Both she and the pastor were out of town Sunday. First Baptist Church, according to its website, has a fellowship breakfast on Sunday mornings, followed by Sunday School. A morning worship service is at 11 a.m., with a Sunday evening service at 6 p.m. A ladies Bible study is scheduled Tuesday morning, while a men’s prayer group meets at 6:30 a.m. on Wednesdays. Thursdays include an evening fellowship dinner, followed by religious activities and prayers for children and a food distribution for anyone who needs “God’s Blessings.” The church’s Facebook page has photos on Halloween of children and their parents in costumes outside the church, with lights strung up on poles and various games separated by hay bales. The church regularly posts videos of its Sunday services on a YouTube channel, raising the possibility that the shooting was captured on video. No video appears on the channel from Sunday, and authorities have not yet said whether they obtained video footage from Sunday’s service. In the sermon video posted Oct. 29, Pomeroy began by speaking in front of a stage with two guitarists and a singer. Most people, including Pomeroy, appear to be in jeans. A few children can be seen walking around and climbing around on the pews. Pomeroy mentioned Annabelle in his sermon, saying that the two of them rode on the bike that morning. With a smile, he mentioned that while both of them could watch the sun rise and the nature around them, the temperature that morning had fallen nearly to 30 degrees Fahrenheit. “She was back there cuddled behind me, and when I pointed at the temperature gauge, I felt her snuggle in even tighter,” he said.

http://www.ibtimes.com/who-devin-kelley-texas-church-shooting-suspect-killed-police-2610694,"This is a developing story. Check back for updates. A man responsible for opening fire on a community church in Sutherland Springs, Texas died after the attack, law enforcement said. Devin Kelley, 26, of New Braunfels, Texas was identified as the alleged attacker and was believed to be the sole person responsible, according to the Associated Press. Initial reports suggested Kelley was killed by police, though investigators said Sunday evening it remained unclear whether he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound or was shot by someone else. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott confirmed in a press conference that at least 26 people were killed, though it remained unknown whether that number would go up in the coming days and hours. The ages of those killed ranged from 5 to 72-years-old. The 14-year-old daughter of the church’s pastor was also killed in the attack, according to Fox News. Kelley reportedly entered the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, a town about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio, and began shooting Sunday afternoon. He was apparently dressed in all black tactical gear and wore a ballistic vest. No motive had yet been ascertained in the shooting, Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackett told NBC News. Kelley reportedly lived in a suburb of San Antonio and did not appear to be linked to any organized terrorist groups, an official told the AP. “Apparently the shooter was not from the area, he was from outside of that area,” Texas Congressman Vincente Gonzalez told MSNBC. JUST IN: Church shooting suspect identified as Devin Kelley, of New Braunfels, Texas, according to state and federal law enforcement sources Kelley was reportedly a former United States Air Force service member, who received a dishonorable discharge and was court-martialed in 2014, CBS News reported. Investigators said they were looking into Kelley’s alleged social media posts, including one that may have shown an AR-15 semiautomatic weapon. “I talked to one of gunman Devin Kelly’s Facebook friends, who says Kelley was randomly adding strangers and starting fights on Facebook,” Los Angeles Times correspondent Matt Pearce tweeted. Bystanders described to reporters hearing the shooting take place from places nearby the church. “[The shooting] lasted about 15 seconds,” Carrie Matula, a resident who was working at a gas station across the street from the church at the time of the shooting, told WPLG. “I yelled ‘Get down! Get inside! And we all went into hiding.” Officials said in a press conference Sunday evening that after the attack was underway, a next-door neighbor engaged with the gunman, firing shots from his own rifle and chasing him away from the scene. The unidentified citizen also pursued the suspect and caused him to drop his gun, officials said. The FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were assisting in the aftermath of the shooting, according to the Associated Press. “May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas,” President Donald Trump tweeted. “The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan.”  "

https://www.bustle.com/p/what-is-the-charleston-loophole-the-us-tried-taking-guns-from-over-4000-people-who-werent-supposed-to-have-them-6776177,"News  One of the strongest gun control measures in the United States is the FBIâs National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS. Though the process seems relatively simple â federally licensed gun dealers run a potential gun buyer's name through the FBI's database before selling them a firearm â it isn't foolproof. A problem becoming known as the ""Charleston loophole"" is putting guns in the hands of Americans who aren't allowed to have them. In fact, it's the very same loophole that allowed a white supremacist to buy a gun in 2015, which he later used to murder nine churchgoers in Charleston. ""There are so many things in federal gun law that are absurd, and this is definitely one at the top of the list,"" Laura Cutilletta, an attorney at the Giffords Law Center To Prevent Gun Violence, tells Bustle of the ""Charleston loophole."" NICS was established in 1993 under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, and it's meant to identify people who are legally prohibited from purchasing guns. This includes convicted felons, people who've been involuntarily committed to a mental institution, undocumented immigrants, people with domestic violence convictions, and more. When a name is fed into NICS, the FBI conducts a background check and reports back to the gun dealer on whether or not the sale is legal. Here's the loophole: If a gun dealer doesn't hear back from the FBI within three days of requesting a background check, they're allowed to sell the gun to the buyer anyway. Unlike some loopholes, this isn't some accidental consequence of carelessly written legislation; rather, it's explicitly detailed both in federal law and on the FBI's website. Gun sales like this, which are made even though the buyer hasn't passed a background check, are known as ""default proceeds."" Usually, this doesn't happen. FBI data says that in 2015, over 90 percent of background checks produced an immediate response. Only around 3.02 percent of background checks that year resulted in default proceeds, which sounds like a relatively small number â but on an absolute scale, it means that 371,000 Americans were allowed to buy guns that year without having passed a background check. More to the point, 2,892 of those gun buyers were later found to have been legally prohibited from owning guns. It's unclear what these people did that should have disqualified them from buying guns, as the FBI doesn't release such detailed data. In total, though, 43 percent of people who failed background checks in 2015 â and that includes folks who were successfully blocked from buying a gun â failed because they'd been ""convicted of a crime punishable by more than one year or a misdemeanor punishable by more than two years."" Another 19 percent couldn't pass a background check because they were a ""fugitive from justice,"" while about 10 percent had either a conviction or restraining order stemming from a domestic violence accusation. More details on this are available in the FBI's 2015 report on gun sales. When someone falls through the cracks in this manner and buys a gun they're not allowed to own, the FBI orders the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms to retrieve the weapon. USA Today reported on Monday that in 2016, the FBI issued over 4,000 orders to seize weapons from buyers who fell through the Charleston loophole that year. That's the most seizure orders the agency has issued in a decade, according to FBI data. In 2015, someone who failed a background check but was allowed to buy a gun went on to commit a mass shooting. The white supremacist convicted of carrying out the 2015 Charleston church massacre had previously been convicted of possessing a controlled substance, which legally prohibited him from buying a gun. When he tried to buy a handgun, his name was fed into the NICS; thanks to a bureaucratic mix-up, however, the system didn't detect his conviction within the three-day window. ""The investigator had called the wrong county to look into this person's background,"" Cutilletta explains to Bustle. ""They never got a response, and meanwhile, the three days elapsed, and the gun was [sold] by default."" The buyer then used that gun to murder nine people. He later said said that he did this in hopes of igniting a race war, and has since been sentenced to death. In 2017, Democrats in the House and Senate introduced legislation to close the Charleston loophole. However, Republicans control both chambers, and GOP leadership hasn't put either bill up for a vote. In general, Congress has been incredibly reluctant to pass any form of gun control, largely due to opposition from Republican officials. Luckily for gun control advocates, though, state lawmakers also have a say in how background checks are conducted. As of 2015, at least 15 states plus Washington D.C. have enacted legislation that gives law enforcement more time to conduct background checks before gun dealers are allowed to proceed with a sale, according to Everytown Research. Delaware enacted a similar law the next year. ""It's easier to get things done at the state level, and unfortunately, that's what's had to happen,"" Cutilletta tells Bustle. As long as Republicans control at least one chamber of Congress, it's unlikely that background check laws will be strengthened any time soon on the federal level. But there's much more room for progress at the state level, which means your advocacy can make a difference. If you want to close the loophole and promote a stricter background check process, vote pro-reform canidates into state office at every possible election. And though closing the Charleston loophole seems like a small feat in the larger scheme things, it could stop thousands of people who shouldn't have guns from getting their hands on them in the first place.

http://www.ibtimes.com/mass-shooting-drawing-scene-florida-students-homework-lands-man-jail-2623305,"A man from Florida was arrested Friday because he reportedly drew a disturbing and threatening picture on an elementary school student’s homework. The drawing showed a schoolhouse on fire as a man shoots with his gun. The 33-year-old, Robert Paul Alexander Edwards of Mexico Beach, Florida, allegedly drew the horrifying scene in the student's notebook. Edwards in his drawing also illustrated two people shot on the ground lying in a pool of blood. The words, ""Pew, Pew, Pew,"" were written next to the person with the gun who was shown shooting at people standing in a queue. There was another person depicted in the picture who was on fire next to the words ""AHHH! It burns!"" Sheriff Mike Harrison, from Gulf County Sheriff’s Office announced the arrest of Edwards who has been charged with violating Florida State Statute 836.10 — written threat to kill or do bodily injury. According to the press release by Sheriff Harrison, the investigation sparked after a staff at the Port St. Joe Elementary School saw the illustration and contacted the School Resource Deputy about the alarming picture drawn on a student’s homework assignment. It is said that the drawing clearly showed a school building on fire, a person running from the school on fire, and several others who are shown standing in a queue were being shot by a gunman.  Sheriff Harrison said: ""Our country has been affected one too many times with horrific school tragedies. We take matters like this very seriously."" The case has been investigated jointly by the Sheriff and officials with Gulf District Schools. Investigators thoroughly interviewed Edwards. According to the release the department also explained that although the actions illustrated in the drawing were taken seriously, there was no indication that he would carry out the threat as depicted. Robert Paul Alexander Edwards of Mexico Beach, Florida, was arrested and charged with violating Florida State Statute 836.10 - Written threat to kill or do bodily injury — as he drew a disturbing image on an elementary school student’s homework. However, it is not known if Edwards had any connection with the student or how he got the student’s homework assignment notebook. In another incident in 2012, a teenage student was student arrested as his drawing demonstrated concerning behavior. A 16-year-old boy from Cedar Creek High School in Galloway Township, New Jersey, made illustrations in his notebook that appeared to be weapons. After a teacher noticed the drawing in the student’s notebook, the school authority contacted the police. The student was taken to the Galloway Township Police Department. Later, during the investigation, police searched the boy’s home on the 300 block of East Spencer Lane where they found several electronic parts and chemicals which if mixed together, could cause an explosion. The teenager whose name was not disclosed was charged with possession of a weapon and an explosive device. He was placed in Haborfields Juvenile Detention Center. According to a report in CBS Philly, speaking about the incident, the Superintendent of the Greater Egg Harbor Regional High School District, Steven Ciccariello said, ""This is a perfect example of a teacher implementing her training. She saw drawings that appeared disturbing to her and alerted school officials."""

http://rssfeeds.cincinnati.com/~/488793326/0/cincinnati-home~FBI-has-Devin-Kelleyaposs-iPhone-But-it-canapost-unlock-it-obscuring-clues-to-Texas-shooter/,"SAN FRANCISCO – A simple iPhone passcode may be stopping the FBI from more fully understanding the shooter behind Sunday’s deadly church killing, possibly exacerbated by a gap between when murder suspect Devin Kelley last used the phone and when authorities started trying to unlock it.  The FBI has Kelley’s iPhone, retrieved after he shot a congregation in Sutherland Springs, Tex., killing 25 people before he was killed. A search warrant allowing investigators access has been executed. The phone was flown to FBI headquarters in Quantico, Va., for analysis but so far a forensics team has been unable to unlock the phone. Their efforts — if prolonged — could resurface a fight between law enforcement, tech companies and privacy advocates over whether the government should get a back-door key to unlocking widely used consumer devices. The FBI has argued it needs to be able to override the phones' encryption to uncover criminals' tracks. Tech companies, including iPhone-maker Apple, have countered doing so would make all individuals more vulnerable to hackers. Authorities may have had more than one way to get beyond the personal passcode. Versions starting with iPhone 5S and later, but not the new X, use Touch ID. This fingerprint sensor would have allowed the investigators to access the phone using his fingerprints, but only for a short period of time after his last use.  “We are working very hard to get into the phone,” Christopher Combs, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s San Antonio bureau, said during a news briefing on Tuesday. “It could be tomorrow, it could be a week, it could be a month.” A law enforcement official, who is not authorized to comment publicly, said Wednesday that authorities were still trying to access the contents of the iPhone.  Apple said Wednesday afternoon that no one at the FBI or any other law enforcement agency had reached out to Apple for technical assistance with the phone. The timing of any such requests is critical.Touch ID allows the owner to set a fingerprint to open the device. However, Touch ID stops working if the phone hasn’t been unlocked for more than 48 hours — at that point the user must type in the passcode, according to Apple’s website. Too many unsuccessful attempts to unlock a passcode can lock down a phone permanently. If the phone had been set up to accept a fingerprint, the FBI could have used Kelley’s finger to open the phone during that 48 hour window, if he had recently unlocked it. Apple’s Touch ID feature can be engaged with a dead person’s finger. More: Texas church shooting: Who is Devin Kelley? More: Neighbor ran to aid Texas shooting victims after shooter Devin Kelley fled More: Devin Kelley's troubled past included divorce, domestic battery, and time in the brig Law enforcement officials argue that access to suspects' cell phones is often a crucial component of investigations — but one that's frequently blocked by security technology. The FBI has been able to retrieve data from fewer than half the mobile phones it has tried to access over the last 11 months, director Christopher Wray said last month at a speech at the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference in Philadelphia. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance has warned that inaccessible devices have thwarted some of the office’s most serious investigations, including murder and sex crimes. Vance is expected to disclose a new count of locked devices later this month. Last year, the district attorney reported that 423 Apple iPhones and iPads had been seized since October 2014 and have been inaccessible to investigators because of default encryption. “Approximately 10% of our warrant-proof devices pertain to homicide or attempted murder cases, and 9% to sex crimes,” Vance said last year. “With over 96% of all smartphones worldwide operated by Apple and Google, and with devices running older operating systems rapidly aging out, the trend is only poised to continue,” the district attorney said. “In other words, the risks associated with warrant-proof encryption remain, and are growing.”       The issue came to a very public head last year when Apple and the Department of Justice spent 43 days locked in a legal battle over an order from a federal magistrate in California that the company must help the FBI try to get into an iPhone used by San Bernardino gunman Syed Rizwan Farook. Apple v FBI timeline: 43 days that rocked tech At issue was a feature on the iPhone 5C Farook had been issued by his employer that  would lock investigators out if they made 10 unsuccessful tries to determine the correct password. The FBI demanded that Apple help it disable the locking program, which Apple refused to do on the grounds that creating software to do so would result in something that could potentially unlock any iPhone. “The FBI may use different words to describe this tool, but make no mistake: Building a version of iOS that bypasses security in this way would undeniably create a backdoor. And while the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case, there is no way to guarantee such control,” Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote in a public blog post on Feb. 16, 2016. In the end, the FBI paid an estimated $1.3 million to an unnamed company to build a tool that allowed it to break into the phone, and withdrew its case against Apple. Left unresolved was whether Apple could have been forced to create such a tool for the FBI. USA TODAY, together with the Associated Press and the news site Vice, sued to discover the name of the outside party that helped crack the phone, but a judge said the agency could keep the identity secret. Privacy advocates and civil liberties groups argue that giving police the ability to break into locked phones represents too great a threat to privacy. Last year the United Nations' human rights chief warned that the creation of cyber tools to do so risked unlocking a Pandora's Box. ""This is not just about one case and one IT company in one country. It will have tremendous ramifications for the future of individuals’ security in a digital world which is increasingly inextricably meshed with the actual world we live in,"" Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement in March 2016. In a show of unity rarely seen in the tech industry, more than 30 companies — Google, Facebook, Microsoft, AT&T, Yahoo, Amazon, Twitter, Intel, Cisco Systems and others — filed amicus briefs in support of Apple in its opposition to cracking an iPhone linked to the San Bernardino killings. It is a formidable front in an industry often fractured by internecine product wars. "

http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/pence-texas-gov-attend-vigil-victims-church-shooting,"SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas (AP) — Vice President Mike Pence joined Texas Gov. Greg Abbott at a memorial service for the victims of Sunday’s massacre at a small-town Texas church. Pence told the crowd Wednesday evening that the shooting at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs was the worst mass shooting at a church in American history and called the gunman “deranged.” “Whatever animated the evil that descended on that small church, of the attacker’s desire was to silence their testimony of faith, they failed,” the vice president added. Abbott began the service by praying “for healing and for help.” The governor said that Texans come together at times of crisis and tragedy. “It’s what we do,” Abbott said. People in the crowd responded “amen.” He also proclaimed Tuesday a statewide day of prayer. Authorities have reviewed video from inside the church where a gunman killed more than two dozen, including footage that shows the assailant shooting victims in the head during Sunday services, a U.S. official said Wednesday. The official’s account of the video is consistent with statements made by survivors of the attack. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. The same U.S. official confirmed that the attacker’s cellphone was an iPhone and that the FBI had not yet asked Apple for help obtaining data from the device. The church regularly recorded its services, and the footage investigators have seen shows several minutes of the attack because there was “no one to turn it off,” according to a law enforcement official who has seen the video. The official also spoke on condition of anonymity because that person was not authorized to speak publicly about an ongoing investigation. The law enforcement official was among those who went inside the First Baptist Church after the attack and said several of the pews were overturned, although it was unclear if that was from the attack or from rescue efforts. Bullets had splintered the walls and pews, leaving shards of wood all over the floors. Pence arrived in Texas on Wednesday, visiting wounded victims at a San Antonio hospital and later meeting families of the dead in Floresville, not far from Sutherland Springs. Pence went from table to table at a high school library attempting to console devastated family members. “The whole country is praying over you,” he told one man who lost his sister-in-law. He stopped to talk with John Holcombe, whose family was decimated by the shooting. Holcombe, who suffered shrapnel wounds, lost his wife Crystal — who was pregnant with their first child — three of her children, his parents, a brother and a toddler niece. Pence hugged 7-year-old Evelyn Holcombe, who managed to survive by running out of the church during the attack. Earlier Wednesday, Pence said that President Donald Trump had ordered federal agencies to provide extensive help to the investigation, including 100 on-site FBI agents. The agent in charge of the FBI’s San Antonio division said Tuesday agents had not been able to retrieve data from Devin Patrick Kelley’s cellphone. In a statement Wednesday evening, Apple said it’s offered the FBI technical advice after learning the bureau was trying to access the phone. The company said the FBI had not requested its assistance. Depending on the model of iPhone and what security features it had, FBI agents might have had a short window to use alternative methods to access its data. For instance, if the iPhone used Apple’s Touch ID fingerprint sensing system, agents could have tried placing the dead gunman’s finger on the phone to unlock it. But that would only have worked within 48 hours of the last time the phone was locked. Meanwhile, more details emerged about the gunman’s past. School records showed that Kelley was a disciplinary problem in high school. In fall 2006, Kelley’s sophomore year, he was suspended and sent to an alternative school for two months after an unspecified drug-related incident. He was suspended twice as a junior and three times as a senior for reasons including “insubordination,” ”profane language/gestures” and “dishonest/false records.” With each passing year at New Braunfels High School, his grades slipped as well, according to the records. A B-student overall as a freshman, he failed several classes by his senior year and ended up ranked 260 out of 393 students in his graduating class in 2009. He finished with a 2.3 grade-point average. The records also listed attention deficit hyperactivity disorder as one of his medical conditions. A former friend said Kelley asked her for sexual favors and prevented his first wife from communicating with her friends. Kelsey Huckaby told Austin television station KTBC that Kelley was “kind of controlling of his girlfriends” in high school. Huckaby said she lost contact with Kelley until he responded to a Facebook post she made in April asking for a place to stay for her and her boyfriend. She said Kelley offered to let them stay in a trailer on his property if she performed weekly “sexual favors” for him. Also Wednesday, the Texas Department of Public Safety released an official list of those killed in the rampage. The eight male victims and 17 female victims ranged in age from 1 to 77. Eight of the fatalities were children or teenagers. The oldest of them was 16. Authorities said the 26 dead also included the unborn baby of a woman who was killed. All the victims died at the scene, except for one child who died at a San Antonio-area hospital. Eleven people remained hospitalized with wounds they suffered in the attack. ___ Associated Press writers Michael Balsamo in Los Angeles and Matt O’Brien in Providence, Rhode Island, contributed to this report.

http://www.mlive.com/tv/index.ssf/2017/11/does_the_punisher_promote_gun.html,"""The Punisher"" premiered on Netflix, and the series holds 67 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Fans are excited about the action-packed series, but critics argue ""The Punisher"" glorifies gun violence. Others add that the character is the epitome of white male privilege and speaks to the issue of white male terrorists in America. The Punisher is a vigilante who takes violent revenge on criminals. No one else would be able to get away with that. What do you think? Below is the synopsis of ""The Punisher,"" per IMDB. Check out the trailer below, and tell us by voting if you think the series promotes gun violence. Some critics complained the series is too long, but there's no denying Jon Bernthal's charisma as the Punisher. The Wrap's Phil Owen writes: Some critics have been calling out the Punisher's exact depiction of white male privilege. Only a white dude can become a vigilante who shoots up bad guys in the name of justice. Regardless if his victims are criminals, many would agree the Punisher shouldn't be taking such violent ""justice"" into his own hands. And more importantly, some argue the Punisher speaks to the mental illness narrative that American society uses to justify white male shooters. ""The Punisher"" is just bad timing, and the series may never be appropriate in an America that struggles with gun reform. The Wired's Gaeme McMillan writes: The Tylt is focused on debates and conversations around news, current events and pop culture.

(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli)  By DON THOMPSON and PAUL ELIAS The Associated Press RANCHO TEHAMA RESERVE — A Northern California man killed two neighbors with whom he had been feuding before he went on a shooting rampage Tuesday at apparent random sites — including an elementary school that successfully locked him out — in a series of attacks where he killed two more people and injured 10 before police fatally shot him, officials said. Police said surveillance video shows the shooter unsuccessfully trying to enter a nearby elementary school after quick-thinking staff members locked the outside doors and barricaded themselves inside when they heard gunshots. The shooter Tuesday morning in Rancho Tehama was being prosecuted for assault stemming from an attack on neighbors in January and possession of an assault weapon. Tehama County Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston said the gunman spent about six minutes shooting into Rancho Tehama Elementary School before driving off to continue shooting elsewhere. Johnston said one student was shot and injured and is expected to survive. “It was a bizarre and murderous rampage,” Johnston said. He said the 45-minute spree ended when a patrol car rammed the stolen vehicle the shooter was driving and killed him in a shootout. Johnston said the shooter was facing charges of assaulting one of the feuding neighbors in January and that she had a restraining order against him. “I think the motive of getting even with his neighbors and when it went that far — he just went on a rampage,” Johnston said. He said there was a “domestic violence” report Monday involving the gunman, but didn’t provide any further details. At least one of the victims has life-threatening injuries, he said. Johnston declined to identify the shooter until his relatives were notified, but he confirmed the gunman was charged with assault in January and had a restraining order placed against him. The district attorney, Gregg Cohen, told the Sacramento Bee he is prosecuting a man named Kevin Neal in that case. Kevin Janson Neal was arrested Jan. 31 and booked into Tehama County Jail on charges of assault with a deadly weapon, according to the Red Bluff Daily News. Neal was due to stand trial on charges of second-degree burglary, assault with a deadly weapon, two counts of false imprisonment by violence, discharge of a firearm with gross negligence, possession of an assault weapon and misdemeanor battery, records show. Court documents list Neal as owning an AR-15 Bushmaster rifle, but it is not known whether it was used in Tuesday’s shootings. Tehama County District Attorney Gregg Cohen said Neal had a long-running dispute with his neighbors and during the January incident allegedly shot through a wooden fence at two female neighbors as they walked along the fence. Neal then jumped the fence, confronted the women, stabbed one and took a cellphone from the other, Cohen said. Neal’s mother, in Raleigh, N.C., told The Associated Press he called her Monday and told her “it’s all over now.” The woman, who would only be identified as Anne, said her son was frustrated by constant feuding with his neighbors and told her “I’m on a cliff and there’s nowhere to go.” She said he told her he believed the neighbors were cooking methamphetamine.

https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/2017/11/07/readers-reactto-shooting-sutherland-springs-first-baptist-church,"By Letters to the Editor 11:00 AM on Nov 7, 2017 CST Re: ""Horrific tragedy — Gunman kills 26 at small-town church service,"" Monday news story. I'm looking for some leadership and courage on the part of our governor, our president and the leadership of the Republican Party. It is time for turning their backs to the NRA and turning their hearts to the public that has elected them. Get active on serious control of these weapons and those who buy them. Otherwise, you are as complicit as those who pull the trigger. The country is bleeding from your lack of leadership. Robert Burns, North Dallas The latest gun massacre gives the world an opportunity to see the primitive thinking that pervades our Texas politicians. Our leaders are surrogates for the merchants of death. After the attack, they, along with the president, immediately endorsed versions of the NRA playbook, insisting these massacres are about anything but effective gun control, such as: • More prayer. (Protect the embryo but do nothing to stop massacre of full-fledged human beings.)
• Bad people will always break the law. (Does it follow that we should have no laws?) 
• Not enough guns, ""good guy with a gun."" (How often does that happen?) 
• A mental health issue. (Every nation has mental health issues, yet they don't have mass murders like we do.) 
• Too early and disrespectful to talk now. (That's the most disingenuous response, since there is never a right time.)     California and Northeast businesses have for some time found Texas cities like Dallas and Houston attractive primarily for low taxes, low labor costs and lower real estate costs. As a recent transplant, it has been my hope that eventually the influx of more cultural diversity would result in more socially responsible thinking. Robert Barrese, Dallas A friend in New York sent me what I think is sadly a quotable quote: ""When you're not safe in a Baptist church in Texas, you're not safe anywhere."" Robert Henderson, Dallas/Turtle Creek As I write this, my television and social media feeds are filled with the news of 26 dead in a mass shooting near San Antonio. A few weeks ago, I could have written the same sentence, swapping out only the name of the town and the number of casualties. To be honest, I am sick of the tacit acceptance, the cultural pattern we have set for ourselves: a moment of shock and grief, a wave of partisan bickering that everyone knows is prelude to nothing, and then ... silence. In between the fading of the last gunshot of one mass murder and the first shot of the next: silence. I am tired of the silence. If there must be silence, let it be about the killers. Let us push for legislation regulating the coverage the perpetrators of mass violence and their crimes receive on television and in print. Unless law enforcement sees a need, a perpetrator's name should never be mentioned, nor his actions replayed and revisited endlessly on 24-hour news networks. It is worth a try. Todd Allen, Hurst When an African-American male shoots up a church in Tennessee, the news is swept under a rug. When an ISIS terrorist mows down innocents, we are told not to rush to judgment. When a white male shoots a church of Christians, it seems the gun control crowd pounces on the opportunity to judge America. It's amazing how hateful leftists are when this type of shooting occurs and how they have the audacity to blame an organization that promotes gun safety (NRA) and then attack Christians for being the problems. Others have even gone further to praise the attack, noting there are now fewer white Republicans. If this is what liberalism is, then I'm glad I'm right. Stephen Phillips, Decatur Re: ""Now can we talk about guns? Here we go again, dancing around the issue, says Michael Lindenberger,"" Monday Viewpoints. Where was Mr. Lindenberger's outrage about the vehicle that killed 14 people in New York City? It was just as responsible as a gun. Bill Herod, Irving Re: ""Paxton: Texans with guns can stop mass shooting,"" Monday news story. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's vision of utopia is one in which every citizen is armed with a weapon capable of murdering the person next to him. That is not my vision of what America should be. A safe America is one in which I am assured that the person next to me cannot hurt me. Paxton is an idiot. Stephen McCluer, Far North Dallas Surely Ken Paxton misspoke when he said, ""that gunman will be taken out before he has the opportunity to kill very many people."" I understand what he was trying to say, but all lives matter. Perhaps a better comment would have been, ""We must be more vigilant with regard to those who buy guns."" This scenario is becoming all too common, and somehow, we must fix it. Bearing arms is not only a right but a responsibility to do no harm. God bless these families. Sondra Kay Baird, Plano Bravo Mr. Paxton! A politician who speaks the truth! Every mass shooter goes after ""soft targets."" This is because they are cowards who wish to inflict the greatest amount of pain without being hurt themselves. If more citizens were armed, there would be fewer of these incidents. Whether or not you wish to believe it, the only thing that will stop bad guys with guns is good guys with guns. If laws worked, there'd be no drugs on the streets. Benjamin H. Johnson, Irving It is OK for a a hunter to have his shotguns or deer rifle, but nobody needs to own an assault rifle. If you want to shoot these kinds of weapons, go to a controlled gun range and play. Katherine Fruthaler, Grapevine There has been much news recently in the media on gun violence, again. As I read and listen to those debates, I notice that it is almost always men talking and writing either for or against gun control. Those debates go on forever, are endless and will never be resolved. The only way to resolve this issue is for the women to unite once again and make it happen. Women made it happen when they rallied together to get the vote. Rosa Parks changed the course of history when she wouldn't give up her bus seat. There are many more examples, including Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), which has been very effective. The men will keep debating the issue forever and a day, and nothing will ever change. Get it together, ladies! Get organized once again, but hurry up before you lose your own husband, father, brother, son or child to a gunshot. This will never get resolved until the women get involved. Lawrence E.

https://www.inquisitr.com/4603169/miley-cyrus-sparks-outrage-sutherland-springs-texas-shooting-reaction-slams-donald-trump/,"Miley Cyrus is responding to the backlash she received for a lengthy Instagram post regarding the November 5 shooting inside a small church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, that left 26 people dead. Miley got extremely candid in her response to the massacre on the site on November 6 and even claimed that the U.S. is ""backwards,"" which inspired some very mixed responses from her fans. After hearing the news of yet another mass shooting, Cyrus wrote on the social media site this week that her ""dreams have become nightmares"" as she described the horrific shooting as ""a TERRORIST act by a WHITE AMERICAN MAN!"" Continuing, in part, that she had been left feeling ""heartbroken,"" ""embarrassed,"" and ""mortified by our country & its s****y system,"" she called for stricter gun laws and said that she was hopeful that ""the eyes of the ignorant will open and realize that (gun) VIOLENCE has to stop!"" before then signing off her lengthy message with the hashtags #F***Guns and #F***Violence. While a number of her followers supported The Voice Season 13 coach's call for stricter gun laws in the U.S., Cyrus was also met with a wave of criticism and backlash, which she then addressed in another lengthy post shortly after. After noticing that she was being called out by a number of Instagram users who responded with outrage at her comments regarding gun laws in the U.S., Miley then posted another message to the social media site in which she called out President Donald Trump and admitted that she was ""aghast"" by the reaction her previous post got.  Miley then claimed that those who called her out for her previous comments were ""not focused on the horrific tragedy"" but claimed that they were instead ""angered"" by the fact that she shone ""a BIG bright spotlight on the fact it was a 'WHITE AMERICAN MALE' terrorist."" Cyrus, who vowed to leave the U.S. if Trump was elected and broke down in tears in a video posted to social media following the election results, then continued by referencing the 2016 presidential election and Trump's win over Hillary Clinton last year. ""All of a sudden.... 'we are all equal,' 'human is human,' 'skin color doesn't matter,' 'makes no difference if they were male or female' BUT those things absolutely matter when someone completely legitimate is running for president (versus someone who isn't),"" Miley added, referring to Clinton and Trump.  Cyrus then continued to call out those who criticized her previous post about gun violence in the wake of the tragedy in Texas on the social media site, claiming that they were more worried about themselves than the victims of the recent attacks on U.S. soil. ""All of you are so focused on protecting yourself, you've completely forgotten that you're not the only one that has to live in this country or on this planet! Aren't you exhausted?"" Miley asked. ""I am f***ing sick and tired of starting everyday with tears and in mourning! Let's unite! Trump never needed to build a wall for us, we've done it ourselves! Love!""   Miley then posted screen captures of the same messages to her Twitter page on November 6, where they received a combined 24,000 likes and more than 6,500 retweets. Cyrus continued to defend her position even further by posting a few photos of some of her favorite white males, including her dad, Billy Ray Cyrus, and her two brothers, Trace and Braison Cyrus, to Instagram. She explained that she refuses to stereotype or generalize people and urged her followers to do the same. What do you think of Miley Cyrus's controversial response to the Sutherland Springs, Texas, mass shooting and her subsequent hit back at the haters who called her out for her initial post?

https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2017/11/05/texas-church-rampage-thoughts-prayers-leave-gun-control-side-frustrated,"newsPolitics By Nicole Cobler and Todd J. Gillman 6:45 PM on Nov 5, 2017 CST Updated with President Trump's comments from Japan and Attorney General Ken Paxton's call for more widespread access to guns. WASHINGTON — The Sutherland Springs church massacre reopened a gun control debate that has raged for decades, erupting with fresh vigor with each new tragedy. Five weeks have passed since a rampage in Las Vegas left 58 people dead, and the arguments and battle lines were still echoing in Congress. But the history of mass shootings in America suggests that this one — the worst in modern Texas history — won’t lead to changes, either. Gun control advocates predicted that Las Vegas would be a turning point for restrictions on guns — in particular on bump stocks, a device found in the shooter’s hotel room that allows rifles to be fired at nearly automatic rates. It hasn't so far. A bipartisan push to ban bump stocks seems to have stalled in Congress. The House has yet to hold a committee hearing. Within hours of Sunday’s shooting, Democratic lawmakers renewed their pleas for action aimed at limiting the damage one gunman can inflict. “The shooter turned his gun on people — kids — in a place of worship. America is in the grips of a gun violence crisis. Congress must act,” tweeted Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the party's deputy Senate leader. The shooter turned his gun on people -- kids -- in a place of worship. America is in the grips of a gun violence crisis. Congress must act. https://t.co/CIJX3jM3Tq Gun control advocates, including Barack Obama when he was president, have long chafed at the standard formulation provided by politicians in the immediate aftermath of a mass shooting: calls for thoughts and prayers. The National Rifle Association and other gun advocacy groups held off making public comments in the hours after the Sutherland shooting. Texas attorney general Ken Paxton was quick to push back against calls to curb access to guns, and predicted that no legal restrictions would stop such attacks. ""This is going to happen again,"" he told Fox News on Sunday, arguing that anyone willing to commit murder is also willing to violate gun laws, and that Texas' concealed carry law reduces the risk of mass murders. ""If it's a place where somebody has the ability to carry, there's always the opportunity that gunman will be taken out before he has the opportunity to kill very many people."" The White House and House Speaker Paul Ryan were among the national leaders offering prayers. President Donald Trump, traveling in Japan, called the ""horrible and murderous attack"" an ""act of evil."" He spoke with Gov. Greg Abbott hours earlier and received regular updates from aides. ""All of America is praying to God to help the wounded and the families of the victims. We will never, ever, leave their side, ever,"" the president said. Reports out of Texas are devastating. The people of Sutherland Springs need our prayers right now. As quickly as ""thoughts and prayers"" poured out, so did frustration at that message, which gun control advocates view as a method of deflection even as shootings grow more deadly. Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, a group that demands gun restrictions, blasted Abbott and other defenders of gun rights. And she noted the irony of invoking the power of prayer after a massacre at a church. ""If thoughts and prayers alone prevented gun violence, we wouldn't be shot in places of worship,"" she tweeted. If thoughts and prayers alone prevented gun violence, we wouldn't be shot in places of worship. God calls on us to ACT. #SutherlandSprings Abbott's 2014 Democratic opponent, Wendy Davis, tweaked him Sunday night for so ardently supporting gun rights that two years ago he encouraged Texans to buy more guns because California claimed bragging rights as the state with the most per capita purchases. That might stir liberals but isn't likely to boost the political price in Texas for supporting gun rights. Reminder of this: https://t.co/5P1wkjdRoq After the Vegas shooting, Republicans turned aside pleas for action as premature. Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the second-ranking member of the Senate, said ""politicizing this tragedy is beyond disgusting,"" and like other Republicans, he waited days before addressing Democrats' calls for gun restrictions. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey was among the Democrats ramping up pressure Sunday night. ""We are not powerless to reduce gun violence in our nation. Congress must act,"" he tweeted. Heartbroken for the victims in Texas and their families. We are not powerless to reduce gun violence in our nation. Congress must act. But even some lawmakers who have long pushed for restrictions avoided taking the issue head-on Sunday — to avoid preemptive criticism of anyone seen to be politicizing a tragedy. “This horrific act against innocent people at a place of worship leaves yet another community reeling from the heartache and devastation caused by gun violence,” said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, a Houston Democrat who made no mention of her longstanding desire for restrictions on certain firearms. “My thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families, the first responders, and the people of this small community who are now reeling from this senseless attack.” After the Las Vegas attack, the NRA, the White House and many high-profile Republicans initially called for a crackdown on bump stocks, but later shifted the focus from federal legislation to pressuring the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for a regulatory approach. ATF is responsible for making classification decisions on firearms. It approved the bump stock in 2010, deeming it a lawful accessory, rather than a modification that turns a lawful weapon into an unlawful automatic weapon. Even public attention on the aftermarket device has dwindled. Google trends search data on ""bump stocks"" dropped back to pre-shooting levels two weeks after the Las Vegas massacre, CNN reported. To the dismay of those calling for restrictions, that pattern has played out for years after every mass shooting. Gun control advocates had hoped that the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Conn., might provide the momentum needed to expand background checks and ban assault weapons. But Congress rejected nearly every gun control measure proposed in the aftermath of the tragedy and since then. Since Sandy Hook, where a gunman killed 20 children and seven adults, 27 states have passed 93 laws expanding gun rights. In Texas, gun owners now can openly tote their handguns and carry concealed guns onto public university campuses. And Sunday’s shooting brought back memories of the June 2015 church shooting in Charleston at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, where nine people were killed by 21-year-old Dylann Roof. Democrats called for regulations that would close the loophole that allowed Roof to buy a pistol despite a recent arrest on a felony drug charge. A measure, known as the Background Check Completion Act, has yet to gather enough support to make it through the House or Senate. Now, Congress is poised to vote on the Sportsmen's Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act, or SHARE, which includes a provision to ease restrictions on silencers. Sport hunters, with backing from lawmakers in both parties, have pushed the measure as a way to protect hunters' hearing. Critics say that muffling the sound of firearms would make it harder for police and victims to detect the source of an attack and could have made the Las Vegas massacre even worse. The bill was delayed after a shooter fired on Republican lawmakers at a congressional baseball practice in June. The bill made it through committee but has not been scheduled for a vote by the full House. And the Trump administration is considering shifting oversight of gun exports from the State Department to the Commerce Department, treating guns more like commodities and less like weapons. At the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, executive director Josh Horwitz voiced frustration Sunday at the lack of progress since the Las Vegas massacre — and the artful deflections used by gun rights advocates and their allies in Congress. “We went through the worst mass shooting in modern American history just over a month ago. Politicians offered their `thoughts and prayers’ tweets,” he said. “This uniquely American cycle must stop. Americans are slain in their houses of prayer and all their elected officials will offer is prayer. We must do more.” Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic Party, also spoke of thoughts and prayers after “the horrific shooting in Texas.” He alluded to a call for restrictions. “In the last 35 days, we've witnessed two of the worst mass shootings in American history. We cannot allow those who wish us harm to so easily turn their hatred into violence,” he said. To the dismay of gun control advocates, some deadly episodes result in increased public demand for expanded gun rights. After the 1991 Luby's massacre in Killeen, one of the survivors, Suzanna Gratia Huff — whose parents were among the 24 people killed by gunman George Hennard — was elected to the Legislature. She had left her gun in a purse in her car to avoid running afoul of state law, and in Austin she become a leading advocate of the right to concealed carry. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi argued Sunday night that the growing list of mass shootings should prompt action in the other direction. ""We have a solemn obligation to the victims of Sutherland Springs, Las Vegas, Orlando, Newtown and the many tragic shootings that occur each day to respond not only with prayer and unwavering love, but with action,"" she said.
