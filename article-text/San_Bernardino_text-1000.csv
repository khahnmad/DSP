The Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood shooting was a shock but, sadly, not a surprise.  In the past four months, at least four separate groups have warned that the undercover video campaign from the Center for Medical Progress (CMP), which alleged that Planned Parenthood illegally profited from its fetal tissue donation program, could result in an escalation of violence against abortion providers. In a July 31 application (PDF) for an injunction against CMP founder David Daleiden and his organization, the National Abortion Federation (NAF) noted that there were already telling warning signs of anti-abortion violence, just 17 days after the release of the first undercover video. In addition to relaying death threats received by Planned Parenthood doctors, the NAF noted that their security staff had received “an increase in ‘off’ hour requests for security advice from its members” and that they had advised abortion providers to “be on heightened alert.” Most immediately concerning, however, was the NAF’s claim that “incidents of harassment at Planned Parenthood facilities increased nine fold in July, compared to reported incidents in June, and the reported incidents of harassment were even more numerous in August.” NAF President and CEO Vicki Saporta noted a “dramatic increase” in harassment since July 14, and recounted phone calls to clinics in which people made “threats [that] they are going to kill every doctor at the facility.” “Let’s pull a Columbine,” one caller allegedly said.In an interview with The Huffington Post, Saporta said, “In my 20 years at NAF, I have never seen such a volume, intensity, and escalation of hate speech, threats, and criminal activity, and we would like to prevent a serious violent act from occurring.” Law enforcement was also concerned about an increased risk of violence following the release of the CMP videos. In September, CBS reported that an FBI Intelligence Assessment warned that “it is likely criminal or suspicious incidents will continue to be directed against reproductive health care providers, their staff, and facilities.” The document further noted that a recent uptick in criminal or suspicious incidents following the CMP videos was “consistent with the actions of lone offenders using tactics of arsons and threats all of which are typical of the pro-life extremist movement.” One of the nine incidents they listed was in Denver.Planned Parenthood itself has also warned about the effects the videos could have on a culture of anti-abortion extremism, despite the fact that the organization has been repeatedly cleared of allegations of criminal wrongdoing.On Nov. 10, a little over two weeks prior to the shooting, Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards told Katie Couric that vandalism had increased at affiliates around the country, making it challenging to recruit clinicians.“Given this current environment and the hostility that some of the extremists have and their willingness to kind of go to these depths to shame doctors, it’s very tough,” Richards said. Then there are the high-profile incidents themselves. There have been four arsons or attempted arsons at Planned Parenthood since July—a pattern that prompted anti-abortion terrorism expert David S. Cohen to tell the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Hatewatch, “It’s scary to contemplate what might happen next.” Cohen was one of a group of 32 attorneys who signed a letter to California Attorney General Kamala Harris in July warning that the video campaign posed “a real threat to abortion provider safety.” “Given the unique risks that abortion providers face of being targeted by anti-abortion extremists, abortion providers whose images and names are blasted across the Internet in this fashion face grave threats to their and their family’s safety,” the letter read. After months of warning from multiple organizations, there has finally been a high-profile attack on an abortion provider that resulted in loss of life. On Nov. 27, Robert Lewis Dear entered the Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs with “duffel bags full of rifles and handguns” and allegedly killed a police officer and two civilians. In the history of violence against abortion providers, this could be the first murder since the 2009 assassination of Dr. George Tiller and the closest event to “a Columbine” since 1994 when John Salvi fatally shot two receptionists in two different Massachusetts abortion clinics within minutes of each other. Until Dear goes to trial, it will be impossible to pinpoint the precise catalyst for the shooting and difficult to say if or how closely he was influenced by the CMP videos. Since the shooting, Cecile Richards has stopped short of attributing Dear’s alleged actions to current anti-abortion rhetoric while still warning of an “incredible escalation of harassment and intimidation” at abortion clinics.We can reasonably assume, however, that Dear had at least caught wind of the conversation around the CMP’s allegations against Planned Parenthood. Two law enforcement sources told NBC News that Dear said, “No more baby parts,” after being taken in for questioning. “Planned Parenthood Uses Partial-Birth Abortions to Sell Baby Parts” was the title of the first CMP video and #PPSellsBabyParts was the hashtag through which that video spread on social media. And on Tuesday, an anonymous source who had extensive conversations about religion with Dear told the The New York Times that the accused gunman described those who attacked abortion providers as doing “God’s work” and called the Christian terrorist organization Army of God, which has claimed responsibility for several bombings and abortion clinic attacks, “heroes.”Based on the Army of God website, the admiration appears to be somewhat mutual. Their description of the Colorado Springs shooting currently reads, “These murderous pigs at Planned Parenthood are babykillers [sic] and they reap what they sow. In this case, Planned Parenthood selling of aborted baby parts came back to bite them.” No matter Dear’s precise motive, his alleged act of violence at an abortion provider could prove to be the most extreme in decades. Based on NAF statistics, (PDF), Dear stands accused of killing as many people in seven hours in an abortion provider as have died from anti-abortion violence in the previous 20 years combined. And whatever led Dear to walk through the doors of the Colorado Springs clinic last Friday, the political climate following the Colorado Springs shooting is already eerily reminiscent of previous killings in anti-abortion history, with some of the most extreme voices on the right walking a fine and dangerous line in their response to the shooting.On Tuesday, RedState founder and conservative pundit Erick Erickson wrote, “It really is surprising more Planned Parenthood facilities and abortionists are not being targeted.” “Given the public light shed on the atrocities committed by Planned Parenthood and both the government and media’s turning a blind eye to it, dismissing it, laughing it off, or lying about it, it really should be surprising that Americans convicted of the need to stop the murder of children have not taken the law into their own hands,” he continued. But one development in the Colorado Springs shooting is troublingly different from past cycles of violence and rhetoric. As The New Yorker noted Tuesday, Dear does not fit the standard profile of previous anti-abortion killers, most of whom professed ties to groups like Operation Rescue, which is now funding the CMP, and Army of God. Pro-life leaders in Colorado Springs have said that they are not familiar with Dear and his online writings have yet to turn up any clear links to anti-abortion groups. And unlike past shootings, many of which clearly targeted specific doctors, Dear’s alleged actions—with the present limited information, at least—seem to have more in common with recent mass shootings at schools, churches, and other public venues than they do with anti-abortion assassinations.Dear’s case, then, could be a continuation of past violence at abortion providers but he could also prove to be something even more alarming: a new face of anti-abortion extremism in the age of the mass shooting.Either way, one of the most frightening things about Dear is just how many people seem to have seen him coming from so far away."

December 2, 2015 Guns must be on a lot of Christmas lists this year, as the FBI processed a record number of background checks on Black Friday. The 185,345 checks easily exceeded past records set after mass shootings. This makes Black Friday 2015 the largest single day for firearm background checks, which provide a rough estimate of gun sales, FBI spokesman Stephen Fischer confirmed to Fortune. Black Friday is not a lone wolf statistic for 2015. The FBI has reported record monthly background checks for every month this year since May. The FBI has not yet announced the number of checks for November, but the high number on Nov. 27 indicates that it will probably break November records as well. While the number of background checks offers a good estimate for gun sales, it probably does not precisely correlate with the number of guns purchased. Not everyone checked bought a gun on Black Friday, as some sought checks as part of obtaining concealed carry permits and others bought multiple guns at once. The previous record for gun checks in a single day was Dec. 21, 2012, a week after a mass shooting occurred at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. The Black Friday 2015 stat beat that record of 177,170 by 8,175 checks, and gun checks for the 2015 holiday season are already up by almost 10 percent from last year, according to the National Rifle Association (NRA). ""This year is poised to eclipse 2013’s record-setting total of 21,093,273,"" according to a press release from the NRA. The new record resulted from one major impetus for gun sales converging with another. Black Friday is typically a big day for gun sales, and Cabela's and other gun retailers were advertising deals for firearms as part of their regular Black Friday lineup. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Mass shootings inspire gun sales, as well, because gun enthusiasts take a ""now or never"" approach in fear that gun control will clamp down, says Mr. Fischer from the FBI. Out of the top 10 record-setting days for background checks prior to Black Friday 2015, the FBI reports, four came in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shootings and three were set during Black Friday sales. The Christian Science Monitor reported: Guns sales spiked in 2008 and 2012 following US President Barack Obama’s elections, as the Monitor has reported in 2013. Why? In fear of new restrictions, more people purchase guns sooner rather than later. President Obama has pushed for more laws on gun control throughout his presidency. The FBI launched the National Instant Criminal Background Check System in 1998 because of a mandate in the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993, according to the FBI website. The system requires that firearm sellers get a federal license. Before each sale, the cashier calls or, more recently, uses an online E-check system, to check the prospective buyer for a criminal record. In the last decade, the agency has carried out more than 100 million checks – and denied more than 700,000 applications. Already a subscriber?

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives.

http://www.inquisitr.com/2604322/black-friday-gun-sales-crush-2015-record/,"Every year, Black Friday is the official start of holiday shopping, and it would appear that gun sales took part in the record 2015 season. While most people were out buying televisions and iPads, many were getting background checks and buying guns. Last week, the FBI reportedly processed a record number of background checks most likely related to Black Friday gun sales, according to the Huffington Post. Averaging two per second, the FBI received 185,345 background check requests in one day, Black Friday 2015.   It is not unusual for record number background checks on Black Friday. FBI data show previous spikes the day after Thanksgiving in 2013 and 2012, as well. The FBI initially estimated 190,000 background checks would be performed on Black Friday 2015. Last Friday's single-day record was set the same day that a shooter in Colorado killed three people and injured nine others in an attack at a Planned Parenthood office. The previous record high for background screenings in one day was 177,170 on December 21, 2012, just days after the Sandy Hook massacre in Connecticut. Gun sales also increased during the week after terrorists struck the city of Paris last month. Whether or not an attack similar to the one in France can happen in the U.S. or someone closer to home takes innocent lives, people are obviously concerned about personal safety and respond by purchasing a gun. ""It puts a scare in an individual, it takes something like that to shake people up in a way,"" said Timothy Dilcher, a gunsmith with Frazier's Tactical Firearms. In the wake of the Planned Parenthood shooting, some are demanding increased government oversight when it comes to gun sales. On Saturday, President Obama triggered additional debate on gun control regulation by calling guns ""weapons of war.""  After the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act was enacted in 1998, the FBI has been running background checks prior to a gun sale. Since then, more than 220 million requests have been sent to the agency. The numbers recorded by the FBI do not include private gun sales, which do not require background checks. A recent study put out by Harvard estimates that 40 percent of gun buyers never go through a background check. The number of guns owned by Americans is currently estimated at 310 million. Although there were five percent more screenings Friday than the same day in 2014, a background check doesn't necessarily mean a gun was purchased. Some background checks resulted in a denial or were for a concealed carry application. Fortune reports that the FBI background check statistic is used by gun manufacturers to gauge the overall growth or decline of the industry. Despite some sales not being monitored, background check statistics are currently the best measure available to track the number of guns sold in the U.S. With a record number of FBI screenings on Black Friday 2015, most analysts agree that gun sales reached a record peak on that day as well.

http://www.mercurynews.com/opinion/ci_29189727/robert-w-nichelini-blame-california-lawmakers-cops-stolen?source=rss,"Trending: A number of stories have appeared in Bay Area media decrying the theft of guns from police and federal officers. Yet, every story has missed a key point and failed to identify the real problem. Guns end up being stored in officers’ cars because officers often have no other alternative and the California State Legislature has failed to fix the problem. Police officers are expected to be vigilant and prepared to take appropriate action on or off duty. In order to be prepared to protect themselves and others, off-duty officers need — and in some departments are expected — to be armed. This was never a problem until the proliferation of metal detectors and prohibitions against bringing weapons into various buildings and other venues, even by police officers.  Since an officer often cannot know in advance where weapons are prohibited, guns end up being stored in the only alternative available: his or her car. Before I retired as chief of the Vallejo Police Department I ran into this problem with a local amusement park. Park management had a prohibition against bringing weapons into the park by anyone. Armed off-duty officers entering the park were left with no other alternative other than to leave their weapons locked in a vehicle. At that time, I approached the California State Legislature and attempted to get a bill introduced that would exempt police officers from rules barring weapons in so-called secure areas or require installation of secure storage facilities anywhere where weapons are necessarily prohibited. The bill never got out of committee. Metal detectors and weapons-free areas will not stop an armed and determined subject. That scenario was clearly demonstrated in 1998 when two United States Capitol Police Officers stationed at a Capitol Building metal detector were shot and killed. Metal detectors only assure police officers and law-abiding citizens are not armed, and criminals know that. The Legislature can easily resolve this problem. The way it is now, officers are expected to protect themselves, their families and the public but are not given the support they need to accomplish that. What would the public reaction be if someone needed help and an off-duty officer was unable to react because he or she was unarmed and not prepared to intervene? Almost every mass shooting that you have read about lately could have been stopped had an armed police officer been present and equipped to take action.

http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/02/san-bernardino-california-shooting,"First published on Wed 2 Dec 2015 19.51 GMT A couple have been killed in a police gun battle hours after they took part in a mass shooting that left at least 14 people dead and 17 wounded in San Bernardino, California.  Syed Farook and his partner Tashfeen Malik were shot dead by police officers following a car chase through the streets of the city. Police said Farook and Malik, aged 28 and 27, were intercepted and a gun battle with more than 20 officers left their dark SUV riddled with bullets and both suspects dead. The chase came about four hours after Farook left a gathering of fellow public health employees of San Bernardino county where he worked. Police said he was angry and departed early, only to return with his partner. Both were heavily armed. The attack at the Inland Regional Center, which lies 60 miles (95km) east of Los Angeles, was the deadliest shooting on US soil since the Sandy Hook school massacre in 2012. The San Bernardino police chief Jarrod Burguan said one officer was shot in the gun battle and was transported to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Two rifles and two handguns were found in the SUV. During the hunt for the couple a third person was taken into custody, but police said they were confident the couple were the only ones responsible for the killings. The attack started at about 11am local time. Most of those killed or injured were in one area of the building, police said. The building was evacuated in the aftermath; people were taken across the street to a golf course, where some were given initial treatment for their injuries. Hours after the attack police continued to search a house in the neighbouring city of Redlands believed to be connected to Farook. A number of controlled explosions were heard by people at the scene. Officials of the Los Angeles Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) held a media conference on Wednesday night “unequivocally condemning” the mass shooting. An emotional Farhan Khan, introduced at the Cair conference as the brother-in-law of Farook, told the assembled media: “I just cannot express how sad I am for what happened. Condolences to the people who lost their life … I’m very sad, and to the victims out there I wish a speedy recovery to them. I have no idea why he would do something like this. I’m in shock myself.” Muzammil Siddiqi, chairman of the Islamic Council of South California, expressed his “sadness and sorrow” for those killed and injured: “We are in solidarity with them.” Hussam Ayloush, the executive director of Cair in the Los Angeles area said Farook and and Malik left their baby daughter with Farook’s mother in the nearby city of Redlands on Wednesday morning, telling her that they were going to attend a doctor’s appointment for Malik. Ayloush told CNN that the Farook family “have no reason [about] what made him snap. Was it workplace related? Is it mental illness? Is it some twisted ideology? It is really unknown to us. All they [the family] can do is share with everybody sorrow and prayers.” David Bowdich, the assistant director in charge of the LA field office of the FBI, said he could not rule out terrorism as the reason for the killings. “I know one of the questions that will come up is ‘is this terrorism’, and we don’t know that for sure. It is a possibility but we don’t know that yet and we’re not willing to go down that road yet,” he said. Burguan, the police chief, said: “We do not have a motive.” He told the media the shooters had entered the center “as if on a mission”, adding: “They came in with a purpose … We have no information to indicate that this is terrorism in the traditional sense; obviously at a minimum we have a domestic terrorism situation.” Alex Vasquez, an NBC4 cameraman who was driving nearby when a call from his newsdesk redirected him to the scene, said he arrived as shooting still resounded through the building. “They were the last shots fired,” he said later. “People were running,” Vasquez continued. “People had been shot in the back, arms, chest. I saw a woman who was badly injured. She was on the ground, struggling. I saw her take her last breath.” Vasquez shook his head. “These were people who got up in the morning and went to work and ended up in their worst nightmare.” Marybeth Field, a member of the board of trustees at Inland Regional Services, said that on any given day the facility had 500 employees on site. She said the San Bernardino county public health department had rented a conference center for a Christmas party on Wednesday. She had a meeting at the center scheduled for Wednesday morning but had not yet arrived when the shooting began. A local man told ABC7 that he had received a text from his daughter saying: “Shooting at my workplace. People shot. In the office waiting for cops. Pray for us.” She said she was locked in an office. There were reports of Swat team officers in the social services building and aerial photographs of people leaving the building with their hands in the air. Soon afterwards all courts, government buildings and schools in the county were put on lockdown. Nancy Lungren, assistant director of communications for the California department of developmental services, said the Inland Regional Center was one of 21 facilities in the state that helped to coordinate services and support people with developmental disabilities including autism and cerebral palsy. “And it can make all the difference,” Lungren said. “They try to keep them in a community, living at home or living in an apartment.” Police advised residents to avoid the area near Orange Show Road and Waterman Avenue. Early witness reports described three gunmen wearing ski masks and camouflage and carrying rifles, but police later said they were confident a man and a woman were the only ones responsible. This was the 342nd mass shooting in the US this year, according to Shootingtracker.com, a site that records all incidents with four or more victims (including the shooter). Together, those shootings left at least 447 individuals confirmed as dead and 1,292 injured. On Friday three people were killed and nine injured in an attack on a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Barack Obama condemned the latest mass shooting – and the lack of political action to prevent them taking place – in an interview with ABC News. “We have a pattern now of mass shootings in this country that has no parallel anywhere in the world,” the president said. Congress could do more to “improve the odds that they don’t happen as frequently”, he said. Chris Murphy, the Connecticut senator who had just been elected when the 26 people were shot dead at Sandy Hook elementary school in 2012, leading him into a campaign for gun control, summed up the feelings of many on social media: Oh god.  Not again.  #SanBernardino Additional reporting by Paul Lewis in San Francisco"

	Variety Staff Follow Us on Twitter UPDATED: At least 14 people were killed and 17 others were injured in San Bernardino, Calif. when up to three shooters opened fire on Wednesday at a health facility during a holiday lunch for county health department personnel. Two suspects in the shooting, one male and one female, were killed after a gun battle with police on a San Bernardino street later Wednesday afternoon. A third suspect was still at large, while police had surrounded a residence in the nearby town of Redlands. The shootings occurred  at the Inland Regional Center, about 60 miles east of Los Angeles. The facility at the provides services for people with development disabilities. The suspects, reportedly armed with long rifles, fled the scene in a dark-colored SUV.  CNN, Fox News and MSNBC went wall-to-wall with coverage Wednesday as details emerged from local affiliates in Los Angeles. ABC, CBS, and NBC also extended their evening news programs to accommodate for coverage.  A SWAT team, which happened to be training nearby, responded rapidly and cleared the building immediately. According to CNN, a bomb squad located a suspicious package on the center’s second floor that was determined “not normal.” “We should come together in a bipartisan basis at every level of government to make these rare as opposed to normal,” President Barack Obama said on Wednesday in an interview that aired on CBS News. “We have a pattern now of mass shootings in this country that has no parallel anywhere else in the world. And there’s some steps we could take, not to eliminate every one of these mass shootings, but to improve the odds that they don’t happen as frequently. Common sense gun safety laws, stronger background checks and you know, for those who are concerned about terrorism of, you know, some may be aware of the fact that we have a no fly list where people can’t get on planes, but those same people who we don’t allow to fly could go into a store right now in the United States and buy a firearm and there’s nothing that we can do to stop them. That’s a law that needs to be changed.” UPDATE: Dozens of people filed out of center, holding hands in air; others being treated https://t.co/Ekf6Acw6jM pic.twitter.com/mfmBapCOwP — ABC7 Eyewitness News (@ABC7) December 2, 2015  Scene is still active in #SanBernardino.

Hours after the shootings, authorities spotted a dark-colored SUV not far from the original crime scene and attempted to detain those inside. Following a high-speed chase, two suspects -- a man and a woman -- were shot, NBC News reported, citing law enforcement officials.

Those suspects died at the scene, officials said, but a third person fled into a residential neighborhood, where police brought in a K-9 unit and conducted a house to house search. That person was ultimately taken into custody but it wasn't clear whether they were connected to the San Bernardino attack, police said.
Investigators had been looking for a dark-colored SUV that eyewitnesses said was the getaway vehicle for gunmen at the Inland Regional Center -- a developmental services complex -- immediately after the suspects opened fire at a holiday party, killing 14 and injuring 17. The pursuit began after police attempted to investigate a house in nearby Redlands.

The two suspects killed by police were later identified as Syed Farook, 28, and Tashfeen Malik, 27. The third suspect has not been identified.
Farook was a U.S. citizen and health inspector with San Bernardino County's health department for five years. He was described as quiet and polite by fellow employees.
Co-workers said Farook, a devout Muslim, had recently traveled to Saudi Arabia and returned married to Malik, whom he'd met online. The couple also had a baby. When the pair were killed by police in Wednesday's shootout, they each had a .223-caliber DPMS Model A15 or Smith and Wesson M&P15 assault rifle and a semiautomatic handgun, at least two of which were bought legally in the United States.
""I have no idea why he would he do something like this. I have absolutely no idea. I am in shock myself,"" said Farhan Khan, Farook's brother-in-law.
Police said Farook was with colleagues earlier in the day at a holiday party at the center, then left angrily shortly before the shooting began at about 11 a.m. local time.
San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said at a news conference that up to three gunmen entered the facility and began shooting people inside.

""Upwards of 14 people that are dead and upwards of 14 people who are wounded,"" Burguan said, also noting that hundreds of people inside the facility escaped unharmed. ""These people came prepared to do what they did as if they were on a mission.""
A police representative later updated the injured toll to 17 -- 10 of whom they said were critically wounded.
An FBI representative said at the news conference that investigators were unsure whether the shootings are terror-related. The Los Angeles Times reported that at least one of the suspects is a U.S. citizen.
One report said the suspect or suspects were heavily armed and wore tactical body armor, although San Bernardino police did not immediately confirm that detail.
One source told CNN the shooting occurred in a conference center at the facility.
The bomb squad removed three devices from the center that Burguan described as ""leaning a little bit more toward a pipe bomb type design.""
Authorities urged residents to stay away from the scene as they attend to the injured and search for suspects. Several schools nearby were placed on lockdown.
SWAT team members combed the area searching for perpetrators. Multiple agencies -- including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the California Highway Patrol -- assisted local authorities in the case, officials said.

Law enforcement officials also interviewed everyone in the immediate vicinity of the scene and prevented them from leaving the perimeter in the event a suspect was among them.
The San Bernardino Board of Supervisors convened an emergency meeting Wednesday afternoon to settle on a course of action to handle the mass shooting, NBC Los Angeles reported.
The Inland Regional Center, a private nonprofit facility, aids persons with developmental disabilities in San Bernardino and nearby Riverside County.
""This is wrong. Why would they target an agency that deals with helping handicapped people?"" asked one man who has a relative who is employed at the complex.
""My prayers are with the victims, families and survivors of this horrific attack,"" Rep. Pete Aguilar, San Bernardino's federal representative, said. ""My heart aches that the out-of-control gun violence epidemic has come to our community.""
Other politicians also responded to the shootings with shock and sadness -- and in some cases, frustration.
""What more evidence do you need that we need to step it up as it relates to gun safety in this state?"" Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom said. ""It is just unacceptable what is going on in this country. And California needs to lead the way.""

President Barack Obama, who has repeatedly advocated stricter gun laws, was briefed on the shooting Wednesday afternoon -- as was Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton.
""I refuse to accept this as normal. We must take action to stop gun violence now,"" Clinton tweeted.
""Enough is enough,"" Democratic candidate Martin O'Malley tweeted. ""It's time to stand up to the NRA and enact meaningful gun safety laws.""
""California shooting looks very bad,"" GOP candidate Donald Trump tweeted. ""Good luck to law enforcement and God bless. This is when our police are so appreciated!""

http://www.ibtimes.com/stocks-drop-mass-shooting-california-adds-investors-worries-2208745,"U.S. stocks closed sharply lower Wednesday as a shooting in Southern California added to investor jitters about rising interest rates and oil prices that dipped below $40 a barrel. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Standard & Poor's 500 index had fallen sharply earlier in the day, led by drops in energy shares, after comments by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen suggested the U.S. central bank may be ready to raise rates. The Nasdaq fell into negative territory, despite record highs in Alphabet, Amazon and Netflix. Yahoo jumped after reports the company could sell its core Internet business. The energy index was down 3 percent as U.S. crude oil futures hit a two-week low below $40 a barrel. The utility index was down 2 percent. Utilities tend to underperform in a higher-rate environment. In prepared remarks to the Economic Club of Washington, Yellen said she was ""looking forward"" to a rate hike that would be seen as a testament to the economy's recovery from recession. She did not indicate if she still expected an increase would be warranted at the Fed's policy meeting Dec 15-16. Yellen also expressed confidence in the U.S. economy. Earlier in the day, data showed U.S. private employers boosted hiring in November. The U.S. government monthly jobs report is due Friday. ""I was a little surprised she sounded as hawkish as she did given we're two days away from the non-farm payrolls report and a couple of weeks away from the Fed FOMC meeting,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. ""The market is still digesting a couple of different things."" The Fed said in its Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide that the U.S. labor market tightened modestly in recent weeks with some upward pressure on wages. Yellen also is due to testify on the economic outlook before a joint congressional committee Thursday. Shares of Amazon touched a record high of $684.82, while those of Netflix rose as much as 4.8 percent to $131.35. Airline shares rose after Delta Air Lines said it earned more per mile in November than a year ago."

But the official said the contact was with ""people who weren't significant players on our radar,"" dated back some time, and there was no immediate indication of any ""surge"" in communication ahead of the shooting. (California Department of Motor Vehicles via AP)  SAN BERNARDINO — At least two heavily armed attackers opened fire on a holiday banquet at a social services center for the disabled Wednesday, killing 14 people and seriously wounding more than a dozen others in a precision assault that looked “as if they were on a mission,” authorities said. About four hours later, police hunting for the killers riddled a black SUV with gunfire in a shootout 2 miles from the late-morning carnage, and a man and woman with assault rifles, handguns and “assault-style clothing” were killed, San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said. They were later identified as 28-year-old American Syed Farook and 27-year-old Tashfeen Malik, whose city of residence was unknown. But, police did state she was in some kind of relationship with Farook. A third person who was spotted running near the gunbattle was detained, but Burguan said it was unclear if that person had anything to do with the crime. The shooting at the social services center occurred at a celebration for workers, not the disabled. It was the nation’s deadliest mass shooting since the attack at a school in Newtown, Connecticut, three years ago that left 26 children and adults dead. At a press conference late Wednesday, Burguan said no motive had been determined yet in the shooting, but that authorities had not yet ruled out terrorism. He said investigators could confirm earlier rumors that Farook was at the party when he was involved in an altercation and left the event upset. “We all know when these types of things happen that a lot of information comes out in the first few days and it changes significantly in days following,” he said. But, he added, the shooting did not appear to be random. “Based on the nature of the incident, there had to have been some degree of planning that went into this,” Burguan said. The FBI is investigating several possible motives, including workplace violence and terrorism, according to David Bowdich, assistant director of the bureau’s Los Angeles office. He did not elaborate. Farhan Khan, who is married to Farook’s sister, told reporters he last spoke to his brother-in-law about a week ago. He said he was in shock and had “absolutely no idea why he would do this.” The attackers invaded the Inland Regional Center about 60 miles east of Los Angeles and began shooting around 11 a.m. Wednesday. They opened fire in a conference area that the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health had rented out for an employee banquet, said Marybeth Feild, president and CEO of the nonprofit center. Police spokeswoman Sgt. Vicki Cervantes said witnesses reported seeing one to three gunmen.Burguan later confirmed that there only appeared to be two shooters in the incident, whereas officers had worked much of the day under the impression there had been three. As gunfire echoed through the large three-building complex, several people locked themselves in their offices, desperately waiting to be rescued by police. Some texted or telephoned their loved ones and whispered to them what was going on. “People shot. In the office waiting for cops. Pray for us. I am locked in an office,” Terry Petit’s daughter texted him. Petit, choking back tears as he read the text for reporters at the scene, said his daughter works at the center, where social workers find jobs, housing and transportation and provide other services to people with disabilities such as autism, cerebral palsy and epilepsy. According to its web page, the center has a client base of more than 30,000 people with developmental disabilities and their families. It is a privately run nonprofit, the largest of its kind in California with about 670 employees. Ten of the wounded were hospitalized in critical condition, and three were in serious condition, Fire Chief Tom Hannemann said. That the violence happened at a place dedicated to helping people with developmental disabilities — even if they were not targeted — made it even harder for some to comprehend. “These are all disabled kids, very disabled,” said Sherry Esquerra, who was searching for her daughter and son-in-law, both of whom work at the center. “She gets all the services she possibly could for these kids. So I just don’t understand why somebody would come in and start shooting.” FBI agents and other law enforcement authorities converged on the center and searched room to room for the attackers. Triage units were set up outside, and people were wheeled away on stretchers. Others were marched from the building with their hands up so that police could search them and make sure the attackers weren’t trying to slip out. They had indeed escaped. One witness, Glenn Willwerth, who runs a business across the street, said he heard 10 to 15 shots and then saw an SUV with blacked-out windows pull out “very calmly, very slowly” and drive off. As the manhunt dragged on, stores, office buildings and schools were locked down in the city, and roads were blocked off. About four hours later, with police looking for a dark SUV, officers staking out a home in the nearby city of Redlands saw a vehicle matching that description. Public records show the home is a possible residence of a family member of Farook. Authorities pursued the SUV, and a gunbattle broke out around 3 p.m., authorities said. One officer suffered a minor injury. The aftermath of the shootout was captured live by television news helicopters. Each of the dead had a rifle and handgun and was wearing tactical clothing, including vests stuffed with ammunition magazines, said Agent Meredith Davis of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. An explosive device was found at the social service center, and during the car chase, the couple hurled a fake bomb — a metal pipe stuffed with cloth — out of the SUV, she said. President Barack Obama was briefed on the attack by his homeland security adviser. He said it was too early to know the shooters’ motives but urged the country to take steps to reduce mass shootings, including stricter gun laws and stronger background checks. “The one thing we do know is that we have a pattern now of mass shootings in this country that has no parallel anywhere else in the world, and there’s some steps we could take, not to eliminate every one of these mass shootings, but to improve the odds that they don’t happen as frequently,” Obama told CBS. The shooting sounded like “an organized plot,” and preliminary information seems to indicate that “this is personal, and there seems to suggest some element of revenge and retaliation,” said Erroll G. Southers, director of Homegrown Violent Extremism Studies at the University of Southern Californiaand a former FBI agent. “What it says to me, it’s someone who’s familiar with the facility, it’s someone who knew exactly what room they were going to go to. They knew exactly which way they needed to escape,” Southers said. “They’ve done their homework.” The social services center has two large buildings that require a badge to get in, said Sheela Stark, a member of its board of trustees. However, the conference room where many public events take place — including the banquet Wednesday — is usually left open when visitors are expected. Olivia Navarro said her daughter, Jamile Navarro, a case manager at the social service center, called her and whispered that she was taking cover in a locked room. “Of course you’re going to be quiet, so we hung up,” she said. “I said, ‘All right, I’ll be there, turn off the lights, don’t make a sound.’ And that was it.” The daughter made it safely out of the building.

http://www.sfgate.com/nation/article/Sales-of-guns-spiked-on-Black-Friday-FBI-says-6671051.php,"Gun bargains were apparently a big draw on Black Friday. As news of a deadly standoff in Colorado Springs overshadowed America’s unofficial shopping holiday, the FBI was busy processing about two firearm background checks per second. The agency ran a record 185,345 background checks Friday, about 5 percent more than the amount processed through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System on that day in 2014, a figure that is seen as a strong indicator of how many guns were sold, the Associated Press reported. But since about 40 percent of all gun sales are through unlicensed dealers, that figure probably underestimated how many firearms actually changed hands, said Jon Vernick, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. The federal system checks the records of people trying to buy a firearm from a licensed dealer, but it is not required for those purchasing from many small-scale, unlicensed retailers who sell in places like the gun shows that were held in Texas, Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, Missouri and other states Friday. In 2015, record numbers of background checks have been reported month after month. In October, more than 1.9 million background checks were processed. That month, stocks for two major gun manufacturers soared after President Obama called for tougher gun laws in the wake of a mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, the Guardian reported. Despite all the gun shopping this year, other measures indicate that the number of U.S. households with guns has declined over the past four decades."
http://www.ibtimes.com/san-bernardino-shooting-how-define-domestic-terrorism-era-mass-shootings-hate-groups-2208851,"After Wednesday's mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, police confirmed that there were as many as three suspects, one of whom was killed and two of whom were in a standoff with police Wednesday afternoon local time. “At a minimum ... we have a domestic terrorism situation,"" San Bernardino police Chief Jarrod Burguan told reporters. So far, descriptions of the suspects -- let alone their motives -- are scant. Some eyewitnesses reported that the men wore ski masks and body armor as they carried out the brutal attack at the Inland Regional Center, a social services facility. In the hours after the shooting, police combed the area, shut down government buildings, and urged local residents to lock their doors. Despite the many unknown factors in the shooting, observers seized on Burguan’s comment that this was an act of domestic terrorism. Because the suspects chose a nonprofit, government-funded agency -- and police seemed concerned that another government building might be the next target -- the shooting brought to mind previous domestic terror attacks, perhaps most notably the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. 12 dead from attack on center for disabled kids in #SanBernadino. Another attack on a women&#39;s clinic in Houston. Domestic terrorism is REAL.  Local police enforcement is calling it domestic terrorism. Of course it is.  Will never understand why they won&#39;t classify these mass shootings acts of domestic terrorism...  With a staff of nearly 700, the Inland Regional Center is a nonprofit agency that works with more than 30,200 people with developmental disabilities “to normalize” their lives by “facilitating needed supports for them,” according to the agency’s website. This year alone, there have been 351 mass shootings in the United States. So what, exactly, turns a mass shooting into an act of domestic terror? According to the FBI, “domestic terrorism” is defined by several characteristics, but the most salient detail is that the attack is used “to intimidate or coerce a civilian population ... to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion ... or to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping.” While police hunted for the suspects in Wednesday’s attack, experts cautioned that it was too soon to ascribe particular motivations or labels to the shooting. Militia and patriot groups are on the rise, say data from the Southern Poverty Law Center.  Photo: SPLC However, it is worth noting that the “antigovernment ‘Patriot’ movement” is on the rise. In 2013, the Southern Poverty Law Center set out to document a precipitous rise in these American hate groups. Their findings were disturbing. In 2000, the SPLC documented 607 hate groups. By 2012, that number had grown to 1,007. The SPLC also found that in 2000, there were 72 far-right militia groups, and 194 armed patriot groups. By 2012, those numbers increased to 321, and 1,360, respectively. While the motivations of the San Bernardino shooters were still unknown, what is known is that acts of domestic terror -- as defined by the FBI -- appear to be on the rise. Since the Oklahoma City bombing, there have been “over 100 domestic radical-right plots, conspiracies and racist rampages,” Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the SPLC, noted in the report."
http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/126244001/0/usatodaycomnation-topstories~Voices-Our-apathy-about-gun-violence-is-staggering/,"COLORADO SPRINGS – Standing amid yet another community shattered by gun violence, I'm left with the unshakable belief that Americans are actually OK with it. How else can we explain the lack of a broad-based outcry to Do Something when it comes to men with guns killing their fellow citizens? How, in the wake of yet another mass shooting Wednesday – this time in San Bernardino, Calif. – to explain that even as the president calls for reducing gun violence, we buy more guns? Sure, some politicians and activists will make the same perfunctory calls for background checks and maybe restrictions on high-powered rifles. Others might make a nod toward incrementally better mental heath care. But other politicians are already saying that Planned Parenthood maybe brought a shooting upon itself, and that you can't really ever stop a determined man with a gun without getting rid of all guns, and we're never going to do that. As many of my friends point out, even in countries with virtually no guns, such as Great Britain, gun deaths still occur. The first mass shooting I ever covered took place in Dunblane, Scotland. It remains the worst. USA TODAY Obama mourns passing of Saudi king Friday's shooting at Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs is the second mass shooting I've covered in two months for USA TODAY. I was in Roseburg, Ore., in the hours after a young man killed nine people in his college classroom. And earlier this year I watched as jurors decided to spare the life of James Holmes, who killed 12 people in a suburban Denver movie theater in 2012 – a shooting that I began covering just hours after his gunshots ended and tears were still falling. USA TODAY Obama mourns passing of Saudi king Last year, I walked among the stunned Fort Hood community in Texas as it grappled with the deaths of three soldiers and the wounding of 12 others at the hands of an Army specialist who then killed himself. Covering all of those shootings brings to mind a bitingly accurate headline from the satirical news site The Onion: ""'No Way To Prevent This,’ Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens."" USA TODAY Obama mourns passing of Saudi king When word came Wednesday of the San Bernardino attack, President Obama had some strong words for the situation. ""Some may be aware of the fact that we have a no-fly list where people can't get on planes,"" Obama said. ""But those same people who we don't allow to fly could go into a store right now in the United States and buy a firearm and there's nothing that we can do to stop them."" USA TODAY Obama mourns passing of Saudi king An exasperated Obama has said before that he wants to do something, but he's focusing on using an executive order, rather than persuading Congress to act. He knows lawmakers don't really want to change anything. ""This is not normal,"" the president says of gun violence. Respectfully, I disagree. Our country was born in armed revolution only a few hundred years ago, and the link between an armed American public and the success of that revolution is clear. We made it even clearer by writing into our country's founding documents that we have a God-given right to our guns. And by God we love them. As my colleague Nick Penzenstadler reported earlier this week, federal officials conducted more than 185,000 background checks on Black Friday, reflecting gun purchases that were happening even as a man shot up a Planned Parenthood clinic, killing a cop and two other people during a five-hour standoff. MYCENTRALJERSEY Branchburg sets forum to discuss affordable housing Guns are an integral part of American culture and life, and the vast majority will never harm anyone. As a society, however, we've accepted that some guns will kill innocents. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, who knows well the toll that gun deaths take on innocents, says he's not ready to give up trying to reduce them. He argues that empathy is a cornerstone of democracy, and that if we don't care enough about innocent strangers being gunned down to actually change anything, well, ""we've got a real problem."" But I'm not sure Americans really see gun violence as a problem. Polls show that while slightly more than half of Americans say they want stricter limits on gun sales, it sure doesn't feel like the majority of us really want to do anything differently. We've simply accepted, as a culture, that innocents will die every day to protect our way of life. It's the price we pay to ensure no one will ever take this country by force. And it's a cost we are clearly willing to pay. Hughes is a Denver-based reporter for USA TODAY. Follow Hughes on Twitter @trevorhughes    "
http://www.eurweb.com/2015/12/president-obama-speaks-on-the-san-bernardino-mass-shootings-watch/," *In Washington, President Obama has reacted to the mass shooting, in San Bernardino, California that claimed 14 lives and injured 14 others on Wednesday. In an interview with CBS News, here is what the president had to say: “Obviously, our hearts go out to the victims and their families.” “The one thing we do know is that we have a pattern now of mass shootings in this country that has no parallel anywhere else in the world.” “There are some steps we could take – not to eliminate every one of these mass shootings – but to improve the odds that they don’t happen as frequently. Common sense gun safety laws, stronger background checks.” “For those who are concerned about terrorism, some may be aware of the fact that we have a no-fly list where people can’t get on planes, but those people we don’t allow to fly could go into a store right now in the United States and buy a firearm and there’s nothing that we can do to stop them. That’s a law that needs to be changed.” “My hope is we are able to contain this particular shooting, and we don’t yet know what the motives of the shooters are. What we do know is that there are steps we can take to make Americans safer, and that we should come together in a bi-partisan basis on every level of government to come together to make these rare as opposed to normal.” “We should never think this is something that just happens in the ordinary course of events, because it doesn’t happen with the same frequency in other countries.” https://youtu.be/e4MjwoC6e_A Heard obama this morning speak about the shooting in california. What happened there , yes it was tragic. So again he starts off with gun control. Look…as i hear him talk , in the background you can hear people . which to me are the news reporter’s and crew saying yeah? Yes? On the gun control and banning of automatic weapons. Look they are semi automatic, not automatic. In the background you can hear camera taking pictures of president as he speaks, well those are full automatics. Why does law enforcement need full automatic weapons. Only the military should have them. Also obama likes to help other country’s with weapons full automatic to semi types, so thats no different. He’s aiding to the killing of people in other country’s with our u.s. made weapons. But no one reports on that! Weapons regardless of type, from a tree branch- kitchen utensils- junk yard scrap metal- bb gun- pallet gun – bolt action rifle – revolver pistol- vehicles all etc anything can be used as a weapon. So obama check yourself. We the gun right owners will not fold for you obama or any entity with gun control regulations. We have the right to protect and defend ourselves from ALL. The people who DONT WANT GUN CONTOL ARE REPUBLICAN AND THEY LIKE THESE CONSTANT MASSACRES SO MY PRESIDENT SHOULD STOP TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS IS BECAUSE THEY DONT UNDERSTAND AND HES WASTING HIS TIME. Thank God only a few Blacks are usually caught up in these massacres and as far as ISIS WHY IS IT THE REPUBLICANNS ARE SO QUICK TO PUT OUR ARMY IN HARMS WAY WHEN the Syrians, the Turks the Kurds or Rusiaia is willing to put their men on the ground to fight for that land and they live over wIth ISIS. WHY IS IT THE U.S. HAS TO CARE LESS ABOUT ITS MEN SAFETY EVERY TIME. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/DRsA1R2CFyo/,"Multiple shooters opened fire in a San Bernardino, Calif., center for the developmentally disabled on Wednesday, in an attack that police believe left as many as 14 people dead and another 14 injured. It was the 352nd mass shooting this year—at least according to an often-cited database on the website Reddit. But depending on your definition of “mass shooting,” that number is either highly misleading or spot on. The truth is that there’s no widely accepted definition for what amounts to a “mass shooting” and therefore no trusted central database for the number of incidents that occur in the U.S. The Mass Shooting Tracker, compiled by Reddit users, defines “mass shooting” as four or more people either killed or injured, including the gunman. But that definition is often criticized for being overly broad. The FBI, for instance, defines “mass killings” as “three or more killings in a single incident” and defines “active shooter” as “an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area.” And the FBI’s definition is criticized by some for compiling too few shootings. In a 2014 report, the FBI said it had identified a total of 160 “active shooter” incidents and only 43 “mass killings” between 2000 and 2013. It doesn’t keep any sort of real-time database that can be publicly accessed. Until there are definitions widely accepted  by government agencies and the general public, there will be conflicting and unsatisfying numbers on shootings in America. The only thing we might be able to agree on is that there are too many. Contact us at letters@time.com."
http://feeds.inquisitr.com/~r/google/yDYq/~3/Iq-I0k5OaD0/,"Today, in a San Bernardino medical center dedicated to helping those with disabilities, the U.S. encountered domestic acts of terrorism. Here's the problem at the moment. Not ISIS. From reports, allegedly, three gunmen entered the facility and opened fire on those within the building. Totally unexpected, on what appeared to be an ordinary Wednesday, at least 20 people were shot in this mass shooting. There are still people inside the building, locked in panic rooms. Likewise, there are officers still on the scene checking each room, says K-CAL 9 News. With all the public, mass shootings that have happened — and seem to continue, as well as all the seemingly ignored church burnings — it would appear that this country's problem is and has already been here within itself. Why is the United States and many of its citizens concerned with a foreign threat while its domestic issues are swept under the rug and ignored? Just last week, there was a domestic attack on a Planned Parenthood building. In the San Bernardino incident, police chief Jarrod Burguan, in a public interview, mentioned that ""upwards of 14 people are dead,"" reports K-CAL 9 News. Sure, the Islamic State has validly threatened the safety of the U.S. and its residents. However, domestic tragedies like this have been happening long before and during ISIS's foreign acts of terrorism, elsewhere, outside of the United States. How is it that many United States citizens are more concerned with a threat that's not even in our faces yet? That's comparable to a little boy who's afraid of a bully from a school in another state while a local bully gets ignored, is it not? While the hype is focused on foreign terrorism, we have domestic terrorists wreaking havoc on American people. This is where the nation's energy should be concentrated. Not somewhere across the Atlantic or the Pacific oceans. One of the mass shooting victims, Garrett Lacroix, interviewed with K-CAL 9 News and mentioned the horrors he experienced, as follows.  — Amanda Bazemore (@AmandaBazemore) December 2, 2015  — Amanda Bazemore (@AmandaBazemore) December 2, 2015  ""Preliminary information suggests that these were individuals who came prepared,"" says police chief Burguan. Likewise, it was tipped that the shooters — who were described as wearing military, tactical gear and being armed with assault rifles — exited the IRC Conference Center and fled northbound on Waterman Avenue, in a black GMC Yukon. Burguan even mentioned during the public press conference that, ""at minimum, this is a domestic terrorism issue...they came in with a purpose...they came in with the intent to do something,"" reports K-CAL 9 News. Authorities are still evacuating the building. However, all victims are coming out with their hands up. This is because authorities are unsure if any gunmen are still among the victims.  — Brad Tatum (@BradTatum) December 2, 2015  — Brad Tatum (@BradTatum) December 2, 2015  If you remember the Denzel Washington movie Inside Man, you might remember that — when all the victims were rescued from the shooters' custodies — the suspects were actually dressed and acting hysterical as everyone else. So, police were unable to distinguish between the two.  — Lashell Valadez (@LashellValadez) November 28, 2015  — Lashell Valadez (@LashellValadez) November 28, 2015  Also, there's assumed to be a bomb on the San Bernardino location as well, reports K-CAL 9 News. SWAT is on the scene to defuse the situation. The Federal Aviation Administration has set a flight restriction that was even enforced in the area. Helicopters aren't able to fly below 6,000 feet, says CBS-12 News. As far as finding family members, San Bernardino police sergeant Vicki Cervantes mentioned that family members are urged to go to the Hernandez Center on 3rd Street and Sierra Way in order to get information about their families.

http://www.ibtimes.com/san-bernardino-update-majority-us-mass-shootings-involve-lone-gunman-data-shows-2208754,"The U.S. faced another mass shooting Wednesday as authorities worked to piece together events in San Bernardino, California. As many as three gunmen may have been involved in the attack, authorities said. Data from the Mass Shooting Tracker, a crowd-sourced initiative, showed that the majority of shootings in the U.S. are committed by individuals, or so-called lone gunmen. The Mass Shooting Tracker counts the number of people shot (not necessarily killed), and defines a mass shooting as those in which four or more people are shot in one setting or incident. The data analyzed spanned 2013 to 2015.  Of a total of 1,050 shootings recorded across the U.S., 760 were categorized as having an unknown gunman or woman. In the 290 cases where authorities were able to identify shooters, 251 were committed by lone shooters. There were 32 recorded cases involving two shooters. Five cases involved three shooters while only two cases involved four shooters. ""On The Media,"" an NPR program that focuses on journalism practices, issued a reporting guide in 2013 to help media consumers understand how to best read reports during mass shootings. The guide warns, “There’s almost never a second shooter.”  Recent high-profile shootings in the U.S. have involved lone gunmen. Robert Lewis Dear, 57, killed a police officer and two civilians in Colorado Springs, Colorado, when he opened fire at a Planned Parenthood healthcare facility Friday. Dylann Roof, 21, opened fire at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, killing nine people June 17 in what has been described as an attack fueled by racist ideology. Over the history of mass shootings in the U.S., several well-known cases have involved multiple shooters who plotted the attack together, including the 1999 Columbine High School shooting in Colorado that left 12 students and one teacher dead. The shooting was committed by fellow students Dylan Klebold, 17, and Eric Harris, 18, who committed suicide at the scene. The multiple shooters apparently involved in the San Bernardino case raised the question of whether the incident constituted domestic terrorism."

(California Department of Motor Vehicles via AP)  SAN BERNARDINO — At least two heavily armed attackers opened fire on a holiday banquet at a social services center for the disabled Wednesday, killing 14 people and seriously wounding more than a dozen others in a precision assault that looked “as if they were on a mission,” authorities said. About four hours later, police hunting for the killers riddled a black SUV with gunfire in a shootout 2 miles from the late-morning carnage, and a man and woman with assault rifles, handguns and “assault-style clothing” were killed, San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said. They were later identified as 28-year-old American Syed Farook and 27-year-old Tashfeen Malik, whose city of residence was unknown. But, police did state she was in some kind of relationship with Farook. A third person who was spotted running near the gunbattle was detained, but Burguan said it was unclear if that person had anything to do with the crime. The shooting at the social services center occurred at a celebration for workers, not the disabled. It was the nation’s deadliest mass shooting since the attack at a school in Newtown, Connecticut, three years ago that left 26 children and adults dead. At a press conference late Wednesday, Burguan said no motive had been determined yet in the shooting, but that authorities had not yet ruled out terrorism. He said investigators could confirm earlier rumors that Farook was at the party when he was involved in an altercation and left the event upset. “We all know when these types of things happen that a lot of information comes out in the first few days and it changes significantly in days following,” he said. But, he added, the shooting did not appear to be random. “Based on the nature of the incident, there had to have been some degree of planning that went into this,” Burguan said. The FBI is investigating several possible motives, including workplace violence and terrorism, according to David Bowdich, assistant director of the bureau’s Los Angeles office. He did not elaborate. Farhan Khan, who is married to Farook’s sister, told reporters he last spoke to his brother-in-law about a week ago. He said he was in shock and had “absolutely no idea why he would do this.” The attackers invaded the Inland Regional Center about 60 miles east of Los Angeles and began shooting around 11 a.m. Wednesday. They opened fire in a conference area that the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health had rented out for an employee banquet, said Marybeth Feild, president and CEO of the nonprofit center. Police spokeswoman Sgt. Vicki Cervantes said witnesses reported seeing one to three gunmen.Burguan later confirmed that there only appeared to be two shooters in the incident, whereas officers had worked much of the day under the impression there had been three. As gunfire echoed through the large three-building complex, several people locked themselves in their offices, desperately waiting to be rescued by police. Some texted or telephoned their loved ones and whispered to them what was going on. “People shot. In the office waiting for cops. Pray for us. I am locked in an office,” Terry Petit’s daughter texted him. Petit, choking back tears as he read the text for reporters at the scene, said his daughter works at the center, where social workers find jobs, housing and transportation and provide other services to people with disabilities such as autism, cerebral palsy and epilepsy. According to its web page, the center has a client base of more than 30,000 people with developmental disabilities and their families. It is a privately run nonprofit, the largest of its kind in California with about 670 employees. Ten of the wounded were hospitalized in critical condition, and three were in serious condition, Fire Chief Tom Hannemann said. That the violence happened at a place dedicated to helping people with developmental disabilities — even if they were not targeted — made it even harder for some to comprehend. “These are all disabled kids, very disabled,” said Sherry Esquerra, who was searching for her daughter and son-in-law, both of whom work at the center. “She gets all the services she possibly could for these kids. So I just don’t understand why somebody would come in and start shooting.” FBI agents and other law enforcement authorities converged on the center and searched room to room for the attackers. Triage units were set up outside, and people were wheeled away on stretchers. Others were marched from the building with their hands up so that police could search them and make sure the attackers weren’t trying to slip out. They had indeed escaped. One witness, Glenn Willwerth, who runs a business across the street, said he heard 10 to 15 shots and then saw an SUV with blacked-out windows pull out “very calmly, very slowly” and drive off. As the manhunt dragged on, stores, office buildings and schools were locked down in the city, and roads were blocked off. About four hours later, with police looking for a dark SUV, officers staking out a home in the nearby city of Redlands saw a vehicle matching that description. Public records show the home is a possible residence of a family member of Farook. Authorities pursued the SUV, and a gunbattle broke out around 3 p.m., authorities said. One officer suffered a minor injury. The aftermath of the shootout was captured live by television news helicopters. Each of the dead had a rifle and handgun and was wearing tactical clothing, including vests stuffed with ammunition magazines, said Agent Meredith Davis of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. An explosive device was found at the social service center, and during the car chase, the couple hurled a fake bomb — a metal pipe stuffed with cloth — out of the SUV, she said. President Barack Obama was briefed on the attack by his homeland security adviser. He said it was too early to know the shooters’ motives but urged the country to take steps to reduce mass shootings, including stricter gun laws and stronger background checks. “The one thing we do know is that we have a pattern now of mass shootings in this country that has no parallel anywhere else in the world, and there’s some steps we could take, not to eliminate every one of these mass shootings, but to improve the odds that they don’t happen as frequently,” Obama told CBS. The shooting sounded like “an organized plot,” and preliminary information seems to indicate that “this is personal, and there seems to suggest some element of revenge and retaliation,” said Erroll G. Southers, director of Homegrown Violent Extremism Studies at the University of Southern Californiaand a former FBI agent. “What it says to me, it’s someone who’s familiar with the facility, it’s someone who knew exactly what room they were going to go to. They knew exactly which way they needed to escape,” Southers said. “They’ve done their homework.” The social services center has two large buildings that require a badge to get in, said Sheela Stark, a member of its board of trustees. However, the conference room where many public events take place — including the banquet Wednesday — is usually left open when visitors are expected. Olivia Navarro said her daughter, Jamile Navarro, a case manager at the social service center, called her and whispered that she was taking cover in a locked room. “Of course you’re going to be quiet, so we hung up,” she said. “I said, ‘All right, I’ll be there, turn off the lights, don’t make a sound.’ And that was it.” The daughter made it safely out of the building.

Less than a week ago, we had the shooting in Colorado. And look at all the things going on around the world, ISIS and groups like this, just hatred and evil. We need to be able to combat these things, because otherwise we will melt into despair, and that’s not who we are.” Asked to explain why he said the shooting should be classified as a hate crime, Carson replied, “It’s hard to imagine you would shoot a bunch of people if you didn’t hate them, right? You don’t do that to people you love.” The shooting in Southern California killed at least 14 and left 17 wounded, according to reports. The suspects have not been identified and their motive remains unknown. Missing out on the latest scoops?

Everything just stops,” Rimando said. “This is an area that is very close to my heart. It is where I’m from and where I grew up. It means even more because you worry so much for the people you know and everybody else. “I have friends and family who are here, and I have friends in the police department who are involved in what is going on. I have a close friend who is on one of the SWAT teams right now that is involved.” USA TODAY Obama mourns passing of Saudi king Rimando said his law enforcement friends are with the nearby Fontana Police Department. “It is horrible to think that there are terrible people who would do this kind of thing, and you want them to be caught, but you just want the people you care about and for no one else to get hurt ,” Rimando told USA TODAY. Rimando, 36, grew up in Montclair and spent his childhood in the Inland Empire. He is the goalkeeper for Real Salt Lake in Major League Soccer. He was the No. 3 goalkeeper for the U.S. at the World Cup last year. Police have said at least 14 people were killed and 14 injured after three gunmen opened fire at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino."
http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/the-other-mass-shooting-that-happened-today-plus-a-look-at-the-59-since/2256241,"The rampage that claimed at least 14 lives in San Bernardino, Calif., isn't today's first mass shooting. Here's news you probably missed: A gunman in Savannah, Ga., shot four people early Wednesday, killing a woman and injuring three men. Police haven't arrested a suspect, said Eunicia Baker, spokesperson for the Savannah Chatham Police Department. They also haven't released the names of the victims, and the three men are expected to recover. There was little acknowledgment of the incident in news media: One local television station covered the shootings in three paragraphs. And the world spun on. Then news broke that multiple attackers opened fire at a center for disabled adults in San Bernardino — a center that just hosted its holiday party yesterday. Suddenly, the little-noticed crime in Georgia became the second mass shooting in a single day — and the third since Robert L. Dear Jr. opened fire at a Planned Parenthood clinic last week in Colorado springs. After the Colorado Springs shootings, President Barack Obama declared that this type of violence must not ""become normal."" But as the Washington Post's Chris Ingraham points out, the data show that mass shootings are already normal. There have been more mass shootings than calendar days this year. News reports collected by a Reddit community show there have been 355 mass shootings in 2015. The Mass Shooting Tracker, as its called, differs from other shooting databases in that it uses a broader definition than the FBI's old four-fatality rule: If bullets strike four people in the same attack, that's a mass shooting. The big ones, of course, attract the national media, comments from the president, cries of terrorism. The small ones . . . well, they have become just another police report in the United States. The Mass Shooting Tracker The San Bernardino shooting would be the 355th mass shooting this year, according to a mass shooting tracker maintained by the Guns Are Cool subreddit. ( http://www.reddit.com/r/GunsAreCool/wiki/2015massshootings )The Reddit tracker defines mass shootings as incidents in which four or more people, including the gunman, are killed or injured by gunfire. This portion of that list reflects only the shootings since Oct. 1. It begins with shooting 296, in which a gunman killed nine people and himself at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore. 296: Oct. 1, 10 dead, 9 injured, Roseburg, Ore. 297: Oct. 1, 3 dead 1 injured, Inglis 298: Oct. 2, 1 dead 4 injured, Baltimore 299: Oct. 6, 5 injured, Baltimore 300: Oct. 9, 1 dead 3 injured, Flagstaff, Ariz. 301: Oct. 10, 4 injured, Charlotte, N.C. 302: Oct. 10, 1 dead 3 injured, Peoria, Ill. 303: Oct. 10, 5 injured, Memphis, Tenn. 304: Oct. 12, 4 injured, Dekalb County, Ga. 305: Oct. 17, 4 injured, Elkhart, Ind. 306: Oct. 17, 1 dead 5 injured, Fort Myers 307: Oct. 18, 4 injured, New Orleans 308: Oct. 19, 7 injured, Calumet City, Ill. 309: Oct. 23, 1 dead 3 injured, Nashville 310: Oct. 24, 4 injured, Bamberg, S.C. 311: Oct. 25, 1 dead 4 injured, Phoenix, Ariz. 312: Oct. 25, 5 injured, Washington, D.C. 313: Oct. 25, 5 injured, Four Oaks, N.C. 314: Oct. 25, 2 dead 2 injured, Pageland, S.C. 315: Oct. 26, 5 injured, Evansville, Ind. 316: Oct. 27, 5 injured, Fort Worth, Texas 317: Oct. 28, 1 dead 3 injured, Houma, La. 318: Oct. 31, 4 dead, Colorado Springs, Colo. 319: Nov. 2, 4 dead, Pendleton, S.C. 320: Nov. 3, 1 dead 3 injured, Jacksonville 321: Nov. 3, 2 dead 2 injured, Cypress, Texas 322: Nov. 4, 4 dead, Oakland, Maine 323: Nov. 6, 4 injured, Tallahasse 324: Nov. 6, 1 dead 3 injured, Denver 325: Nov. 6, 4 injured, Bakersfield, Calif. 326: Nov. 7, 2 dead 2 injured, Waycross, Ga. 327: Nov. 8, 1 dead 3 injured, Des Moines, Iowa 328: Nov. 8, 4 injured, Warren, Mich. 329: Nov. 9, 2 dead 2 injured, Indianapolis 330: Nov. 13, 4 dead 1 injured, Jacksonville 331: Nov. 13, 3 dead 2 injured, Southern California (multiple locations) 332: Nov. 14, 5 injured, Johnstown, Pa. 333: Nov. 15, 4 injured, Philadelphia 334: Nov. 15, 6 dead 1 injured, Anderson County, Texas 335: Nov. 16, 3 dead 1 injured, Cherokee County, Ala. 336: Nov. 16, 1 dead 5 injured, Youngstown, Ohio 337: Nov. 17, 4 dead, Calloway County, Kent. 338: Nov. 18, 5 injured, Fresno, Calif. 339: Nov. 20, 1 dead 3 injured, Pittsburgh 340: Nov. 21, 1 dead 3 injured, Baltimore 341: Nov. 22, 5 injured, Newburgh, N.Y. 342: Nov. 22, 5 injured, Seattle 343: Nov. 22, 4 injured, Chicago 344: Nov. 22, 4 injured, Brownsville, Texas 345: Nov. 22, 17 injured, New Orleans 346: Nov. 23, 5 injured, Minneapolis, Minn. 347: Nov. 23, 4 dead 1 injured, Columbus, Ohio 348: Nov. 23, 1 dead 3 injured, Houston 349: Nov. 24, 4 injured, Conway, S.C. 350: Nov. 26, 1 dead 3 injured, Boston 351: Nov. 27, 2 dead 2 injured, Sacramento, Calif. 352: Nov. 27, 3 dead 9 injured, Colorado Springs, Colo. 353: Nov. 29, 5 injured, Kankakee, Ill. 354: Dec. 2, 1 dead 3 injured, Savannah, Ga. 355: Dec. 2, 14 dead 14 injured, San Bernardino, Calif."
http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2015/12/14_dead_more_than_a_dozen_woun.html," Gallery: california-shootings SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. -- As many as three gunmen believed to be wearing military-style gear opened fire Wednesday at a Southern California social services center, killing at least 14 people and wounding more than a dozen others in what authorities described as a targeted mission. Hours later, officers blocked a dark SUV that appeared to be riddled with bullet holes on a residential street in San Bernardino. Shots were fired, and a suspect was down, police said. Police shed no light on a motive for the nation's latest mass shooting, which came five days after a gunman opened fire at Planned Parenthood in Colorado, killing three. ""They came prepared to do what they did, as if they were on a mission,"" Burguan said, noting the attackers carried long guns -- which can mean rifles or shotguns. Witnesses said several people locked themselves in their offices, desperately waiting to be rescued by police, after gunfire erupted at the Inland Regional Center, which serves people with developmental disabilities. The attack took place in a conference area where the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health was renting space to hold a banquet, said Marybeth Feild, president and CEO of the center. She said the building houses at least 25 employees as well as a library and conference center. FBI agents and other law enforcement authorities converged on the center and searched room to room for the attacker or attackers, San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said. But he said they might have escaped in an SUV. No weapons were recovered at the center, though authorities were investigating unidentified items in the building and brought in bomb squads, Burguan said. Ten of the wounded were hospitalized in critical condition, and three were in serious condition, San Bernardino Fire Chief Tom Hannemann said. Police cautioned that the number of people killed and wounded were preliminary estimates that could change. San Bernardino police spokesman Sgt. Vicki Cervantes told The Associated Press there were reports from witnesses of one to three gunmen. As the manhunt went on, stores, office buildings and at least one school were locked down in the city of 214,000 people about 60 miles east of Los Angeles, and roads were blocked off. Triage units were set up outside the center, and people were seen being wheeled away on stretchers. Others walked quickly from a building with their hands up. They were searched by police before being reunited with loved ones. President Barack Obama was briefed on the attack by his homeland security adviser. He said it was too early to know the shooters' motives, but urged the country to take steps to reduce the frequency of mass shootings. He told CBS that stricter gun laws, including stronger background checks, would make the country safer. ""The one thing we do know is that we have a pattern now of mass shootings in this country that has no parallel anywhere else in the world, and there's some steps we could take, not to eliminate every one of these mass shootings, but to improve the odds that they don't happen as frequently,"" Obama said. Terry Petit said his daughter works at the center, where social workers find jobs, housing, transportation and provide programming for people who have disabilities ranging from autism to cerebral palsy to epilepsy. He got a text from her saying she was hiding in the building after hearing gunshots. Petit choked back tears as he read the texts for reporters outside the center. He said she wrote: ""People shot. In the office waiting for cops. Pray for us. I am locked in an office."" Sherry Esquerra was searching for her daughter and son-in-law, both of whom work at the center. She said her daughter helps ""very disabled"" children and ""gets all the services she possibly could for these kids."" ""I just don't understand why somebody would come in and start shooting,"" Esquerra said. She last saw her daughter at Thanksgiving and planned to see her Friday. When she calls her phone now, ""Nothing. I just get her message. Straight to voicemail."" Marcos Aguilera's wife was in the building when the gunfire erupted. He said a shooter entered the building next to his wife's office and opened fire. ""They locked themselves in her office. They seen bodies on the floor,"" Aguilera told KABC-TV, adding that his wife was able to get out of the building unharmed. The social services center has two large buildings that require a badge to get in, said Sheela Stark, an Inland Regional Center board member. However, the conference room where many public events take place -- including the banquet on Wednesday -- is usually left open when visitors are expected.

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/126228997/0/phoenix/nation~San-Bernardino-shooting-What-we-know-now/,"Here's what we know about the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.: Suspects: Health inspector Syed Farook, 28, and the woman he lived with, Tashfeen Malik, 27 went on a shooting rampage in San Bernardino on Wednesday at a social services center, then fled the scene. After a manhunt, a Farook and Tashfeen were killed after gunfire was exchanged with police. Witnesses say Farook attended a meeting at the center before leaving angrily for reasons that are still unknown. He returned with Malik and opened fire. Manhunt ensues: After the shooting, the suspects fled the scene in a dark colored car, reports San Bernardino County Sheriff's department. Later, officers following up on a tip rushed to a home, and the suspects fled in an SUV. A police chase and a shootout followed, San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said. ""One male and one female were killed,"" Burguan said. He said the pair were dressed in military-style garb and were armed with assault rifles and handguns. One officer was wounded in the shootout, but the injuries were not life-threatening. What about the third suspect? ""There was a third person seen running away, and that person has been detained,"" Burguan said. He said it was not clear if the person was involved in the massacre. Burguan said that based on the investigation, Farook and Malik were the only shooters. Officers searching the scene of the mass shooting later found an explosive device that had not detonated. Victims: At least 14 people are dead and 17 wounded, the sheriff's department reports. Loma Linda University Medical Center says its received four adult patients from the shooting, with at least three more expected. There is no word on the condition of the victims. San Bernardino county officials tweeted that six patients are being treated at Arrowhead Regional Medical Center. Possibility of terrorism: David Bowdich, FBI assistant director in charge of the Los Angeles office, said terrorism is ""a possibility, but we do not know that yet."" The FBI is working with state and local law enforcement. ""We will go where the evidence takes us,"" he said. Location of mass shooting: The incident occurred at Inland Regional Center, which provides services for people with developmental disabilities. Marybeth Field, president and CEO of the Inland Regional Center, says the incident took place in a conference area, one of three buildings at the center, that an outside healthcare provider was renting Wednesday for a holiday party. Location of suspect shootout with police: Farook and Malik were killed on E. San Bernardino Ave., a few miles from Inland Regional Center. About Inland Regional Center: Hundreds of staff members provide services to more than 30,200 people with developmental disabilities in Riverside and San Bernardino counties. The center's clients range from toddlers to seniors. How to connect and help: The public can call 1-866-346-7632 if they have any information on the incident or gunmen.

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/126254155/0/phoenix/nation~Out-of-the-loop-today-Weve-got-what-you-missed/,"The USA just had another mass killing. Is this the new normal? Since 2006, there have been more than 200 mass killings in the United States. They happen approximately every two weeks. After each incident, there's outrage. Prayers. Arguments over what makes a lunatic. Debate over rhetoric. The ritual reciting of political talking points. And then the cycle begins again. We saw it again Wednesday after yet another mass shooting. This time, in San Bernardino, Calif. Afterward, President Obama said: ""We have a pattern now of mass shootings in this country that has no parallel anywhere else in the world."" What we know about San Bernardino so far: Location. Gunmen burst into a conference room at a social services center, began shooting and then fled quickly. A county group was renting the room. Victims. More than a dozen people are dead. More than a dozen others have been injured. Motive. We don't know yet. We do know the suspects were prepared, and they were equipped to get away. Suspects. There were reports of as many as three shooters. They had rifles and were wearing ski masks and military-style vests. Police reported Wednesday evening that at least one suspect was ""down"" but declined to give more information. USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham got audio reactions from the shooting scene today. Tests show Rio's Olympic waterways are still filthy — and dangerous Yuck. We knew the Olympic waters in Rio — host city of the 2016 Summer Games — were dirty and posed a threat to the athletes' health, but it's even worse than we thought. Results from additional tests show Rio's waterways have high viral and, in some cases, bacterial counts not only along shorelines where raw sewage runs into water bodies, but also far offshore where athletes will compete in sailing, rowing and canoeing. Since the Associated Press first reported on the dirty waters, Olympic officials and the World Health Organization have changed their minds repeatedly about what to do, making a long list of promises and retractions. Interest rates may go up for the first time in 10 years Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen signaled Wednesday that the Fed is all but certain to raise interest rates this month. Happy holidays. The Fed's benchmark rate has been near zero since the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Yellen says the economy is doing well, and she thinks the labor market is going to keep doing better. Fed policymakers, however, are divided over the timing of the hike. Some argue the Fed should hold off because a premature move could derail the recovery and expose the economy to unexpected shocks. Yellen basically said, ""I hear you,"" but if we wait too long, it could eventually require abrupt rate hikes that raise the risk of recession. Financial markets are now giving 75% odds of a rate increase. These are the songs you can't get out of your head At least when you were posting on Instagram.

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/126258081/0/phoenix/nation~Obama-US-mass-shootings-problem-has-no-parallel/,"President Obama said Wednesday's mass shooting in California is another moment of U.S. infamy that could have been prevented with stronger gun control laws. ""We have a pattern now of mass shootings in this country that has no parallel anywhere else in the world,"" Obama told CBS News after the shooting, which left at least 14 dead and another 17 wounded. ""There's some steps we could take, not to eliminate every one of these mass shootings, but to improve the odds that they don't happen as frequently."" The killers in Wednesday's shooting walked into the meeting room at the Inland Regional Center, a state-run facility for individuals with developmental disabilities, and opened fire. The motive for the shootings is unknown. Since 2006, there have been more than 200 mass killings in the United States, according to a USA TODAY analysis of FBI and police data. ""We have a no-fly list where people can't get on planes but those same people who we don't allow to fly could go into a store right now in the United States and buy a firearm and there's nothing that we can do to stop them,"" Obama said. ""That's a law that needs to be changed."" In the wake of mass shootings, Obama has often spoken of his wish for tighter gun control. He said the country needs ""common-sense gun safety laws"" and stronger background checks on people buying guns. ""There are steps we can take to make Americans safer and that we should come together in a bipartisan basis at every level of government to make these (shootings) rare as opposed to normal,"" Obama said. ""We should never think that this is something that just happens in the ordinary course of events, because it doesn't happen with the same frequency in other countries."""

With few details released from police on who the suspects were or what a potential motive could be to open fire on San Bernardino’s Inland Regional Center -- which serves people with disabilities -- Twitter users were quick to attribute the rampage to supporters of the Islamic State group, which is also known as ISIS or ISIL. Google Trends, which tracks search terms for trending topics, also found that the terms “ISIS” and “California” were heavily searched together Wednesday. #SanBernadino Terror attack in California.. Hope this is not linked to #ISIS or #SyrianRefugees in any way.. Praying pic.twitter.com/cel38uqfzi In a news conference Wednesday evening, law enforcement officials said a potential explosive device had been recovered, although law enforcement also told media it was unclear where the device was found or whether it had been brought by the suspects. Twitter users linked the device to reports last year that ISIS-affiliated online forums included instructions for making pipe bombs out of items such as Christmas lights, bleach, sugar and matches, for potential attacks to be carried out in the U.S. According to social media, this shooting in California is either because of ISIS or because of Republicans. Can we just not? It’s not the first time in recent days that California has seen ISIS surface in local news. On Tuesday, a California man pleaded guilty to planning to join the group in Syria. Nicholas Michael Teausant, 22, from Acampo -- near Stockton -- was charged with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, the Jerusalem Post reported. Teausant was arrested in March 2014 while traveling to the U.S.-Canadian border, en route to Syria to join ISIS, a statement from the prosecutor’s office alleged. The criminal complaint against Teausant said he had told an FBI informant about his plans."

The National Instant Criminal Background Check System processed 185,345 requests on Nov. 27, FBI statistics show.

That's the highest amount for a single day on record -- and almost 10,000 more than were recorded last year on the day after Thanksgiving, considered one of the year's busiest shopping days.
""This was an approximate 5% increase over the 175,754 received on Black Friday 2014,"" wrote Stephen Fischer, the FBI's chief of multimedia productions. ""The previous high for receipts were the 177,170 received on 12/21/2012.""
The previous highs for a single day and single week each occurred in December 2012, following the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.
Officials say background checks typically spike in the aftermath of mass shootings -- which means another spike may be coming in the wake of Wednesday's attack on a social services facility in San Bernardino, Calif.

Licensed gun dealers are required to perform criminal background checks on customers who wish to purchase firearms. Some sellers, though, do not -- which has recently prompted federal lawmakers to push for the elimination of a legal loophole in the federal gun laws.
Friday's numbers were logged on the same day as another mass shooting in Colorado that killed three and wounded nine others.

December 2, 2015 Updated: 9:07 P.M. ET As many as three heavily armed attackers opened fire on a banquet at a social services center for the disabled Wednesday, killing 14 people and seriously wounding more than a dozen ""as if they were on a mission,"" authorities said. The attackers escaped, setting a large region east of Los Angeles on edge, but several hours later police riddled a black SUV with gunfire two miles from the late-morning carnage. One person lay motionless on the pavement — dead or dying — with a gun nearby. Officers appeared to remove a second person from the vehicle. San Bernardino police spokeswoman Sgt. Vicki Cervantes said authorities had not immediately confirmed whether those in the SUV were involved in the morning attack. As darkness fell, law officers swarmed a neighborhood about a mile from the SUV shootout, apparently in a hunt for a possible third gunman. Officers also searched a home several miles away in Redlands. It was the deadliest mass shooting in a nation all too familiar with them since 2012, when a man killed 26 children and adults at a school in the Newtown, Connecticut. Police shed no light on a motive for Wednesday's massacre, which came just five days after a gunman opened fire at Planned Parenthood in Colorado, killing three. In what authorities described as a carefully planned assault, the gunmen invaded the Inland Regional Center, which serves people with developmental disabilities, and began shooting around 11 a.m. They opened fire in a conference area that the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health had rented out for a banquet, said Marybeth Feild, president and CEO of the center. ""They came prepared to do what they did, as if they were on a mission,"" San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said, noting the attackers carried long guns — which can mean rifles or shotguns. That the violence happened at a place dedicated to helping people with developmental disabilities made it even harder for some to comprehend. ""These are all disabled kids, very disabled,"" said Sherry Esquerra, who was searching for her daughter and son-in-law, both of whom work at the center. ""She gets all the services she possibly could for these kids. So I just don't understand why somebody would come in and start shooting."" FBI agents and other law enforcement authorities converged on the center and searched room to room for the attackers, but they had apparently escaped. Cervantes, the police spokeswoman, said there were reports from witnesses of one to three gunmen. Several people locked themselves in their offices, desperately waiting to be rescued by police, after the gunfire erupted. Some texted their loved ones or telephoned them and whispered to them what was going on. ""People shot. In the office waiting for cops. Pray for us. I am locked in an office,"" Terry Petit's daughter texted him. Petit, choking back tears as the read the text for reporters at the shooting scene, said his daughter works at the center, where social workers find jobs, housing and transportation and provide other services to people with disabilities such as autism, cerebral palsy and epilepsy. Ten of the wounded were hospitalized in critical condition, and three were in serious condition, San Bernardino Fire Chief Tom Hannemann said. Police cautioned that the numbers of dead and wounded were early estimates that could change. No weapons were found at the center, though authorities were investigating unidentified items in the building and brought in bomb squads, Burguan said. As the manhunt went on, stores, office buildings and at least one school were locked down in the city of 214,000 people about 60 miles east of Los Angeles, and roads were blocked off. Triage units were set up outside the center, and people were seen being wheeled away on stretchers. Others walked quickly from a building with their hands up. They were searched by police before being reunited with loved ones. One witness, Glenn Willwerth, who runs a business across the street, said he heard 10 to 15 shots and then saw an SUV with blacked out windows pull ""very calmly, very slowly."" Hours later, with police looking for a dark-colored SUV, an officer in nearby Redlands saw a suspect vehicle and tried to pull it over, a law enforcement official speaking on condition of anonymity said. The SUV crashed, and a gunbattle broke out around 3 p.m. President Barack Obama was briefed on the attack by his homeland security adviser. He said it was too early to know the shooters' motives, but urged the country to take steps to reduce the frequency of mass shootings. He told CBS that stricter gun laws, including stronger background checks, would make the country safer. ""The one thing we do know is that we have a pattern now of mass shootings in this country that has no parallel anywhere else in the world, and there's some steps we could take, not to eliminate every one of these mass shootings, but to improve the odds that they don't happen as frequently,"" Obama said. The shooting sounded like ""an organized plot,"" and preliminary information seems to indicate that ""this is personal, and there seems to suggest some element of revenge and retaliation,"" said Erroll G. Southers, director of Homegrown Violent Extremism Studies at the University of Southern California and a former FBI agent. ""What it says to me, it's someone who's familiar with the facility, it's someone who knew exactly what room they were going to go to, they knew exactly which way they needed to escape,"" Southers said. ""They've done their homework, they know what the response time in this jurisdiction."" Marcos Aguilera's wife was in the building when the gunfire erupted. He said a shooter entered the building next to his wife's office and opened fire. ""They locked themselves in her office. They seen bodies on the floor,"" Aguilera told KABC-TV, adding that his wife was able to get out of the building unharmed. The social services center has two large buildings that require a badge to get in, said Sheela Stark, an Inland Regional Center board member. However, the conference room where many public events take place — including the banquet on Wednesday — is usually left open when visitors are expected.

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s hard for the world to figure out. We’re run by a church, but we’re not only for church members and we’re not about converting people.

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/126255047/0/phoenix/nation~The-unlikely-scene-of-San-Bernardino-mass-shooting/,"The biggest event this week at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, Calif., a state-run facility with services for individuals with developmental disabilities, should have been its Tuesday holiday party. Instead, the center was thrust under the national spotlight Wednesday after as many as three gunmen opened fire in one of its conference rooms, killing at least 14 and wounding 21 before fleeing in a dark-colored SUV, according to the local police department. The gunmen's motives for targeting the center, which is located about 60 miles east of Los Angeles, remain unknown at this time. The San Bernardino County Department of Public Health had rented the space for a banquet, Maybeth Field, president and CEO of the social services center, told the Associated Press. USA TODAY Officials: Shooting reported at Calif. golf course The non-profit center, which is made up of three buildings, has served individuals with developmental disabilities since opening its doors in 1972. It has a staff of nearly 670 and caters to more than 30,200 individuals – ranging from toddlers to seniors – and their families in the Riverside and San Bernardino counties, according to the center's Facebook page. Field said 25 employees work in the building where the gunmen first opened fire. Along with housing, Inland Regional offers work programs, therapy and social services for those with developmental disabilities such as autism, cerebral palsy and epilepsy, among others. It aims to make them feel independent, empowered and included in ""the everyday routines and life rhythms of the community,"" according to its website. The Association of Regional Center Agencies in Sacramento, which oversees the non-profit centers, released a statement Wednesday evening, noting that the Inland center is one of California's 21 non-profit regional centers that offer assessments, case management and other services for people with developmental disabilities and their families. ""Today, multiple people were shot and killed. We do not have official information as to the names of the victims, the intended targets, or the motives behind this. As we receive confirmed information, we will update our community,"" the statement said. ""What we do have are heavy hearts, knowing innocent lives were cut short. Regional centers connect families and people with developmental disabilities to services and supports. They are places of connection and community. Any act of violence is a tragedy. But in a place focused on service to people with developmental disabilities, it is even harder to comprehend,"" it said. ""The president of our Board of Directors, Anne Struthers, put it best. 'ARCA, the regional centers, and the developmental disabilities community is united in mourning and support. The victims of today's shooting were connected to us by service to those in need. Our hearts are with all those affected,""' the statement said The center is the product of the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act, a California law that was passed in 1969 to improve services for people with development disabilities. The ""dignity, privacy and humane care"" mandated by the Legislature led to the creation of a state-wide network of regional facilities, including the Inland Regional Center, to serve those individuals.

The suspects were carrying long guns and “dressed and equipped in a way to indicate they were prepared,” San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said. “They came prepared to do what they did, as if they were on a mission,” he said. A man and a woman wearing combat-style clothing were killed in a gunfight with police on a street lined with homes, police said. Officers detained a third person, but they were still trying to determine if that person was connected to the earlier shooting. A police officer also suffered non-life-threatening injuries during the shootout, and at least 17 people were injured at the holiday event, police said. Hours after the initial shooting at about 11 a.m., the situation was still chaotic, with motives and even the number of suspects still in doubt. Police said that there had been a dispute at the holiday party that sent one person away angry, but it was unclear if that was connected to the later assault. Families gathered at a meeting place to be reunited with loved ones were told to take cover after reports of shots being fired. County and city buildings, as well as hospitals and schools were locked down, and employees were told to shelter in place for hours — an eerie echo of a mass shooting that had unfolded just days earlier in Colorado Springs.

The headline says, ""God Isn't Fixing This."" ""As latest batch of innocent Americans are left lying in pools of blood, cowards who could truly end gun scourge continue to hide behind meaningless platitudes,"" the cover reads. ""The Daily News' front page is not, in any way, shape or form, condemning prayer or religion.

Thoughts & prayers are with #SanBernardino We all are thinking about what happened in California today. Please keep the victims & their families in your prayers. Praying for the victims, their families & the San Bernardino first responders in the wake of this tragic shooting. The tweet of the Daily News' provocative front page is currently the most retweeted of 2015 for the news organization, according to Twitter. Meanwhile, Democratic presidential hopefuls, including Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, took a different tone and called for ""action"" to stop gun violence. I refuse to accept this as normal. We must take action to stop gun violence now. -H https://t.co/SkKglwQycb Mass shootings are becoming an almost-everyday occurrence in this country. This sickening and senseless gun violence must stop. President Obama underscored the need for stronger gun control laws in the United States after Wednesday's mass shooting, which left at least 14 dead and 14 wounded. ""There's some steps we could take, not to eliminate every one of the mass shootings, but to improve the odds that they don't happen as frequently,"" Obama told CBS News. Some twitter users also reacted with pleas for more government action. David Mignery tweeted @SpeakerRyan We need more from you than prayers. @SpeakerRyan We need more from you than prayers.

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/126265507/0/news-opinion~Gun-control-is-not-the-answer-Opposing-view/,"Even before the bodies were cold in the San Bernardino mass shooting, President Obama called for more gun control. He urged Congress to pass a law banning firearms purchases for people on the Transportation Security Administration’s unaccountable, unconstitutional no-fly list. Wait. What? What would that have done to prevent the slaughter? By the same token, what would any gun control law do to prevent evil people from enacting their homicidal plans, be they Chicago gang-bangers or a religious zealot attacking a Planned Parenthood clinic? Nothing. No assault weapons ban, no gun violence restraining order, no ammunition magazine capacity law would have prevented the San Bernardino slaughter. No gun control law has stopped Robert L. Dear Jr. from allegedly killing three people in Colorado. There’s only one way to stop killers from killing: Put them where they can’t get access to a gun, knife, explosives, car or any other lethal weapon. Put them in jail or a secure mental institution. How do we know whom to incarcerate, when and for how long? That’s a question worthy of debate — and due process. Certainly, criminals who commit violent offenses shouldn’t enjoy “revolving door” justice. And there are numerous examples of obviously and dangerously psychotic individuals, such as Newtown killer Adam Lanza and Aurora shooter James Holmes, who should have been institutionalized. USA TODAY Another (mass shooting) day in the USA: Our view But there will always be people who fall through the cracks. There will always be evil men among us. Truth be told, they view gun control laws with the same contempt that they view laws against murder. The incrementalist argument — that more or better gun control will derail some killers — ignores the fact that these measures make it harder for law-abiding Americans to exercise their natural, civil and constitutionally protected right to keep and bear arms. A right that protects them against those who would do them harm. As the French terrorist attacks proved, gun control doesn’t work. Worse, civilian disarmament leaves innocent people defenseless against killers. Gun control enables — rather than prevents — homicide. Robert Farago is the publisher of thetruthaboutguns.com."

Coroners arrived at the scene of the shooting, but were told not to remove the bodies due to a need to preserve the integrity of the crime scene and allow evidence to be collected, the Los Angeles Times reported. Lead supervising deputy coroner Robert Shaw said no names, ages or other information would be released about those killed until next of kin were notified. He said he expected many of the notifications to take place by Thursday.  People reuniting at the Hernandez Center after #SanBernardino shooting pic.twitter.com/HztLUs8k7l   Four adults had been admitted to Loma Linda University Medical Center and three more were expected, a spokeswoman for the hospital told the San Bernardino Sun. Other injured people were reportedly taken to other hospitals in the region. Greg Johnson was one of the people waiting at the Hernandez center for news about a family member. He told the L.A. Times he hoped his 42-year-old nephew Daniel Kaufman would be on one of the school buses that were carrying survivors. “We haven’t been able to get ahold of him,” Johnson said. “They’re saying it could be a couple of hours.”  A woman waits to reunite with her sister at Hernandez Community Center #SanBernardinoShooting pic.twitter.com/ikmHvh1sA4  Mindy Velasco was also hoping to hear news about a family member. Her sister Yvette, who is in her late 20s, works for the San Bernardino County Health Department and was expected to be in the area of the shootings Wednesday, but no one has heard from her. “I’m fearing the worst,” Velasco told the L.A. Times. “Yvette is usually in constant touch with us. She would definitely be in contact after something like this.”"
http://www.ibtimes.com/syed-farook-american-citizen-suspect-san-bernardino-shooting-identified-2209115,"Media reports identified one of the three suspects in Wednesday's mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, as Syed Farook, also referred to as Sayeed Farook. The rampage resulted in police fatally shooting two of the suspects, one of whom was identified as Farook, an American citizen, the Los Angeles Times reported. The other deceased suspect, a woman, and the third suspect, who has been detained, have not yet been identified. Public records reportedly show that a person named Syed R. Farook was employed by the San Bernardino County Health Department as an environmental health specialist, but it was unclear whether that was the same person involved with the deadly shooting. #UPDATE According to NBC News, Syed Farook has been identified as one of the possible suspects in the San Bernadino shooting.  The mass shooting occurred at the Inland Regional Center, which offers services to those with developmental and physical disabilities, and claimed the lives of at least 14 people and wounded at least 17 others. The motive behind the rampage was still unclear, and terrorism has not yet been ruled out. ""I am still not willing to say that we know that for sure,"" said David Bowdich, assistant director of the FBI, during a news conference, International Business Times previously reported. ""We definitely are making some movements that it is a possibility."" An FBI raid was underway Wednesday night at an apartment in Redlands, California, as police served a search warrant in connection with the deadly shooting at the Inland Regional Center."
http://feeds.inquisitr.com/~r/google/yDYq/~3/Jzf6MEDahoo/,"Two suspects are dead after a shootout with police on Wednesday afternoon after they committed a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, where they killed 14 people and wounded at least 17 more. The investigation is still ongoing, and many stories are coming out of the day, including a video of evacuees being led to safety by police officers in one of the office buildings. One of the officers words displayed true courage and have now gone viral. The shooting took place at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino on Wednesday afternoon as a holiday party was going on. The party was taking place in an auditorium at the center for people with developmental disabilities. So far, not everything is known, but CNN has confirmed that one male and one female suspect have been killed in a shootout with police. A third person had been detained and was being questioned about the day's events.   After the shootings were reported and police arrived on the scene, the multiple buildings at the center were being evacuated and cleared by police. As reported by KPCC 89.3, an employee in one of the buildings began recording with their phone as the armed officers were leading them to safety. The video is rather shaky and often times, the view is obstructed, but you can see the evacuees with their hands raised as officers lead the group. The sound is perfectly clear and just a short time in, you can hear one officer clearly say something extremely brave.   The building shows that the police officers weren't just doing their job in leading the evacuees to safety, but making sure they were safe. Not only that, but they were willing to put their lives on the line to make sure no other innocent lives were lost. As the evening has gone on, one of the suspects in the San Bernardino shootings has been identified as Syed (Sayeed) Farook.  — Breaking News Feed (@pzf) December 3, 2015  — Breaking News Feed (@pzf) December 3, 2015  Farook had been identified as the shooter by witnesses on the scene. He is listed as a state employee who works as an environmental health specialist in San Bernardino. There is another state employee of the same name who works as a business tax representative for the Board of Equalization in Norwalk. According to the NY Daily News, Farook's father said his son was a devout Muslin and ""very religious."" Farook's father said his son would even leave work to go home and pray, and then drive all the way back to return to work.  In the wake of the tragedy of the San Bernardino shootings, stories and videos like that of the police officer willing to take a bullet for evacuees make people believe in each other again. That video is making the rounds online now, and more like that will be needed as the tragic information of the day continues to be investigated. [Image via Twitter/ABC7]"

It was about 11 a.m. Wednesday.
The Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, where Dorothy is a nurse, conducts active-shooter drills every month or so.
Vong assumed that’s why she could see heavily armed law enforcement officers sprinting toward the building.
She walked to a window and made a cellphone video of the scene. She sent it to her husband, Mark.
On the video, a voice can be heard saying: “They’re all geared up! Rifles and everything!”
In the background, there is laughter.
Then reality intruded.
Vong texted her husband again: “Well, it’s real.”
And a few minutes later: “We’re in a locked office.”
Vong emerged unharmed. Others were not so fortunate.
Fourteen people were killed and 17 injured when gunmen opened fire on a holiday gathering inside the regional center. For parents, spouses and friends of those inside the building, cellphones were the primary source of information. Through that fragile connection, they consoled, counseled, prayed and hoped.
——
“Active shooter.”
Mary Campos, 54, received the text at 11:34 a.m.
It was from her daughter, Monica Siegers, 34, reporting that she and her co-workers were hiding under their desks, crying.
Campos turned on the TV and heard the news: There had been a mass shooting at the building where Siegers has worked for two years as a case manager for disabled adults.
“Oh, my God,” Campos thought. “It’s happening everywhere.”
She dressed and drove to the scene. The next text from her daughter reported that SWAT officers were escorting survivors to buses. But her daughter didn’t know where they were being taken, and her cellphone was running out of power.
Campos waited Wednesday at a Shell gas station not far from the regional center, looking for her daughter among the dozens of evacuees who were being led to buses. They were taken to another location to be interviewed by law enforcement officers.
“I just need to see her,” Campos said.
——
Angela Stutte stood on the corner of Waterman Avenue and Orange Show Road, near the center, clutching her phone. Her 21-year-old daughter, Miranda Stutte, had also been inside.
The younger Stutte, a vector control officer for San Bernardino County, was in a meeting when she heard shots, Angela Stutte said. The daughter locked herself in a bathroom. She emerged unharmed but told her mother that a few friends had been injured.
“I’m relieved,” her mother said. “Now we are just waiting. She has never had an experience like this.”
As she spoke, a group of women feverishly checked their phones. Their loved ones had been in the building too, they said, fighting tears.
Angela Stutte’s phone rang.
“Honey?” she said, speaking to her husband. “I’m going to wait for Miranda, OK?”
——
Olivia Navarro’s daughter Jamile called her just after 11 a.m. and told her she was hiding in a room at the Inland Regional Center, where she works as a case manager for special-needs children.
There were multiple shooters in the building, the daughter said.
Navarro told her to turn off all the lights.
Jamile followed the advice. She told everyone in the room to stay quiet too. Her phone died soon after. Unable to reach Jamile, her mother grew frantic, wondering if her daughter was among the dead.
Police later told Olivia Navarro that her daughter had been evacuated safely. The mother cried as she recalled this and said she didn’t understand why someone would open fire in a place that helps children with disabilities.
“I don’t understand it,” Olivia said as she stood down the street from the scene of the shooting.
Navarro said all she wanted was to see her daughter.
“I want to hold her and thank God that she’s alive,” she said.
——
Nerves were frayed in the waiting room at Loma Linda University Medical Center.
Kat Kit had been waiting for her daughter to come out of routine surgery at the hospital when helicopters started unloading shooting victims and emergency workers set up triage stations.
“I’m afraid, I’m scared and I’m sad,” said Kit, who lives in Fontana.
“They haven’t caught them yet,” said Linda Frankenbergen, who was waiting for her husband to come out of previously scheduled surgery.
“And that’s scary,” Kit said, “because they could come in here.”
With many streets closed and schools locked down as the manhunt unfolded, residents across the Inland Empire stayed glued to news updates and exchanged urgent calls with friends and family.
Kathy Hotetz, 37, waited anxiously outside Arrowhead Regional Medical Center in Colton. She said her sister, Denise Peraza, 27, had been inside the Inland Regional Center and was being treated for a gunshot wound.
“She’s alive. That’s all I know,” Hotetz said. “Not knowing any more than that is the scariest part.”
Among a dozen people holding hands in a prayer circle outside the medical center was Carlos Ortiz, 54, whose son Kevin Ortiz, a county environmental inspector, was shot twice in the leg and once in the shoulder.
Amid the chaos, the 24-year-old managed to call his wife of two weeks and his father to tell them he was alive.
“Kevin said he had been shot three times and that he was in pain but he was all right,” Dyana Ortiz, 23, recalled. ” Then he said ‘I love you’ and I said ‘I love you.’ ”
——
Gabriel Torres was reunited with his wife, Katrina, at the Rock Church and World Outreach Center in San Bernardino, near the shooting scene. Katrina, a social worker, was among evacuees who had been bused to the church.
Gabriel said his wife had called him about 11:30 a.m. Wednesday morning to tell him she could hear gunfire. She hid in a filing room.
They stayed on the phone for 30 minutes. She spoke in whispers. He tried to console her.
“She said she didn’t know if she would make it,” Gabriel recalled. “I was terrified.”
About 20 evacuees were gathered in the church driveway. As they waited to be reunited with loved ones, a handful of buses guided by a police escort pulled up.
A man bolted down the driveway, as fast as his legs would carry him. As his mother walked toward him, he flew into her arms.

http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/12/03/white_house_steers_clear_of_chicago_turmoil.html,"Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s mounting political problems seeped into the White House briefing room Wednesday, forcing President Obama’s spokesman to distance his boss from his first-term chief of staff. Emanuel, battling to keep his job and respond to an explosion of criticism and questions about the 2014 videotaped shooting of Chicago 17-year-old Laquan McDonald by a Chicago police officer, said Wednesday he has no intention of resigning. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, asked if the president believed Emanuel should step down, said it was “a decision for Mayor Emanuel and the voters of Chicago to make.” Obama is aware of the controversy in his adopted hometown and has viewed the recently released dashcam video of the McDonald shooting, Earnest confirmed during the White House daily briefing. “The president had the kind of human reaction that I think lots of other people across the country have had to that specific video,” Earnest added, declining to be more specific about Obama’s reaction. The president’s spokesman said Obama was wary of injecting his reactions into the public discussion about McDonald’s death and the indictment of a white Chicago police officer on charges of shooting the black teenager 16 times. He is concerned that any presidential comments could be “viewed by some as improperly interfering with an ongoing independent criminal investigation,” Earnest said. Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan this week asked the Justice Department to investigate the Chicago Police Department, and the federal government said it is reviewing the request. Justice is separately is investigating McDonald’s death. Earnest rejected assertions by critics that Obama was reluctant to speak because Chicago’s fallout involves a mayor who is a former aide, friend and occasional adviser. He denied the president was more publicly assertive after police shootings of young black men in Ferguson, Mo., and Baltimore. “The president believes that these kinds of situations should be evaluated and investigated based on the facts and based on the merits and the arguments that are presented,” Earnest said. Emanuel’s publicly stated aim to achieve reforms in the Chicago Police Department and his decision to fire Garry McCarthy, the police superintendent he hired during his first term, are evidence “the mayor has obviously confronted this situation over the course of the last week quite directly and already taken some steps to indicate his own commitment to addressing some of the problems that he has seen,” Earnest said. The controversy surrounding McDonald’s 2014 death and the lapse of 13 months before Chicago authorities released a video of police shooting him as he walked alone in the middle of a street flared in the White House just as a mass shooting took place in San Bernardino, Calif. The event filled television screens as Earnest briefed reporters. Within hours, White House Homeland Security Adviser Lisa Monaco briefed Obama, and he told CBS News that he continued to believe such carnage could be made “rare,” rather than appear to be “normal,” with the adoption in Congress of additional gun safety measures. Since 2013, Obama has proposed no new gun control legislation. During his presidency, he signed legislation allowing Amtrak travelers to carry firearms and ammunition in baggage, and in 2010 he allowed national parks visitors to carry firearms. “Common-sense gun safety laws [and] stronger background checks” would curb the frequency of such events, Obama said in reaction to the ongoing situation in California. “We don’t yet know what the motives of the shooters are.” Investigators late Wednesday reported at least 14 dead and at least 14 people injured by one or more shooters armed with long guns in San Bernardino. It was the second time in a week the president was asked to comment on shooting incidents, and his message remained the same. “There are steps we can take to make Americans safer, and we should come together in a bipartisan basis at every level of government,” he told CBS’s Norah O’Donnell.

http://www.ibtimes.com/san-bernardino-shooting-live-updates-who-farhan-khan-suspect-syed-farooks-brother-law-2209198,"UPDATE: 6:37 a.m. EST -- Two assault rifles and two handguns used in Wednesday’s mass shooting in Southern California were all purchased legally in the United States, federal authorities said, according to the Associated Press. A person who purchased two of the guns is now under investigation. Investigators are currently working to make a connection to the last legal purchaser of the guns. Meredith Davis of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives said late Wednesday that all four guns were purchased four years ago, but did not mention whether they were bought out of state or how the weapons got into the hands of the two shooters. She added that California requires paperwork when guns change hands privately unlike many other states. UPDATE: 6:06 a.m. EST -- The two suspects in Wednesday’s mass shooting in Southern California were married to each other for two years, according to reports. Syed Rizwan Farook reportedly joined colleagues at an annual holiday party for the San Bernardino County Public Health Department at the Inland Regional Center but left the event after a dispute. Later, he and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, returned dressed in tactical gear and carrying assault rifles, officials said, according to the New York Times. The motive of the shooting remains unclear, and Hussam Ayloush, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Los Angeles, urged people not to jump to conclusions. “Is it work?” Ayloush reportedly said. “Rage-related? Is it mental illness? Extreme ideology?” Farook’s work involved inspecting restaurants, bakeries and public swimming pools for the county department, according to inspection reports. Online records indicate Farook was paid about $70,000 a year, the Times reported. UPDATE: 3:01 a.m. EST -- Southern California county will close most of its offices for the rest of the week in the wake of the mass shooting at a social services facility in San Bernardino that left 14 dead. James Ramos, chairman of the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors, said only essential offices will remain open Thursday and Friday, according to the Associated Press. UPDATE: 2:05 a.m. EST -- Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the suspects involved in the mass shooting in Southern California Wednesday, traveled to Saudi Arabia earlier this year and returned with a wife, whom he met online, his co-workers reportedly said. As authorities released little information about the suspects, Farook's colleagues from San Bernardino County’s Public Health Department opened up about him. Patrick Baccari, a food inspector who shared a cubicle with Farook, told the Los Angeles Times that the 28-year-old and his wife had a baby and appeared to be “living the American dream.” Farook’s colleagues reportedly said that he was a devout Muslim, but rarely discussed religion at work. “He never struck me as a fanatic, he never struck me as suspicious,” Griselda Reisinger, who worked with Farook before leaving the agency in May, told the LA Times. Farook was present at the Inland Regional Center along with his colleagues, but reportedly disappeared just as a group photo was about to be taken. Shortly afterward, he returned to the meeting following which gunfire erupted at the venue leaving 14 people dead. UPDATE: 1:39 a.m. EST -- San Bernardino police chief Jarrod Burguan said late Wednesday that police have not ruled out terrorism as a motive in the mass shooting in Southern California. He said that, based on the armor and level of preparation, “there had to be some degree of planning in this.” Authorities reportedly said that three explosive devices found at the scene of shooting were “disposed of.” While investigators believe the devices were a “pipe bomb-type design,” Burguan could not confirm that at this stage. The suspects, who were shot dead during a police standoff, were armed with .223 caliber assault rifles as well as handguns. A police officer who was injured during the shootout with the suspects -- Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and Tashfeen Malik, 27 -- is at a hospital and is expected to survive, authorities reportedly said. Burguan also told reporters that the two suspects were in a relationship but it was unclear if they were married or engaged. According to the Associated Press, relatives have said that Farook and Malik were married. UPDATE: 1:07 a.m. EST -- San Bernardino police chief Jarrod Burguan confirmed late Wednesday the identity of the two suspects as Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and Tashfeen Malik, 27. Burguan said that 14 people were killed at the mass shooting in Southern California Wednesday and 17 others were injured. Burguan said that Farook had been employed at the public health department for five years and was briefly at the meeting taking place at the Inland Regional Center. He also said that it was unclear what relationship the two suspects shared with each other. Burguan reportedly added that he is “pretty comfortable” that the two identified were the two shooters who are now dead. He said that none of the victims have been identified yet as police have only just gained access to the shooting scene. Farook was born and raised in the United States and his parents hailed from Pakistan, Hussam Ayloush, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Los Angeles, said late Wednesday. Ayloush also said in a press conference that Farook and his wife have been missing since Wednesday morning. The couple reportedly left their 6-month-old child with the suspect’s mother, saying that they were going for a doctor’s appointment. Four hours after the shooting at the at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, California, police shot dead two suspects -- a man and a woman -- during a standoff. Original story: Farhan Khan, the brother-in-law of one of the suspects involved in the mass shooting in Southern California Wednesday, expressed regret during a conference held by the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Syed Farook has been identified as one of the suspects in the shooting at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, California, that left at least 14 dead and at least 17 injured. ""I am in shock that something like this can happen,"" Khan said, adding that he has “no idea … why he (Syed Farook) would do something like this."" He declined to comment when asked if Farook was religious. Khan, who is married to Farook's sister, Saira Khan, said that he last spoke to his brother-in-law about a week ago. He also said that he has no idea what might have motivated the attack. Muzammil Siddiqi, chairman of the Islamic Shura Council of Southern California, also expressed his “sadness and sorrow” for the victims of the shooting. “We are in solidarity with them,"" Siddiqi said, while condemning the “horrible violence,"" and urged people not to condemn Islam. At least two heavily armed gunmen opened fire at the center that serves people with developmental disabilities. Two suspects -- a man and a woman -- were killed in a police standoff four hours after the shooting. San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan reportedly said that both the suspects were armed with assault rifles, handguns and ""assault-style clothing"" when they were shot dead. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) confirmed that at least one of the four firearms retrieved by investigators was legally purchased, the Guardian reported, citing CNN. However, the name of the purchaser has not been made public. The motive of the mass shooting remains unclear. ""It's not a time for us to become angry but to realize there is a need to be very cautious,"" San Bernardino Mayor Carey Davis said late Wednesday. Davis held a press conference to offer his condolences to the families of the victims. According to the Los Angeles Times, San Bernardino County public records reveal a person named Syed R. Farook was employed by the health department as an environmental health specialist. Staff members from that department had reportedly gathered Wednesday for a party where the shooting incident took place. It was not clear if the employee was the same man as the suspect linked to the shooting. ""We become a family when this happens. Unfortunately there is a history here; it doesn’t affect just one member. There’s a lot of sympathy and reaching out now, but that needs to be sustained,"" Rep. Lois Capps, (D-Santa Barbara), said while expressing regret over the tragedy in his congressional district. New info evolving. 9pm press conference being trailed to 10:00. Appreciate everyone's patience."

Authorities later say attackers opened fire at the Inland Regional Center, a social services center that serves people with developmental disabilities, during a holiday gathering for San Bernardino County health department employees, where Farook worked. The two shooters fire assault rifles, one armed with a DPMS Model A15 and the other a Smith & Wesson Model M&P 15. They fire 65 -75 rounds.  People remain in place and hide in other parts of the building for the next two hours. Police report a dark-colored sports utility vehicle fled the scene.

The next day, Police Chief Burguan says the third person was not connected to the case. He said the 20-21 officers involved fired 380 rounds during the shootout. Police find in the black Ford Expedition that Farook had rented a total of 1,400 .223 rounds for the rifles and 200 9 mm rounds for the two handguns the two were carrying.

Smith alluded to the remarks from Obama, then explained why he thought Obama was correct. “[H]e mentioned something of this nature when he was in Paris for the climate summit when he said this is unique to the United States,” Smith said. “He got a lot of partisan push back from his political opponents.

The source of mass shootings with regularity of where they occur in the United States — you don’t find that in other countries. That’s not to say anything except that fact. You can extrapolate from that whatever you want. But that part right there that this happens in the United States more than anywhere else on earth is a true thing. That’s all there is.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thedailybeast/articles/~3/ozKmd8rhVQA/shut-up-about-san-bernardino-because-there-s-nothing-left-to-say.html,"SEARCH Columns written about the Planned Parenthood shooting were still being published as the San Bernardino killers began firing. Here’s a proposal: Let’s stop writing about them. The right and the left have both issued verdicts on what not to say after a mass shooting. The right ridicules calls for gun-safety measures. The left mocks what it perceives to be hollow nostrums about “thoughts and prayers.” I think they’re both right. I think it’s time to say nothing at all. I realized this when I discovered the most trenchant thing I’d read about San Bernardino—noting that Sandy Hook didn’t begin a national conversation about guns so much as end it—was actually written about the murders at the Emanuel AME Church. There is no way to overdramatize the speed with which San Bernardino followed Colorado Springs; it happened too fast for hyperbole. There wasn’t even time for an idea to be proposed, much less fail. Columns written about Richard Dear are still being published even as we hunt for answers about the massacre farther west. Sure, the particular gruesomeness of this crime—at a center for the disabled—seems like it might be enough to…what? What about this crime will shove the graceless leviathan of our national consciousness from the sludge-gummed track we’ve developed to deal with what should be unspeakable, unthinkable, at very fucking least rare? In the hours after the California killings, heavy traffic crashed a mass shooter database. Which is more horrifying—that so many people needed the information, or that there was so much information to be had? We have reached the point where mass shootings have a “news consumer handbook,” where the most helpful journalistic tool in covering a killing isn’t local sources so much as search-and-replace: Newsweek reporter Polly Mosendz keeps a pre-written mass shooter story fresh in her text editing files. “A mass shooting has been reported at TK, where TK people are believed to be dead and TK more are injured, according to TK police department,” it says. “The gunman has/hasn’t been apprehended.” So I propose a columnist strike, a hot take moratorium, a sound-bite freeze. The only response that could possibly match this gut-punching tragedy isn’t made up of words but silence. I envision blank blog posts, empty sets, magazine pages slick and white from edge to edge. I want to open up The Washington Post or The New York Times and find the grainy gray of naked newspaper stock in place of columnists’ prose. Let’s fill Twitter with dead space and leave Facebook with a total absence of “likes.” Let the cable talking heads mute themselves. Hear in that noiselessness the echo of all the prayers and the pleas, all the policy proposals and screeds that were written about the last mass shooting, and the one before that and the one before the one before that. Hear the thundering clap of absolute inaction in Congress, and the crazed, giddy titter of those loosening gun laws state by state. Hear the voices that don’t speak, that can’t, the conversations some families will never get to have. What I want is not a “national moment of silence,” nor really a prayer. I don’t wish to summon contemplation or reflection but choking sobs and knotted throats. I want to share with the world the wordless groan that is the only prayer the grieving have. I want a strike, a shutdown, a refusal to move. Not just inaction as a pause—rather, stillness as an action in itself. I don't think what I want to happen actually can happen, not in this world. The media machine inexorably churns and, less reflexively, our mutual ache and mourning demands recognition on screens and off. Then again, our suspension of discussion doesn’t have to last forever. I don’t want to create a vacuum so much as create awareness about how much has already been said. There’s nothing left to say, so let’s just not say it. I write this, my fingers cold and my heart broken and hesitating before I press “send.” If I publish this column now, if I let this idea into the world after this slaughter…Why, then, what will we do after the next?"

http://nypost.com/2015/12/03/obama-pleas-for-tougher-gun-laws-after-latest-mass-shooting/,"Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. President Obama unloaded on America’s gun-control loopholes following the San Bernardino shooting that left at least 14 dead — urging the country to help make mass shootings “rare instead of normal.” “The one thing we do know is that we have a pattern now of mass shootings in this country that has no parallel anywhere else in the world,” Obama said during a scheduled interview with CBS on Wednesday afternoon as the California rampage unfolded. KNBCObama said he is particularly frustrated that loopholes in the system allow people on the government’s no-fly list to purchase guns at a store. “And there’s nothing that we can do to stop them,” he said. “That’s a law that needs to be changed.” But he said there are ways to prevent some of these types of attacks by strengthening background checks and implementing “common sense gun-safety laws.” “What we do know [is] that there are steps we can take to make Americans safer and that we should come together in a bipartisan basis at every level of government to make these [shootings] rare as opposed to normal,” he added. This was 15th time Obama has addressed a mass shooting in the United States as president, the last time being after last week’s Planned Parenthood attack in Colorado Springs, which left three dead. Meanwhile, presidential hopefuls tweeted their prayers to the victims and the families of Wednesday’s massacre. “California shooting looks very bad,” Donald Trump wrote. “Good luck to law enforcement and God bless.

http://www.eurweb.com/2015/12/statement-by-california-assemblymember-mike-a-gipson-d-carson-on-the-mass-shooting-in-san-bernadino/," *GARDENA, Calif —  “We mourn the loss of  the 14 victims in today’s mass shooting in San Bernadino and pray for the recovery of the 17 injured at the Inland Regional Center, a provider of social services for the developmentally disabled. This latest tragedy, the seventh in five months nationwide, underscores the need to address the proliferation of gun violence. The three suspects used assault style weapons and hand guns. I stand with President Barack Obama and agree that we need more background checks for weapons. I would also include the purchase of ammunition. Unfortunately, shootings routinely occur in the 64th and neighboring districts and have recently spiked. Our prayers and condolences go out to all of the families and friends who have suffered loss because of these atrocities.” Assemblymember Mike A. Gipson represents the 64th Assembly District which includes Carson, Compton, Gardena, Harbor Gateway, Lynwood, North Long Beach, Rancho Dominguez, South Los Angeles, Torrance, Watts/Willowbrook and Wilmington.  You just lost me as a supporter. It is always a sad day when people resort to violence, but worse when we lose sight of the real fight. By giving into the nonsensical focus on the firearm rather than the cause of a shooter you lose sight of making real and lasting change and creating successful solutions. By using such weapons – by their very definition (so-called “assault style”) – they should have had a more fatal outcome, but fortunately did not. They could have had the same outcome with more limited capacity magazines – and likely would have had with more training. They could have used weapons that don’t look like so-called assault style weapons and had the same – or even worse – outcome. I am certified by CA DOJ to provide firearms safety training, am a range safety officer, and for years took part in tactical pistol competition. I know what weapons and proper training can do and while people were sadly and senselessly taken from us or injured, the weapons used had absolutely nothing to do with it – except after the fact when politicians try to be seen to be doing something about violence. But you will not solve anything by focusing on the firearms. People and ideologies should be our focus. Our unity as a Republic and the freedoms we have are what others are afraid of and use senseless acts to try to pry them from us – these are our targets. Show those who wish to harm us that our resolve to live as a free people is a higher goal than bowing to hatred and the fear of a terrible god who demands senseless carnage. Our God is a loving God who has endowed his creation with rights and liberties not to be trifled with. That is how we fight these ideologies: with faith and freedom – with unity of resolve.

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/126290219/0/phoenix/nation~Health-inspector-wife-slay-in-murderous-rampage-at-meeting/,"SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. — The married couple who massacred 14 people during a holiday party at a social service center fired up to 75 rounds into the frantic crowd and even planted a crude explosive device of pipe bombs before they fled the scene, police said Thursday. Authorities said Syed R. Farook, 28, and Tashfeen Malik, 27, had amassed a huge arsenal of weapons, ammunition and explosive devices at their residence in nearby Redlands that they drew upon for their attack Wednesday. Twenty-one people also were injured; at least two remained in critical condition. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Thursday it was still too early to determine whether the shooting had its roots in terrorism. But the FBI’s National Security Division, which oversees terror cases, is deeply involved in investigating the backgrounds of the two dead suspects, a federal law enforcement official said Thursday. Of particular interest is the suspects’ recent travel to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan and Farook’s apparent contacts with at least a handful of individuals with suspected ties to radical extremism and who have been known to the FBI, said the official, who was not authorized to comment publicly on the matter. The official cautioned that investigators have not fully examined the contents of all of the couples' electronic communications, so any suspicious messages or contacts are still under review. Authorities have begun to piece together some key elements of the attack at the center but have not determined a motive. ""If you look at the preparation, the amount of weapons and ammunition, there was obviously a mission here,"" David Bowdich, assistant director of the Los Angeles FBI office, told reporters Thursday. But he added that at this early stage in the investigation it would be ""irresponsible and premature to call this terrorism."" ""We cannot rule anything out at this point,” Bowdich said. The two suspects were shot and killed hours after the initial attack during a high-speed chase with officers who traced them to their Redlands residence. Two officers were slightly injured in the encounter, but none of the wounds was life-threatening. It was the nation's deadliest shooting since a gunman killed 26 people in Newtown, Conn., in December 2012. San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said Thursday that each shooter was armed with a handgun and assault-style weapon. The guns were purchased legally and registered, he said. The couple wore dark tactical clothing, as well as utility vests stocked with 1,600 rounds of ammunition when they burst into the center's conference room. USA TODAY Delta announces new European routes from Detroit, Minneapolis “They sprayed the room with bullets,"" he said. ""I don't know that there was anyone that they openly targeted."" Police found a crude, remote-controlled explosive device made up of three pipe bombs wired together that had been left in a bag at the scene. Burguan said it was not clear whether the killers failed to push the button or the device simply misfired. Burguan said a search of the couple's home turned up 2,000 9mm rounds, more than 2500 .223-caliber rounds and “several hundred” 22 long rifle ​rounds, as well as 12 pipe bombs and tools for making more explosive devices. He said the pair had rented their black SUV  several days earlier and were supposed to return it on the day of the assault. Farook legally purchased two handguns at dealers in San Diego and Corona within the past three years, said another federal law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly. Investigators were looking more closely at the transactions involving the two assault-style rifles, which were purchased by another person who was not immediately identified. Burguan said that although initial reports indicated as many as three shooters may have been involved, ""we are confident now"" that Farook and Malik acted alone. Farook, who was born in the United States to Pakistani parents, met Malik online and became acquainted with her in Saudi Arabia. He brought her back to the U.S. in 2014. She entered with a Pakistani passport and a visa. The couple have a 6-month-old daughter, who was left with grandparents on the morning of the shootings. Although the suspects' motives were unknown, police quote some witnesses as saying Farook had attended the annual holiday party, left in a fit of anger and returned with Malik. Chris Nwadike, who worked with Farook as a restaurant inspector with the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health, said Wednesday's gathering was one of two ""general education"" meetings the department holds each year. The meeting was routine, in which employees receive  awards and other recognition. Nwadike said he was sitting at a table with Farook, who he knew from around the office. He said that at some point, more than 30 minutes before the shooting, he and his co-workers noticed Farook had left. . Nwadike said the meeting was on a 15-minute break when the shooting happened, and many participants were outside the room. Nwadike said he was in the bathroom. ""If everybody was there, it could have been a total massacre,"" he said. He said that he and the others in the bathroom laid down on the floor and remained there until police escorted them out of the building. ""I have not at any time noticed any sign that he would do anything like that,"" he said. ""I can't understand why."" . Farook's brother-in-law, Farhan Khan, said at news conference Wednesday night with the Council on American-Islamic Relations: ""On behalf of my family we all are shocked. We are completely shocked and had no idea."" Contributing: Mike James, John Bacon, Liz Szabo and Brad Heath in McLean, Va.; Brett Kelman and Anna Rumer, The (PalmSprings, Calif.)

http://www.inquisitr.com/2606412/mass-shootings-obama-calls-for-more-gun-control-after-351incidents-in-344-days/,"The United States has had more mass shootings than days in 2015. As of December 2, 344 days into the year, the U.S. has been subject to 351 mass shootings. The most recent include the horrific and senseless Planned Parenthood shooting the day after Thanksgiving and the San Bernardino shootings on December 2, Washington Post reports. These mass shootings also include school shootings, such as the Roseburg, Oregon, shooting on October 1, as well as racially-inspired shootings including the South Carolina church shooting. The South Carolina shooting took place on June 17 and took nine innocent lives. So far in 2015, a year with just less than a month less in the calendar year, the mass shootings have exceeded 2014's total. The number of mass shootings in 2015 are also on pace to dwarf the record set in 2013 of 363. This is according to Reddit's mass shooting tracker. The tracker includes ""mass shootings"" which include four or more casualties (deaths or injuries), due to gunfire, in a single incident. This number includes the gunman/gunmen.   In the second of this week's mass shootings, the two shooters (who police are now ""confident"" as being the only two involved) have been identified as Sayed Farook and Tashfeen Malik. The male/female pair are believed to be devout Muslims, although details are sketchy at this early stage of the investigation. Following the second of this week's high-profile mass shootings, President Obama issued another plea for more thorough gun control. His public call for more restrictions came prior to reports that at least one of the AK-47 assault rifles used in the mass shooting was purchased through legal channels.    While the United States reels from ever more frequent mass shootings, one would think that there has to be something we can do to reduce their frequency. We can't prevent every criminal from getting their hands on a gun. What we can do is make it impossible for certain known threats to get their hands on a firearm legally. We can't prevent all future mass shootings: there are too many guns in too many hands in the U.S. for that to be feasible. We can do everything within our power to reduce the number of future mass shootings through responsible legislation. [Image Courtesy Of David McNew/Getty Images]"

Wednesday afternoon I was greeted by the news from San Bernardino, Calif., that at least 14 people were killed in another mass shooting incident, this time at a public facility. I'm tormented by the stark realization that as a nation that prides itself as the voice of justice and compassion to the rest of the world, we can't go through a week's news cycle without hearing about another mass shooting and innocent people losing their lives, often in the most violent and brutal manner. As a mayor who dealt with this issue firsthand at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin shooting on Aug. 5, 2012, I'm weary of getting calls from news media asking me to comment on the most current mass shooting incident, especially when they ask me the question: What can we do about it? Controlling individual behavior is difficult, if not impossible, and trying to guess — in advance — what might motivate someone to commit an act of hate and violence will always be a challenge. But in sharing this collective national shock whenever this happens, I would argue that we're witnessing a fundamental and profound failure of our duty to protect our citizens from violence in any way possible, and we've turned over the debate to politicians, bloggers and lobbyists, all who hide behind tired, clichés and fundamentally dishonest reasons why we can't do anything about it. The U.S. Constitution is a powerful and wise document, but with the rights it endows come responsibility, and I would argue that in the case of gun ownership, which is a right guaranteed by the Second Amendment, we've let that right define the culture and environment in which we live to a degree that it has taken over our consciousness and made our citizens feel less safe. As an elected official, I feel the burden of the question every time a mass shooting takes place. What should I be doing? What can I do to lessen the likelihood that it will happen again? Why don't we as a country take actions to reduce violence? The answer, of course, is we could, but we don't. We use silly arguments and fall back into entrenched, absolutist positions that may make us feel better as part of a defense of our own personal agendas or political tastes. We bury our head in nonstop television coverage that progresses from eyewitness accounts, to hastily-arranged news conferences to medical trauma centers, but stops short of moving forward on any legislation, policy or social changes that could actually make a difference. I am a gun owner. But I have to believe that one of the popular responses to mass shootings — arm everyone and encourage individual and aggressive action against a mass shooter — is at best naive, and at worst, dangerous. Law enforcement professionals are highly trained and understand through direct experience that carrying a gun is a powerful responsibility and doesn't guarantee that a shooter will be stopped. The shooting at the Sikh Temple was a clear example of that, with one of our most experienced officers coming within an inch of losing his life. Expecting citizens to prevent or slow down perpetrators of violence seems logical, and in some cases might actually be possible, but it could result in the gun owner losing his or her life when mistaken for the shooter. As a country, we've lived through the ""wild west"" mentality of frontier justice. It didn't work. It only made the weakest members of our society less safe. And it won't work now. What can we do? Why not start with researching and funding programs that have been proven to reduce violence? We live in a country of tremendous resources and brilliant minds who tackle difficult and complex problems every day. Why would we not care as much about this epidemic of violence as we do about all the other ways people die every day? Stephen Scaffidi is the mayor of Oak Creek.

http://www.ocregister.com/articles/voeltz-694626-ramirez-shooting.html,"Trending:  Mario Hernandez, 62, his wife Maria Hernandez, son Israel Hernandez, and daughter Jhoana Hernandez, 32, waiting for Karina Torres, who works at Inland Regional Center, outside the Rock Church.  Angelo Agonoy, 20, awaiting his mom outside the Rock Church. He received text messages from her saying she was OK.  They hid in closets, inside locked offices with the lights off and cabinets holding the door shut. This is what family members were told from loved ones through text messages or cellphone calls while inside the Inland Regional Center on Wednesday during the scene of the mass shooting there. Marcos Aguilera’s wife was in the building when the gunfire erupted. He said a shooter entered the building next to his wife’s office and opened fire. “They locked themselves in her office. They saw bodies on the floor,” Aguilera told KABC-TV, adding that his wife was able to get out of the building unharmed. A dozen friends and relatives of shooting victim Kevin Ortiz gathered in prayer outside Arrowhead Regional Medical Center. He and his wife, Diana, were married two weeks ago. They’ve known each other for years, she said, since both of their sister became best friends in elementary school. Kevin Ortiz, 24, a San Bernardino County employee, is active outdoors and at his church, Fontana First Assembly of God, his wife said. Ortiz was shot in both legs and the back and was awaiting surgery. “I’m just hoping to see him,” Diana Ortiz said, tears welling up in her eyes. Her husband called her from a hospital to say he was OK but hung up quickly. She pleaded with a security guard at the emergency room to let her in but he refused. DON’T PANIC “She sounded terrorized,” said Mario Hernandez in tears as he recalled his daughter Karina Torres’ voice over the phone. “She said, ‘Dad, I’ll leave you in charge of my daughters.’” Hernandez’s daughter is a social worker at the Inland Regional Center. She was hidden inside a closet when she called him, frantic, asking that he take care of her daughters. He said he tried to calm his daughter over the phone and advised her to not make a lot of noise. “Don’t panic,” Hernandez said he told her. Hernandez waited for her outside of the Rock Church in San Bernardino late Wednesday afternoon with others also eager to see their loved ones. One of those was Angelo Agonoy, 20. He said he got a text message from his mother telling him she was in her supervisor’s office with the lights off. She was OK, he said she told him.His mother does paperwork at Inland Regional Center, he said. “First thing I felt was butterflies in my stomach,” Agonoy said. “I’m enraged. I wish I could be there doing something, clearing rooms, something,” Alonoy said. “Getting these guys.” “I feel we need to do something about it … understanding that evil is out there. It can hit you any day,” Agonoy added. “Last week we saw Colorado. This week, it’s right here in our backyard,” he said. SHE SAID, ‘I LOVE YOU’ In a brief cellphone call, Keith Benson’s wife told him she was OK and was sheltering within the center, Benson said. But then the call was interrupted. “She said SWAT had just kicked in the door … and she thought ‘this is the end,’” Benson recalled. Instead, officers guided her and her coworkers to a triage center where she sat on a bus bench. “She said, ‘I love you’ and I said ‘I love you back’ and that was it,” Benson said. For others, the wait was more excruciating. Greg Rudolph’s left hand and leg shook uncontrollably as he spoke of his ex-girlfriend, who worked at the center. “We tried to call her cell phone and to call her home phone, and no one answers,” Rudolph said. ‘IT’S HEARTBREAKING’ Jorge Gomez of Ontario stood outside the Rudy C. Hernandez Community Center in San Bernardino hoping to be reunited with his wife, Marybell, who is a case worker at the center. He had made contact with her by cellphone. “She was crying so she handed the phone to her friend, and her friend said they were doing well,” he said. “It was scary situation, hearing the gunshots. They ran into a supervisor’s office, and waited in lockdown.” Tom Carrillo received a slew of text messages from her 29-year-old daughter who works in human resources at the Inland Regional Center. She texted him saying she was OK, he said Carrillo, who was waiting for his daughter outside the Hernandez Community Center Wednesday evening, said she was hiding in a room, with cabinets in front of the door. “When you get a text from your daughter saying, ‘Dad, I’m scared.’ It’s heartbreaking.” Contact the reporter at amolina@pe.com or @alemolina Get the latest news delivered daily!

http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/breakingnews/~3/XBu6Db8tbCc/ct-san-bernardino-california-shooting-20151203-story.html,"SAN BERNARDINO, CALIF. — A heavily armed man and woman dressed for battle opened fire on a holiday banquet for his co-workers Wednesday, killing 14 people and seriously wounding more than a dozen others in a precision assault, authorities said. Hours later, they died in a shootout with police. Authorities were trying to determine a motive, which could include workplace violence or terrorism. The shooting happened at a social services center for the disabled where the suspect's colleagues with the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health were renting space for a celebration. It was the nation's deadliest mass shooting since the attack at a school in Newtown, Connecticut, three years ago that left 26 children and adults dead. San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan identified one dead suspect as Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, the other as Tashfeen Malik, 27, his wife or fiancee. Burguan said Farook was born in the United States; the chief said he did not know Malik's background. Authorities told the Los Angeles Times that Farook was born in Illinois. San Bernardino shooting updates The attackers invaded the Inland Regional Center about 60 miles east of Los Angeles around 11 a.m., opening fire in a conference area where county health officials were having an employee banquet, said Marybeth Feild, president and CEO of the nonprofit center. ""They came prepared to do what they did, as if they were on a mission,"" Burguan said. Farook attended the event before leaving — and returning to kill. Co-worker Patrick Baccari said he was sitting at the same table as Farook, who suddenly disappeared, leaving his coat on his chair. Baccari said when the shooting started, he sought refuge in a bathroom and suffered minor wounds from shrapnel slicing through the wall. Baccari described Farook as reserved and said he showed no signs of unusual behavior. Earlier this year he traveled to Saudi Arabia and returned with a wife, later growing a beard, Baccari said. The FBI is investigating several possible motives, including workplace violence and terrorism, according to David Bowdich, assistant director of the bureau's Los Angeles office. He did not elaborate. Farook was a restaurant inspector for the health department, according to public records. Police chief Burguan said he had been a county employee for five years. The couple dropped off their 6-month-old daughter with relatives Wednesday morning, saying they had a doctor's appointment, Hussam Ayloush, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said after talking with family. Farhan Khan, who is married to Farook's sister, told reporters he last spoke to his brother-in-law about a week ago. He said he was in shock, condemned the violence, and had ""absolutely no idea why he would do this."" About four hours after the morning carnage, police hunting for the killers riddled a black SUV with gunfire in a shootout 2 miles from the social services center in this Southern California city of 214,000 people. Farook and Malik were found with assault rifles and semi-automatic handguns, and were wearing ""assault-style clothing"" with ammunition attached, authorities said. Television news helicopters captured the aftermath, as officers slowly approached the mangled SUV. In the morning, as the day's first bursts of gunfire echoed through the large three-building complex, some people locked themselves in offices, desperately waiting for police and texting or making hushed phone calls to loved ones. ""People shot. In the office waiting for cops. Pray for us. I am locked in an office,"" Terry Petit's daughter, who works at the center, texted him. Petit choked back tears as he read his daughter's words for reporters outside the center, where social workers find jobs, housing and transportation and provide other services to people with disabilities such as autism, cerebral palsy and epilepsy. Olivia Navarro said her daughter, Jamile Navarro, a case manager at the social service center, called her and whispered that she was hiding in a locked room. ""I said, 'All right, I'll be there, turn off the lights, don't make a sound,'"" Navarro said. ""And that was it."" Her daughter survived. That the violence happened at a place dedicated to helping people with developmental disabilities — even if they were not targeted — made it even harder for some to comprehend. ""These are all disabled kids, very disabled,"" said Sherry Esquerra, who was searching for her daughter and son-in-law, both of whom work at the center. ""She gets all the services she possibly could for these kids. So I just don't understand why somebody would come in and start shooting."" Playlist: Mass shooting in California According to its web page, the center has a client base of more than 30,000 people and their families. It is a privately run nonprofit, the largest of its kind in California with about 670 employees. FBI agents and other law enforcement authorities converged on the center and searched room to room for the attackers. Triage units were set up outside, and people were wheeled away on stretchers. Seventeen people were wounded, according to authorities. Ten were hospitalized in critical condition, and three were in serious condition, Fire Chief Tom Hannemann said. Others were marched from the building, hands raised so police could search them and make sure the attackers weren't trying to slip out. They had indeed escaped. One witness, Glenn Willwerth, who runs a business across the street, said he heard 10 to 15 shots and then saw an SUV with tinted windows pull out ""very calmly, very slowly"" and drive off. As the manhunt dragged on, stores, office buildings and schools were locked down in the city, and roads blocked off. With police looking for a dark SUV, officers staking out a home in the nearby city of Redlands saw a vehicle matching that description. Public records show the home is a possible residence of a family member of Farook. Authorities pursued the SUV, and a gunbattle erupted around 3 p.m. One officer among nearly two dozen involved in the shootout suffered a minor injury. A fake bomb — a metal pipe stuffed with cloth — was thrown from the SUV during the chase, said Agent Meredith Davis of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Three explosive devices — thought to be real and all connected to one another — were found at the social service center and later detonated by a bomb squad, police said. A third person who was spotted running near the gunbattle was detained, but Burguan said it was unclear if that person had anything to do with the crime. At a late-night news conference, Burguan also said that early witness accounts of three shooters were probably wrong: ""We are reasonably confident at this point that we have two shooters and we have two dead suspects."" President Barack Obama urged the country to take steps to reduce mass shootings, including stricter gun laws and stronger background checks. ""The one thing we do know is that we have a pattern now of mass shootings in this country that has no parallel anywhere else in the world,"" Obama told CBS. The social services center has two large buildings that require a badge to get in, said Sheela Stark, a member of its board of trustees. However, the conference room that hosts public events such as Wednesday's banquet is usually left open when visitors are expected.

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/126321017/0/phoenix/nation~San-Bernardino-shooting-What-we-know-now/,"Here's what we know about the mass shooting in San Bernardino,Calif.: Suspects: Health inspector Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and Tashfeen Malik, 27 – variously described as his wife or fiancée – went on a shooting rampage in San Bernardino on Wednesday at a social services center, then fled the scene. Farook attended a holiday party at the center before leaving angrily for unknown reasons. He returned with Malik and opened fire. Officers searching the scene of the killings later also found an undetonated pipe bomb. Motive: The FBI is investigating several possible motives, including workplace violence and terrorism. Authorities are reviewing Farook's contacts with a number of people with suspected links to radical ideology, a federal law enforcement official said Thursday. Weapons: All four firearms, two rifles and two handguns, that were recovered Wednesday from the suspects were purchased legally from a federally licensed dealer, a federal law enforcement official said Thursday. The two handguns were purchased by Farook, while the two assault-style rifles were purchased by an individual whose identity and relationship to the suspects remains unknown.

So it’s going to be very interesting for me to see what her background was, what level of animus she had, because she had to have had a considerable level.” She added: “A woman is a woman. And her child has to be of maximum importance to her.” #SyedFarook pics been circulating online since this afternoon, now this:  @Nehemiah_israel @AlysiaStern  @DaneHarr1s pic.twitter.com/3DTbk5TIkM UPDATE: 1:40 p.m. EST -- The family of shooter Syed Farook has denounced Farook's actions, and members are cooperating with police, according to Newsday crime reporter John Asbury.

Original Story: The motive behind Wednesday’s mass shooting in Southern California that left at least 14 people dead and 17 wounded remained unclear early Thursday as police searched for answers. Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, who were both killed in a shootout with police, were named as suspects in the rampage. The couple is believed to have been married. The gunmen were heavily armed when they opened fire at the San Bernardino County Public Health Department at the Inland Regional Center, a facility that serves people with developmental disabilities. Farook worked at the center and joined colleagues at their annual holiday party, but left the event after a dispute. He later returned with his wife, bearing tactical gear and assault rifles, officials said. suspect traveled to Saudi Arabia, was married, appeared to be living &#39;American Dream,&#39; co-workers say - LA Times https://t.co/qdGMNiWuwK Hussam Ayloush, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Los Angeles, has urged people to remain patient and to wait until a motive has become clear amid speculation the shooting may have been politically or religiously motivated. The civil rights organization, which held a news conference Wednesday evening, quickly condemned the shooting and expressed sympathy for the victims. Ayloush, who has been in touch with Farooq’s family, told CNN the motives remain unclear, and the family ""is devastated, like all Americans. This is the time for us to express solidarity among all of us Americans in rejecting whatever the motives might have been,"" the Guardian reported. ""There is absolutely no justification for such horrendous behavior.”  A co-worker said Farook had traveled to Saudi Arabia and returned with a wife he met online, various media outlets reported. The suspects in the rampage reportedly dropped off their 6-month-old daughter with a grandmother, family representatives said. The shooting rampage lasted just a few minutes -- a sign, San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said, they likely went in “with a purpose,” the New York Daily News reported.

http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-rahm-emanuel-politico-reporter-testy-exchange-20151202-story.html,"Welcome to Clout Street: Morning Spin, our weekday feature to catch you up with what's going on in government and politics from Chicago to Springfield. It's Thursday, Dec. 3, the day after Mayor Rahm Emanuel got testy with an out-of-town reporter who asked him about his planned family holiday trip to Cuba. Video of the awkward exchange quickly gained traction in the political-journalism industrial complex. We'll break it down a bit more for readers who might not know the ins and outs of how politicians and reporters interact day to day. The mayor was doing a solid for Politico Illinois, appearing at a kickoff event for the news organization's website. He has done a couple of similar public sit-downs with the Chicago Tribune's Editorial Board over the years. Emanuel is a renowned charmer of the national media since his days in the Clinton and Obama White Houses. Politico's Mike Allen even brought up that reputation during the morning interview in front of a crowd high up in the Willis Tower. ""You're well known for being very image-conscious. You at times work the press, work news organizations very closely,"" Allen said, prompting Emanuel to respond, ""How do you think it's working?"" Emanuel was virtually guaranteed to make news at the Politico event, given that it came the day after he dismissed police Superintendent Garry McCarthy and during a week in which the mayor had to contend with the most widespread criticism he has faced in office. For nearly an hour, the mayor mostly stuck to well-rehearsed talking points about the Laquan McDonald shooting investigation, although he also said he opposed a U.S. Justice Department civil rights probe of the Police Department. But as reporters who have long covered the mayor know, Emanuel has no tolerance for questions about his family. (His wife, Amy Rule, is a private person, and the administration rarely notifies the media about her public appearances.) So it was hardly surprising that a question from Allen about the mayor's holiday family vacation plans caused Emanuel to lose his cool. ""First of all, thanks for telling everybody what I'm going to do with my family,"" Emanuel said. ""You had a private conversation with me, and now you just had to make that public. I don't appreciate that, for one. I really don't."" From the context, Emanuel and Allen had a pre-interview chat in which the two talked about the mayor's planned family trip to Cuba. The typical rules of engagement are that a politician utters the words ""off the record"" before telling a journalist something he or she doesn't want to see in a story. If Emanuel told Allen the Cuba stuff was off the record beforehand, divulging where the mayor was going when asking the question would be viewed as out of bounds. If the mayor didn't expressly say it was off the record, Allen was within his rights to ask about the Cuba trip while onstage. In an email, Allen told the Tribune ""there was no stipulation it was private or off the record."" During his tenure as mayor, the stay-on-message-minded Emanuel has been fairly disciplined about not stepping in it and making news he doesn't want to make. That didn't happen Wednesday, however. After talking about the Cuba trip for a bit, Emanuel revisited his anger at the question and predicted his wife's unhappy reaction to learning their plans had been publicized. (Though Emanuel in recent years has confirmed his holiday vacation plans to reporters.) ""I can't wait — can you give me your cell number? Because I want you to listen to Amy,"" he said. ""I apologize for that,"" Allen said. ""I don't know if you know this: It's not going to work,"" Emanuel responded. (John Byrne) *Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who's not in Paris for the climate change meeting as scheduled, will be at the opening of Google's Chicago office.  He won't be taking questions. *Gov. Bruce Rauner is at the Google office opening in the morning (scheduled to take questions) and the Lake County Municipal League annual dinner at Kemper Lakes in Kildeer in the early evening. *Next meeting: Gov. Rauner said he will meet with the four legislative leaders again early next week to talk about the budget. The gathering will take place either Monday or Tuesday in Chicago against the wishes of the governor, who said he preferred to meet in Springfield. ""In (being) accommodating and a compromise, I think we're going to Chicago to try to further the conversation,"" Rauner said. The governor and legislative leaders met in Springfield on Tuesday for the first time since May, though it did little to thaw the ice between the Republican chief executive and Democrats who have been deadlocked on the budget as Rauner also pursues an agenda to weaken unions and cut costs businesses. By all indications, the standoff is unlikely to end any time soon. ""We've laid out the terms, we kind of know what we've got to do,"" Rauner said. ""But on a pro rata basis, or based upon on the size of the problem and the deficit, it wouldn't be surprising if it doesn't go for a few more months, it's kind of the nature of the political process here in this building."" (Monique Garcia) *County rush over Alvarez: Two Cook County Board members will hold a news conference to rip State's Attorney Anita Alvarez for her handling of the Laquan McDonald police shooting case. One, Commissioner John Fritchey, is backing Alvarez challenger Donna More. The other, Commissioner Jesus ""Chuy"" Garcia, is a close ally of Board President Toni Preckwinkle, who backs Alvarez challenger Kim Foxx, her former chief of staff. In addition, Commissioner Richard Boykin, D-Oak Park, who has yet to publicly endorse anyone for state's attorney, has prepared two resolutions — one backing a federal probe of how the city, Chicago Police Department and Alvarez's office handled the case — even though Mayor Emanuel says that the FBI and U.S. attorney's office already are looking into it — and another calling for an independent prosecutor to handle the case against Officer Jason Van Dyke. In an interview, Boykin said Emanuel, former police Superintendent Garry McCarthy and Alvarez ""let a lie stand ... for 13 months."" Van Dyke ""suggested, and his superiors signed off on it, that Laquan McDonald had lunged at him with a knife, and that he feared for his life. That video shows Laquan McDonald walking away from him and shows him shooting him and then shooting him as he lay on the ground,"" Boykin said. ""They'll have to answer."" (Hal Dardick) *New House member: Diana Rauner's former chief of staff was sworn is as the newest member of the Illinois House on Wednesday. Republican Sara Wojcicki Jimenez of Springfield was appointed to replace longtime Rep. Raymond Poe, who Rauner appointed to lead the Illinois Department of Agriculture. Poe split with Rauner on some union issues as the govenor has made weakening organized labor a key part of his agenda. As chief of staff, Jimenez helped spearheaded ongoing efforts to restore the aging Executive Mansion. Before that, she served as press secretary for former House Republican Leader Tom Cross, spokeswoman for Democrat Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias and as a television reporter covering the statehouse. ""One of the things that I learned on staff is that I should definitely keep this brief. So I am very humbled by the opportunity. I am honored. I look forward to working with everybody in our caucus, and for our friends across the aisle,"" Jimenez said during remarks on the House floor. (Monique Garcia) *House member weds: Lawmakers congratulated Rep. Sam Yingling, D-Round Lake Beach, on his marriage last week to Lowell Jaffe. Yingling had proposed to Jaffe, the son of former Illinois Gaming Board Chairman Aaron Jaffe, during a celebration at the governor's mansion following the passage of legislation legalizing gay marriage in 2013. (Monique Garcia) *Immigration coalition criticizes Kirk, Rauner over Syrian refugee policies: The Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights is criticizing two of the state's top Republicans — U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk and Gov. Bruce Rauner — for their support of a halt in accepting Syrian refugees. The group said it was ""disheartening that we find two Illinois elected officials have scorned the latest families seeking refuge and have instead fanned the flames of fear and prejudice."" Kirk, seeking re-election next year, is running a new cable TV ad attacking one of the Democrats seeking to challenge him, U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth, over her support of continued acceptance of Syrian refugees. Rauner has said he wants a pause in accepting Syrian refugees into Illinois until he is assured they have passed stringent background checks. Kirk wants the same assurances nationally. ""The U.S. accepts roughly 70,000 refugees every year, and the refugees who come from unstable regions like Syria, adhere to the most rigorous screening and security vetting of any category of people entering the U.S.,"" the group said. ""The concern for proper refugee screening is critical to the safety of citizens and refugees alike, but the recent words and actions of Sen. Kirk and Gov. Rauner are both unfounded and reactionary decisions,"" the group said. (Rick Pearson) *News cycle: Chicago violence and Mayor Emanuel's dismissal of police Superintendent Garry McCarthy was scheduled to be the subject of a couple of MSNBC shows Wednesday. Ald. Joe Moore, 49th, had sent out an email letting people know of his appearance on one of them. But the topic was naturally bumped due to the San Bernardino mass shooting. Moore sent out another email letting his constituents know he wouldn't be appearing. ""My prayers go out to the victims and their families. When will this violence ever end?""

Farook communicated with individuals who were under FBI scrutiny in connection with a terrorism investigation. But the official said the contact was with ""people who weren't significant players on our radar,"" dated back some time, and there was no immediate indication of any ""surge"" in communication ahead of the shooting. (California Department of Motor Vehicles via AP)  SAN BERNARDINO — San Bernardino gunman Syed Rizwan Farook had been in contact with known Islamic extremists on social media, a U.S. intelligence official said Thursday, and police said he and his wife had enough bullets and bombs to slaughter hundreds when they launched their deadly attack on a holiday party. The details emerged as investigators tried to determine whether the rampage that left 14 people dead was terrorism, a workplace grudge or some combination. The husband-and-wife killers were not under FBI scrutiny before the massacre, said a second U.S. official, who likewise was not authorized to discuss the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity. But, late Thursday, a law enforcement official said authorities are looking for a man who bought two rifles used in a Southern California attack that killed 14 people. The official had knowledge of the investigation but wasn’t authorized to speak publicly. Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire Wednesday at a holiday party in San Bernardino. Authorities have said two pistols and two rifles they carried were bought legally more than three years ago. Farook bought the pistols, but a man authorities won’t identify bought the rifles. It’s not known if the man was acting on Farook’s behalf when he bought the weapons or if they were stolen and then used in the attack. The official says the guns were all purchased in California. Also late Thursday, Muslims that gathered at one of Southern California’s largest mosques have denounced Wednesday’s massacre, which occurred only about two dozen miles away. About 200 people met at the mosque in Chino on Thursday night for a prayer vigil and to send a message that Ahsan Khan described as “love for all, hatred for none.” Khan and other leaders of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community described the shooting that killed 14 people in San Bernardino as deplorable and horrific. Leaders also said they didn’t know Farook, who was killed along with his wife in a gun battle with police. Group spokesman Amjad Mahmood Khan cautioned that no one yet knows the motives of the killers and can’t presume it was faith-driven. But he said he said the “radicalization of Muslim youth is a problem.” Wearing black tactical gear and wielding assault rifles, Farook, a 28-year-old county restaurant inspector, and his wife, Malik, 27, sprayed as many as 75 rounds into a room at a social service center for the disabled, where about 75 of Farook’s co-workers had gathered Wednesday morning. Farook had attended the event but slipped out and returned in battle dress. Four hours later and two miles away, the couple died in a furious gunbattle in which they fired 76 rounds, while 23 law officers unleashed about 380, police said. On Thursday, Police Chief Jarrod Burguan offered a grim inventory that suggested Wednesday’s bloodbath could have been far worse. At the social service center, the couple left three rigged-together pipe bombs with a remote-control detonating device that apparently malfunctioned, and they had more than 1,600 rounds of ammunition remaining when police killed them in their rented SUV, Burguan said. At a family home in the nearby town of Redlands, they had 12 pipe bombs, tools for making more, and over 3,000 additional rounds of ammunition, the chief said. “We don’t know if this was workplace rage or something larger or a combination of both,” Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in Washington, echoing President Barack Obama. “We don’t know the motivation.” Investigators are trying to determine whether Farook, who was Muslim, became radicalized — and, if so, how — as well as whether he was in contact with any foreign terrorist organization, said the U.S. intelligence official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The same official said Farook had been in touch on social media with extremists who were under FBI scrutiny. The second U.S. official said the FBI was treating the attack as a potential act of terror but had reached no conclusion that it was. The official said Farook’s contacts online did not involve any significant players the FBI knew of and dated back some time, with there was no immediate indication of a recent surge in communication. The official cautioned that such contact by itself doesn’t mean someone is a terrorist. Rita Katz, director of SITE Intelligence Group, an organization that tracks and analyzes extremists, said it hasn’t found any connection between Farook and jihadi groups. But she also said that some of Farook’s social media posts seem to have been deleted before the attack. Wednesday’s rampage was the nation’s deadliest mass shooting since 2012, when 26 children and adults were slain in Newtown, Connecticut. In San Bernardino, a Southern California city of 214,000, the victims ranged in age from 26 to 60. A further 21 people were injured, including two police officers, authorities said. Two of the wounded remained in critical condition Thursday. Nearly all the dead and wounded were county employees. Authorities said the attack was carefully planned. “There was obviously a mission here. We know that. We do not know why. We don’t know if this was the intended target or if there was something that triggered him to do this immediately,” David Bowdich, assistant director of the FBI’s Los Angeles office, said as the bureau took over the investigation. Farook has no known criminal record, Burguan said. He was born in Chicago to a Pakistani family, raised in Southern California and worked at San Bernardino County’s Department of Public Health for two stints totaling four years since 2010, according to authorities and acquaintances. The Saudi Embassy said he traveled to Saudi Arabia in the summer of 2014 for nine days. As for Malik, she came to the U.S. in July 2014 on a Pakistani passport and a fiancée visa, authorities said. To get the visa, immigrants submit to an interview and biometric and background checks — screening intended to identify anyone who might pose a threat. They were married on Aug. 16, 2014, in nearby Riverside County, according to their marriage license. Both listed their religion as Muslim. The couple had a 6-month-old daughter who they dropped with relatives Wednesday morning before the shooting. Adam Lankford, a criminal justice professor at the University of Alabama, said his review of mass public shootings in the U.S. indicates this is the first one in recent history involving a male-female team. Farook was a devout Muslim who prayed every day and recently memorized the Quran, according to brothers Nizaam and Rahemaan Ali, who attended Dar Al Uloom Al Islamiyah mosque in San Bernardino with Farook. Rahemaan Ali said he last saw Farook three weeks ago, when he abruptly stopped going to the mosque. Ali said Farook seemed happy and his usual self, and the brothers never saw a violent side. “He never ever talked about killing people or discussed politics, or said that he had problems at work,” Rahemaan Ali said. “He always had a smile on his face.” Federal authorities said Farook legally bought two handguns used in the massacre and their two assault rifles were legally bought by someone else. Authorities did not say how the rifles got into the attackers’ hands. Farook apparently was no stranger to guns. A profile on a matchmaking website for South Asians that matched Farook’s name, California hometown, county health job and Muslim faith said his interests included target shooting in his backyard. Though the date of the posting was not clear, it listed his age as 22 so it could have been six years old. Two weeks ago, Farook and one of the co-workers he killed, 52-year-old Nicholas Thalasinos, had a heated conversation about Islam, according to Kuuleme Stephens, a friend of the victim. Stephens said she happened to call Thalasinos while he was talking with Farook at work. She said Thalasinos told her Farook “doesn’t agree that Islam is not a peaceful religion.” As for workplace conflicts, co-worker Patrick Baccari said that until the rampage, Farook showed no signs of unusual behavior and was a reserved young man. Baccari said he was sitting at the same table as Farook before Farook suddenly disappeared, leaving his coat on his chair. Baccari was in the bathroom when the shooting started; he suffered minor wounds from shrapnel slicing through the wall. One of the first officers to reach the room said the carnage was “unspeakable” and the scene overwhelming — the smell of gunpowder, the wails of the injured, the blood, fire sprinklers pumping and fire alarms blaring. All in a room with a Christmas tree and decorations on every table. “As we entered,” said San Bernardino Police Lt. Mike Madden, “the situation was surreal.” Associated Press writers Brian Melley, John Antczak, Christopher Weber, Christine Armario and Gillian Flaccus in Los Angeles; Ken Dilanian, Eric Tucker and Tami Abdollah in Washington; Amy Taxin and Kimberly Pierceall in Redlands; Alina Hartounian in Phoenix; Ellen Knickmeyer in San Francisco; Michael Sisak in Philadelphia; and Holbrook Mohr in Jackson, Mississippi, contributed to this story.

http://www.inquisitr.com/2606756/let-america-know-a-new-era-isis-praises-san-bernardino-shooters-with-sickening-hashtag-america_burning/,"ISIS is praising the horrific San Bernardino shooting with a special hashtag #America_Burning. A number of Islamic State followers took to a popular web forum for the extremists to praise God for bringing hell to America and for spreading fear into the homes of ""the Crusaders."" ISIS has not taken responsibility for any of the attacks directly in any of the forum messages. However, they did call the shooters ""lions"" that ""made us proud."" Vocativ first reported on the startling series of tweets on a popular Islamic State messaging forum on Twitter. When scanning the forum for talk of the San Bernardino shooting, a hashtag, #America_Burning, was uncovered. The hashtag referenced the mass shooting and praised God for the horrible act. The Islamic State followers seemed overjoyed that the California streets were ""full of soldiers with heavy weapons"" and that the event would ""let America know a new era."" Here are a few of the posts from ISIS supporters sporting the hashtag #America_Burning.  It seems that the social media website Twitter isn't taking any chances with the users posting praises to the shooter online. Many of the posts utilizing the hashtag #America_Burning have been removed and the users suspended from the forum. Though many of the users have been washed from the website, that hasn't stopped the hashtag from continuing to spread. In fact, many ISIS sympathizers are continuing to post to the hashtag.  — محمد ابو عبيدة (@abo_oubayda) December 2, 2015  — محمد ابو عبيدة (@abo_oubayda) December 2, 2015  The police say they are still looking into the motive, but that the attack seemed planned, as the couple came fully armed and their home was a ""pipe bomb factory."" The San Bernardino shooting marks the deadliest mass shooting in the United States since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and has left 14 dead, with dozens others injured. Though the police have not released the motive for the crime, noting it could be workplace violence or terrorism, they say they will ""leave no stone unturned"" and that if Farook had contact with ISIS members or any other terrorists organization, they will find out.

http://nypost.com/2015/12/03/ill-take-a-bullet-before-you-do-video-from-inside-calif-massacre/,"Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. A sheriff’s deputy promised he would take the first bullet as he led frightened office workers to safety inside the Inland Regional Center. “Try to relax, sir. Try to relax,” the unidentified San Bernardino cop can be heard saying in a cellphone video made in the aftermath of Wednesday’s massacre. “I’ll take the bullet before you do, that’s for damn sure,” the deputy tells the group of almost 50 workers as he directs them through a hallway in the building where 14 people were slaughtered. The three-minute clip, posted online by local radio station KPCC, was taken by Gabi Flores, one of the terrified employees at the center. “Just be cool, OK?” the deputy, his voice firm and consoling, tells the workers, who are reeling with fear. The clip begins with the deputy shouting around a corner. “Are you ready? If you’re not cool, I’m not walkin’ ’em, dude,” he hollers to an unseen fellow deputy who apparently is checking to see if the coast is clear. “F–k,” a woman with long black hair says under her breath, fear and impatience filling that single hissed syllable. A brief glimpse of the brave deputy is visible between the shuffling shapes of the evacuees. He’s an ­ordinary-looking man, bald, in a dark uniform. But his command of the situation is evident in his voice, and shows how ­extraordinary he is. “Sir?” he asks someone at the head of the line. “Go. Go. Go to that other deputy. Keep your hands where I can see them,” he instructs. “Go all the way to that deputy.” Some of the evacuees appear to be sniffling as they move forward, hands raised. A small boy walks between two women, each holding one of his hands. “Thank you. Thank you. Try to relax,” the deputy encourages them, before promising to take a bullet on their behalf, should it come to that. The hero deputy is well out of view by the time the group progresses to an ­elevator bank. An elevator comes — three short “dings” ring out. “Go! Go! Go!” one woman urges fearfully. With that, the video cuts out, and the group evidently rides down to safety. “Oh, yes, we know all about the video,” a Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman said, pride in her voice, when The Post asked about the clip. The deputy’s identity had not been released as of Thursday evening. Share Selection"

http://www.ocregister.com/articles/thompson-694614-ducks-center.html,"Trending: ANAHEIM – The day that Nate Thompson was cleared to hit the ice and start practicing with his Ducks teammates, the veteran center compared it to waking up on Christmas morning. 
His real present arrived Wednesday night. 
A long rehabilitation process for Thompson officially ended when the veteran center was inserted into the Ducks’ lineup. And there was the bonus of the opposing Tampa Bay Lightning, the team he spent 41/2 seasons with before a summer 2014 trade to Anaheim. 
After undergoing surgery to repair two labral tears in his left shoulder and missing the first 25 games, Thompson made his season debut. 	


“It’s exciting,” Thompson said. “The last couple of days, I haven’t been able to stop smiling just because it’s like Christmas. I’m excited to get going.” 
Thompson’s recovery started in June with his surgery and then having his shoulder in a sling, which he said was the worst part of the process. More rehab work was required over the remainder of the summer and throughout training camp. 
						
In the first week of November, Thompson was back with the Ducks but still a ways away from actual game action. The first of that came last weekend when he played in two games with the team’s American Hockey League affiliate in San Diego. 
“The physical part is the easiest part,” Thompson said. “The mental part of it’s the hardest. Every month you start feeling better. It’s baby steps. The sling and then it was just small movements. Just a lot of different steps you have to take and then you get to a certain point. 
“I felt like I was ready to play and then you’re not ready to play. It’s just a long process with shoulders. It takes a while. At the same time, you have to make sure you’re ready.” 	


In Thompson, the Ducks are getting back a valuable center who gives them additional quality minutes in other facets than regular fourth-line shifts with his linemates. 
“He’s a responsible fourth-line guy,” Coach Bruce Boudreau said. “I can use him in all situations. I can use him as a faceoff guy. He’s a good penalty killer. In the last 10 minutes of the game, if you’re having to protect a lead, he can play left wing. And he can skate and he’s physical. 
“We know he’s not going to score 30 out there. In the locker room, he’s a vocal guy. He’s a leader of our team. And he showed it in the playoffs last year. I thought he came really to the forefront and played great.” 
Thompson originally suffered the shoulder tears in the regular-season finale at Arizona and missed the first round of the 2015 playoffs against Winnipeg. The Ducks got the center well enough for the second and third rounds against Calgary and Chicago. 
Boudreau said once it was clear how damaged the shoulder was, it said a lot about his center’s courage. Thompson said the playoffs “definitely made it worse.” 
“From what the doctors said, it was pretty tore up,” Thompson said. “I think any guy on the team would have done the same thing. When you’re playing for the Stanley Cup, guys will do whatever it takes. 
“Once you get in the game and you get in the swing of things and you’re battling in that kind of intensity, you don’t really feel it. You just go for it.” 
NOTES 
Cam Fowler appeared in his 371st regular-season game for the Ducks, which is just as many as former Ducks captain and Conn Smythe Trophy winner Scott Niedermayer played in over his five seasons with the franchise. In matching Niedermayer, the 23-year-old Fowler moved into a tie for fourth place in club history in games played for a defenseman. … A moment of silence was held at Honda Center in memory of the victims of Wednesday’s mass shooting in San Bernardino.

Report an Error “It’s exciting,” Thompson said. “The last couple of days, I haven’t been able to stop smiling just because it’s like Christmas. I’m excited to get going.” 
Thompson’s recovery started in June with his surgery and then having his shoulder in a sling, which he said was the worst part of the process. More rehab work was required over the remainder of the summer and throughout training camp. 
						
In the first week of November, Thompson was back with the Ducks but still a ways away from actual game action. The first of that came last weekend when he played in two games with the team’s American Hockey League affiliate in San Diego. 
“The physical part is the easiest part,” Thompson said. “The mental part of it’s the hardest. Every month you start feeling better. It’s baby steps. The sling and then it was just small movements. Just a lot of different steps you have to take and then you get to a certain point. 
“I felt like I was ready to play and then you’re not ready to play. It’s just a long process with shoulders. It takes a while. At the same time, you have to make sure you’re ready.” 	


In Thompson, the Ducks are getting back a valuable center who gives them additional quality minutes in other facets than regular fourth-line shifts with his linemates. 
“He’s a responsible fourth-line guy,” Coach Bruce Boudreau said. “I can use him in all situations. I can use him as a faceoff guy. He’s a good penalty killer. In the last 10 minutes of the game, if you’re having to protect a lead, he can play left wing. And he can skate and he’s physical. 
“We know he’s not going to score 30 out there. In the locker room, he’s a vocal guy. He’s a leader of our team. And he showed it in the playoffs last year. I thought he came really to the forefront and played great.” 
Thompson originally suffered the shoulder tears in the regular-season finale at Arizona and missed the first round of the 2015 playoffs against Winnipeg. The Ducks got the center well enough for the second and third rounds against Calgary and Chicago. 
Boudreau said once it was clear how damaged the shoulder was, it said a lot about his center’s courage. Thompson said the playoffs “definitely made it worse.” 
“From what the doctors said, it was pretty tore up,” Thompson said. “I think any guy on the team would have done the same thing. When you’re playing for the Stanley Cup, guys will do whatever it takes. 
“Once you get in the game and you get in the swing of things and you’re battling in that kind of intensity, you don’t really feel it. You just go for it.” 
NOTES 
Cam Fowler appeared in his 371st regular-season game for the Ducks, which is just as many as former Ducks captain and Conn Smythe Trophy winner Scott Niedermayer played in over his five seasons with the franchise. In matching Niedermayer, the 23-year-old Fowler moved into a tie for fourth place in club history in games played for a defenseman. … A moment of silence was held at Honda Center in memory of the victims of Wednesday’s mass shooting in San Bernardino.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/uproxx/springboard/~3/Tr3Mw0ghelU/,"After Wednesday’s mass shooting in San Bernardino, a manhunt remained intact for several hours as police pursued up to three suspects. The hunt sought to recover those who killed at least 14 people at the Inland Regional Center. As the shootings and subsequent confrontation occurred, one newspaper took aim at those who offered thoughts and prayers (under the rationale that words mean little without action). To be certain, President Obama would like more action in the direction of increased gun control. Several hours after the shootings, two suspects — Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and Tashfeen Malik, 27 — were killed after police stopped their black SUV on a residential street a few miles away from the center. There may or may not be another suspect at large, but CNN spent a great deal of time marveling over the exception to the lone wolf theory. Here’s what we know about the two deceased suspects:  UPDATE: 1:15pm – San Bernardino officials released a number of details in a press conference about the married suspects. After a thorough search, they determined that Farook and Malik’s home “had extensive amounts of ammunition” (including 12 pipe bombs and several thousands rounds of ammunition). Police Chief Jarrod Burguan stressed that “we still don’t have a motive,” but “they were equipped … and they could have done another attack.” Officials also revealed that Farook was “apparently radicalized” and “in touch with international terrorism subjects.” As this time, authorities have stopped short of assigning terrorism as a motive for Wednesday’s mass shooting.

The U.K. launched airstrikes on ISIS targets in Syria. And how to silence a crying baby in a few seconds. By
      
        BuzzFeed News Posted on December 3, 2015, at 8:30 a.m. ET HERE ARE THE TOP STORIES The attackers entered a social services center on Wednesday and opened fire before leaving in what officials described as a dark-colored SUV, BuzzFeed News writes. Most of the victims were part of a holiday party for hundreds of county government workers. The suspects, a man and a woman authorities identified as 28-year-old Syed Rizwan Farook and 27-year-old Tashfeen Malik, were killed during a shootout with police. The shooters were armed with handguns and assault-style weapons, and they were wearing tactical gear. The two are believed to have been in a relationship, and were possibly married, San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said. The shooters’ motives remain unclear, but police say they haven’t ruled out terrorism. Farook worked for San Bernardino County as an environmental health specialist, public records show. Eyewitnesses said Farook attended the party on Wednesday and that he looked anxious and left as employees gathered to take a group photo. A third suspect was detained, but it’s unclear if that person was involved in the shooting. Marie Cabrera, Sonya Gonzalez, and Christine Duran pray after the shooting. And a little extra. There are depressingly few days — if any — that go by without a mass shooting in America. Between January 2013 and the end of last month, 1,064 days passed. During that time, the U.S. experienced 1,050 mass shootings, according to data from ShootingTracker.com. (Mass shootings are defined as “when four or more people are shot in an event, or related series of events.”) More than 75% of the time, there has been another mass shooting on the same day or the day before, BuzzFeed News’ Jeremy Singer-Vine writes.  For more updates from San Bernardino, follow BuzzFeed News’ Adolfo Flores and Ken Bensinger, who are reporting from the scene. Or download the BuzzFeed News app for iOS and Android (U.S. app stores only). WE’RE KEEPING AN EYE ON The bombings came hours after U.K. politicians voted 397 to 223 in favor of Prime Minister David Cameron’s plan for military action in the war-torn country, BuzzFeed News’ Emily Ashton writes. The U.K. joins the U.S., France, and Russia in bombing ISIS targets in Syria. Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the U.K.’s opposition Labour party, opposed the airstrikes and warned against an “ill-thought-out rush to war.” After the vote — which followed a 10-hour debate in the House of Commons — Corbyn tweeted that “British service men and women will now be in harm’s way and the loss of innocent lives is sadly almost inevitable.” Two British warplanes fly over a British air base near Limassol, Cyprus, Thursday, Dec. 3, 2015, as they arrive from an airstrike against ISIS targets in Syria. What’s next? The U.K.’s defense secretary called the airstrikes — which targeted oil fields in eastern Syria — “successful,” adding that the aim of the strikes was to deliver “a very real blow on the oil and revenue on which [ISIS] depends,” BBC News writes. On Wednesday, ISIS released a new video that appears to show the beheading of a Russian citizen by a jihadi who’s also from Russia, BuzzFeed News’ Ellie Hall reports. This would be the first time ISIS has beheaded a Russian citizen. DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS? In the last decade, the main government agency responsible for workplace safety has not received or investigated a single complaint regarding sexual assault in California’s adult film industry, BuzzFeed News’ Cora Lewis writes. The issue of sexual assault on porn sets is receiving attention after six women made allegations against high-profile porn actor James Deen. Over the weekend, his ex-girlfriend — who is also a porn actor — accused him of rape on Twitter. Some performers compare the situation to the epidemic of sexual assault on college campuses. “Victims, for any number of reasons, are reluctant to report incidents to the authorities, and the lack of reported incidents may lead to authorities underestimating their prevalence,” Lewis writes. That thing where you log in to the internet for a second and see people idolizing the guy who raped you as a feminist. That thing sucks.

http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/03/planned-parenthood-shooting-doj-domestic-terrorism-abortion,"In wake of Planned Parenthood shooting in Colorado, abortion rights groups resume demand from summer for DoJ to provide counter-terrorism resources Last modified on Fri 14 Jul 2017 21.23 BST In the wake of Friday’s shooting at the Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood that left three dead and nine injured, abortion rights groups have renewed their calls for the Department of Justice to investigate attacks on abortion providers and clinics as acts of domestic terrorism. “This man went into one abortion clinic with the intention of scaring women at abortion clinics all over the nation,” said Ilyse Hogue, the president of the abortion rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America, referring to the suspect in the attack. “Unfortunately, we could have predicted this. This was not a random shooting. This was a politically motivated attack and it must be called out as such.”  Barack Obama quickly met the assault in Colorado with a strong pronouncement against “demonizing organizations like Planned Parenthood” and gun violence. Lawmakers, he said, are “going to have to act in order to make sure we’re preventing people who are deranged from getting weapons that can magnify the damage they can do”. But the Justice Department has been silent on whether it would investigate Friday’s attack or other violent events at abortion providers as acts of terrorism. Abortion rights groups have been demanding counter-terrorism resources for months. Since this past summer, when anti-abortion activists released videos edited to show Planned Parenthood employees apparently selling fetal body parts in violation of federal law, the scale of threats against abortion providers and clinics has grown. The accusations contained in the tapes have been disproven. Still, in September, the FBI alerted police departments across the country to the heightened number of incidents against Planned Parenthood, including several cases of arson. On Wednesday, NARAL and its partners delivered a petition to US attorney general Loretta Lynch demanding a DoJ terrorism investigation – just two days before the shooter in Colorado Springs opened fire, Hogue said. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Shaunna Thomas, a founder of UltraViolet, a progressive women’s rights organization, compared the Planned Parenthood shooting with the mass shooting at the Mother Emanuel AME church in Charleston that killed nine. The Justice Department initially treated those killings as an act of terror, but since backed away from that designation, to the dismay of activists. “Women have a constitutional freedom to access abortion care,” Thomas said. “That right has to be protected. Right now it is not.” The Justice Department’s definition of terrorism covers violent or life-threatening acts that “appear to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population” or influence the conduct or policy of the government. In thinking that Friday’s assault falls within these bounds, the abortion rights activists are not alone. “Clearly, this would fit their definition of terrorism,” said Michael German, a national security researcher with the New York University School of Law’s Brennan Center for Justice. “It’s totally appropriate to investigate it that way and to talk about it that way.” Michael Greenberger, the director of the University of Maryland Center for Health and Homeland Security, agreed that the door was open to a terrorism charge. “The key here is whether federal prosecutors in the national security division believe that they can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the shooter was committing a crime to change the political views of the people he was targeting?” he said. “My own view is, yes, there’s an element here of him trying to convert pro-choice people against legal abortion by putting them in fear of their lives.” Activists confirmed that they were seeking a shift in how crimes against abortion providers are prosecuted. “We hope it can start to reframe the way we talk about these attacks in society,” Hogue said. “Even though there is one man who pulled the trigger, there’s a network of actors who created the culture of hate and violence that led to it.” But they also argued a need for greater investigative resources. A string of six arsons at Planned Parenthood locations this summer, said Thomas, are being investigated without any apparent coordination. “What we’re really concerned about is how limited the resources and the scope of the investigations as they currently stand must be, because they are being investigated locally,” Thomas said. Local investigations, she said, are unable to answer larger questions: “Is there a driving connection between these attacks? If there is, what is it? Who is it?” German said these are the questions domestic terrorism investigations are specifically designed to answer. “It’s easy to look at each incident as isolated,” German said. “And maybe they are. But it’s hard to develop an effective counter-terrorism approach without a greater understanding of the scope of the problem across the country. If we’re not considering these crimes in a broad way, to understand the trend, we’re not being as effective as we can.” Domestic terrorism investigations, he continued, unlock resources and a sense of urgency that are otherwise unavailable: “Money, manpower, analysis, and all kinds of difference investigative methods – you name it. Counter-terrorism is a much higher priority than other types of crimes.” Greenberger, the University of Maryland professor, added that the DoJ’s involvement would entail more experienced prosecutors with more resources and time than local officials. “I think it’s a safe bet that the DoJ will be going through the evidence,” he said. “There is going to be a big incentive for the federal government to take the lead in the prosecution because of the viciousness of the crime.”"
http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2015/dec/03/latest-justice-department-offers-help-shooting-pro/,"SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. — San Bernardino gunman Syed Rizwan Farook had been in contact with known extremists on social media, a U.S. intelligence official said Thursday, and police said he and his wife had enough bullets and bombs to slaughter hundreds when they launched their attack on a holiday party. The details came to light as investigators tried to determine whether the rampage that left 14 people dead was terrorism, a workplace grudge or some combination. Wearing black tactical gear and wielding assault rifles, Farook, a 28-year-old county restaurant inspector, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, 27, sprayed as many as 75 rounds into a room at a social service center for the disabled, where Farook's co-workers had gathered for a holiday banquet Wednesday. Farook had attended the event but slipped out at some point. Four hours later and 2 miles away, the couple died in a gunbattle, in which they fired 76 rounds, while 23 law officers unleashed about 380, police said. On Thursday, Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said the couple left behind three rigged-together pipe bombs with a remote-control detonating device that apparently malfunctioned, and they had more than 1,600 rounds of ammunition left when police shot and killed them in their rented SUV after an hours-long manhunt. Also, at a family home in the nearby town of Redlands, authorities found 12 pipe bombs, tools for making more, and over 3,000 additional rounds of ammunition, the chief said. ""We don't know if this was workplace rage or something larger or both,"" Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in Washington, echoing President Barack Obama. ""At this point in time we don't know the motivation."" Investigators are trying to determine whether became radicalized and if so, how, and whether he was in contact with any foreign terrorist organization, said the U.S. intelligence official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. But the official said Farook had been in touch on social media with extremists who were on the FBI's radar screen. Wednesday's attack was the nation's deadliest mass shooting since the Newtown, Conn., school tragedy three years ago that left 26 children and adults dead. Twenty-one people were injured before the day was out in this Southern California city of 214,000, including two police officers, authorities said. Two of the wounded remained in critical condition. Authorities said the attack was carefully planned. ""There was obviously a mission here. We know that. We do not know why. We don't know if this was the intended target or if there was something that triggered him to do this immediately,"" David Bowdich, assistant director of the FBI's Los Angeles office, said as the bureau took over the investigation. Farook has no known criminal record, Burguan said. He was born in Chicago to a Pakistani family, was raised in Southern California and worked at San Bernardino County's Department of Public Health for five years, according to authorities and acquaintances. The Saudi Embassy said he traveled to Saudi Arabia in the summer of 2014 for nine days. As for Malik, she came to the U.S. in July 2014 on a Pakistani passport and a fiancée visa, authorities said. To get the visa, immigrants submit to an interview and biometric and background checks — screening intended to identify anyone who might pose a threat. Adam Lankford, a criminal justice professor at the University of Alabama, said his review of mass public shootings in the U.S. indicates this is the first one in recent history to involve a male-female team. Federal authorities said that Farook legally bought two handguns used in the massacre and that their two assault rifles were legally bought by someone else. They did not say how the rifles got into the attackers' hands. Before they went on the rampage, the couple dropped off their 6-month-old daughter with relatives Wednesday morning, saying they had a doctor's appointment, according to Hussam Ayloush, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Co-worker Patrick Baccari said he was sitting at the same banquet table as Farook before Farook suddenly disappeared, leaving his coat on his chair. Baccari said that when the shooting started, he took refuge in a bathroom and suffered minor wounds from shrapnel slicing through the wall. The shooting lasted about five minutes, he said, and when he looked in the mirror he realized he was bleeding. ""If I hadn't been in the bathroom, I'd probably be laying dead on the floor,"" he said. As for any workplace conflicts, Baccari said that up until then Farook showed no signs of unusual behavior and was a reserved young man. Two weeks ago, Farook and one of the co-workers he killed, 52-year-old Nicholas Thalasinos, had a heated conversation about Islam, according to Kuuleme Stephens, a friend of the victim's. Stephens said she happened to call Thalasinos while he was at work and having a discussion with Farook. She said Thalasino told her that Farook ""doesn't agree that Islam is not a peaceful religion."" Among the wounded was Julie Paez, who was at the holiday party. Paez, who tests water for the health department, was shot at least twice, and her pelvis was shattered by a bullet, according to her son, Nick Paez. She managed to send her family a message through a group chat app to say she had been shot, and she included a selfie of just her face. ""It was a picture of her with a half-smile,"" her son said. ""She just wanted to send us something so we would know what was happening."" Read Friday's Arkansas Democrat-Gazette for full details.

In the video, an unidentified male officer tells people to walk forward with their hands in front of them. “Go, walk to that deputy and keep your hands where I can see them,” he said. He tells the group to stay calm and “relax,” as the group shuffles toward a deputy at the end of a hall. “I’ll take a bullet before you, that’s for damn sure,” he says.  “Just be cool, ok?” Gabi Flores, who works at the Inland Regional Center where the shooting happened, shared the video with KPCC. San Bernardino Police Department referred calls about the identity of the police officer to a spokeswoman who could not be reached for comment. Syed R. Farook, 28, and Tashfeen Malik, 27, opened fire inside the Inland Regional Center on Wednesday, killing 14 people and injuring at least 17 others. The motive is unknown, although police quote some witnesses as saying Farook had attended the annual holiday party, left in a fit of anger and returned with Malik. The couple — who met online and who became acquainted in Saudi Arabia — were decked out in body armor and armed with assault rifles and handguns. Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said that following the late-morning massacre, the pair fled in a dark-colored SUV but were shortly tracked down by police, who riddled the vehicle with bullets. Both Farook and Malik died at the scene. Contributing: Doug Stanglin Follow @MaryBowerman on Twitter."

""It is possible that this is terrorist-related, but we don't know. It's also possible this was workplace-related,"" he said. ""There may be mixed motives in all this, which makes the investigation more complicated. But rest assured, we will get to the bottom of this.""

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the change in tone was only because the president had just been briefed on the incident by top law enforcement, intelligence and national security officials, and that Obama remained committed to gun safety legislation. Indeed, Obama used the San Bernardino shooting to rally a public response, saying the prevalence of mass shootings have made Americans often feel ""as if there is nothing we can do about it.""

(California Department of Motor Vehicles via AP)  SAN BERNARDINO — San Bernardino gunman Syed Rizwan Farook had been in contact with known Islamic extremists on social media, a U.S. intelligence official said Thursday, and police said he and his wife had enough bullets and bombs to slaughter hundreds when they launched their deadly attack on a holiday party. The details emerged as investigators tried to determine whether the rampage that left 14 people dead was terrorism, a workplace grudge or some combination. The husband-and-wife killers were not under FBI scrutiny before the massacre, said a second U.S. official, who likewise was not authorized to discuss the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity. But, late Thursday, a law enforcement official said authorities are looking for a man who bought two rifles used in a Southern California attack that killed 14 people. The official had knowledge of the investigation but wasn’t authorized to speak publicly. Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire Wednesday at a holiday party in San Bernardino. Authorities have said two pistols and two rifles they carried were bought legally more than three years ago. Farook bought the pistols, but a man authorities won’t identify bought the rifles. It’s not known if the man was acting on Farook’s behalf when he bought the weapons or if they were stolen and then used in the attack. The official says the guns were all purchased in California. Also late Thursday, Muslims that gathered at one of Southern California’s largest mosques have denounced Wednesday’s massacre, which occurred only about two dozen miles away. About 200 people met at the mosque in Chino on Thursday night for a prayer vigil and to send a message that Ahsan Khan described as “love for all, hatred for none.” Khan and other leaders of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community described the shooting that killed 14 people in San Bernardino as deplorable and horrific. Leaders also said they didn’t know Farook, who was killed along with his wife in a gun battle with police. Group spokesman Amjad Mahmood Khan cautioned that no one yet knows the motives of the killers and can’t presume it was faith-driven. But he said he said the “radicalization of Muslim youth is a problem.” Wearing black tactical gear and wielding assault rifles, Farook, a 28-year-old county restaurant inspector, and his wife, Malik, 27, sprayed as many as 75 rounds into a room at a social service center for the disabled, where about 75 of Farook’s co-workers had gathered Wednesday morning. Farook had attended the event but slipped out and returned in battle dress. Four hours later and two miles away, the couple died in a furious gunbattle in which they fired 76 rounds, while 23 law officers unleashed about 380, police said. On Thursday, Police Chief Jarrod Burguan offered a grim inventory that suggested Wednesday’s bloodbath could have been far worse. At the social service center, the couple left three rigged-together pipe bombs with a remote-control detonating device that apparently malfunctioned, and they had more than 1,600 rounds of ammunition remaining when police killed them in their rented SUV, Burguan said. At a family home in the nearby town of Redlands, they had 12 pipe bombs, tools for making more, and over 3,000 additional rounds of ammunition, the chief said. “We don’t know if this was workplace rage or something larger or a combination of both,” Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in Washington, echoing President Barack Obama. “We don’t know the motivation.” Investigators are trying to determine whether Farook, who was Muslim, became radicalized — and, if so, how — as well as whether he was in contact with any foreign terrorist organization, said the U.S. intelligence official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The same official said Farook had been in touch on social media with extremists who were under FBI scrutiny. The second U.S. official said the FBI was treating the attack as a potential act of terror but had reached no conclusion that it was. The official said Farook’s contacts online did not involve any significant players the FBI knew of and dated back some time, with there was no immediate indication of a recent surge in communication. The official cautioned that such contact by itself doesn’t mean someone is a terrorist. Rita Katz, director of SITE Intelligence Group, an organization that tracks and analyzes extremists, said it hasn’t found any connection between Farook and jihadi groups. But she also said that some of Farook’s social media posts seem to have been deleted before the attack. Wednesday’s rampage was the nation’s deadliest mass shooting since 2012, when 26 children and adults were slain in Newtown, Connecticut. In San Bernardino, a Southern California city of 214,000, the victims ranged in age from 26 to 60. A further 21 people were injured, including two police officers, authorities said. Two of the wounded remained in critical condition Thursday. Nearly all the dead and wounded were county employees. Authorities said the attack was carefully planned. “There was obviously a mission here. We know that. We do not know why. We don’t know if this was the intended target or if there was something that triggered him to do this immediately,” David Bowdich, assistant director of the FBI’s Los Angeles office, said as the bureau took over the investigation. Farook has no known criminal record, Burguan said. He was born in Chicago to a Pakistani family, raised in Southern California and worked at San Bernardino County’s Department of Public Health for two stints totaling four years since 2010, according to authorities and acquaintances. The Saudi Embassy said he traveled to Saudi Arabia in the summer of 2014 for nine days. As for Malik, she came to the U.S. in July 2014 on a Pakistani passport and a fiancée visa, authorities said. To get the visa, immigrants submit to an interview and biometric and background checks — screening intended to identify anyone who might pose a threat. They were married on Aug. 16, 2014, in nearby Riverside County, according to their marriage license. Both listed their religion as Muslim. The couple had a 6-month-old daughter who they dropped with relatives Wednesday morning before the shooting. Adam Lankford, a criminal justice professor at the University of Alabama, said his review of mass public shootings in the U.S. indicates this is the first one in recent history involving a male-female team. Farook was a devout Muslim who prayed every day and recently memorized the Quran, according to brothers Nizaam and Rahemaan Ali, who attended Dar Al Uloom Al Islamiyah mosque in San Bernardino with Farook. Rahemaan Ali said he last saw Farook three weeks ago, when he abruptly stopped going to the mosque. Ali said Farook seemed happy and his usual self, and the brothers never saw a violent side. “He never ever talked about killing people or discussed politics, or said that he had problems at work,” Rahemaan Ali said. “He always had a smile on his face.” Federal authorities said Farook legally bought two handguns used in the massacre and their two assault rifles were legally bought by someone else. Authorities did not say how the rifles got into the attackers’ hands. Farook apparently was no stranger to guns. A profile on a matchmaking website for South Asians that matched Farook’s name, California hometown, county health job and Muslim faith said his interests included target shooting in his backyard. Though the date of the posting was not clear, it listed his age as 22 so it could have been six years old. Two weeks ago, Farook and one of the co-workers he killed, 52-year-old Nicholas Thalasinos, had a heated conversation about Islam, according to Kuuleme Stephens, a friend of the victim. Stephens said she happened to call Thalasinos while he was talking with Farook at work. She said Thalasinos told her Farook “doesn’t agree that Islam is not a peaceful religion.” As for workplace conflicts, co-worker Patrick Baccari said that until the rampage, Farook showed no signs of unusual behavior and was a reserved young man. Baccari said he was sitting at the same table as Farook before Farook suddenly disappeared, leaving his coat on his chair. Baccari was in the bathroom when the shooting started; he suffered minor wounds from shrapnel slicing through the wall. One of the first officers to reach the room said the carnage was “unspeakable” and the scene overwhelming — the smell of gunpowder, the wails of the injured, the blood, fire sprinklers pumping and fire alarms blaring. All in a room with a Christmas tree and decorations on every table. “As we entered,” said San Bernardino Police Lt.

The group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, has not claimed responsibility for the shootings, but the radical group based in Syria and Iraq has threatened to carry out attacks across the U.S. “Three lions made us proud. They are still alive,” one ISIS adherent tweeted in Arabic after the shootings at Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, Vocativ reported exclusively. “California streets are full with soldiers with heavy weapons. The United States is burning #America_Burning #Takbir” Another ISIS supporter posted in reference to the shooting on Twitter, “God is the greatest. May god spread fear in the homes of the Crusaders.” Another ISIS extremist wrote: “Let America know a new era #California #America_burning.” President Barack Obama said Thursday from the Oval Office that the motive behind the killings was unknown but terrorism could be involved. The shooting in California carried out by a husband and wife also left at least 21 wounded in the deadliest mass shooting in the U.S. since the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012. A police search for the suspects resulted in a deadly shootout, with both suspects killed. A third person was detained, but police later said only the two suspects were involved in the attack. The man involved in the shootings was Syed Farook, a staff employee at the San Bernardino County Public Health Department. Farook’s father said his son was a “very religious” Muslim. “He would go to work, come back, go to pray, come back,” his father told the New York Daily News. Farook’s brother-in-law, Farhan Khan, told reporters during a news conference in Anaheim, California, organized by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) that he was shocked. “I cannot express how sad I am for what happened today,” he said. “My condolences to the people who lost their lives. I am in shock that something like this could happen.” Twitter users were quick to blame the shooting on ISIS. Google Trends found that the terms “ISIS” and “California” were heavily searched together Wednesday. Earlier this week, a California man pleaded guilty to planning to join the group in Syria. Nicholas Michael Teausant, 22, was charged with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, the Jerusalem Post reported."

https://newrepublic.com/article/124980/the-new-normal-happy-sorrow,"When I was ten, my mother married a Baltimore County Police officer. While
off duty, he kept his service pistol in a locked box in their bedroom closet;
after each shift, he’d sit on the edge of their bed and unload it. I never
watched him do it. But the clicks and cadences became familiar, and the chills
I felt hearing them never went away—even now, when I hear pistols being loaded
and unloaded in action films, I shudder. The sounds echoed off our high
ceilings. Some nights, it was impossible not to think: “There is a weapon
in this house that can easily kill. Only one of us is trained to use it.”
It was also impossible to forget what I’d seen and read about police officers
using their guns on unarmed civilians. These were the Amadou Diallo
years, the Sean
Bell years. For about nine of the eleven years they were married, my
stepfather served on the police force. I never saw him wield the gun, but
living with it in my house shaped my ideas about owning one. I don’t want to.
They have never made me feel safer. In October, as President Obama delivered his impassioned response to the
mass shooting in Roseburg, Oregon at Umpqua Community College, he stressed how
repetitive this cycle has become. “Somehow this has become routine,”
he said. “The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends
up being routine. The conversation in the aftermath of it. We’ve become numb to
this.” And these shootings are happening so frequently that numbness is
unsurprising. We develop stock responses, because the details of each tragedy
being to blur and our condolences and pleas for more stringent gun control—or a
redoubled defense of gun ownership—become
interchangeable. The data show that a mass shooting—where four or more die—happens nearly
once per day in this country. This year, they have happened more
often than that. But there are ways to avoid forgetting the cost of
American gun violence, even for those of us who have experienced the news
reports at a remove, even among those of us who have been fortunate enough to
have never witnessed or been the victim of a shooting. This is imperative,
because retaining our humanity depends on being able to feel. For me, staving off numbness involves a series of rituals. They
alternate between conjuring memory, speaking the names of the dead, and,
retaining some minor detail reported about the personality of at least one
victim among those slain in mass shootings. Six-year-old Sandy Hook Elementary
student Catherine Violet Hubbard, for instance, had flame-red hair and a
smattering of freckles across her cheeks and nose. She loved animals so much
that her family requested donations to the
Newtown Animal Shelter in lieu of flowers to honor her memory. Lucas
Eibel, one of nine killed at Umpqua, was a Wildlife Safari junior zookeeper
and a quadruplet; when I think of him, I think about his siblings, and imagine how
they are coping. President Obama was quick to acknowledge the many “responsible,
law-abiding gun owners” who use their firearms “to hunt, for sport,
and to protect their families.” And I immediately remember my first years
teaching college in Michigan, where, during deer season, some of my students
would occasionally come to class in camouflage. Some would write their
narrative essays about their first successful kills as young hunters. Mostly I
remember them as proud, grateful for their familial rites of passage. But I
also remember the student who wrote that he froze the first time a deer entered
his sights, and how the sudden gravity of his power to end a life filled him
with indecision. His father, he wrote, reassured him: many hunters pause the
first time. He said his father told him it would get easier. Thoughts of former students often pull me back from ambivalence. In
July, as Baltimore experienced its deadliest month in 30 years, I scrolled
through a Baltimore Sun article that shared
the photographs of the 45 people murdered in 31 days, along with brief
summaries of the circumstances surrounding their deaths and small details about
them from their families. The victims died mostly from gunshots. As I scrolled, the details and faces began to blur together, though I
instinctively checked the neighborhoods where the homicides occurred. None were
close to mine. This shouldn’t have mattered; I know that my address doesn’t
insulate me from gun violence. Nothing does. But it’s hard not to feel an
admixture of relief at latest shooting’s distance from my street and shame for
being glad to have been spared other neighborhoods’ misfortunes. I kept
scanning the ages of the victims in the paper to see if I might remember anyone
from grade school. Another sigh of relief; I didn’t see the faces of anyone
from my childhood. But suddenly  I was
struck with growing alarm: I realized I still might recognize one of the dead from
the introduction to college writing class I taught in Baltimore for three
years. There are too many ways to know or know of someone who was killed in a
shooting; there are too many ways to know someone who did the shooting. Gun violence is that prevalent. After those twenty children were shot and killed at Sandy Hook
Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, I joined the Facebook community “Remembering Ana
Marquez-Greene.” I still visit it and her mother still updates it. In
12 days, it will be the three-year anniversary. On September 17, she writes:
“The bus Ana should be on to 4th grade just drove by the house (it’s
amazing how that sound makes my knees buckle).” Later, on September 27,
she notes
that how her surviving son, Isaiah, still asks why it happened. She says that
even he’s happy, “it’s hard to be ‘completely’ happy. The new normal is
happy sorrow.” I remember that Tywanza Sanders, who died trying to protect his mother
and aunt at Bethel A.M.E in Charleston, was afraid to flush the toilet when he
was a little boy, according to his sister’s remarks at his funeral. “And
look what he did last week,” she observed in the aftermath. “He
wasn’t afraid of anything.” In the coming days, just as President Obama predicted a few months ago,
I’ll settle into my own routine again. If I can stomach it, I’ll read what I
can about the victims of the latest
shooting. I’ll try hard to remember their lives, because that is how we
keep life sacred. I don’t need those memories to lobby my state representatives about gun
laws. They aren’t the reason I support stronger regulations for gun ownership.
And perhaps it’s the emptiest gesture in the world that I collect knowledge
about lives that never should have been lost to a gunman’s impersonal motives
or random aim. But I wish we all would do it. I wish the ritual would translate
to legislative action. I wish all gun deaths were regarded as something more
than rhetorical devices or as admonition against ambivalence. In the meantime, I
will keep to my routine, as often as tragedy necessitates. Stacia Brown is a writer based in Baltimore, MD."

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/P3Wv5w9p69Y/,"“I just want to tell you that I love you,” Denise Peraza, a victim of Wednesday night’s mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, told her sister on the phone, with the news that she had been shot in the lower back. Peraza is one of many victims of the shooting whose first instinct was to call relatives and update them on their status personally, long before news outlets had yet to piece together the details of the occasion: that 28-year-old Syed Rizwan Farook and 27-year-old Tashfeen Malik had armed themselves, dressed in all black, and opened fire at a holiday party Farook’s company was holding. The shooting began after Farook disappeared from the dinner table he was sitting at and returned with his wife and weapons in tow. Local news outlets have chronicled the alarming phone calls and messages family members received from the inside of the scene of the crime. Peraza, who is currently recovering from her injuries at Arrowhead Regional Medical Center, was one of many to feel the need to say their final “I love you”s before being taken to the hospital. Melinda Rivas called her son to explain the situation: “There’s men and they’re wearing all black with masks and there’s a lady down outside.” Rivas and a large group of 40 people remained unharmed after locking themselves into a room. She was exposed to some of the victims, however, including the diseased. Her son, Cameron James, told local news in the early morning hours that he had yet to be able to speak to her since the fateful call, as she had been in high demand by media looking for a witness to tell their story. Kevin Ortiz, recovering from three bullet wounds, was able to call his wife and his father to inform them of his status. “I’ve been shot three times, Dad. I’m in pain. Don’t worry. There’s a policeman with me,” Ortiz allegedly told his father. He spoke to his wife, Dyana Ortiz, and gave her a similar message and an “I love you.” Luis Gutiérrez tells the local NBC affiliate that his wife was unable to say much on her call, but he could hear the screams around here. “I didn’t know what was going on. All I heard was, ‘There’s a shooter at work,'” he said, noting that he immediately drove to the scene of the crime to find out what had happened. He later learned she and some coworkers had also locked themselves in a room and used chairs to block to door, waiting for the situation to subside. Some were not so lucky, and into the early morning hours were still waiting for news. Jeff Thompson told the Press Enterprise early this morning that he was hoping to be updated on his wife’s status. He only heard from her after he had been told she had been shot, her voice a source of relief after hours of uncertainty. Law enforcement officials are still investigating the scene of the crime, and the name of only one deceased victim has been released at press time: 58-year-old Damian Meins, “the husband of the principal at Sacred Heart School in Rancho Cucamonga.” LocalNational SecurityCaliforniaradical islamSan BernardinoSan Bernardino shootingSyed Rizwan FarookTashfeen Malik .

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/126352335/0/usatodaycomnation-topstories~Term-mass-shooting-confuses-public-and-masks-phenomenon/,"Depending on how you're counting, the shooting deaths of 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif. Wednesday was the 22nd mass shooting this year, or one of more than 300 in a near-daily epidemic. Big difference. But the problem is one of definitions, sometimes used sloppily and interchangeably. The result: a very confused, and possibly hyperventilating public. There is no official definition of a mass shooting. The closest is by the Congressional Research Service, which says it is four or more people killed with a firearm, not including the killer. That's pretty similar to the FBI's definition of a mass killing, about 75% of which are committed with a firearm, according to USA TODAY research. (Other weapons include knives, a baseball bat, even one case where a father threw his children off a bridge). So far this year, there have been 29 mass killings, resulting in 155 deaths. Of those, 22 incidents were shootings. But several other sources use alternate definitions, regardless of whether anyone dies. For example, two widely used sources on mass shootings include Stanford Mass Shootings, and Mass Shooting Tracker, The first defines a mass shooting as three or more people shot,but not necessarily fatally; the killer(s) is not counted. The second defines it as four or more people shot, not necessarily fatally. It may include the killer(s). Researchers say headlines that suggest a 'mass shooting' occurs daily, on average, are misleading. In the eyes of the public, that translates into a San Bernardino-style shooting nearly every day. ""That definition of four or more shot, rarely translates to four or more killed. One-third of these 'mass shootings' result in no fatalities, and only 5% are mass killings,"" says James Alan Fox, Lipman Family Professor of Criminology, Law & Public Policy at Northeastern University. ""However, this scary one-a-day statistic is rolled out whenever there is a large-scale mass killing, allowing unsophisticated readers to make the wrong connection."" Fox also points out that the one-a-day statistic is devoid of any benchmark. Since most counting of public shootings occurred after Sandy Hook almost exactly three years ago, it's difficult to make comparisons. ""Without historical context, we get hysterical response."" says Fox. ""If it were possible (and it really isn’t) to go back to 2005 and count number of shootings with 4+ injured, I’m sure it would be on par with today’s figures."" Fox says the central problem is that the idea of a 'mass shooting' conflates how the crime occurred, with how many victims. And they are really separate hallmarks. It also makes it really hard to understand which way such incidents are trending. Mass killings -- by firearm or other means -- have not increased since 2006; they are consistently about two dozen a year. But there is some indication that incidents of 'active shooters' may be increasing. According to an FBI report released last year, there were 160 'active shooter' events between 2000 and 2013. An average of 6.4 incidents occurred in the first 7 years studied, and an average of 16.4 occurred in the last 7 years. But critics say early years are under counted, which likely explains the increase. Anyone waving a gun in a public place is threatening, and should be counted to understand such episodes of violence. But the FBI is far more likely to call such incidents an 'active shooter' because it makes no distinction between whether deaths have occurred, and conveys the idea that it's an ongoing situation. USATODAY.COM BEHIND THE BLOODSHED: THE UNTOLD STORY OF AMERICA'S MASS KILLINGS That's precisely why the Congressional Research Service report called for better data collection among government agencies. Currently, the FBI collects data on all homicides in the U.S., though -- because of the way individual police agencies report incidents -- nearly half of the mass killing cases included in the Supplemental Homicide Report are incorrect. The report includes cases that never occurred, and leaves out cases that did, according to USA TODAY research. Clarifying the definition and improving reporting -- whether it's mass killing, mass shooting or active shooter, is critical to understanding and responding to the phenomenon, the CRS report noted. ""Mass shootings are arguably one of the worst manifestations of gun violence,"" the report notes. And everyone has a different definition ""contributing to a welter of claims and counter-claims about the prevalence and deadliness of mass shootings. With improved data, policymakers would arguably have additional vantage points from which to assess the legislative proposals that are inevitably made in the wake of these tragedies."""
http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/RBOVEszQcck/,"California Gov. Jerry Brown is not yet canceling plans to attend the UN climate change conference in Paris, despite Wednesday’s mass shooting in San Bernardino. “We’ll update the advisory if there are schedule changes,” Deputy Spokesperson Gareth Lacy told Breitbart News. Brown did cancel the Christmas tree lighting, originally scheduled for Wednesday, after the shooting. Friday is Brown’s first scheduled day in Paris, where he is due to begin by speaking at a gathering of “subnational” governments. UN Secretary-General Ban-ki Moon will participate. He is also scheduled to speak and/or participate in a variety of other events through next Wednesday. He will be joined at the Paris conference by several other California political leaders, all Democrats. On Wednesday, Brown issued a statement in which he said: “California will spare no effort in bringing these killers to justice.” The motives of the San Bernardino killers are still–officially–unclear, though both were Muslim and appear to have planned for large-scale attack, using a variety of guns and possible explosive devices, and filming the entire attack with GoPro cameras. The FBI said late Wednesday that the attack may have been terrorism, but has not confirmed that, pending further investigation. President Barack Obama has been criticized for saying that climate change is a greater danger than terrorism, and for claiming that the Paris climate change conference is an answer to terrorists from the so-called Islamic State who attacked Paris last month.

http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/03/republicans-sheldon-adelson-speeches-republican-jewish-coalition,"Candidates take turns addressing crowd of influential donors at event hosted by Republican Jewish Coalition, closely tied to mega-donor Sheldon Adelson Last modified on Fri 14 Jul 2017 21.23 BST Republican presidential candidates were supposed to be competing for the endorsement of mega-donor Sheldon Adelson on Thursday. Instead, it seemed as if each was vying to give the most surreal performance at a forum held by the Republican Jewish Coalition in Washington DC. In front of the crowd of influential GOP powerbrokers and donors who are members of the RJC, bizarre moments repeatedly popped up as the two frontrunners in the race, Donald Trump and Ben Carson, both demonstrated their lack of knowledge of foreign policy in startling and astonishing ways.  Closely tied to Adelson – the mega-donor and casino magnate who single-handedly kept Newt Gingrich’s 2012 bid for the White House alive – the RJC has long attracted presidential hopefuls. The group focuses on promoting a hawkish foreign policy – it strenuously opposed the nuclear deal with Iran – and most candidates attending typically harp on these themes. Instead, Trump told borderline antisemitic jokes and Carson gave a monotone history lesson on the Middle East. Trump repeatedly referenced stereotypes of Jewish business acumen and wealth in his speech. He told attendees “You’re not going to support me because I don’t want your money” while suggesting they wanted to control politicians. Trump also asked the audience: “Is there anyone who doesn’t renegotiate deals in this room? Perhaps more than in any room I have ever spoken.” He also compared himself to Elton John and said: “I was the grand marshal of the Israel Day Parade at a very dangerous time.” He presided over that parade in New York City in 2004. The one time that Trump discussed policy he was booed by the audience, when he dodged a question about whether Jerusalem should be the undivided capital of Israel. For his part, Carson read a scripted speech in a quiet monotone. The retired neurosurgeon has long drawn questions about whether he has sufficient foreign policy experience to serve in the White House and recently took a trip to Jordan to burnish his credentials on the topic. In his speech, Carson repeatedly mispronounced the name of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, calling it “hummus” on several occasions as he seemed to give a basic history lesson of the Middle East, reciting every war in the region since 1947. He also repeatedly cited truisms, such as: “There is a geographic challenge in trying to unite Gaza and the West Bank.” The two are 25 miles apart. Among the establishment Republicans, Ohio governor John Kasich proclaimed that his mother told him as a child: “If you want a really good friend, find somebody who is Jewish.” Even the gaffe-free speeches prompted raised eyebrows. South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham ignored foreign policy almost entirely and instead lit into Ted Cruz and Trump on abortion and immigration reform in a remarkable, rambling and somewhat unconventional speech. A well-known hawk who has ardently supported Israel and joked that he didn’t need to even mention the issue, Graham told attendees: “Anyone can beat Hillary Clinton as long as they are right on two things: on immigration and sensible on social issues.” The South Carolina senator, who has been languishing at the back of the pack, went out of his way to target Cruz’s claim that he could build a winning general election coalition centered around the Republican base. Graham mocked the idea and focused on the need to attract Hispanics to the GOP. He asked the predominantly Jewish crowd about the idea of rounding up illegal immigrants: “Does that sound familiar to you?” Graham also said Cruz was unelectable in a general election because he was opposed to allowing victims of rape or incest to seek abortions. The South Carolina Republican said his party would not win a general election if the nominee did not support a rape and incest exception. Rand Paul abruptly cancelled his scheduled appearance due to votes in the Senate. The cancellation raised eyebrows among some at the group as the Kentucky Republican has long been viewed skeptically by pro-Israel advocates because of his relatively isolationist views. One person close to the RJC wondered aloud to the Guardian whether his absence was a deliberate snub. A few candidates did focus on foreign policy. Chris Christie gave an impassioned speech recalling 9/11 and suggested that in light of the mass shooting in San Bernardino, “let’s remember if a center for the developmentally disabled in San Bernardino can be a target for a terrorist attack then every place in America is a target for a terrorist attack”. His warnings were echoed by Jeb Bush, who suggested the Obama administration was soft on terrorism and also got applause by saying on Israel policy, he relies most on his brother, former president George W Bush, for advice. But the most well-attended speeches came in the morning from Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, two candidates rapidly rising in the polls. Both sounded similar notes as ardent supporters of Israel. In a fiery oration on Thursday, Cruz reiterated promises from his stump speech including his pledge to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. However, he also made more detailed and nuanced proposals specifically to appeal to attendees. In particular, the Texas senator pledged that if elected, “any university that supports the BDS movement will find federal funds stripped away”. BDS, which stands for Boycott, Divest, Sanction, is a movement that has become a major concern of Adelson and other pro-Israel advocates who consider the group to be antisemitic. He also raised the specter that the mass shooting in San Bernardino on Wednesday was Islamic terrorism. Cruz told attendees: “All of us are deeply concerned that this is yet another manifestation of terrorism, radical Islamic terrorism at home. Coming in the wake of terrorist attack at Paris, this horrific murder underscores that we are at a time of war.” Rubio echoed Cruz’s hawkishness in a tough address that condemned efforts by the European Union to label goods from what the Florida senator said come from “what the EU considers ‘Israeli-occupied territories’”. Rubio warned darkly that “discriminatory laws that apply only to Jews are now being written into European law for the first time in more than half a century”. The Florida senator went on to say: “I believe we need a president who is not afraid to call this out for what it is: antisemitism.” Rubio also echoed Cruz’s condemnation of the BDS movement and said “it reeks of hypocrisy”. On Middle East policy, Rubio made clear he would be a firm ally of Israel as well. “There is no moral equivalence between Israel and those who seek to destroy her,” he told attendees. In his view, the peace process was “not a real estate deal with two sides arguing over money. It’s a struggle to safeguard the future of Israel.” However, Rubio and Cruz disagreed on Syria and the future of the Assad regime. Rubio targeted Cruz for saying he would be comfortable leaving Assad in power as the least of all evils in Syria. The Florida senator said: “This simplistic notion that ‘leave Assad there because he’s a brutal killer, but he’s not as bad as what’s going to follow him’ is a fundamental and simplistic and dangerous misunderstanding of the reality of the region.” It’s unclear though how much the actual debate about policy between the two senators stood out from the political carnival surrounding them."

Syed Farook, a 28-year-old county health inspector, journeyed to the Middle Eastern country for about a month and came back to the U.S. with a wife, his coworker Patrick Baccari told the Associated Press. Baccari worked in a cubicle near Farook and also attended the banquet the couple targeted in a conference room at a center for developmentally disabled people.

It’s still unclear where else Farook may have traveled before the deadly rampage. “We know he did go to Pakistan at one point,” Bowdich said. Malik, who has a Pakistani passport, was in the country on a K-1 visa, which is issued to the fiancé of a U.S. citizen to enter the country. Authorities still don’t know the couple’s motive. “There was obviously a mission here. We know that. We do not know why,” Bowdich said. Farook and Malik killed 14 people and injured 17 others in their attack at the Inland Regional Center before they were gunned down in a police shootout.

http://www.inquisitr.com/2607474/syed-farook-was-radicalized-san-bernardino-shooter-in-touch-with-fbi-terror-suspect/,"Syed Farook Radicalized Update - FBI officials revealed during a San Bernardino shooting update press conference that Farook did travel to Pakistan and are yet unsure of how many other places he may have gone on a recent visit to the Middle East. The rental home searched last night by investigators may have not been the residence of Farook and Tasfeen Malik. California FBI officials said that the address may have just been used as a bomb-making factory. The black SUV used during the shooting was a rental vehicle. Three pipe bombs were wired together at the Inland Regional Center, but the devices did not explode. Photo of woman believed to be Tashfeen Malik as shard by US News and World Report.   FBI agents have found approximately 5,000 rounds of ammunition, at least one dozen pipe bombs and hundreds of tools for making IEDs - improvised explosive devices at the property rented to Tashfeen Malik and Syed Farook. ""He's married and has a kid. We're estranged because my wife got the divorce, and [she and my son] are together. She doesn't want to see me,"" the elder Syed Farook, the shooter's father, told the New York Daily News. ""He was very religious. He would go to work, come back, go to pray, come back. He's Muslim."" The shooter was born in America to Pakistani parents. A San Bernardino County coworker of Farook, Patrick Baccari, said he shared a cubicle with the killer. During an interview with the Los Angeles TimesBaccari said Syed and his family appeared to be ""living the American dream.""  — Joe Prich (@JoePrich) December 3, 2015  — Joe Prich (@JoePrich) December 3, 2015  As previously reported by the Inquisitr, Tashfeen Malik, the wife of the San Bernardino male shooter, is a native of Pakistan.

http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2015/12/president_obama_its_possible_c.html,"Barack Obama President Barack Obama makes a statement on Wednesday's mass shooting in San Bernandino, Calif., Thursday, Dec. 3, 2015, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C. (Evan Vucci, Associated Press) WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama said Thursday investigators are continuing to search for the motives of the people who killed 14 people in a spray of bullets in California and called on Americans to ""search ourselves as a society"" to find a way to curb gun violence. Speaking to journalists in the Oval Office, Obama said there may have been ""mixed motives"" behind the shooting, a factor that is complicating the investigation. ""It is possible that this was terrorist-related, but we don't know. It's also possible this was workplace-related,"" Obama said after a meeting with his national security team. Obama said the suspects in the Wednesday shooting were equipped with weapons at the time they were killed by police and appeared to have access to more at home. ""We don't know why they did it. We don't know at this point the extent of their plans,"" Obama said, warning against passing judgment before conclusions are drawn. Obama repeated his case for new gun control measures -- a call he's promised to issue after every mass shooting -- although he did not lay out specific proposals or criticize the Republican-led Congress for blocking tighter controls, as he often does. Speaking softly, a subdued Obama said too often Americans feel there's nothing they can do to prevent this kind of violence. ""We all have a part to play. As the investigation moves forward, it's going to be important for all of us, including our legislatures, to see what we can do to make sure that when an individual decides they want to do somebody harm, we make it a little harder for them to do it. Right now, it's just too easy. ""We're going to have to, I think, search ourselves as a society,"" he said. Obama ordered U.S. flags at the White House and other government buildings to be flown at half-staff through Monday to honor the victims of the shootings.

December 3, 2015 A police officer leading trapped bystanders to safety from the Inland Regional Center, the site of Wednesday’s mass shooting in San Bernandino, Calif., offered comforting words to the group that has won the hearts of many. Cell phone video footage, captured by customer service coordinator Gabi Flores, shows the tense moments at the social service center in San Bernardino, as the group was being calmly guided out of harm’s way by police officers. In the video, people including two women holding a child's hands appear clearly anxious and whisper as they try to get out of the building. At that point, the group had no idea where the attackers were. Despite the terrifying situation unfolding, a cop can be heard reassuring the panicked group, ""Try to relax, try to relax. I'll take a bullet before you do, that's for damn sure."" The video has gone viral and many people on the Internet were quick to praise the officer’s calm actions. “What an honorable officer. Thank you sir. And thank you to his family for supporting him while he puts his life on the line,” Facebook user Kookoo Jacobs, commented on a post of the footage by KPCC, a public radio station in Pasadena. One Reddit user said: ""This is a video of a police officer doing a commendable job. In the middle of all this chaos and terror the officer was able to keep everyone calm and orderly. This is the kind of professionalism one would hope for. When all you ever hear is how bad cops are, it's good to see the other side of things."" Another Redditor wrote: ""You can hear the camera person sort of laugh to herself, and she definitely sounds like she was crying based on the other noises. I imagine that probably eased a lot of tension and made her and others feel very safe. Just a good officer doing his job well."" Police say at least 14 people were killed and 17 wounded during the shooting at the San Bernardino facility, which serves individuals with developmental disabilities and has a staff of nearly 670 people.

San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said of the attackers, “They came prepared to do what they did, as if they were on a mission.""

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it.

http://rssfeeds.cincinnati.com/~/126290219/0/cincinnati-home~Officials-Guns-used-in-ramage-purchased-legally/,"SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. — The married couple who massacred 14 people during a holiday party at a social service center fired up to 75 rounds into the frantic crowd and even planted a crude explosive device of pipe bombs before they fled the scene, police said Thursday. Authorities said Syed R. Farook, 28, and Tashfeen Malik, 27, had amassed a huge arsenal of weapons, ammunition and explosive devices at their residence in nearby Redlands that they drew upon for their attack Wednesday. Twenty-one people also were injured; at least two remained in critical condition. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Thursday it was still too early to determine whether the shooting had its roots in terrorism. But the FBI’s National Security Division, which oversees terror cases, is deeply involved in investigating the backgrounds of the two dead suspects, a federal law enforcement official said Thursday. Of particular interest is the suspects’ recent travel to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan and Farook’s apparent contacts with at least a handful of individuals with suspected ties to radical extremism and who have been known to the FBI, said the official, who was not authorized to comment publicly on the matter. The official cautioned that investigators have not fully examined the contents of all of the couples' electronic communications, so any suspicious messages or contacts are still under review. Authorities have begun to piece together some key elements of the attack at the center but have not determined a motive. ""If you look at the preparation, the amount of weapons and ammunition, there was obviously a mission here,"" David Bowdich, assistant director of the Los Angeles FBI office, told reporters Thursday. But he added that at this early stage in the investigation it would be ""irresponsible and premature to call this terrorism."" ""We cannot rule anything out at this point,” Bowdich said. The two suspects were shot and killed hours after the initial attack during a high-speed chase with officers who traced them to their Redlands residence. Two officers were slightly injured in the encounter, but none of the wounds was life-threatening. It was the nation's deadliest shooting since a gunman killed 26 people in Newtown, Conn., in December 2012. San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said Thursday that each shooter was armed with a handgun and assault-style weapon. The guns were purchased legally and registered, he said. The couple wore dark tactical clothing, as well as utility vests stocked with 1,600 rounds of ammunition when they burst into the center's conference room. USA TODAY Delta announces new European routes from Detroit, Minneapolis “They sprayed the room with bullets,"" he said. ""I don't know that there was anyone that they openly targeted."" Police found a crude, remote-controlled explosive device made up of three pipe bombs wired together that had been left in a bag at the scene. Burguan said it was not clear whether the killers failed to push the button or the device simply misfired. Burguan said a search of the couple's home turned up 2,000 9mm rounds, more than 2500 .223-caliber rounds and “several hundred” 22 long rifle ​rounds, as well as 12 pipe bombs and tools for making more explosive devices. He said the pair had rented their black SUV  several days earlier and were supposed to return it on the day of the assault. Farook legally purchased two handguns at dealers in San Diego and Corona within the past three years, said another federal law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly. Investigators were looking more closely at the transactions involving the two assault-style rifles, which were purchased by another person who was not immediately identified. Burguan said that although initial reports indicated as many as three shooters may have been involved, ""we are confident now"" that Farook and Malik acted alone. Farook, who was born in the United States to Pakistani parents, met Malik online and became acquainted with her in Saudi Arabia. He brought her back to the U.S. in 2014. She entered with a Pakistani passport and a visa. The couple have a 6-month-old daughter, who was left with grandparents on the morning of the shootings. Although the suspects' motives were unknown, police quote some witnesses as saying Farook had attended the annual holiday party, left in a fit of anger and returned with Malik. Chris Nwadike, who worked with Farook as a restaurant inspector with the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health, said Wednesday's gathering was one of two ""general education"" meetings the department holds each year. The meeting was routine, in which employees receive  awards and other recognition. Nwadike said he was sitting at a table with Farook, who he knew from around the office. He said that at some point, more than 30 minutes before the shooting, he and his co-workers noticed Farook had left. . Nwadike said the meeting was on a 15-minute break when the shooting happened, and many participants were outside the room. Nwadike said he was in the bathroom. ""If everybody was there, it could have been a total massacre,"" he said. He said that he and the others in the bathroom laid down on the floor and remained there until police escorted them out of the building. ""I have not at any time noticed any sign that he would do anything like that,"" he said. ""I can't understand why."" . Farook's brother-in-law, Farhan Khan, said at news conference Wednesday night with the Council on American-Islamic Relations: ""On behalf of my family we all are shocked. We are completely shocked and had no idea."" Contributing: Mike James, John Bacon, Liz Szabo and Brad Heath in McLean, Va.; Brett Kelman and Anna Rumer, The (PalmSprings, Calif.)

Every Monday While media outlets and law enforcement have developed a routine response to mass shootings in the US, families and friends of the victims in San Bernardino are still battling their own confusion and grief. Loading... December 3, 2015 After the mass shooting at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, California, Wednesday that killed 14 and wounded 17 others, families and friends of the victims suffered an antagonizing wait before learning the fate of their loved ones. Sherry Esquerra desperately tried to reach her daughter after learning of an active shooter in the same social services office as where her daughter works for children with disabilities. “Nothing, I just get her message,” Ms. Esquerra tells the Associated Press. “Straight to voicemail.” So far in the year 2015, there have been more than 350 shootings in the US in which four or more people are harmed or killed, according to shootingtracker.com, a website that tallies gun violence in the US. And in what may be considered an insensitive yet also accurate opening, BBC began its coverage of the San Bernadino shootings Wednesday with the tagline: “Just another day in the United States of America, another day of gunfire, panic and fear.” And although the aftermath of mass shootings has become almost routine for the police and media, there was nothing normal about the attacks in San Bernardino Wednesday for the victims’ friends and family. Ryan Reyes described to NBC4 the shock and confusion he felt Wednesday afternoon when he learned his boyfriend, Daniel Kaufman, had been shot in the arm. “It’s all been a blur,” he said. “My sister texted me about somebody shooting up the Inland regional center – isn’t that where Daniel works? I immediately freaked out, tried to call him, text him.” Luis Gutierrez was on the phone with his wife when she saw a gunman with a rifle enter the building, and he heard the screaming in the background. “I just couldn’t drive,” he told the Los Angeles station. “I didn’t know what was going on. All I heard was, ‘there’s a shooter at work.’” Mr. Reyes and Mr. Gutierrez later learned their loved ones were safe, but the families of 14 other victims did not hear such relieving news. While many news anchors broke the news of Wednesday’s shootings with phrases such as “In what has become an increasingly commonplace scene,” and “In yet another mass tragedy,” President Obama reminded the American public that the frequency of these events is unprecedented and unnecessary. Speaking to CBS News moments after the news broke of the San Bernardino shootings, Mr. Obama said the frequency of US mass shootings “has no parallel anywhere else in the world.” He added, “We should never think that this is just something that just happens in the ordinary course of events because it doesn’t happen with the same frequency in other countries.” While Americans are sharply divided about just to address such incidents, there is a general sense that there is great risk of becoming resigned to the fact that such tragedies are an inevitable part of American life. As the Los Angeles Times’ Mary McNamara writes: “News outlets, including this one, flooded the area with a frightening efficiency born of repetition. Gone was the stutter-step of disbelief, the voice-choked sorrow, the barely concealed rage that marked coverage of Columbine, Virginia Tech, Newtown and Aurora. Gone was the first stage of denial or cautious diminishment, the hope that the harm done would not, could not, be as great as feared. In its place was the grim reality of a nation that knows better, a near mechanical acceptance of a now-familiar scenario.” This report contains material from the Associated Press.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/Hk1nwTH7vP0/,"The mass shooting in San Bernardino that killed 14 people and wounded 21 was unique for its male and female pair of attackers, something experts say has never occurred in the U.S. Police have named Syed Farook, 28, and his wife Tashfeen Malik, 27, as the two suspects involved in the shooting at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, Calif., which provides services to people with developmental disabilities. Both were killed by authorities Wednesday. “This is the first time I’ve seen anywhere in the world a public mass shooting attack with a man and a woman that was successful,” said Adam Lankford, a University of Alabama criminal justice professor who studies mass shootings. Dual attackers in a mass shooting are rare because one person can typically pull the more extreme of the two from turning violent, Lankford said. Mass shooters are also almost always men, with estimates showing that 98% of attackers are male. Men tend to be more violent, and studies have shown that a threat to a man’s societal status can trigger violent actions. Still, there have been a handful of mass shootings involving women, the most deadly occurring in 2006 when Jennifer San Marco killed seven people and committed suicide at a postal facility in Goleta, Calif. Profiles of past dual attackers can vary widely. In Columbine, experts largely identified Eric Harris as the likely instigator behind the attack who successfully convinced Dylan Klebold to take part. Similarly, John Allen Muhammad, 42, appeared to have acted as a father figure to Lee Boyd Malvo, 17, throughout the D.C. sniper shootings. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was sentenced to death for the Boston Marathon bombing, has been portrayed as a follower of his older brother Tamerlan by his defense attorneys, but reporting by the Boston Globe has portrayed him more as a co-equal. It’s still unclear whether the suspects in the San Bernardino attacks were equally responsible for the attacks or whether one pushed the other into acting. “The San Bernardino shooting is very unusual,” said Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor, citing the husband-wife duo and the fact that they also were parents of an infant. “This couple, with a well-paying job and a six-month-old baby, seemingly had a lot to live for, which is not what we usually see in mass shootings.” Contact us at letters@time.com."

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Mashable/~3/ygfhSUSi_Pg/,"We're going to force the Senate to vote today on amendments that do something to stop gun violence. Dear Republicans, let's close the NRA loophole that lets terror suspects buy Paris-style assault rifles in America. https://t.co/GNhPde3D6Z"
http://hotair.com/archives/2015/12/03/about-those-more-mass-shootings-than-days-narrative-for-2015/,"The Left and their media allies are pushing a new narrative regarding mass shootings. The Washington Post and Boston Globe had massive headlines yesterday claiming there have been 355 mass shootings in 336 days this year, while Vox included it as part of their “fancy stats” on gun violence. It’s enough to make people squeamish about ever owning a gun, let alone hanging out with a gun owner. The problem is the definition of “mass shooting.” All three websites are using the data supplied by crowd-sourcing website shootingtracker.com, which has a really broad definition of what a “mass shooting” actually is (emphasis mine). The old FBI definition of Mass Murder (not even the most recent one) is four or more people murdered in one event. It is only logical that a Mass Shooting is four or more people shot in one event. Here at the Mass Shooting Tracker, we count the number of people shot rather than the number people killed because, “shooting” means “people shot”… The only requirement is that four or more people are shot in a spree or setting, likely without a cooling off period. This may include the gunman himself (because they often suicide by cop or use a gun to kill themselves to escape punishment), or police shootings of civilians around the gunman. The reasoning behind the latter being that if the shooter is arrested, he will often be charged with injuring people the police actually shot, as that is a foreseeable result of a shooting spree. These statistics are being manipulated to fit a narrative. Not everyone would consider a gunman to be a “victim” of a mass shooting because he/she are the ones actually pulling the trigger. The definition of “mass” is even up for debate. Dictionary.com defines “mass” as “pertaining to, involving, or affecting a large number of people,” but even that’s a little deceptive. Some people consider a large number of people to be eight, while others consider it to be over a dozen. The FBI’s own study on mass shootings from 2014 is just as broad (emphasis mine). A total of 1,043 casualties occurred during the incidents included in this study (486 killed, 557 wounded). If a shooter died as a result of the incident, that individual was not included in the casualty totals. In addition, a small number of those identified as wounded were not injured by gunfire but rather suffered injuries incidental to the event, such as being hit by flying objects/shattered glass or falling while running. For the purposes of this study, the FBI did not seek to isolate the exact number of individuals that fell into this category, when research did not allow for that type of injury to be easily discerned. The median number of individuals killed in each incident was 2, and the median number of individuals wounded in each incident was 2. The FBI found that 64 incidents (40.0%) would have been categorized as falling within the new federal definition of “mass killing,” which is defined as “three or more killings in a single incident.” The Congressional Research Service has a completely different definition of what they consider a mass shooting. In order to delineate a workable understanding of public mass shooting for this report, CRS examined scholarly journal articles, monographs, and government reports.12 These sources discussed a variety of terms such as mass murder, mass shooting, mass killings, massacres, and multiple homicide. Definitions of these terms varied with regard to establishing the number of victims or fatalities involved, the weapons used, the motives of the perpetrator, and the timeframes within which the casualties or injuries occurred. This report defines public mass shootings as incidents occurring in relatively public places, involving four or more deaths—not including the shooter(s)—and gunmen who select victims somewhat indiscriminately. The violence in these cases is not a means to an end such as robbery or terrorism. It’s easy to sit here and point out how the Left’s “fancy stats” are total garbage. The fact is they’re still being used because of how emotional the mass shooting issue is. It’s horrific when the innocent are injured or killed. It tugs at the heartstrings and causes people to consider their own mortality or the mortality of their loved ones. When they hear headlines like, “more mass shootings than days,” it makes them recoil in terror, and consider the government as the only solution. The same goes for people when they see stories about poverty or the golden parachute some ousted corporate executive was able to grab. It’s easy to rush to judgment on a situation, and demand a solution which may or may not actually work. This is why the Right needs to message correctly and be extremely shrewd about it. It’s easy to throw cold, hard logic online or make some snarky comment on how “gun laws don’t stop anything.” But this isn’t exactly the wisest thing to do. It might be best to grab stories of how clerks or women used guns to ward off someone looking to cause them harm. It’s not always going to work, but it needs to be done to combat the “fancy stats” which aren’t worth the websites they’re posted on. Copyright ©2021 HotAir.com/Salem Media. All Rights Reserved."
http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/XdZu7TX_1gI/,"The impetus for the article was tragic, and unique to its time: the killing of Robert F. Kennedy, on June 6, 1968. But the opening paragraph, presented about two weeks after the assassination under a striking cover by artist Roy Lichtenstein, could have been written today. “Forget the democratic processes, the judicial system and the talent for organization that have long been the distinctive marks of the U.S. Forget, too, the affluence (vast, if still not general enough) and the fundamental respect for law by most Americans. Remember, instead, the Gun,” the story began. “That is how much of the world beyond its borders feels about the U.S. today. All too widely, the country is regarded as a blood-drenched, continent-wide shooting range where toddlers blast off with real rifles, housewives pack pearl-handled revolvers, and political assassins stalk their victims at will.” In fact, that same sentiment was expressed in the last 24 hours: as many observers have pointed out, the BBC’s report on the mass shooting in San Bernardino, which left at least 14 dead, described Wednesday as, “Just another day in the United States of America — another day of gunfire, panic and fear.” The similarities between eras don’t stop there. While one of today’s more popular proposals for reducing gun violence is the “smart gun” that is specially linked to its owner, the solutions of a half-century ago involved closely linking bullets to each gun. “Some authorities have suggested that every firearm sold be ‘fingerprinted’ in advance by test-firing to determine its ballistic pattern,” the 1968 article noted. “In the age of the computer, such distinctive patterns could be kept on file without too much difficulty.” Likewise, as many people have reacted to the San Bernardino events with calls for gun control and questions about why gun violence is such a problem in the U.S., many commentators 50 years ago responded to the RFK assassination with similar questions. As part of the 1968 cover story, TIME ran a page of political cartoons from around the globe expressing just that thought (roll over to zoom in): A page from the June 21, 1968, issue of TIME And finally, the feeling of inevitability and pessimism that accompanies some of today’s conversations about mass shootings is nothing new either. “Sir: If we think we‘re a violent nation now,” wrote reader Mrs. Norman L. Jacobson in response to the 1968 story, “just wait until our young children grow up.” Read the full story, here in the TIME Vault: The Gun Under Fire Write to Lily Rothman at lily.rothman@time.com."

The suspects, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, died in the shootout with police following the attack on Wednesday. Farook was reportedly a U.S. citizen born in Illinois to Pakistani immigrants, and Malik was born in Pakistan. They killed 14 people, and authorities on Thursday raised the number of wounded to 21, including 10 remain hospitalized. Farook and Malik had thousands of rounds of ammunition and numerous explosives with them or in their home, including 12 pipe bombs, authorities said. A motive remains unclear, and it is possible the shooting site — a center for people with disabilities — was not their sole target. CNN, citing unnamed law enforcement officials, reported Thursday that Farook was apparently radicalized and in touch with people under investigation for international terrorism.

http://www.ibtimes.com/who-nicholas-thalasinos-san-bernardino-shooting-victim-was-outspoken-messianic-jew-2210477,"Nicholas Thalasinos, 52, was among the 14 people killed in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, his wife told the New York Times on Thursday. In an phone interview, Jennifer Thalasinos told the paper that he was among the same ""little group"" of employees as Syed Farook, one of the suspected shooters in an attack that occurred at a social services center. ""He had worked with [Farook],” Thalasinos said. “He had talked about him. Nothing negative."" Thalasinos said that she and her husband were Messianic Jews, that he wore traditional Jewish tassels and that he was politically conservative. She said that her husband would not have known if Farook, who was described as a devout Muslim by family, had been radicalized. “My husband was very outspoken about ISIS and all of these radicalized Muslims,” she said to the Times. “If he would’ve thought that somebody in his office was like that, he would’ve said something.” Thalasinos had previously worked in New Jersey, where a former colleague called him ""a wonderful friend,"" according to Philly.com. At least 14 people were killed and 21 more were injured in the shooting on Wednesday. The suspected shooters, Farook, 28, and his wife 27-year-old Tashfeen Malik. Prior to the alleged attack, the couple left their 6-month-old daughter with Farook's mother, saying they had a doctor's appointment, according to the New York Times.  The shooting occurred during ""a Christmas gathering, holiday-type of luncheon,"" San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said on Thursday during a press conference. Farook worked at the county health department as an environmental health specialist and left the party reportedly in an angered state. He allegedly returned with his wife, armed with multiple weapons and dressed in tactical gear. The shooting suspects behind the shooting in San Bernardino on Wednesday fired up to 75 rounds and used an explosive device controlled by a remote control, Burguan said on Thursday during a press conference. ""They sprayed the room with bullets, so I don't know if there was one person they openly targeted,"" he said. Following a chase and an exchange of gunfire with authorities, both Farook and Malik were killed. Described to reporters as a devout Muslim by family, Farook was a U.S. citizen born in Illinois, while Malik was a Pakistani citizen in the country on a visa for fiancés, officials said. A motive for the attack has yet to be determined. Farook had recently traveled to Saudi Arabia to attend the annual Hajj pilgrimage. “It is possible that this was terrorist-related, but we don’t know,” U.S. President Barack Obama said in an address from the Oval Office on Thursday. “It’s also possible that this was workplace-related. Police were expected to name all 14 victims Thursday.      "
http://www.startribune.com/nation/360467241.html,"The data for this map was collected by ShootingTracker.com, a crowd-sourced project attempting to track mass shootings. They define a mass shooting as one in which four or more people were injured or killed by gunfire -- which includes domestic situations, shootings during crimes, etc. This is a broader than the definition used by the the federal government. Click a bubble for more information about that mass shooting. This, however, does not take population density into account. It stands to reason that with more people comes more mass shootings. For instance, there haven't been any mass shootings this year in North Dakota, Wyoming, New Hampshire, West Virginia or Hawaii, which are all relatively low-population states. So, we used the most recent state populations to find a per capita rate of incidents for each state and then multiplied by 10,000,000 to get them into somewhat whole numbers. That map is below.

http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2015/12/attackers_in_california_shooti.html,"California Shootings San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan takes a question at a press conference near the site of yesterday's mass shooting on Thursday, Dec. 3, 2015 in San Bernardino, Calif. A heavily armed husband and wife dressed for battle opened fire on a holiday banquet for his co-workers Wednesday, killing multiple people and seriously wounding others in a precision assault, authorities said. Hours later, they died in a shootout with police. (Chris Carlson, Associated Press) SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. -- The husband-and-wife attackers who slaughtered 14 people at an employee banquet fired as many as 75 rifle rounds in the assault, left behind three rigged-together pipe bombs with a remote-control device that apparently malfunctioned, and had over 1,600 more bullets with them when they were gunned down in their SUV, authorities said Thursday. At their home, they had 12 pipe bombs, tools for making more such explosives, and over 3,000 more rounds of ammunition, Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said in a grim morning-after inventory that suggested Wednesday's bloodbath could have been far worse. Wearing black tactical gear and wielding assault rifles, Syed Rizwan Farook, a 28-year-old county restaurant inspector, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, 27, opened fire at a social service center shortly after he slipped away from a banquet he was attending there. Four hours later and a few miles away, the couple were shot to death in their rented vehicle in a furious gunbattle with police. During the shootout, the couple fired 76 rounds, while law officers unleashed about 380, the police chief said. Twenty-one people were injured before the day was out, including two police officers, authorities said. Two of the wounded were listed in critical condition Thursday. It was the nation's deadliest mass shooting since the Newtown, Connecticut, school tragedy three years ago that left 26 children and adults dead. As the FBI took over the investigation, authorities were trying to learn why the couple left behind their 6-month-old daughter and went on the rampage in this Southern California city of 214,000. ""There was obviously a mission here. We know that. We do not know why. We don't know if this was the intended target or if there was something that triggered him to do this immediately,"" said David Bowdich, assistant director of the FBI's Los Angeles office. At the White House, President Barack Obama said after meeting with his national security team that it was ""possible this was terrorist-related"" but that authorities were unsure. He raised the possibility that it was a workplace dispute or that mixed motives were at play. Law enforcement experts said investigators may well conclude the killers had more than one motivation. Farook was born in the U.S. to a Pakistani family, was raised in Southern California and had been a San Bernardino County employee for five years, according to authorities and acquaintances. Authorities said Malik came to the U.S. on a Pakistani passport and a fiancee visa in July 2014. The stockpile of pipe bombs, tools and ammunition was found at a home in Redlands, about 7 miles from the massacre at the Inland Regional Center. Investigators said that Farook and his wife were listed on the rental agreement but that it wasn't known whether they lived there. Federal authorities said the two assault rifles and two handguns used in the massacre had been bought legally, but they did not say how the weapons got into the attackers' hands. The couple invaded the center about 60 miles east of Los Angeles around 11 a.m., opening fire in a conference area county health officials had rented for their banquet. Farook had attended the banquet, left and then returned. Co-worker Patrick Baccari said he was sitting at the same table as Farook before the young man suddenly disappeared, leaving his coat on his chair. Baccari said that when the shooting started, he took refuge in a bathroom and suffered minor wounds from shrapnel slicing through the wall. The shooting lasted about five minutes, he said, and when he looked in the mirror he realized he was bleeding. ""If I hadn't been in the bathroom, I'd probably be laying dead on the floor,"" he said. Baccari described Farook as reserved and said he showed no signs of unusual behavior. Earlier this year, he traveled to Saudi Arabia, was gone for about a month and returned with a wife, later growing a beard, Baccari said. The couple dropped off their daughter with relatives Wednesday morning, saying they had a doctor's appointment, Hussam Ayloush, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said after talking with family. ""We don't know the motives. Is it work, rage-related? Is it mental illness? Is it extreme ideology? At this point, it's really unknown to us, and at this point it's too soon to speculate,"" Ayloush said. Co-workers told the Los Angeles Times that Farook was a devout Muslim but didn't talk about religion at work. Farhan Khan, who is married to Farook's sister, told reporters that he last spoke to his brother-in-law about a week ago. Khan condemned the violence and said he had ""absolutely no idea"" why Farook would kill. Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.

Riteris was one of five women who opened the store in 1977. Photo By Staff photo by Jeff Rumage By Jeff Rumage Dec. 3, 2015 Whitefish Bay — One of Whitefish Bay's older shops will close its doors at the end of this holiday season. Mara Riteris was one of five women — all lawyers' wives — who opened Placesetters in the fall of 1977 at 501 E. Silver Spring Drive. Her four friends have either passed away or left the business, making Riteris the sole owner for the last 20 years. At 74 years old, she is ready to retire. The store will have clearance sales throughout the rest of the month until the store closes on Dec. 31. When Placesetters first opened, the store specialized in china and crystal tableware. Their place in the tableware market was shaken by the rise of chain department stores, which offered discounts that a small shop like Placesetters couldn't afford. Over time, the china tableware at Placesetters was replaced by a broader selection of gift items. Placesetters remained profitable due to its loyal customers, but Riteris said she is concerned about the future of other gift retailers. During a conversation on Cyber Monday, Riteris predicted in-store gift shopping will eventually be overtaken by online sales. ""I personally feel the art of selecting and giving a gift to someone in a way where you see it, touch it and feel it is not important for most people,"" she said. ""You go on the internet and click away."" Placesetters' inventory may have changed over the years, but other aspects of the business have remained the same for decades. Sales are written up without the convenience of a computer or a cash register. The store has been consistently decked out with festive holiday decorations. Most importantly, Riteris has three employees who have stayed with her for more than 25 years: Dreanna Nuss, Jackie Thompson and Evelyn Leisle. ""We've gone through weddings, through funerals, through grandchildren — you name it,"" Riteris said of her close-knit group of employees. Nuss said the group of ladies are practically family, and have helped each other overcome the loss of loved ones. Working in a bright, cheery environment with unique gifts also adds to her enthusiasm for the job. ""It's the greatest place to work because customers always come in the store in a good mood,"" Nuss said. ""And we carry the prettiest things. When I come into work in the morning, seeing all of this pretty stuff just puts me in a good mood."" Riteris' son Michael has been working at the store for the last four years. He thought about carrying the store into a second generation of ownership, but felt he didn't have his mother's knack for identifying industry trends. ""It's her eye (for unique merchandise) that makes the store special,"" Michael said. In honor of her 38 years in business, Riteris was named the grand marshall of the Whitefish Bay Holiday Stroll parade on Friday, Nov. 27. Her recent celebrity appearance is a fitting capstone to a career devoted to making Whitefish Bay as merry as possible during the holiday season. ""I've made some wonderful friends through the store,"" Riteris said. ""I've received so many phone calls, hugs and kisses. It's been very heartwarming for me.""

http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/sheriff-gun-owners-carry-your-firearms,"As yet another mass shooting has a gun control debate roiling the country, a sheriff in New York is urging gun owners to bring their firearms out with them. Sheriff Paul J. Van Blarcum of Ulster County — which is about two hours north of New York City — posted the message on the sheriff office’s Facebook and Twitter.  Blarcum confirmed the authenticity of the notice to TPM over the phone. “All I was trying to do is remind people that we’re partners with the public in safety and crime prevention,” he said. “So if you are legally licensed to carry a firearm and if you feel like you’re proficient enough in it, you’re responsible and you’re up on the laws in the state of the New York, we encourage you to carry a firearm.” Open carry is illegal in New York, but conceal carry is permitted with the proper licensing. Blacrum said he encourages people coming into his county to become licensed gun owners and that, “We have over 10,000 permits out there.” “If you look around the United States in the past bunch of years and around the world, whenever there’s these mass shootings, you never hear of anybody standing up and firing back,” Blacrum said. “I want people to be aware of that.” Planned Parenthood is leaving the federal government’s Title X program, which funds family planning services for low-income people, due to… Following the ousters of the Homeland Security secretary and Secret Service director, and the withdrawal of the would-be ICE director’s… Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on Monday called for ousted Secret Service Director Randolph “Tex” Alles to testify before…"

All the guns were purchased legally and registered, authorities said. Farook, a 28-year-old health inspector, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, 27, were shot and killed Wednesday during a dramatic gunbattle with San Bernardino police hours after their assault at the Inland Regional Center. On Thursday, police said the couple had amassed thousands of rounds of ammunition and more than a dozen pipe bombs ahead of the massacre. The handguns were purchased from gun dealers in San Diego and Corona within the past three years, said the federal official who is not authorized to comment publicly. Investigators were looking closely at the transactions involving the two assault-style rifles purchased by another person who was not immediately identified. The official said that buyer is the focus of an investigation into his relationship with the suspects. It was not immediately clear whether that person had been located and questioned, the official said. USA TODAY Delta announces new European routes from Detroit, Minneapolis USA TODAY Olivia Nalos Opre: Why we hunt, even lions The official said investigators also are examining materials seized from the suspects’ Redlands home, where authorities found an elaborate work space with hundreds of tools. Investigators also recovered remote control devices, smokeless powder, 2,000 rounds of 9mm ammunition and 2,500 rounds of .223-caliber ammunition. A .22 rifle also was found at the home. The suspects were killed in a shootout with police hours after the assault. In Washington, President Obama said Thursday that ""it is possible that this was terrorist related, but we just don't know."" He also said the nation should address the issue of access to firearms. ""It is going to be important for all of us, including our legislatures, to see what we can do to make sure that when individuals decide they want to do somebody harm, we are going to make it a little harder to do it,"" he said. ""Because right now, it is just too easy."" The National Law Enforcement Partnership to Prevent Gun Violence issued a statement urging gun law changes including limiting ammunition magazine capacity to 10 rounds, expanding background checks and other efforts. ""There is no excuse for a lack of action when it comes to lives lost to gun violence.  We’ve seen too much bloodshed.  Action is long overdue,"" the statement said.

http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Sundance-Film-Festival-reveals-drama-documentary-6673438.php,"LOS ANGELES — The dramatic contenders at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival span history, genre and setting, from the slave days in the South to the gay-sex scene today in Los Angeles’ Korean spas. What unites them, says festival director John Cooper, is excellent storytelling and a “thorough understanding of the craft of filmmaking, especially writing.” On Wednesday, Cooper and programming director Trevor Groth announced the slate of American and international dramas and documentaries in competition this year at the annual festival in Park City, Utah. “Independent film is evolving right now,” Cooper said. “There seems to be a real want and need for different kinds of stories.” Tales of a slave who helps his owner, for example, as in writer-director-actor Nate Parker’s “The Birth of a Nation”; or of a first-generation Korean American navigating traditional cultural expectations and his own emerging identity in “Spa Night.” Other selections include “Swiss Army Man,” starring Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe, about a hopeless loner who befriends a dead body; and “Tallulah,” starring Ellen Page and Allison Janney, about a young woman who steals a baby from a wealthy family. While most Sundance films won’t be seen outside the festival for many months, moviegoers everywhere should be excited about what these movies say about the state of cinema, Cooper said. The 117 feature-length films showing at the January festival were culled from more than 12,700 submissions. “It proves that there’s a choice out there, that there are other options for your entertainment,” he said. “The whole notion of discovery is big. ... It’s the beginning of a cultural year, and also the discovery of new talent: talent that go on to direct other films, and acting talent that go on to be in other films and really become what’s driving the film business forward.” Recent Sundance success stories include Colin Trevorrow’s hyper-charged career trajectory, from premiering his first feature at Sundance in 2012 to directing the summer smash “Jurassic World”; and “Fruitvale Station” director Ryan Coogler and actor Michael B. Jordan, who followed up their 2013 Sundance hit with this year’s “Creed.” Jennifer Lawrence also first broke out at Sundance five years ago with “Winter’s Bone,” which brought her first Oscar nod. The festival’s domestic documentary slate features stories of unsung heroes, such as ALS advocate and former NFL star Steve Gleason, and perspectives on gun violence and social media. Titles include “Newtown,” about the community’s recovery from the 2012 mass shooting at an elementary school, and “Audrie & Daisy,” about two teenage victims of online bullying. Cooper and Groth said there’s a sexy undercurrent to the international dramas: A group of college brainiacs try to lose their virginity in “Brahman Naman” from India; a mermaid falls in love with a man in Poland’s “The Lure”; a woman forms a relationship with a wolf in Germany’s “Wild”; and “Male Joy, Female Love” from China is described as a portrayal of “an unlimited cycle of love stories.” The Sundance Film Festival runs from Jan. 21 to 31."

http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/03/mental-illness-an-easy-scapegoat-for-those-who-wont-point-fingers-elsewhere,"Research does not show a strong connection between violence and mental illness, but it’s often blamed for mass shootings anyway Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.19 BST The reasons that Syed Farook, a San Bernardino County health department employee, and Tashfeen Malik, his wife, killed 14 people and injured 21 in an attack on the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, California, on Wednesday haven’t yet been confirmed. The FBI is still trying to determine whether the attack was driven by politics, a workplace altercation or a combination of both.  But that hasn’t stopped some politicians, who despite all evidence to the contrary have been quick to ascribe to the San Bernardino – and many other shootings – a ready culprit: people with psychiatric disabilities. On Thursday morning, the newly anointed Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, took to CBS News to announce his intent to respond to the San Bernardino attack and similar shootings by moving forward with legislation from congressman Tim Murphy, a Republican from Pennsylvania, that restricts the rights of Americans with psychiatric disabilities. Murphy’s bill, the perversely named Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act of 2015, would limit the federal privacy rights of people with mental illness to decide whether or not their family members will know about their care. The bill would also place new restrictions on the ability of federally funded legal aid programs for people with disabilities to protect and advocate for their clients with mental illness. Bizarrely, it restricts federal mental health funds to states unless they authorize coercive assisted outpatient treatment programs, which could force individuals to receive care they do not consent to. Congressman Murphy has made a point of exploiting each mass shooting to call for restricting the rights of people with disabilities, blaming the mentally ill for this violence despite a clear research literature debunking such links. This trend has continued even after shootings, like last week’s attack on Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs or Elliot Rodgers’s 2014 shooting spree at the University of California Santa Barbara, that had a clear political motive. Having spoken at length with Murphy, I know that he is sincere in his passion restrict the privacy and due process rights of Americans with psychiatric disabilities. He genuinely and misguidedly believes that the path to improve mental health policy in America is through more coercion and force. Like any politician, he is making use of whatever political window he can to attempt to advance it. But many of his allies seem to be making use of mental health as a dodge to avoid having to face down the gun lobby on the difficult question of how to appropriately regulate firearms. Mental illness often makes a convenient scapegoat for politicians that can’t point their fingers elsewhere. After all, people with disabilities have nowhere near the advanced lobbying and political operation of the National Rifle Association, which has made it adamantly clear that they have no intention of allowing any restrictions on firearm ownership in response to these horrifying incidents. While Speaker Ryan’s purported concern over the mental health of Americans is touching, it becomes somewhat disingenuous when one takes note of his proposals to drastically slash Medicaid funding – the single largest financing stream for mental health services in the United States. The Senate sponsor of the Murphy legislation, Senator Bill Cassidy, is also on record proposing significant cuts to Medicaid expenditures. Both stances call into question the degree to which improving America’s mental health services infrastructure is truly a priority. Politicians who propose Medicaid cuts while arguing that the Murphy legislation is the solution to our gun violence problem seem to believe that the problem with mental health in America today is a lack of coercion, not a lack of funding. Their proposed policy recommendations suggest that they believe that we can cut funding and improve services, simply by depriving Americans with psychiatric disabilities of their right to decide how they receive care and who gets to know about it. This is an astonishing assessment; the only benefit of proposing such policies is the ability of politicians to be seen taking action without angering the powerful firearms lobby. What makes the calls for mandated coercive treatment all the more galling is that the research does not show a strong connection between violence and mental illness. After controlling for substance abuse problems (which do legitimately seem to correlate with violent crime), mental health has almost no relationship with violent criminal activity. Americans with disabilities are far more vulnerable to violence than those without, including violence that comes from those charged with supporting them. Because of negative experiences in the current care system, many people with mental illness make an informed choice to select options other than institutional care or similarly coercive approaches to treat their mental health needs. The Murphy legislation would deprive them of that choice, despite zero evidence that it would help solve America’s gun violence problem. Arguing against restricting the gun ownership of those placed on terrorism watch lists, Speaker Ryan said on Thursday, “We have to make sure, in our rush to do something, we don’t violate people’s rights in this country.” Such sentiments are admirable; the rights of Americans with psychiatric disabilities should be getting the same consideration."

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/126352335/0/phoenix/nation~Term-mass-shooting-confuses-public-and-masks-phenomenon/,"Depending on how you're counting, the shooting deaths of 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif. Wednesday was the 22nd mass shooting this year, or one of more than 300 in a near-daily epidemic. Big difference. But the problem is one of definitions, sometimes used sloppily and interchangeably. The result: a very confused, and possibly hyperventilating public. There is no official definition of a mass shooting. The closest is by the Congressional Research Service, which says it is four or more people killed with a firearm, not including the killer. That's pretty similar to the FBI's definition of a mass killing, about 75% of which are committed with a firearm, according to USA TODAY research. (Other weapons include knives, a baseball bat, even one case where a father threw his children off a bridge). So far this year, there have been 29 mass killings, resulting in 155 deaths. Of those, 22 incidents were shootings. But several other sources use alternate definitions, regardless of whether anyone dies. For example, two widely used sources on mass shootings include Stanford Mass Shootings, and Mass Shooting Tracker, The first defines a mass shooting as three or more people shot,but not necessarily fatally; the killer(s) is not counted. The second defines it as four or more people shot, not necessarily fatally. It may include the killer(s). Researchers say headlines that suggest a 'mass shooting' occurs daily, on average, are misleading. In the eyes of the public, that translates into a San Bernardino-style shooting nearly every day. ""That definition of four or more shot, rarely translates to four or more killed. One-third of these 'mass shootings' result in no fatalities, and only 5% are mass killings,"" says James Alan Fox, Lipman Family Professor of Criminology, Law & Public Policy at Northeastern University. ""However, this scary one-a-day statistic is rolled out whenever there is a large-scale mass killing, allowing unsophisticated readers to make the wrong connection."" Fox also points out that the one-a-day statistic is devoid of any benchmark. Since most counting of public shootings occurred after Sandy Hook almost exactly three years ago, it's difficult to make comparisons. ""Without historical context, we get hysterical response."" says Fox. ""If it were possible (and it really isn’t) to go back to 2005 and count number of shootings with 4+ injured, I’m sure it would be on par with today’s figures."" Fox says the central problem is that the idea of a 'mass shooting' conflates how the crime occurred, with how many victims. And they are really separate hallmarks. It also makes it really hard to understand which way such incidents are trending. Mass killings -- by firearm or other means -- have not increased since 2006; they are consistently about two dozen a year. But there is some indication that incidents of 'active shooters' may be increasing. According to an FBI report released last year, there were 160 'active shooter' events between 2000 and 2013. An average of 6.4 incidents occurred in the first 7 years studied, and an average of 16.4 occurred in the last 7 years. But critics say early years are under counted, which likely explains the increase. Anyone waving a gun in a public place is threatening, and should be counted to understand such episodes of violence. But the FBI is far more likely to call such incidents an 'active shooter' because it makes no distinction between whether deaths have occurred, and conveys the idea that it's an ongoing situation. USATODAY.COM BEHIND THE BLOODSHED: THE UNTOLD STORY OF AMERICA'S MASS KILLINGS That's precisely why the Congressional Research Service report called for better data collection among government agencies. Currently, the FBI collects data on all homicides in the U.S., though -- because of the way individual police agencies report incidents -- nearly half of the mass killing cases included in the Supplemental Homicide Report are incorrect. The report includes cases that never occurred, and leaves out cases that did, according to USA TODAY research. Clarifying the definition and improving reporting -- whether it's mass killing, mass shooting or active shooter, is critical to understanding and responding to the phenomenon, the CRS report noted. ""Mass shootings are arguably one of the worst manifestations of gun violence,"" the report notes. And everyone has a different definition ""contributing to a welter of claims and counter-claims about the prevalence and deadliness of mass shootings. With improved data, policymakers would arguably have additional vantage points from which to assess the legislative proposals that are inevitably made in the wake of these tragedies."""

Five shooting victims remained Thursday at Loma Linda University Medical Center, hospital CEO Kerry Heinrich said.He said two of the victims were in serious condition and three were ""fair."" As of Thursday morning, Arrowhead Regional Memorial Hospital in Colton, Calif., was caring for  five patients from the shooting, all stable, San Bernardino County spokeswoman Felisa Cardona said. One victim was admitted at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Fontana and is in stable condition, hospital officials said. And at the Community Hospital of San Bernardino, officials said Thursday morning that two patients admitted from the shooting had been discharged. Here are some of their stories: Kevin OrtizOn Thursday morning, Rosa Ortiz paced outside Arrowhead Regional Memorial Hospital in Colton, Calif., hands stuffed inside the pockets of her gray Winnie-the-Pooh hoodie. She had not slept since arriving at her nephew's side the night before. Kevin Ortiz, 24, an environmentalist for San Bernardino County, had been one of the 21 wounded in Wednesday's mass shooting in southern California in which 14 people died. ""I stayed by his side all night,"" his aunt said. USA TODAY Olivia Nalos Opre: Why we hunt, even lions Ortiz said her nephew had recounted to his family what he could remember from the event at the Inland Regional Center, a social services center for the developmentally disabled that was the site of Wednesday's rampage. He had heard the shots first but thought it was a drill, she said. ""He was sitting at his table when the doors flung open and he saw two people dressed in black,"" she said. A sharp pain pierced one of his legs. Only a few seconds later would he realize it was from a gunshot. Kevin scrambled under the table but was shot again. He telephoned his wife of two weeks and his father to tell them he was hurt but OK, his wife told the Los Angeles Times. ""Kevin said he had been shot three times and that he was in pain but he was all right,"" Dyana Ortiz, 23, told the Times. ""Then he said 'I love you' and I said 'I love you.'"" Ortiz's brother, David, told the Times he was not surprised he had found the ability to make these crucial phone calls. ""That's Kevin, he's a fighter,"" he said. Rosa Ortiz said Thursday that her nephew was ""in a lot of pain"" but remained alert and in stable condition after undergoing surgery Wednesday for five gunshot wounds, Ortiz said. ""He's asking about his co-workers,"" Rosa Ortiz said. ""That's just his personality."" USA TODAY Delta announces new European routes from Detroit, Minneapolis The family had been trying to shield Kevin from news reports that detailed just how tragic the shooting had been. ""We're one of the lucky families and unfortunately the other 14 families don't have this story to share,"" Ortiz said, her voice cracking. ""It really breaks our heart that this is happening to — to all of us."" Rosa Ortiz said violence of this scale had never affected their family or community. ""Shocked,"" she said. ""I think that's the word."" USATODAY.COM BEHIND THE BLOODSHED: THE UNTOLD STORY OF AMERICA'S MASS KILLINGS Denise Peraza Another of the injured, Denise Peraza, 27, called her family from Arrowhead hospital, according to local TV station KABC. ""She said 'I just want to tell you that I love you' and then she said she had to go and she hung up,"" said Stephanie Baldwin, Peraza's sister. According to KABC, she is expected to recover from her injuries, which included a bullet in her lower back. ""As soon as the gunfire started, everyone dropped to the floor and they were underneath desks, and she was trying to shield herself with a chair, along with a man next to her,"" Baldwin told the station. ""Then, all of a sudden, she said she just felt it going through her back."" USA TODAY Olivia Nalos Opre: Why we hunt, even lions Peraza, who worked with gunman Syed Rizwan Farook, told her family the shooters dressed in black and wore black masks, according to the station. She said the shooters did not speak as they fired at people in the conference room where most of the carnage occurred. Jennifer StevensAnother young person injured, according to local media, was 22-year-old Jennifer Stevens, a native of Redondo Beach, a community about 50 miles west of San Bernardino. Redondo Beach resident Wright Adaza told the local Daily Breeze newspaper that he spoke to Stevens' mother, Lisa Growden Stevens, as she drove to Arrowhead to see her daughter, who suffered a gunshot wound to her abdomen and required surgery. She was in stable condition, Adaza told the paper. USA TODAY Delta announces new European routes from Detroit, Minneapolis Stevens' mother received a telephone message from her daughter about two minutes after the shooting, Adaza said. ""It said, 'Mom, I'm at work. I've been shot,'"" Adaza said. ""She texted her sister and told her she'd been shot and that was all they knew for a while."" According to her LinkedIn page, Stevens also worked with Farook. The local Beach Reporter newspaper said that Stevens played soccer at the University of California-Riverside, from which she graduated in June. According to the paper, Redondo Beach Mayor Steve Aspel posted on Facebook that she was in recovery. ""Just a great kid and one heck of an athlete! She will win this one,"" he said.

http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/breakingnews/~3/cqTKw1z1-w0/ct-gun-makers-stocks-jump-20151203-story.html,"Shares of some gun-makers appear to have spiked shortly after news of a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. CNBC's Carl Quintanilla points out that Smith & Wesson's stock jumped roughly 1 percent in the minutes after word of the shooting got out, at around 2 p.m. Eastern. (It's now trading at half a percent below its opening price.) Meanwhile, shares of Ruger also jumped 1 percent and continued rising through the end of the day. It's hard to say anything definitive about why the stock prices went up or down. There are only a handful of publicly traded gun companies -- one of the few others, Olin Corp., ended the day down 1.4 percent. Mass shootings have had a predictable effect on gun sales. They almost always go up, whether you're talking about Aurora, Columbine or Virginia Tech. And some may attempt to argue that the recent shootings in Colorado near a Planned Parenthood may lead to similar results -- though it's clear that Black Friday is correlated with higher gun sales relative to the rest of the year, anyway.

http://www.tampabay.com/news/localgovernment/sickened-by-mass-shootings-tampa-council-explores-using-city-buying-power/2256398,"TAMPA — Heartsick over this week's mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., the Tampa City Council on Thursday looked for a way to help create a less ""out of control"" gun culture in the United States. ""Assault weapons are intended to maim and kill,"" council member Yvonne Yolie Capin said. ""We don't want this to be our new normal."" Under Florida law, cities are banned from passing any local gun regulations — a prohibition Mayor Bob Buckhorn complained about when he could not keep guns out of the safe zone around the 2012 Republican National Convention. Still, council members did vote to explore taking part in a national initiative called ""Do Not Stand Idly By."" The effort was created by a network of citizens' and religious groups and takes its name from a verse in the Old Testament book of Leviticus: ""Do not stand idly by while your neighbor's blood is shed."" The group is trying to enlist the help of public agencies that buy an estimated 40 percent of the guns purchased in the United States (25 percent by the military and 15 percent by law enforcement). The goal is to use that public purchasing power to encourage gun manufacturers to: • Sell guns only through certified dealers who cooperate with law enforcement, keep thorough records, secure their inventory, train employees to detect ""straw buyers"" looking to resell guns illegally and offer safety and gun-storage training to customers. • Use requests from law enforcement agencies seeking to trace guns used in crimes to help identify trafficking patterns and put pressure on ""bad actor"" retailers. • Develop ""smart guns"" that use owner-recognition technology to limit their use to authorized users, to bring guns to market with bullet micro-stamping capabilities that help law enforcement and make guns less useful to criminals and to work on new safety features to minimize accidental shootings. • Refrain from selling large-capacity magazines and marketing guns based on their lethality. So far, the approach has been endorsed by the U.S. Conference of Mayors and adopted by state or local governments in California, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York and Ohio. Tampa council members asked for a Jan. 21 report from city attorneys and police about the possibility of taking part in the effort. ""I hope that between now and Jan. 21 we will not see another one of these incidents,"" said council member Harry Cohen, who made the proposal. But he was ""sickened"" to say that is probably too much to expect. Council endorses new traffic safety model Pedestrians and drivers are going to make mistakes, but they should not have to die for them. That's the thinking behind a model of transportation planning the council embraced in a separate vote on Thursday. Council member Lisa Montelione proposed that the city adopt what's known as a ""Vision Zero"" model for transportation planning. The council voted to ask Buckhorn's administration to consolidate its existing efforts into a Vision Zero approach. Started in Sweden and adopted in U.S. cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Boston and Seattle, Vision Zero is an approach that puts preventing traffic fatalities as the No. 1 priority in transportation planning. In any situation where a person might fail, its founders say, the road system should not. Locally, the approach has been embraced by a new nonprofit, Walk Bike Tampa, which was formed this fall by Hannah Strom and transportation engineer Jackie Toledo. Supporters say a Vision Zero approach to a road like Busch Boulevard, where a Chamberlain High School student on foot was killed in traffic in October, could include steps like lowering the speed limit, adding high-visibility crosswalks, putting in medians and banning left turns near the high school. In other countries (Germany, France, Spain), states (Minnesota, Utah) and cities (San Jose, among others) where it has been adopted, Vision Zero has led to double-digit reductions in the number of traffic deaths and larger reductions than jurisdictions that have not adopted the model. ""We've changed our culture over time with different things and that's what Vision Zero is all about,"" retired Federal Highway Administration chief highway safety engineer Rudolph Umbs told the council. ""It's a long-term process, but it's doable."" In other business, the council: • Named seven applicants it plans to interview on Dec. 17 for four seats on Tampa's new Citizens Review Board for police. They are Rasheed Ali Aquil, Donna Stark, Shirley Pettaway-Green, Irene Guy, Anneliese Meier, Nestor Ortiz and Mary Dahmer. Buckhorn already has named five board members and two alternates for the panel, which is expected to begin meeting next year. • Repealed Tampa's long-dormant juvenile curfew. The curfew was enacted in 1994, but has not been enforced since the Florida Supreme Court ruled it was unconstitutional in 2004. Police say the repeal will not affect their work. Still on the books is Tampa's ""Ybor City Child Protection Ordinance,"" which requires anyone under 18 to leave the Ybor City entertainment district after 11 p.m. on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. • Gave final approval for the development of 400 apartments or condominiums and a riverfront restaurant on the current site of the Tampa Tribune, Related Development LLC of Miami plans to build an eight-story building on the Tribune property at 202 S Parker St., just north of the W Brorein Street bridge. The project includes a five-story parking garage with 800 spaces. Economic Development Reporter"

http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Shooters-arsenal-for-mission-6673295.php,"SAN BERNARDINO — The husband and wife who killed 14 people and wounded 21 at an office holiday party in Southern California’s Inland Empire were on a “mission,” renting a sport utility vehicle and stockpiling weaponry at their nearby home including four guns, thousands of rounds of ammunition and homemade bombs, authorities said Thursday. But as investigators pieced together Wednesday’s massacre in San Bernardino and made grim notifications to the families of victims, they said they had not yet learned what drove Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, to don tactical vests, drop off their baby with a relative, and slaughter Farook’s co-workers before being killed, hours later, in a firefight with police. President Obama, speaking Thursday morning at the White House, said the FBI was taking the lead on the investigation and was committed to getting “to the bottom of this.” But he added it could take time. “At this stage, we do not yet know why this terrible event occurred,” Obama said. “It is possible that this was terrorist-related, but we don’t know. It’s also possible that this was workplace-related.” FBI officials said they were looking into a potential dispute between Farook and one or more co-workers just before the shooting, while also exploring his travels to Pakistan. That’s where Malik, 27, lived before she moved to the U.S. a year and a half ago to marry Farook, 28, and give birth to their daughter, now 6 months old. Contact with extremists Farook, a U.S. citizen who worked as a health inspector for San Bernardino County, had been in contact with Islamist extremists in the United States and abroad in the past, the New York Times reported, citing anonymous law enforcement officials. But the extent and content of those communications — and whether they were related to the attack — were unclear. An online dating site that Farook apparently used before meeting Malik described him as a Muslim from a “religious but modern family.” Family members said they were not aware of any extreme views and were shocked by what happened. As the investigation ramped up, Gov. Jerry Brown postponed his long-planned trip to the climate change summit in Paris and headed to San Bernardino for a briefing. Upon arrival, he said officials would spare no resources in pursuing those who “engage in these kinds of vicious, brutal acts.” The sheer scope of the nation’s deadliest killing spree since the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre in Connecticut came into focus Thursday. Police said Farook and Malik walked through the unlocked door of a conference room at the Inland Regional Center about 11 a.m. The county Public Health Department had rented the space for a training and Christmas banquet. Up to 80 people were inside. Farook, who had worked for the health department for five years, had been at the gathering earlier before leaving, according to investigators, who are looking into whether he had left angry after a dispute. The couple were armed, authorities said, with two 9mm semiautomatic pistols as well as two rifles that resemble the AR-15, the popular semiautomatic version of the military M-16: a .223-caliber A-15 made by DPMS Panther Arms and a Smith & Wesson M&P15. He and his wife fired between 65 and 75 rounds, shooting so wildly that they set off fire sprinklers and flooded the building, authorities said. “They sprayed the room with bullets,” said San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan. “I don’t know that there was any one person they targeted.” Bombs linked together The first police officer to respond, Lt. Mike Madden, recalled a horrifying scene. Bodies were on the ground both inside and outside the building. Victims were wailing. The air smelled of gunpowder. “It was unspeakable the carnage we were seeing,” he said. The veteran cop said he and his colleagues had been trained to deal with the “sensory overload” inherent in a mass shooting. “It was all of that and more,” he said. “To be honest, it was a little surreal.” Three pipe bombs that were linked together — and to the apparatus of a remote-controlled car — were later found at the site, having failed to detonate. Police also recovered four high-capacity magazines for rifle rounds. The couple apparently had left their infant daughter with Farook’s mother in neighboring Redlands under the pretext that they had a doctor’s appointment, the Los Angeles Times reported. “We do not yet know the motive. We cannot rule out anything at this point,” said David Bowdich, the FBI’s assistant director in Los Angeles. “There was obviously a mission here. We don’t know why.” Array of weapons at home At the couple’s rented home in Redlands, authorities said they later found 12 “pipe-bomb devices” and hundreds of tools for producing explosives. Also in the house and garage, Burguan said, were 2,000 pistol rounds and more than 2,500 rifle rounds. “There appears to be a degree of planning that went into this,” Burguan said. “Clearly they were equipped, and they could have continued on. ... We intercepted them before they could do that.” Hours after the shooting spree, the couple were spotted driving a black Ford Expedition near their Redlands house before leading police on a chase back to San Bernardino. The SUV, Burguan said, was rented a few days ago and had been due back to the leasing agency Wednesday. Farook, who was driving, refused to pull over, and Malik fired at police out the back window, authorities said. Twenty-three officers from seven law enforcement agencies unloaded 380 rounds at the couple, Burguan said. Malik and Farook — who at one point stopped the SUV and stepped out — fired 76 rifle rounds back at the officers before they were killed, he said. Inside the SUV, police said, were an additional 1,400 rifle rounds and 200 pistol rounds. Johnny Randall, 62, who lives near San Bernardino Avenue where the shootout ended, described a terrifying firefight. “I don’t run because I have a busted knee, but when I heard the shooting, I ran!” he said. “It was so massive, man. I knew there was a gunbattle going on. I started praying for everyone around here.” Two deputies were hurt in the confrontation but are recovering, Burguan said. One was shot in the left leg, and the other may have been cut by shrapnel or broken glass, officials said. Neither of the killers appears to have a criminal record, nor had they come to the attention of law enforcement. Farook’s only brush with the California court system was a pair of traffic tickets, records show. “He was not on the radar screen of our agency prior to yesterday,” Burguan said. Bowdich, the FBI director, said Farook had traveled to Pakistan to meet his wife and that they had returned in July 2014. Malik arrived on a visa given to people planning to get married to a U.S. citizen. Last year, a person named Syed Rizwan Farook enrolled in an online graduate program in environmental engineering at Cal State Fullerton and attended for one semester, school officials said. He and his wife appear to have registered at Target for baby gifts, asking for a car seat and diapers. While little is known about the couple, records suggest trouble in Farook’s childhood home. His parents filed for divorce in 2006, with his mother, Rafia, alleging domestic violence and seeking custody of the couple’s children, according to Riverside County Superior Court court documents. She petitioned for restraining orders against her husband. On Thursday, the San Bernardino County sheriff’s office released the names of the 14 victims in the rampage,12 of whom were county employees. The eight men and six women ranged in age from 26 to 60. Among them were an Iranian-born woman who fled to the United States after the Iranian Revolution, a man whose wife said he was outspoken about his loathing of terrorists, and the cousin of New York Giants safety Nat Berhe. The uncle of Yvette Velasco, 27, of Fontana, a county health worker, told The Chronicle his family is still processing “the nightmare.” “Yvette was an intelligent, motivated and beautiful young woman who was full of life and loved by all who knew her. We are devastated about what happened,” George Velasco wrote in an e-mail. “Please pray for our family and the other families who have lost a loved one as a result of this terrible tragedy.” Guns investigated All of the firearms used Wednesday by Farook and Malik were legally purchased, authorities said. The two handguns were bought by Farook, and the two rifles were bought by another person whom authorities have not identified. California’s assault weapons ban, the Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989, bans many models of semiautomatic rifles as well as rifles with certain characteristics or modifications. Asked if the guns that the couple used in the massacre were legal in California, Burguan said, “We have not gotten to the bottom of that.” As for the thousands of rounds, he said, “I don’t think we have restrictions on the volume of ammunition.” Evan Sernoffsky and Kurtis Alexander are San Francisco Chronicle staff writers.

The question, which divides experts, is whether such shootings are on the rise or whether the public is more acutely aware of them. Loading... December 3, 2015 Responding to the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., on Wednesday – the deadliest since the Newtown, Conn., school massacre three years ago – President Obama warned Americans that ""we should never think that this is something that just happens in the ordinary course of events."" Unfortunately, the 355th
 shooting that involved four or more victims this year suggested that already may be the case: In 2015, such occurrences have averaged more than one a day. In fact, the San Bernardino attack was Wednesday's second mass shooting – the first was in Savannah, Georgia. The immediate aftermath of the attack, which killed 14 people and injured 21, took on a familiar script, from the political rhetoric of the gun control debate to what some called empty calls for “thoughts and prayers.” Those reactions have become familiar during a span of two years in America when not a calendar week has gone by without an act of mass gun violence. “We’ve reached a critical saturation point with these mass shootings, and that’s part of the numbness and confusion we feel,” says Ron Astor, a University of Southern California professor of social work who has studied mass violence for more than 30 years. “But it’s not like we’ve accepted [the level of violence]. The problem is, we haven’t figured out what to do with that moral outrage that we all have.” Overall gun violence has declined, along with violent crime, over the past two decades. But the frequency with which mass shootings have been reported this year have led to perceptions that this one, particularly shocking, type of violence may be experiencing a surge. The question, which divides experts, is whether such shootings are, in fact, running above historical norms, or whether the public is simply more acutely aware of them, given the rise of social media and the 24-hour digital news cycle. “The only increase has been in fear, and in the perception of an increase,” says James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, told The New York Times. A lack of a common definition of what encompasses a mass incident complicates the ability of criminologists to reach a consensus on how much of an increase 2015’s tally represents – or what the historical average for mass shootings has been. The FBI, in a report last year, counted 160 “active shooter” situations between 2000 and 2013, including the Sandy Hook school shooting in Connecticut; the Aurora, Colo., theater shooting; and the massacre at Fort Hood in Texas. Its findings suggested a steady increase in frequency, with a peak in 2010 of 26. Research by Harvard University suggests that the frequency of mass shootings has increased threefold since 2011, based on a survey of news reports by the liberal-leaning Mother Jones magazine. That research looked at incidents in which the victims and shooter were strangers, and where the shooter killed four or more people. The Harvard researchers found that such shootings had occurred an average of every 200 days from 1982 to 2011. Since then, they've happened once every 64 days, on average. But Professor Fox, co-author of “Extreme Killing,” slices the data differently. He says that by including situations where the shooter knows the victims – such as domestic or gang violence – the rate of annual mass shootings actually declined slightly from 2011 to 2014 when compared with the previous four years. (Addressing critiques that his method is flawed, Fox told Huffington Post that to those slain “it hardly matters whether they were killed in public or in a private home.”) Two online databases that use news reports to track shootings where four or more are wounded or killed found that there have been 355 such shootings since January, spanning 221 cities and 47 states. That’s up from 337 mass shootings in 2014, according to one, shootingtracker.com. Those databases, which also include incidences of domestic and gang violence, were created in 2013 and differ from the FBI’s old definition of mass murder, which exclusively counted fatalities, making it difficult to compare historical trends. Where criminologists do agree is that, similar to the awareness of killings of unarmed citizens by police that spiked after Michael Brown’s death in Ferguson, Mo., the public’s attention to such events has been heightened and led to a desire to take action – although there is no consensus on either side of the political aisle what such action should be. “The extent that fear and anxiety increases, that may make it harder for us to come to some sort of resolution, because people feel a greater need to protect themselves, be armed or take defensive action or blame certain people and contain those people,” says Frankie Bailey, a criminologist at the State University of New York in Albany. “And at the same time, we’re dealing with competing perceptions of causation of what’s happening. And until we can agree on that, even though there’s a broader moral imperative to stop it, it’s difficult to find common ground for deciding how to deal with it.” But in fact, says Mr. Astor, US cultural norms have shifted in other ways, specifically around the acceptance of violence. After all, he says, in just the past century, the US has eliminated lynching, reduced the number of police killed on the job, and dramatically decreased domestic violence. And while media coverage has increased awareness, he argues that it hasn’t resulted in public apathy. “Media coverage has, ironically, raised our intolerance for these kinds of events,” says Astor. “We already know through social science and religion that the way to get people to respond differently is to go against our instincts, to not only talk about [the perpetrator] and their motives, but to spend an inordinate amount of time on the totality of each of the victims and who they were. We move more to action if we actually feel more closely each of the individual lives that were lost.” While the polarization surrounding the gun control debate has made political solutions difficult to attain, others also argue there are areas where progress can be made. “There’s a sense of helplessness, but it’s in some ways misplaced,” says Jonathan Metzl, director of the Center for Medicine, Health and Society at Vanderbilt University, in Nashville, Tenn. “The fact is, we are going to have a very hard time, given our gun culture, stopping mass shootings. But that doesn’t mean that we can’t stem the tide of gun violence, because everyday gun violence is incredibly preventable.” Correction: This article has been updated to change Ron Astor's title.

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s hard for the world to figure out. We’re run by a church, but we’re not only for church members and we’re not about converting people. We’re known as being fair even as the world becomes as polarized as at any time since the newspaper’s founding in 1908. We have a mission beyond circulation, we want to bridge divides.

http://www.ibtimes.com/syed-farook-terrorist-ring-feds-seek-three-associates-who-were-contact-san-bernardino-2210747,"Federal investigators Thursday sought three men who had been in touch with the suspected attackers in the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, that killed 14 people and injured at least 21 others, the Los Angeles Times reported. A government official told the paper investigators wanted to interview the three men who “were in phone contact,” with suspected shooters Syed Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik in the days leading up to the shooting rampage. ""They were associates and in contact with the shooters,” the official told the newspaper. The government official reportedly requested anonymity because the situation was delicate. The identity of the men or if they had any involvement in the shooting was not yet clear. Farook, 28, and Malik, 27, were both killed in a gunfight with police following a chase after the mass shooting. Federal officials said Thursday they had not ruled out terrorism as a motive. The shooting occurred Wednesday during ""a Christmas gathering, holiday-type of luncheon,"" San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said during a press conference. Farook worked at the county health department and reportedly exited the party at a social services center angrily, then allegedly returned with his wife, armed with multiple weapons.  Farhan Khan, brother-in-law of suspect: &quot;I have no idea why he would do...something like this. I am in shock myself&quot; pic.twitter.com/e2pm5jjWBK   The suspects behind the shooting fired up to 75 rounds Wednesday and used an explosive device controlled by a remote control, Burguan said. ""They sprayed the room with bullets, so I don't know if there was one person they openly targeted,"" he said. The motive behind the shooting is still unknown. “It is possible that this was terrorist-related, but we don’t know,” U.S. President Barack Obama said Thursday in an address from the Oval Office. “It’s also possible that this was workplace-related."" Farook, a U.S. citizen who was born in Illinois had been described by family as a devout Muslim. His wife Malik was a Pakistani citizen in the country on a visa for fiancées. Farook's family denounced his actions, Newsday reported.  Several of Farook&#39;s family has been interviewed and cooperating with police. Denounced attacks last night.   U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said he felt authorities would ""get to the bottom"" of the situation during a press conference that was called to discuss his decision to open all combat positions to women. “The protection of our people, including our service people, and concern about radicalization, including of American citizens living in America ... is an enormous concern,"" Carter said, offering his condolences to the victims' families. Authorities were expected to name all 14 victims Thursday.

X OUR PICKS: My eyebrows shot up like little drones when someone on TV on Thursday mentioned that we are living in a “new normal.” 
It was a reporter commenting or reporting on the latest deadly mass shooting, this time in California, this time at a workplace holiday gathering, this time … until the next time somewhere.
No. If one wants to use the massacre at Columbine High School in 1999 in Colorado as the seminal stepping-off point for these incidents, then it’s been at least 16 years of “new normal.” 
But one can stretch it back to the l980s and early 1990s in major cities, where murders and deadly gun violence soared to unprecedented heights.  


New York City clocked a record 2,245 homicides in 1990. That must have been the new normal on the installment plan. It’s come to a point where these modern-day mass killings and shootings have become … normal. (Heck, a higher murder rate than now was “normal” during ProhibitionÃ¢  . 
Across the country, the pre-Prohibition murder rate of 5.6 per 100,000 nearly doubled to almost 10 during the 1920s. The U.S. murder rate in 2013: 4.5 per 100,000.)
The question is what to do about it, if anything. Some figure it’s tragic but collateral damage for living in a free society, where buying and possessing a firearm is an individual’s constitutional right, the Supreme Court declared in 2008. Others cannot accept that view and feel our leaders on both sides of the aisles have buckled to the NRA and failed miserably in protecting the public from being slaughtered.
As I watched the coverage Thursday and heard every kind of analysis and comment, from the ludicrous to the sensible and back again, I came away with two main thoughts, none of them real answers either: 
We repeal the Second Amendment and use a giant magnet to whisk away the 300 million firearms in this country, or we just arm everyone and hand every newborn a gun permit with a sign that says: “Welcome to the world. You are now on your own …”  


Now, the usual folks will point out that more people die of heart disease or other illnesses than from shootings or mass slaughters. Others will knee-jerk the “should we ban cars because they also cause deaths?” line. 
Disease may be related to genetics or lifestyle, but it’s a natural occurrence. Cars were built for transport, not to run people over. Firearms were made to cause death or inflict great bodily harm, whether to a deer or a human. It’s in its own category. 
The oft-cited figure repeated over and over again is that Wednesday’s massacre in San Bernardino was the 355th mass shooting in America so far this year. That amounts to more than one a day. 
I went to shootingtracker.com and pored through the vast list of incidents. The site defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are killed or injured. 
The first one this year took place New Year’s Day. Five people were injured when someone opened fire on a party bus in Memphis, Tenn. Three days later, three people are fatally shot and a fourth wounded in Dallas. The down button on the computer scanned through what seemed like every state abbreviation in the union and briefly stopped when the number of dead jumps from one to a handful or more. 
It stopped at the five killed Jan. 29 in a home Troup County, Ga. Then it was another five, including the killer, also in a house in another part of Georgia on Feb. 7. It stopped at the eight in Tyrone, Mo., nine and 18 wounded in Waco, Texas, in May, eight in Houston, nine killed in a church in Charleston, S.C., 10 killed and seven wounded at a community college campus in Oregon on Oct. 10, the 14 massacred and 17 wounded Wednesday. 
Pick a motive, any motive: political, social, money, personal. They were all in play. Pick a place, any place: home, shopping mall, college campus, church, social services center. Pick a race, any race, pick a religion, any religion or none at all. You get the picture. 
We’re worried about foreign terrorists and refugees fleeing terror, but it looks like we are doing a bang-up job killing and terrorizing ourselves. 
Yes. Guns don’t kill people. But people — whether clinically mentally ill or just plain evil or immoral — with access to firearms kill people. 
So we will wring our hands, run to our ideological corners once again, stand down hard and resist coming together to find perhaps a better way to curb the carnage while gun sales soar, as they often do after these events. If Sandy Hook and the slaughter of schoolkids didn’t push us there, little else will. But doing nothing and shrugging shoulders — now, that should not be normal.

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/126389761/0/usatoday-newstopstories~Couples-and-crime-go-back-decades-and-far-beyond-Bonnie-and-Clyde/,"Among the mysteries that investigators in Wednesday's shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., will try to figure out is this: Why would a husband and wife with a 6-month-old child at home open fire on a group of coworkers? Psychologists say if Syed R. Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, turn out to be partners in the grisly crime, they wouldn't be the first. Throughout history, potentially dangerous people have occasionally found one another, and the result is often all the more dangerous. ""You do have this psychopathology sort of coming together,"" said Gregg O. McCrary, a former FBI profiler who now runs a Virginia consulting firm. ""And it's interesting how they tend to find each other, if they do."" Authorities say there remains much they still don't know about the case, including what each partner's role was in planning and carrying out the shooting spree. Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Thursday said, ""We don't know if this is workplace rage, something larger or a combination of both."" Like Lynch, University of Virginia psychiatry and neurobehavioral sciences professor Janet Warren said there's just too much unknown to be able to paint a full picture of what happened. But she said psychologists often encounter what's known as folie à deux or “madness of two."" She recalled research in which she and colleagues examined 800 child abduction and abuse cases and found that 135 had dual perpetrators. ""To some extent here, there’s really this question: How is it that one human being gets sucked in and encapsulated in the pathology — and maybe psychosis — of the other? And I’m not sure we’ve completely figured that out.” McCrary recalled working the case of Paul Bernardo and his wife, Karla Homolka, a Canadian couple who raped and murdered at least three women — including Homolka's 15-year-old sister Tammy — in the early 1990s. McCrary said Bernardo was already a serial rapist by the time he married Homolka, but that once they got together, ""there was some sort of synergistic energy"" that made them more dangerous. ""He was a serial rapist before, but she was sort of good with that,"" McCrary said. ""When he asked her, 'What would you think if I was a rapist?' she said, 'Well, I think that would be cool.' Not the response you would expect to get, necessarily."" But Warren said Homolka can actually be seen as ""kind of a compliant victim"" in the crimes. A court apparently agreed: Homolka told investigators that she was an unwilling accomplice to the crimes and pled guilty to manslaughter in exchange for a 12-year prison term. She was released in 2005. Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow, the Depression-era outlaws known popularly as Bonnie and Clyde, are the archetypes for married or romantic partners in crime. But such couples dot the landscape of crime history, experts said. Among the most well-known male/female crime couples over the past several decades: • Martha Beck and Ray Fernandez, also known as the ""Lonely Hearts Killers,"" in the late 1940s used newspaper ""wanted"" ads to lure their victims, rob them and often kill them. A jury convicted the pair of killing Janet Fay, a 66-year-old woman to whom Fernandez had become engaged in 1949. When Beck discovered the two in bed together, she struck Fay in the head with a hammer, according to mystery author Stacy Green, who has written about the couple. The pair were eventually convicted of more than a dozen other murders. They were executed by electric chair in 1951. Their story inspired the 2006 movie ""Lonely Hearts."" • Caril Fugate and Charles Starkweather killed a total of 11 people, including several of Fugate's family members, during a spree in Nebraska and Wyoming in 1957. Both Fugate and Starkweather were in their teens at the time. Starkweather was executed for the killings, but Fugate, who was only 14, was released on parole in 1976 after serving 17 years in prison. The spree was the basis for the film ""Natural Born Killers."" • Rosemary and Fred West, a British couple, raped and killed an estimated dozen girls, including their eldest daughter, at their Gloucester home in the 1970s. In 1995, Fred West hanged himself in his prison cell before his trial; Rosemary West was found guilty of 10 murders and sentenced to life in prison. The Telegraph called her ""Britain's worst female serial killer."" In 1996, authorities demolished the couple's house. • Myra Hindley and Ian Brady, another British couple, committed what came to be called the ""Moors murders,"" among the most notorious in British history. Authorities say Brady, with Hindley as an accomplice, killed five children in the early 1960s, and buried several of their bodies on Saddleworth Moor in North England. Hindley died in prison in 2002; Brady was committed to a hospital for the criminally insane. He has since claimed to have committed five other murders, The Telegraph reported. • Charlene and Gerald Gallego sexually abused and killed 10 people, most of them teens, in Sacramento between 1978 and 1980, police said. Gerald Gallego was sentenced to death — he died in prison in 2002. But Charlene Gallego, who testified against him, agreed to plead guilty to murder. She was released in 1997. ""I did not kill any of them,"" she told Sacramento CBS affiliate KHTK-TV in 2013. • Suzan and Michael Bear Carson were convicted of three murders in northern California in the early 1980s. Known as the ""Witch Killers of San Francisco,"" they were self-proclaimed ""religious warriors,"" local media reported at the time. In a 1983 police interview, Michael Carson declared, ""Witchcraft, homosexuality and abortion are causes for death,"" The Associated Press reported. The couple were suspected in about a dozen other murders, The Arizona Republic reported. They are serving life sentences in California. • Faye and Ray Copeland were convicted of killing five drifters employed on their Missouri farm in the late 1980s. Police said Faye Copeland, who by then was in her late sixties, sewed a quilt made of the victims' clothes. During the investigation, police found a handwritten list of the five victims' names with X's next to them. Another seven names also had X's, but their bodies were never found. Both husband and wife were sentenced to death, but Ray Copeland died in prison in 1993. Faye Copeland's death sentence was overturned and she died in 2003 on parole at a Missouri nursing home. • Erika and Benjamin Sifrit were convicted in 2003 in connection with two murders over Memorial Day weekend in Ocean City, Md., in 2002. Prosecutors said the couple killed a Virginia couple ""for fun"" after luring them to a penthouse condominium, The (Baltimore) Sun reported. Erika Sifrit is serving life in prison, while Benjamin Sifrit is serving 38 years. USA TODAY Delta announces new European routes from Detroit, Minneapolis In Wednesday's case, Farook, 28, and Malik, 27, met online and became acquainted in Saudi Arabia. They had been married for two years, a local Islamic group said. The couple left their 6-month-old daughter with Farook's grandmother on Wednesday, saying they had a doctor's appointment. The pair fled the scene of the shooting and were soon caught by police, who riddled their SUV with bullets, killing both. McCrary cautioned that it's too soon to know for sure, but the former FBI profiler said the pair may have had a dominant/subordinate dynamic. The case that comes to mind for him is the 2002 Beltway sniper case, in which 42-year-old John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo, 17, drove an unassuming Chevrolet Caprice throughout the Washington, D.C., area, killing 10. In that case, he said Muhammad was ""the kind of dominant guy,"" and Malvo, was ""kind of being swept up"" in the spree. Muhammad was executed in 2009. Malvo is serving life in prison. For Warren, the telling detail in the San Bernardino case is that Malik was willing to leave her baby behind. “I think that’s what so compelling about this case,"" she said. Whatever the dynamic between the couple, somehow she overrode her maternal instincts. ""She didn't want to live to keep the child."""

http://www.ibtimes.com/united-states-safe-travel-australian-lawmaker-warns-travelers-about-us-gun-violence-2210755,"During another mass shooting in the United States -- this time in San Bernardino, California -- a former deputy prime minister of Australia said the federal government needs to include travel warnings about U.S. gun violence, the Sydney Morning Herald reported Thursday. Tim Fischer acknowledged that the U.S. had updated its advice for travel to Australia in the wake of terror attacks in Paris last month, and recommended that Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) should do the same for the U.S. ""[Over 300] mass shootings in the USA so far this year but about 80 a day you don't hear about,"" Fischer told ABC News Thursday. ""All [are] unacceptable because the U.S. is not stepping up on the public policy reform front. But have we not reached the stage where the Smart Traveler advice [from DFAT] needs to be muscled up?"" Fischer said it was “time to call out” the reality, citing that a person is 15 times more likely to be shot dead in the United States than in Australia and that travel advice should reflect that. While Australia’s firearm mortality rate is one per 100,000, the U.S. statistic is 10 per 100,000. Currently, Australia's advice for travelers headed to the United States says to, “exercise normal safety precautions,” but travel warnings have been issued for other countries prone to gun violence, including Mexico, where travelers are advised to exercise a “high degree of caution.” A police officer picks up a weapon from the scene of the investigation around the area of the SUV vehicle where two suspects were shot by police following a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California Dec. 3. Photo: Reuters The shooting rampage in San Bernardino on Wednesday -- which claimed the lives of 14 people and injured at least 21 more -- was the latest in an uptick of mass shootings in the United States in recent years. The shooting on Wednesday was called the country’s 355th mass shooting this year, and since 2013 there have been over 1,000 mass shootings in the U.S. In response to the United States’ raging gun violence, Fischer singled out the National Rifle Association (NRA). ""The NRA in particular needs to be called out for their unacceptable blockage of any sensible reform, including [ammunition] magazine limitation,"" Fischer said, according the Sydney Morning Herald."
https://www.nationalreview.com/article/427985/medias-inflated-mass-shootings-count-wildly-misleading-ian-tuttle,"Follow Us National Review Clarence Thomas’s Monumental Legacy Do We Have Freedom of Speech, Really? The Kind Soul of Clarence Thomas The Two Countercultures Clarence Thomas, an American Justice On Wednesday, as police continued the hunt for the murderers of 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., mainstream media outlets noted with alarm that “mass shootings” were outpacing the calendar. San Bernardino’s massacre was the 355th “mass shooting” — in 336 days. The Washington Post’s Wonkblog even provided a dramatic graphic: The numbers are provocative — and, unsurprisingly, misleading.
The source of the much-publicized data is the “Mass Shooting Tracker” at shootingtracker.com, a crowdsourced page that defines a “mass shooting” as any in which “four or more people are shot in one event, or related series of events, likely without a cooling off period.” Victims might include the gunman; the data is based on news reports.
There are obvious problems, one identified by the FBI in a 2014 report on active-shooter situations, which couches its own statistics by noting:

A handful of those identified as “wounded” were not injured by gunfire but rather suffered injuries incidental to the event, such as being hit by flying objects/shattered glass or falling while running.

It may be for this reason, among others, that the FBI does not define “mass shootings,” only “mass killings.” The latter are those incidents with at least three dead, a metric based on the Investigative Assistance for Violent Crimes Act of 2012, which passed into law in 2013 and grants the U.S. attorney general authority to aid in the investigation of “mass killings and attempted mass killings at the request of an appropriate law enforcement official of a state or political subdivision.” Under this definition, there have been 67 “mass killings” this year.
The Congressional Research Service, however, goes further: “Mass murder” is a multiple homicide with at least four victims, not including the offender; a “mass shooting” is a mass murder committed with a firearm; and a “mass public shooting” is a mass shooting “in at least one or more public locations, such as a workplace, school, restaurant, house of worship, neighborhood, or other public setting . . . and not attributable to any other underlying criminal activity or commonplace circumstance (armed robbery, criminal competition, insurance fraud, argument, or romantic triangle).” Using these definitions, Grant Duwe, in his 2007 book Mass Murder in the United States: A History, notes: “Excluding those that occurred in connection with criminal activity such as robbery, drug dealing, and organized crime, there were 116 mass public shootings during the twentieth century” (emphasis mine). The Congressional Research Service reported 317 mass shootings between 1999 and 2013, only 66 of which qualified under their criteria as mass public shootings.

The Congressional Research Service reported 317 mass shootings between 1999 and 2013, only 66 of which qualified under their criteria as mass public shootings. RELATED: The Left’s Cynical Gun-Control Reflex This disaggregation of the data makes clear the problem with the Mass Shooting Tracker’s chronicle: It fails to distinguish between the various types of mass shootings, of which some are more amenable to public-policy responses than others. Under the Tracker’s broad definition, crimes are lumped together that have nothing in common — except for the use of firearms, and a certain number of victims. #share#Consider the mass shooting that took place in Platte, S.D., on September 17, and left six people dead. It is, by death toll, one of the eight deadliest shootings of 2015. Why, then, did few people hear about it? Because the victims were the wife and four children of Scott Westerhuis, who police believed murdered them, then committed suicide. This was a tragedy. But it was also a wildly different circumstance than what transpired in Aurora, Colo., or Newtown, Conn. Likewise, the mass shooting that caused the most injuries this year was the gunfight that took place between two biker gangs in Waco, Texas, in May. That was a heinous crime. But, again, it was very different from the targeted assault on Virginia Tech in 2007. RELATED: Would Cracking Down on Guns in the U.S. Really Reduce Violence It is not even necessary to drill down into the data to recognize that the Mass Shooting Tracker’s catalogue is misleading. A quick glance shows that mass shootings, using the Tracker’s definition, are concentrated exactly where one might expect — in large urban areas, many of them notorious for poverty, gang violence, municipal mismanagement, etc. Seven of this year’s “mass shootings” were in New Orleans, ten were in Baltimore, and 14 were in Chicago; there were six in both Detroit and Indianapolis, and five apiece in St. Louis, Philadelphia, Miami, Houston, and Cincinnati. Concentrations of violence in metropolises suggest to any clear-thinking observer that we’re talking about something different than the type of violence on display in Roseburg, Ore., in October. And, in fact, gang-related shootings, crimes that occasion gunfire, disputes among families and friends that turn explosive — these account for the vast majority of “mass” gun violence in the United States. The Congressional Research Service reports that, of the average of 21 mass shootings (their definition) annually between 1991 and 2013, “familicides” and shootings “attributable to an underlying criminal activity or commonplace circumstance” were both almost twice as common as “mass public shootings” of the sort that more commonly arrest the public eye. RELATED: Our National Rorschach Test of Violence However, conflating the much rarer incidents — the Auroras and Newtowns — with the gang shootouts and familicides that are responsible for many more victims (57 percent more, total, between 1999 and 2013), is politically expedient. The notion that there is a James Holmes or an Adam Lanza wreaking havoc every day in the United States is a form of fearmongering, a way of whipping up the sort of worry that might make voters more amenable to the sorts of policy proposals liberals at the Washington Post and elsewhere already prefer. #related#To that point, the curators of the “Mass Shooting Tracker” do not veil their own agenda, making pointed reference to the NRA; they believe their work, among other things, “punches a hole in the NRA argument that if mass shootings are televised, more mass shootings will occur via copycats” (an argument, by the way, that is almost certainly correct for specific types of shooters, i.e., not Crips or deranged husbands). As an example of the sort of under-broadcast shooting they have in mind, they cite the case of Travis Steed, who shot 18 people in Jackson, Tenn., in 2012, fortunately killing only one. But was Steed a demented killer, out to massacre innocents? No. He was one of three people who opened fire after a dispute broke out in a nightclub around 2 a.m. on a Sunday morning.  The Mass Shooting Tracker obfuscates the variety of circumstances that give rise to gun violence in the United States — and uses that misleading data to push a political point. On Wednesday, mainstream media outlets and politicians indulged in exactly the same behavior. Whatever policy prescriptions may exist to curtail gun violence in the United States, they ought to be based on an accurate assessment of the problem, not on data slyly misinterpreted by those with partisan purposes.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/yo1bwM5Fhaw/,"Right before the attack in California happened, President Obama explained to CBS’s Norah O’Donnell that America was safe from the Islamic State and urged Americans to feel safe. “ISIL is not going to pose an existential threat to us,” he said, insisting that although they were a “dangerous organization,” the country had strengthened national security under his administration. Obama taped his interview with O’Donnell on Wednesday, right before the attacks occurred. The interview was aired on CBS this morning. “[W]e have hardened our defenses, our homeland has never been more protected by more effective intelligence and law enforcement professionals at every level than they are now,” he said, prior to the attack in San Bernardino later that day. The White House extended the interview with O’Donnell after news broke of the attack, allowing him to respond to what was then described as another mass shooting event. Obama was careful to clarify in the interview that there was always a possibility for attacks but encouraged Americans to feel safe. “The American people should feel confident that we’re going to be able to defend ourselves and make sure that we have a good holiday season and go about our lives,” he said in the taped interview that was aired this morning. He also urged Americans to respond properly in the wake of an attack, warning them against responding with fear. “I said this repeatedly overseas, ISIL only wins if we react out of fear and start changing how we live, violating our values,” he said. “They can’t win on the battlefield. They can kill some innocent people but that’s not a victory for them if we respond appropriately.” Israel / Middle EastNational SecurityPoliticsBarack ObamaSan BernardinoShooting .

http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-thoughts-prayers-politics-gun-control-shooting-20151203-story.html,"It's a natural reaction in times of grief: Politicians from both parties offered supportive thoughts and prayers for those killed in the San Bernardino shootings. But within hours, social media was awash with pushback from gun control advocates calling out those who offer prayers without pushing for tighter gun laws. ""Your 'thoughts' should be about steps to take to stop this carnage,"" Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut tweeted. ""Your 'prayers' should be for forgiveness if you do nothing — again."" Murphy, who has been outspoken in pressing for gun control legislation, added at a news conference Thursday: ""Members of Congress don't get elected to send out sympathy tweets."" As GOP presidential candidates and conservative lawmakers tweeted, one by one, their prayers after the shooting, Igor Volsky, a contributing editor at the liberal website ThinkProgress, started tweeting back how much each had received in campaign contributions from the National Rifle Association, which opposes tighter gun laws. Volsky said in an interview that his Twitter campaign stemmed from frustration with those who ""routinely talk about all the thoughts and prayers they're going to send to victims, and yet they do nothing time and time again in terms of actually reducing these things from happening."" The hashtag #thoughtsandprayers quickly was adopted by those venting frustration with the prayerful sentiments offered by those opposed to congressional action on gun legislation. The New York Daily News expressed the same idea on its front page with the blaring headline: ""God Isn't Fixing This"" coupled with images of tweets about prayers from GOP candidates Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Lindsey Graham and House Speaker Paul Ryan. Soon came a backlash from those arguing that gun control advocates were sneering at deeply felt prayers. Obama looks to use executive power to close gun loophole Paul tweeted that the newspaper's cover was ""deplorable. Genuine thoughts and prayers are not political fodder."" ""Prayer is exactly the right immediate response,"" tweeted Matt Mackowiak, a Republican political consultant. ""Belittling praying for victims is odious."" Commentary magazine's Noah Rothman wrote that an ""ill-advised impulse to discredit the act of prayer"" was an example of ""how far removed the left has become from majority opinion in the rest of America."" Separate from the political back and forth, it fell to Catholic priest and blogger Matthew Schneider to tweet his thoughts on the role of prayer for most Americans in such a time of tragedy. ""When a mass shooting happens, all 99 percent of us can do is pray for the victims and their families. #PrayforSanBernadino,"" Schneider tweeted to his 36,000 followers. He added, in an interview, ""In general, in all of our lives, prayer and action should be complementary."" He declined to weigh in on the difficult politics of gun violence. Stories of those who died in the mass shooting in California Most Democrats favor making it harder for people to purchase firearms, while most Republicans oppose the idea. With the GOP running both the House and Senate, leaders have shown little interest in even holding votes on curbing guns. And the National Rifle Association remains a potent force opposing restrictions. Spurred by the latest shooting to take a vote, the Senate on Thursday again voted against expanding background checks for more gun purchases. It was the same proposal the Senate had rejected after the 2012 slayings of 20 children and six educators in Newtown, Connecticut. President Barack Obama opened his remarks on the shooting Thursday by offering, yes, ""thoughts and prayers"" for those affected by the shooting. But he added that ""it's going to be important for all of us — including our legislatures — to see what we can do to make sure that when individuals decide that they want to do somebody harm, we're making it a little harder for them to do it."" Josh Earnest, Obama's press secretary, told reporters: ""We've got too many members of Congress who are terrified of the NRA, while too many Americans are terrified of a mass shooting."" During the 2014 election cycle, the NRA and its affiliates spent more than $35 million on campaign contributions, lobbying expenditures and so-called issue ads supporting or opposing candidates, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Officials: Gunman in San Bernardino killings was in touch with extremists NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker said Thursday the group had not issued any statement about the San Bernardino shootings. But she pointed out in an email that California has one of the nation's strongest gun control laws, including background checks on all firearms sales and a strict limitation on licenses to carry concealed weapons. Asked if there was any gun control legislation currently proposed in Congress that the NRA could support, Baker offered no response.

http://www.ocregister.com/articles/bullets-694670-pipe-version.html,"Trending: The married couple suspected of killing 14 people at a social services center had built more than a dozen pipe bombs and stockpiled thousands of rounds of ammunition. They fired more than 150 rounds at victims and police officers.  Officials said the two assault rifles were variants of the AR-15, the semiautomatic version of the military M-16 rifle; one was made by DPMS Panther Arms, and the other was a Smith & Wesson M&P model, a designation meaning military and police. Although the AR-15 assault-type rifle is designed for 20 and 30-round magazines, there are companies that make 100-round magazines for these assault rifles. Officials found four spent high-capacity magazines inside the Inland Regional Center, where at least 75 rounds had been fired. The assailants fired 76 rounds at police in the shootout.  Assailants were carrying two handguns, a Smith & Wesson and a Llama.  At least 12 pipe bombs were found inside the assailants’ apartment along with thousands of rounds of ammunition.

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/126393611/0/phoenix/nation~Names-of-San-Bernadino-dead-begin-to-emerge/,"They came to attend a holiday party, some planning speeches, some bringing presents. They ranged in age from 26 to 60, and a few had come to America years ago from faraway lands - including Iran and Vietnam. Their lives ended in tragedy at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino on Wednesday after a homicidal couple opened fire. The stories of the 14 people who died are beginning to emerge. USA TODAY put together short bios on several of the victims, based on social media pages, statements and interviews with family members, and recollections from co-workers: Bennetta Betbadal Bennetta Betbadal, 46, was born in Iran in 1969 and fled to America at the age of 18 to escape Islamic extremism and the persecution of Christians that followed the Iranian Revolution, according to a GoFundMe contribution site set up in her name. She initially settled in New York City, eventually moving to California and marrying her husband, Arlen Verdehyou, a police officer, the contribution page said. The couple moved to Rialto, Calif. and had three children, now ages 10, 12, and 15. Betbadal graduated from Cal Poly, Pomona with a degree in Chemistry. ""She accepted a position as an inspector for the San Bernardino County Health Department where she has served for many years,"" the GoFundMe page says. ""Benneta was proud to work for the people of San Bernardino County. She loved her job, her community, and her country. Her greatest love, however, was for her husband, her children, and her large extended family."" In a statement, her family said, ""Bennetta left the house Wednesday morning, excited about a presentation she was scheduled to give to her supervisors and coworkers at their annual meeting. It is the ultimate irony that her life would be stolen from her that day by what appears to be the same type of extremism that she fled so many years ago."" The money raised for her ""will be used solely to benefit Bennetta's children, as they and the family adapt to life without her."" Tin Nguyen Nguyen, a Vietnamese-born woman who was planning to be married in 2017, dropped by the Wednesday-morning holiday meeting at the Inland Regional Center, her cousin Calvin Nguyen told the USA TODAY Network. Neither Calvin nor the rest of Nguyen's cousins were concerned by 10:30 p.m. Wednesday, when the relatives were texting each other about the family's Christmas season plans. It was around 11 p.m. when Calvin's family heard news that Nguyen, 31, was in the same facility they had seen on the news. ""Her mom tried to call, and all people tried to call, but no answer,"" Calvin said. USA TODAY Delta announces new European routes from Detroit, Minneapolis By midnight they still hadn't received word from Nguyen, of Santa Ana in Orange County, but had reached a tragic conclusion. ""We said, if she survived, she would have called us back,"" Calvin said Thursday. Nguyen, like gunman Syed R. Farook, was a food inspector with the San Bernardino County Health Department, her uncle Phu Nguyen told the Newsday newspaper. On Thursday afternoon, Calvin and about 10 other family members huddled together as they approached the grief counseling center set up by the county in nearby Highland. An older woman in the group stopped just short of the curb leading into the building, threw her head back and screamed. Several other family members held her as they escorted her into the small banquet hall. USA TODAY Olivia Nalos Opre: Why we hunt, even lions The screams could still be heard from the parking lot as the family faced the county's grief counselors inside. San Bernardino Sheriff's deputies guarding the facility closed the doors. ""She was very intelligent, a good girl, takes care of Mom and family,"" Calvin told the USA TODAY Network, as the family emerged from the facility in each other's arms about 20 minutes later. ""We very sad that we lose her,"" he said. ""Pray for us."" Daniel Kaufman Kaufman, who was serving coffee at the holiday event, was one of the victims of the shooting, his friend Jack Prewett told the USA TODAY Network. Prewett had read on Facebook that Kaufman, 42, had been at the gathering when the shooting occurred, but had heard that his friend of 15 years was only injured in the attack. ""Initially we heard that he had been shot in the arm and was in surgery and everything was fine, and then we got that, no, that was a miscommunication."" Prewett came to the grief counseling center set up by San Bernardino County on Thursday morning to see for himself if the rumors of Kaufman's death were true. Police confirmed the sad news. ""I was dreading it,"" he said. Nicholas Thalasinos Marie Medina, a 20-year resident of a quiet neighborhood in Colton, Calif., woke up Thursday morning feeling a sense of relief. ""They caught the guys. It's over,"" she thought at first. But when she looked out the shades of her window, she knew she was wrong. ""Instead it came right into our front yard."" News vans crowded into the neighborhood, and Medina soon realized the photo of a victim she saw on television the night before was a neighbor, Nicholas Thalasinos, who lived across the street. The 52-year-old, an environmental health specialist for the county was a co-worker of suspected gunman Syed Rizwan Farook. According to those who knew him, Thalasinos was outspoken about political and religious topics. But he was always known to be ""wonderful and compassionate."" Nicholas lived in a baby blue stucco house with his wife, Jennifer Thompson-Thalasinos, whom he met 14 years ago. Family friend, Sharon Humphrey, 55, said the two met online, on opposite sides of the country. Jennifer lived in Colton and Nicholas lived in New Jersey. A GoFundMe page set up to help Jennifer with funeral costs describes their relationship as ""a truly romantic, fairy tale love."" According to the page, the two bonded over their love for science fiction and fantasy, sharing an interest in Beauty and the Beast. Humphrey said that Nicholas was a great family man who loved Jennifer and helped take care of her parents. ""It's an unbelievable tragedy,"" she said as she stood in front of their yard, talking with Medina. ""You never expect this to happen to someone you know."" Thalasinos, a former New Jersey resident, was an employee at the department for about 12 years and had worked as an inspector alongside Farook, Thalasinos'wife, Jennifer Thalasinos, told KABC. His widow, a second-grade teacher for Colton Joint Unified School District, told KABC that she met her husband online. He was living in New Jersey and moved out to San Bernardino to be with her. ""My husband, Nicholas Thalasinos, was killed in the shooting,"" she wrote in a Facebook post. Also on social media, Thalasinos wrote that he received threats in the days leading up to the attack. In a Facebook post on Tuesday, he said he received a message full of threats, including one stating he ""will die."" Fellow San Bernadino County worker Vincent Armijo, a leader with Shiloh Messianic Congregation church in Crestline where Thalasinos and his wife were members, told the USA TODAY Network that he got a call Wednesday afternoon saying his friend had not been accounted for and asking him to pray. Facebook Profile Pictures - Jennifer Thalasinos | Facebook ""He was just one of those guys who wanted more and more and more from the church,"" Armijo said. Condolences to Thalasinos' friends and family filled his Facebook page. Thalasinos' profile there and on Twitter, where he used the handle @LeastServant, indicated he used the platforms to share his conservative and pro-Israel views. Some online speculated Thursday that those viewpoints may have made Thalasinos a target. ""Nick was very courageous and spoke the truth,"" one person wrote on his Facebook page. ""It is my honest belief that Nicholas was murdered because of his alliance with Israel and Jewish people."" Armijo said Thalasinos was conservative and eager to share his opinions, but never aggressively so. ""I have some people in the congregation who you would know like that, but that was not the way I knew Nick,"" he said. ""Nick had a pleasant manner about him, always said hello."" Jennifer Thalasinos, whose husband Nicholas was killed in San Bernardino: ""He was a martyr.""@lanow @latimes pic.twitter.com/xSlZCRHG0A Michael WetzelWetzel, also a colleague of gunman Farook, was identified Thursday by friends as one of the Inland Regional Center victims, according to the local San Bernadino Sun newspaper. Wetzel's death was confirmed in a post on online fundraising site launched Thursday for his wife and six children. As of Thursday at noon, $51,478 of a $75,000 goal has been raised on the page, the paper reported. In San Bernardino County Department of Public Health documents, according to the Sun, he is listed as a supervising environmental health specialist. The family lives in Lake Arrowhead, a rural town north of San Bernadino, a spokeswoman for the Church of the Woods told the paper. USA TODAY Delta announces new European routes from Detroit, Minneapolis In the fundraiser posting, organizer Celia Behar wrote that Wetzel's wife, Renee, sent her a message on Wednesday. ""Please pray. My husband was in a meeting and a shooter came in. There are multiple people dead/shot. I can't get a hold of him."" Only eight hours after that message was sent, ""Renee learned that her husband Michael Raymond Wetzel had been killed,"" according to Behar. Yvette Velasco Velasco, 27, was described by her family as smart, motivated and full of life, the Associated Press reported. In a statement, her relatives said she was ""loved by all who knew her."" ""We are devastated about what happened and are still processing this nightmare,"" the family said. Velasco is survived by her parents and three sisters. ""Please pray for our family and the other families who have lost a loved one as a result of this terrible tragedy,"" her relatives wrote. In the aftermath of the shooting, Velasco's relatives searched everywhere for her. Mindy Velasco, her aunt, called hospitals, police and evacuee centers in a harrowing search for information, the Los Angeles Times reported. ""I'm fearing the worst,"" she told the paper. ""She would definitely be in contact after something like this."" Damian MeinsIn an email sent to employees, Juan C. Perez, director of Riverside County Transportation & Land Management Agency, called Damian Meins a ""bright light"" that had been ""extinguished from our world in a most tragic way,"" the Los Angeles Times reported. In the email, Perez wrote that Meins had spent 28 years working for Riverside County and had recently returned to a position with the environmental health department after retiring in 2010. Meins, he said, also had been a physical education teacher at St. Catherine's School in nearby Riverside, where he played Santa. ""I will always remember Damian as a caring, jovial man with a warm smile and a hearty laugh,"" Perez wrote. Isaac GebreslassieA woman who answered a USA TODAY Network phone call Thursday at Isaac Gebreslassie's home said he had ""passed away."" She would not give her name. People were crying in the background. A witness, Chris Nwadike, told the USA TODAY Network on Wednesday evening that Gebreslassie, 60, had been sitting next to Farook at the health department meeting before he left to fetch his wife and begin the rampage. Gebreslassie is listed in payroll records as a supervising environmental health specialist in the same department where Farook worked. On Wednesday night, Gebreslassie's wife, Hiwet, told The Wall Street Journal that she was unable to reach her husband by phone and that she and family members had spent all night driving around to local hospitals searching for him. ""I've tried calling, texting,"" she told the paper. ""Nothing."" Later Thursday, Gebreslassie's brother told the Journal that the family had been notified that Gebreslassie was one of the 14 people killed. Sierra Clayborn Sierra Clayborn, 27, was more of a friend than a tenant to Mary Hale, the apartment manager for the small Fontana, Calif. unit where Clayborn lived with her boyfriend. Hale last spoke with Clayborn the previous Wednesday, just before Clayborn was getting ready to visit her family for the holidays. ""She had to come in and wish me a happy Thanksgiving,"" Hale said in an interview Thursday. She ""just always had a smile on her face,"" Hale said. ""Never a mean word was ever said. If something had to be fixed in the unit, she'd go, 'I'm sorry to bother you . . . '"" Hale said Clayborn worked for the health department, testing chemicals in pools. She loved her job. ""The only thing I can say is, she was a lady,"" Hale said. When a journalist first approached Hale about Clayborn Thursday, Hale said she never imagined she would be one of the victims. ""I thought maybe she was getting an award,"" Hale said. ""It was devastating."" Aurora Banales Godoy The mother of a 2-year-old, Godoy ""was a beautiful 26 year old woman who is leaving behind a beautiful baby boy named Alexander Godoy and loving husband, James Godoy,"" a GoFundMe page set up in her honor states. ""The Godoy family has always been positive, fun, loving and have grown on all of us in such a short amount of time,"" the page says. ""They are amazing people who need as much love and support they can get."" Other people who died in the attacks, according to the county coroner (biographical information was not immediately available): Robert Adams, 40Harry Bowman, 46Juan Espinoza, 50Shannon Johnson, 45 Anna Rumer, Barrett Newkirk and Colin Atagi of The (Palm Springs) Desert Sun, Yihyun Jeong, Megan Cassidy and Amy B Wang of the Arizona Republic, and Brad Heath of USA TODAY contributed to this story.

The governor was expected to leave Thursday afternoon for Paris, where he planned to talk about the efforts California has made to cut carbon emissions in the state in an effort to ease global warming. Instead, the governor headed to San Bernardino, where on Thursday afternoon he was scheduled to receive a private briefing from local, state and federal law enforcement officials on the shooting, which officials are investigating as a possible terrorist act that left 14 people dead and 21 injured. While Brown has not yet released his plans for the rest of the week, sources close to the governor suggest he will arrive at the Paris summit sometime this weekend. On Wednesday, the governor canceled a public ceremony around the Capitol Christmas tree lighting in Sacramento “out of respect for Californians affected by (Wednesday’s) tragedy,” Brown said in a statement.

21:35 We’re going to end our rolling coverage of the investigation and aftermath of Wednesday’s mass shooting in San Bernardino, which left 14 people dead, 21 injured and two suspects killed in a shootout with police. You can read our latest, full report on the shooting and investigation through the link below. 9.00pm GMT
21:00 If confirmed as an act of terrorism – as it is now officially considered by the FBI’s investigation – the mass shooting in San Bernardino will join a list of nine attacks considered “terrorism” since September 11 2001. Te research center New America tallies eight “deadly jihadist attacks” since 2001, not including the San Bernardino massacre. The attacks are heterogenous – some have never been official labeled terrorism, nor have all the perpetrators faced terrorism charges. Most prominent on the list are the bombing of the Boston Marathon in 2013 and the mass shooting at Fort Hood in 2009. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found guilty of terrorism earlier this year for executing the Boston bombing with his brother, Tamerlan, who was killed in a shootout with police. Al-Qaida propaganda was found in the brothers’ possessions, and Tamerlan appeared to return to the US radicalized after a trip to Dagestan. The bombing killed three people and injured more than 260 others. The US army has never described the 2009 mass shooting at Fort Hood as terrorism, and Nidal Hasan, the gunman who sent messages to jihadi leader Anwar al-Awlaki, was charged with murder but not terrorism. Similarly, Barack Obama and administration officials shied from calling the attack terrorism. Hasan was sentenced to death in 2013 for killing 13 people and injuring more than 30 others. The New America list also includes more arguable cases, such as a 2014 office attack in Oklahoma, by a man who had recently converted to Islam, and an attack on a Tennessee military recruiting center, by a young Muslim man who had a history of depression and substance abuse. New America contrasts the list of nine “jihadi” attacks (the center includes San Bernardino) with a list of 19 attacks by non-Muslim extremists, such as the murder of nine black people in Charleston, South Carolina, in June. Government agencies have varying definitions of terrorism. The FBI’s definition of domestic terrorism reads: Involve acts dangerous to human life that violate federal or state law; Appear intended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination. or kidnapping; and occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the US.” 8.48pm GMT
20:48 Comey then urges Americans “not too make too much” of the news that one of the suspects had made contact with someone who was, at some point, the subject of an FBI investigation. I urge you not to make too much of that. … We’re obviously looking very closely at those contacts but I would urge you not to overthink that. He says the case is puzzling even FBI investigators – repeating an observation made earlier today by the attorney for the suspect’s family. There’s much about this that doesn’t make sense even to those of us who do this for a living Lastly Comey asks Americans “not let fear become disabling, but try to channel” it into a heightened awareness of suspicious behavior. “If you see something that doesn’t make sense, you say something to somebody,” he says, noting that in most FBI cases there are missed opportunities for witnesses to report uncomfortable or strange behavior on someone’s part. 8.45pm GMT
20:45 FBI director James Comey is delivering a statement, saying there’s evidence of “radicalization by the killers and of potential inspiration by foreign terrorism organizations”. But he cautions: “there is a lot of evidence in this case that doesn’t quite make sense.” We are spending a tremendous amount of time … trying to understand the motives of these killers and trying to understand every detail of their lives. He says the FBI has collected “a very large body” of digital evidence that the suspects “tried to conceal from us”. “We are keeping our minds open as we always try to do.” He says that so far – only two days into the investigation – there is “no indication these killers are part of a larger organized group or a cell … there’s no indication that they are part of a network.” 7.57pm GMT

            at 8.05pm GMT 7.43pm GMT
19:43 Sheriff John McMahon says he’s confident in his forces to confront sudden and devastating crimes. Based on how law enforcement responded to the shooting and subsequent hunt for suspects, he says: “I truly believe we are prepared to deal with whatever threat or incident occurs.” With that the press conference ends. 7.40pm GMT
19:40 Bowdich says he does not know whether Malik somehow radicalized her husband. “I don’t know the answer whether she influenced him or not. Being a husband myself we’re all influenced to some extent, but I don’t know the answer.” He says “of course” he’s concerned about the fact that the suspects were not on law enforcement’s radar before the attack. “Of course I’m concerned. We didn’t know. There’s nothing that we’ve seen yet that would’ve triggered us to know. When you go into a crime scene like that it’s one of the most heinous things you’ll ever see, it’s horrific. Bowdich repeats that investigators know of no credible threat at this time, and makes an appeal to calm and solidarity to the people of San Bernardino. We are with you we stand by you, we are are focused, the FBI’s number one mandate is to protect the homeland from attack. Do not let this cause mass hysteria. We’re not there. we’re not there at a ll. We have a long-term , very complex investigation. I assure the American public we will do everything in our power within the law to get that done.” 7.35pm GMT
19:35 Asked about the “telephonic communications” with other suspects, Bowdich says he only knows of contacts made within the United States at this stage. “I am not aware of all the overseas connections at this point, we are working with all our foreign partners on that.” He’s asked about the two guns bought on behalf of Syed Farook by someone the authorities have described as “an acquaintance”. “There is a person we know of their location, who purchased those weapons. But I’m going to let ATF” handle those questions, Bowdich says. “The person is not under arrest at this point.” 7.32pm GMT
19:32 Asked about the rush of reporters into the suspects’ home, Bowdich says the FBI had returned authority to the apartment back to the owners after their search. Last night we turned that over back to the residents, … Once we’re out we don’t have control of it … We leave anytime we execute a lawful search warrant, we leave a list of all the items seized with that search warrant. Bowdich says that the FBI is piecing together the suspects’ travel history, only confirming that Syed Farook “travelled overseas in 2013”. Farook and his then fiancee, Tashfeen Malik, came to the US in 2014 from Saudi Arabia. “He was not under active surveillance, I am not aware and I do not believe that there was any kind of investigation pending on him.” 7.30pm GMT
19:30 “There’s a number of pieces of evidence that have essentially pushed us off the cliff,” Bowdich says, and “we are now investigating that this is now an act of terrorism.” There are no other suspects currently under arrest, it is possible that there will be some in the future. We don’t know.” He says some of the digital media has been damaged, and that investigators are still hunting for what motivated the attacks. “Are there others, and are they based in the US, are they outside the US – we don’t know the answers.” 7.27pm GMT
19:27 Bowdich says that one of the suspects made a “telephonic connection” with someone else the FBI is investigating. What I’m ready to confirm is that there are some telephonic connections between these two individuals, at least one of these individuals, and other subjects of our investigation.” 7.25pm GMT
19:25 Besides bombs and ammunition, “we have also uncovered evidence that these suspects attempted to destroy” digital evidence, Bowdich says. “We found two cellphones in a nearby trash can, those cellphones were actually crushed. … We do continue to exploit the data from those cellphones. We do hope that the digital fingerprints that were left by these individuals will lead us to their motivations.” Bowdich says the FBI has established a national hotline if they have any information that pertains to the case. “Please do not send us things that are obviously not pertinent to this matter,” he says, “but if you think you have in any form or fashion pertains, please send it.” Updated
            at 7.26pm GMT 7.23pm GMT
19:23 FBI assistant director David Bowdich begins his statement by addressing the victims and their families: “just remember they are first in this scenario.” “This is a very complex investigation, this is a very long-term investigation,” Bowdich says. “As of today, based on the information and the facts that we know … we are now investigating these horrific acts as an act of terrorism.” 7.21pm GMT
19:21 Police chief Jarrod Burguan is giving a press conference. He describes an incident that took place in the days before Wednesday’s mass shooting: “suspicious circumstances that were noted” about a man who asked a movie theater security guard about movie times, theater hours, etc. Burguan says there’s no reason to connect the event with the shooting, but he wanted to address rumors of the incident. “We don’t have any credible information to indicate that there’s a threat to this region right now.” He says that at this point the San Bernardino police will give the reins of the investigation to the FBI, although they will continue to work together. 7.14pm GMT
19:14 Not only reporters walked into the suspects’ apartment, my colleague Tom Dart reports from Redlands. “Maya Pawooskar used to live close by and drove a couple of miles from to quench her curiosity…” “Actually I saw it asked in the White House press conference, asking the press secretary how is that they’re allowing? So I thought, I’d better go quickly before they stop!” she said. The house was less damaged than she had imagined from watching police storm suspects’ homes on television crime dramas. “I think it was a little better than what they show on TV. I thought there would be more holes in the walls and stuff like that. The funny thing was, people were on top of the couches, on top of it all. When I went in it was chaos. I think there were like 50,100 reporters in there,” she said. Updated
            at 7.15pm GMT 7.02pm GMT
19:02 Suspect Tashfeen Malik violated Facebook’s policies with her profile, the social network has told CNBC. Earlier on Friday federal officials told the AP and Reuters that Malik had posted a message in praise of Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. They said she used an alias, and that she and her husband tried to destroy some electronic devices before they shot dead 14 people at the Inland Regional Center on Wednesday. Facebook tells CNBC it identified & removed suspect Tashfeen Malik's profile for violating its standards, is cooperating w/ law enforcement. A Facebook executive has told Mashable that Malik’s profile was suspended because it praised terror acts, a violation of the company’s policy to prevent terror groups from using the site for propaganda or organizing.

          / CBS/AP As police in Redlands, Calif., searched from house to house for suspects in Tuesday's mass shooting in San Bernardino, Americans at home watched something unusual: the tactical use of armored vehicles on a suburban street. Even in a country that regularly experiences mass shootings, the need for either military or non-military armored personnel carriers -- known as MRAPs and Bearcats -- is rare, experts told 48 Hours' Crimesider Wednesday. The vehicles became infamous in 2014 after they were used to quell protests in Ferguson, Mo., sparking an outcry and leading President Barack Obama to issue an executive order in January limiting police access to certain military surplus equipment. In California on Tuesday, they were used as most departments originally planned, to shield the police from people who had already killed and injured dozens, said Jim Bueermann, a former chief of the Redlands Police Department, and current president of the non-profit Police Foundation. ""That usage was exactly what those vehicles were intended to be used for. It was a way to get up to that SUV, where you had an armed person who had just killed a bunch of people, and was shooting at police,"" said Bueermann, whose organization provided recommendations to the White House before it issued its executive order. But Bueermann said one massive military vehicle used Wednesday was out of place, even in a volatile scenario like the one police encountered on the streets of San Bernardino. It's called the MRAP, it's built to withstand a war zone, and it has been provided free-of-charge to some local police departments as part of a program that rids the military of surplus equipment. ""It's not most chiefs' first choice, but they're free,"" said Bueermann, who testified before the Senate in 2014 about the military's surplus program. ""They're not really perfect for police work. Departments get them because they can't afford the hundreds of thousands for a Bearcat."" They also end up spending a lot to adapt them for police work, and to maintain them, said James Stewart, a former director of the National Institute of Justice. Both Stewart and Bueermann said in most places, armored trucks and SWAT teams should be shared among several police departments, instead of each town having its own military-style force. ""If you go to a small town and you have this gigantic thing, you'll find it's expensive just to maintain the tires. They dry out and crack, even when they're not in use"" said Stewart who now directs public safety research for CNA Corporation, an Arlington, Va.-based nonprofit security research firm that advises military and government agencies. ""You find it's a false economy to accept the military's sort of cast off equipment."" Bueermann said that ""false economy"" is what can cause police departments to overuse their armored equipment, leading to scenarios like the one seen in Ferguson, where SWAT teams road atop Bearcats, pointing their guns at protesters. ""You have an armored vehicle or SWAT, and you don't get a lot of use, you're going to get creative in how you use it, because your boss is going to ask why you're spending $80,000 a year,"" Bueermann said. In the day after the San Bernardino attack, police officials as far away from California as Michigan and Virginia highlighted the use of armored vehicles, and criticized the president's executive order limiting their access by police. But Bueermann said the order was ""attempting to strike a balance between the needs of police and the uproar that was coming out of communities."" Among the order's mandates is that police departments have to first receive approval from local legislative bodies, before they can acquire military vehicles. ""If you can't explain to your community why you need a bearcat then you have a problem,"" Bueermann said.

""This tragedy will not paralyze us or keep us from going forward and growing together as a community,"" San Bernardino Mayor R. Carey Davis vowed, the San Bernardino County Sun reported. A tweet indicated that several thousand people were in attendance. Several thousand at Manuel stadium for #sanbernardino vigil. Cold, sombre night. pic.twitter.com/Sq2zxomhfK  Original Story: More than 24 hours after Syed Farook, 28, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, 27, opened fire in a government facility in San Bernardino, California, authorities were still struggling to figure out what drove the couple to kill 14 people and injure 21 others. Farook, a Muslim, was reportedly radicalized and in touch with people being investigated by the FBI for links to terrorism, law enforcement officials said Thursday. But beyond that, few clues emerged to offer a possible reason for the slayings. No sprawling manifestos had been found and no real explanations had surfaced -- either in the dark corners of the Web or in handwritten notes. The couple had led seemingly normal lives with their new baby daughter before shocking the public and their own close relatives with their bloody act of violence. The shooters were killed in a gunbattle with law enforcement officers hours after the massacre. Ever since Farook was named as a suspect, murky details about his life have emerged from the depths of online dating sites and public records, painting a blurred portrait of a man born to Pakistani immigrant parents -- Rafia and Syed Farook -- in Illinois. Farook had signed up for online dating sites when he was 22 and 23 years old, the New York Times reported: one aimed at people in the United Arab Emirates and another for Indian singles. Advertising his family as “religious but modern,” he described himself as a health safety inspector who came from a Sunni Muslim family. County documents indicated that Farook might have had an unstable home life growing up; his parents filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 2002 and his mother submitted paperwork for a separation four years later, citing verbal and physical harassment and describing her husband as “irresponsible, negligent and an alcoholic.” Police officers conduct a manhunt after a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, Dec. 2, 2015. Photo: Reuters Farook went on to graduate from a branch of California State University with a degree in environmental health in 2009, the Washington Post reported. He reportedly worked for the San Bernardino Public Health Department -- where he was employed for five years -- as an environmental health specialist conducing inspections of restaurants and swimming pools. His total compensation in 2013 was listed at $71,230. Farook met his wife, Malik, on dating website, according to Farook’s brother-in-law, who said that Farook had traveled to Saudi Arabia -- where Malik was living -- twice, once to meet her family and again to marry her. Malik, who was born in Pakistan but lived in Saudi Arabia before meeting Farook, came to the United States in July 2014 on a “financee visa” and later became a lawful permanent resident. The couple had been married two years and had one daughter. An online baby registry indicated the baby’s due date had been May 17 of this year. The morning of the rampage, Malik reportedly dropped off their daughter at Farook’s mother's house, telling her they had to keep a doctor’s appointment. The rampage Wednesday occurred at the Inland Regional Center, a facility described as providing services for people with developmental and physical disabilities. Earlier Wednesday Farook had attended a holiday party at the center for the San Bernardino Public Health Department, and at some point had reportedly stormed out of the party angrily, returning later with his wife. The pair was sporting tactical gear and carrying assault rifles, a detail investigators are considering during their search for a motive. Some analysts speculated that the attack may have been a rare ""hybrid"" event, where a workplace provocation and political radicalization fed each other.

Police found hundreds of rounds of ammunition in the SUV and 12 pipe bombs at their apartment. “I have no idea why would he do that,” said Farook’s brother-in-law, Farhan Khan, at a news conference, CNN reported. “I have absolutely no idea. I am in shock myself.”"

Fourteen people were killed Wednesday in the deadliest U.S. mass shooting since the Sandy Hook Elementary attack three years ago. Nearly two dozen others were wounded in what authorities say was a military-style assault plotted by a couple who potentially could have been influenced by domestic and foreign terrorist sympathizers.
During a search of the couple's home in nearby Redlands Thursday, federal authorities found a stockpile of pipe bombs and thousands of rounds of ammunition, The Washington Post reported.

          / CBS News NEW YORK -- Parents all over America are struggling with what to tell their children about the steady stream of violence many feel powerless to stop. One such parent is Sharon Marcus, a mother who is worried about how to talk to her 6-and-7-year-old daughters about yet another mass shooting. ""I always want to be that person that says the right thing. My girls look up to me, and they value what I say, and so imagine, I'm put in this position of having to always know the right thing to say, and it's so much pressure. But I just try to do my best,"" said Marcus. In the last month alone, more than a hundred have been killed in places most consider safe -- at a concert, a café, and an office holiday party. In November, we watched a father in Paris try to calm his young son's fears about bad guys with guns by telling him about the goodness of flowers. But many parents are struggling to explain this emerging new reality to their children. ""I think it's perfectly normal to want to shield our kids from grief and from pain. While counterintuitive, I think it's very important that parents take the lead in breaking the news when something bad happens to their kids,"" said child psychiatrist Harold Koplewicz. Parents need to remember that their children will hear more than what their parents tell them. Koplewicz advises that parents should explain to their kids that they are save and love and that violent events are rare. Safety plans should be calmly reviewed. Parents Sharon and David Marcus take the approach of emphasizing the good to their daughters. ""I can't stop living, and I can't stop enjoying my life, and I have to give them a childhood where they can go to the park and not be worried about anything. You know, we stay smart, but we have to go on and live,"" said Sharon. ""Do you feel better now?"" David asked. ""Yes,"" their daughters replied.

http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/breakingnews/~3/1vD4scZkSpk/ct-san-bernardino-mass-shooting-suspects-20151203-story.html,"SAN BERNARDINO, CALIF. — California gunman Syed Rizwan Farook had been in contact with known Islamic extremists on social media, a U.S. intelligence official said Thursday, and police said he and his wife had enough bullets and bombs to slaughter hundreds when they launched their deadly attack on a holiday party in San Bernardino, Calif. The details emerged as investigators tried to determine whether the rampage that left 14 people dead was terrorism, a workplace grudge or some combination. The husband-and-wife killers were not under FBI scrutiny before the massacre, said a second U.S. official, who likewise was not authorized to discuss the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity. Stories of those who died in the mass shooting in California Wearing black tactical gear and wielding assault rifles, Farook, a 28-year-old county restaurant inspector, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, 27, sprayed as many as 75 rounds into a room at a social service center for the disabled, where about 75 of Farook's co-workers had gathered Wednesday morning. Farook had attended the event but slipped out and returned in battle dress. Four hours later and two miles away, the couple died in a furious gunbattle in which they fired 76 rounds, while 23 law officers unleashed about 380, police said. On Thursday, Police Chief Jarrod Burguan offered a grim inventory that suggested Wednesday's bloodbath could have been far worse. At a family home in the nearby town of Redlands, they had 12 pipe bombs, tools for making more, and over 3,000 additional rounds of ammunition, the chief said. Obama looks to use executive power to close gun loophole ""We don't know if this was workplace rage or something larger or a combination of both,"" Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in Washington, echoing President Barack Obama. ""We don't know the motivation."" Investigators are trying to determine whether Farook, who was Muslim, became radicalized — and, if so, how — as well as whether he was in contact with any foreign terrorist organization, said the U.S. intelligence official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The same official said Farook had been in touch on social media with extremists who were under FBI scrutiny. The second U.S. official said the FBI was treating the attack as a potential act of terror but had reached no conclusion that it was. The official said Farook had communication with individuals who were under FBI scrutiny. But the contact was with ""people who weren't significant players on our radar,"" dated back some time, and there was no immediate indication of a surge in communication before the shooting. The official cautioned that such contact by itself doesn't mean someone is a terrorist. Rita Katz, director of SITE Intelligence Group, an organization that tracks and analyzes extremists, said it hasn't found any connection between Farook and jihadi groups. But she also said that some of Farook's social media posts seem to have been deleted before the attack. For victim's boyfriend, 22 hours of conflicting reports, then heartbreak Wednesday's rampage was the nation's deadliest mass shooting since 2012, when 26 children and adults were slain in Newtown, Connecticut. In San Bernardino, a Southern California city of 214,000, the victims ranged in age from 26 to 60. A further 21 people were injured, including two police officers, authorities said. Two of the wounded remained in critical condition Thursday. Nearly all the dead and wounded were county employees. Authorities said the attack was carefully planned. ""There was obviously a mission here. We know that. We do not know why. We don't know if this was the intended target or if there was something that triggered him to do this immediately,"" David Bowdich, assistant director of the FBI's Los Angeles office, said as the bureau took over the investigation. Farook has no known criminal record, Burguan said. He was born in Chicago to a Pakistani family, raised in Southern California and worked at San Bernardino County's Department of Public Health for two stints totaling four years since 2010, according to authorities and acquaintances. The Saudi Embassy said he traveled to Saudi Arabia in the summer of 2014 for nine days. As for Malik, she came to the U.S. in July 2014 on a Pakistani passport and a fiancée visa, authorities said. To get the visa, immigrants submit to an interview and biometric and background checks — screening intended to identify anyone who might pose a threat. They were married on Aug. 16, 2014, in nearby Riverside County, according to their marriage license. Both listed their religion as Muslim. Thoughts and prayers: Politics of grief and gun control after latest shooting The couple had a 6-month-old daughter who they dropped with relatives Wednesday morning before the shooting. Adam Lankford, a criminal justice professor at the University of Alabama, said his review of mass public shootings in the U.S. indicates this is the first one in recent history involving a male-female team. Farook was a devout Muslim who prayed every day and recently memorized the Quran, according to brothers Nizaam and Rahemaan Ali, who attended Dar Al Uloom Al Islamiyah mosque in San Bernardino with Farook. Rahemaan Ali said he last saw Farook three weeks ago, when he abruptly stopped going to the mosque. Ali said Farook seemed happy and his usual self, and the brothers never saw a violent side. ""He never ever talked about killing people or discussed politics, or said that he had problems at work,"" Rahemaan Ali said. ""He always had a smile on his face."" Federal authorities said Farook legally bought two handguns used in the massacre and their two assault rifles were legally bought by someone else. Authorities did not say how the rifles got into the attackers' hands. Farook apparently was no stranger to guns. A profile on a matchmaking website for South Asians that matched Farook's name, California hometown, county health job and Muslim faith said his interests included target shooting in his backyard. Though the date of the posting was not clear, it listed his age as 22 so it could have been six years old. The maps and numbers to help you understand what happened in San Bernardino Two weeks ago, Farook and one of the co-workers he killed, 52-year-old Nicholas Thalasinos, had a heated conversation about Islam, according to Kuuleme Stephens, a friend of the victim. Stephens said she happened to call Thalasinos while he was talking with Farook at work. She said Thalasinos told her Farook ""doesn't agree that Islam is not a peaceful religion."" As for workplace conflicts, co-worker Patrick Baccari said that until the rampage, Farook showed no signs of unusual behavior and was a reserved young man. Baccari said he was sitting at the same table as Farook before Farook suddenly disappeared, leaving his coat on his chair. Baccari was in the bathroom when the shooting started; he suffered minor wounds from shrapnel slicing through the wall. One of the first officers to reach the room said the carnage was ""unspeakable"" and the scene overwhelming — the smell of gunpowder, the wails of the injured, the blood, fire sprinklers pumping and fire alarms blaring. All in a room with a Christmas tree and decorations on every table. ""As we entered,"" said San Bernardino Police Lt. Mike Madden, ""the situation was surreal.""

(Josie Lepe/ Bay Area News Group)  San Jose Police closed off entrance off Bascom Ave, at  Valley Medical Center, which was on lockdown due to a gun sighting at hospital in San Jose, Calif.,  on Thursday, Dec. 03, 2015. (Josie Lepe/ Bay Area News Group)  SAN JOSE — Patients, staff and visitors at Valley Medical Center got a scare Thursday afternoon after someone saw a man with a gun, spurring a full-scale lockdown and floor-by-floor search of the hospital, authorities said. To the relief of many at the facility, the potential threat literally walked out of the building not long after being seen, and police are looking for him. Still, in the spirit of due diligence, deputies with the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office scoured the hospital to clear it of any threats. “They were making sure our patients, visitors and staff were totally safe,” VMC spokeswoman Joy Alexiou said. The gun call was especially resonant at VMC in light of a mass shooting Wednesday at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino that left 14 dead and at least 21 wounded. The center is a nonprofit dedicated to serving the developmentally disabled. “As a public-health organization, it hits close to home,” Alexiou said. “People are more sensitized to events, hence the heightened reaction.” She added that VMC has long preached an “if you see something, say something” ethos among its staff, noting that “those are the instructions of the times we live in now.” Sheriff’s Sgt. James Jensen said the events of San Bernardino did not influence, but rather reinforced, the tack that the Sheriff’s Office took Thursday. “This would be our normal response any time we get a call about a gun at a hospital,” Jensen said, “to ensure the safety of the patients, the hospital workers, and the citizens of Santa Clara County.” The sighting was reported after 1 p.m. at the medical campus on Bascom Avenue. Initial reports were that someone spotted a man with a holstered gun. “The gun was never out, or threatening,” Alexiou said. Authorities from both the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office and San Jose police responded to the call, Jensen said, adding that deputies reviewed surveillance video to track the man’s movements and determined he left the hospital grounds around 1:30 p.m. Jensen said San Jose police have a lead about the man’s identity and will continue the search for him. Jensen said the surveillance video confirmed that at no point was the man seen holding the gun in his hand. Even after concluding that the man had left the premises, Jensen said deputies searched the hospital “as a precautionary measure,” during which patients and staff were told to stay inside their respective rooms and stations. By 3 p.m., emergency room traffic and access had resumed. The search was completed around 3:30 p.m. Contact Robert Salonga at 408-920-5002. Follow him at Twitter.com/robertsalonga.

http://www.startribune.com/opinion/editorials/360510111.html,"Once again the nation is grieving over a mass shooting that has taken 14 lives, leaving loved ones to wonder what contemptible mind conceives a plan to slaughter county health workers gathered for a holiday party. The roll call of mass shootings lately has been numbing, but there are elements that set the one in San Bernardino, Calif., apart. First, the obvious: Early reports on the perpetrators embody the deepest fears of a nation engaged in a yearslong conflict with terrorists. Syed Rizwan Farook did not slip into this country undetected. He was born here, raised in Southern California and educated in American schools. And yet, early indications show he became radicalized. FBI officials already have found evidence that he had contact with Islamist extremists in the U.S. and while traveling in the Middle East. There is no evidence that the .223-caliber assault-style rifles and semiautomatic handguns Farook used were stolen or bought on the sly. Two of the weapons, in fact, have been traced by federal officials and found to have been purchased legally. Undetonated pipe bombs were found at the site, and at Farook’s home, a makeshift weapons lab with a dozen more pipe bombs and 3,000 rounds of ammunition. Farook was no disaffected drifter: He had a steady, well-paying job with the county that he’d held for five years and a six-month-old baby with Tashfeen Malik, who left Pakistan and entered the U.S. on a “fiancée visa” to become his bride and who helped him carry out a targeted, military-style assault on co-workers. As the U.S. deals with a growing Muslim population in its midst, it bears repeating that as a group they are overwhelmingly peaceful and law-abiding and that many have developed a passionate love for their adopted country. In the days to come, Americans must do their best to shut out the Islamophobic invective and hatred of those who would use this trauma for their own objectives. However, they also must be courageous enough to deal with the new reality of the widening conflict with Islamic extremists. Efforts to reach out to disaffected youth and to build community ties are vital and should continue. But such efforts are not a foolproof safeguard against the desire some harbor to destroy this country from within. As details continue to unfold, the nation should be cautious, reasoned, but unflinching in its determination to protect law-abiding citizens — of all creeds. © 2021 StarTribune. All rights reserved."

After the San Bernardino shooting on Wednesday, 14 people were killed and at least 17 were injured, but that doesn't matter to one group. The Westboro Baptist Church has announced that they do indeed plan on picketing the funerals of the victims. On Wednesday, Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik, a married couple, walked into the Inland Regional Center and opened fire. After killing 14 and injuring many more, they escaped in a black SUV before being tracked down by police and killed in a shootout. There has not been much news on the victims as of yet, let alone plans for funerals. To the Westboro Baptist Church though, that doesn't matter, and they really don't care as they already are planning on picketing the funerals anyway.  — Westboro Baptist (@WBCSaysRepent) December 3, 2015  — Westboro Baptist (@WBCSaysRepent) December 3, 2015  Abortion has also been blamed a number of times throughout the tweets and used as the reason for the mass shooting. According to NBC News, all of the 14 victims have not yet had a lot of their personal info publicly revealed, but their names are all known.   One of them was 37-year-old Raymond Wetzel, a father of six. He supervised a team of health inspectors in the county Environmental Health Services division.

http://hotair.com/archives/2015/12/03/in-god-we-trust/,"This morning the New York Daily News printed an extremely controversial cover which read in bold block letters, “God Isn’t Fixing This,” in regard to the horrific mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. Interesting that during a time of tragedy when people come together through prayer and offer prayer as a comfort to the victims and families a publication would resort to deeming them as “meaningless platitudes.” While the Daily News only chose to profile Republicans who offered their thoughts and prayers to the victims of the San Bernardino shooting it would be wise to remember that prayer unites us and doesn’t divide us.  Prayer isn’t a partisan thing, in fact prayer has no denomination and no political affiliation. Now is the time where it would be important to note that our currency still has printed on it, “In God We Trust.”  Our nation’s history is rich and is deeply rooted in a faith in a higher power, recognizing our human limitations.  Secretary of the Treasury, Salmon P. Chase instructed the Director of the Mint to prepare a motto for our currency back in 1861 that read: “Dear Sir: No nation can be strong except in the strength of God, or safe except in His defense. The trust of our people in God should be declared on our national coins. You will cause a device to be prepared without unnecessary delay with a motto expressing in the fewest and tersest words possible this national recognition.” Congress passed the Act in 1864 and it was then that the first coins were inscribed with the words “In God We Trust.” In fact, a law passed by the 84th Congress and approved by the President in 1956, declared “In God We Trust” as the national motto of the United States. Clearly, our government has no issue putting its trust in a higher power and supreme being so why should we shame policymakers who offer comfort through prayer during a tragedy?  Our nation is rooted in the fact that no nation can be strong except in the strength of God.  Isn’t it only natural that we as humans turn to God, the one whom we trust, during a time of shock and despair? Think back to the minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years after the September 11th terrorist attacks, the American people turned to prayer in their darkest hours.  Prayer truly comforted and united Americans when there was little hope and so much sadness. The Daily News isn’t trying to stop prayer, but they’re trying to politicize a terrible tragedy and pointing fingers at Republican lawmakers who they view as a hindrance to a gun control agenda.  For the record, California has some of the strictest gun laws on the books and it still isn’t enough to prevent these horrible and heinous attacks.  The point is, the motive of this crime has yet to be reported by the law enforcement officials who are conducting a full and thorough investigation, yet within minutes this tragedy was highly politicized. However, calling for stricter gun control laws just doesn’t seem sensible when combating true evil.  Why should we render ourselves defenseless when lives could be saved?  Mass shootings and acts of terrorism are pure evil and the intent is to kill–we need to call it for what it is. Restrictions on everyday law abiding citizens do absolutely nothing to prevent evil people who will stop at nothing to carry out their attacks.  In order to combat evil, we need to as a society believe in the greater good, no matter what your faith.  We need to comfort one another in times of tragedy but remain vigilant, prepared, and ready to not let evil prevail. It is imperative that our nation doesn’t forget in whom we place our trust, especially in times of great tragedy.  We should never stop praying or offering prayers to those who are in dire need of comfort and strength when it seems as though all is lost.  The last thing our country needs is more division in a time where we should all come together to lift up, love, and protect our fellow man.

http://www.cleveland.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/12/senate_votes_to_unravel_health.html,"Mitch McConnell Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., walks from the chamber as Republicans pushed legislation toward Senate approval that would demolish President Barack Obama's signature health care law and halt Planned Parenthood's federal money, setting up a veto fight the GOP knows it will lose, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Dec. 3, 2015.(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) (J. Scott Applewhite) WASHINGTON (AP) -- Openly welcoming a preordained veto, Republicans drove legislation to Senate passage Thursday aimed at crippling two of their favorite targets: President Barack Obama's health care law and Planned Parenthood. With a House rubber stamp expected in days, the bill would be the first to reach Obama's desk demolishing his 2010 health care overhaul, one of his proudest domestic achievements, and halting federal payments to Planned Parenthood. Congress has voted dozens of times to repeal or weaken the health law and several times against Planned Parenthood's funding, but until now Democrats thwarted Republicans from shipping the legislation to the White House. Thursday's vote was a near party-line 52-47. Republicans said an Obama veto -- which the White House has promised -- will underscore that a GOP triumph in next year's presidential and congressional elections would mean repeal of a statute they blame for surging medical costs and insurers abandoning some markets. They lack the two-thirds House and Senate majorities needed to override vetoes, assuring that the bill's chief purpose will be for campaign talking points. ""President Obama will have a choice,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. ""He can defend a status quo that's failed the middle class by vetoing the bill, or he can work toward a new beginning and better care by signing it."" Republicans blame the bill for surging health care costs and insurers abandoning some markets. Government officials said this week that health care spending grew at 5.3 percent in 2014, the steepest climb since Obama took office. Democrats noted that under the law, millions of people have become insured and said their coverage has improved, with policies now required to insure a wide range of medical services. ""Do they talk to their constituents? Do they meet with them?"" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said of Republicans. With just a 54-46 edge, Republicans had until now been unable to push such legislation through the Senate. This time, they used a special budget procedure that prevents filibusters -- delays that take 60 votes to halt -- and lets them prevail with 51 votes. Party leaders initially encountered objections from some more moderate Republicans leery of cutting Planned Parenthood's funds and from presidential contenders, Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, who threatened to oppose the measure if it wasn't strong enough. In the end, Cruz and Rubio voted ""yes."" Moderate GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Mark Kirk of Illinois voted no, the only lawmakers to cross party lines, while Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., did not vote. The Senate bill would all but erase the health care overhaul by dismantling some of its key pillars, such as requirements that most people obtain coverage and larger employers offer it to workers. Also eliminated would be its expansion of Medicaid coverage to additional lower-income people and the government's subsidies for many who buy policies on newly created insurance marketplaces, such as HealthCare.gov. And it would end taxes the law imposed to cover its costs, including levies on higher-income people, expensive insurance policies, medical devices and indoor tanning salons. The bill would also terminate the roughly $450 million yearly in federal dollars that go to Planned Parenthood, about a third of its budget. Federal funds can be used for abortions only in rare cases. A perennial target of conservatives, the group has been under intensified GOP pressure this year for its role in providing fetal tissue to scientists. Citing secretly recorded videos of Planned Parenthood officials discussing such sales, some abortion foes have accused the organization of illegally providing the tissue for profit. The group says the videos were deceptively doctored and say it's done nothing illegal. As they worked through the bill, senators voted on over a dozen amendments -- all symbolic, since the measure was destined to never become law. Senators rejected a pair of similar amendments that would have restored the Planned Parenthood money. They also blocked proposals for tightening gun curbs, a response to Wednesday's mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, last week's fatal attack on a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado and last month's terrorist massacre in Paris. On another, senators voted 90-10 to permanently repeal taxes on high-priced ""Cadillac"" insurance policies, sending a strong signal of growing congressional momentum for erasing that levy. GOP lawmakers said the overall bill could serve as a bridge to a future Republican health care law. Though Obama's overhaul was enacted five years ago, GOP members of Congress have yet to produce a detailed proposal to replace it. ""They've never been in a position where they want to change it and fix the law, it's either repeal or nothing,"" Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., who heads the Senate Democratic campaign committee, said of the GOP's failure to propose an alternative health law. ""I'll take that to the polls and we'll talk about it until the cows come home."" Republicans argued the voters were on their side. ""We've reached a pretty scary time in our nation's history where we have Americans writing and calling their elected representatives saying they need relief from their own government,"" said No. 2 Senate Leader John Cornyn of Texas. ""We have a mandate, I believe, to repeal this terrible law."" Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.

Given the nonstop, 24-hour cable and Internet-driven media coverage of rampage murders, it is no wonder most Americans believe gun violence is out of control. But that is not at all true. Overall violent crime is way down from the 1990s and gun violence has been cut in half. So-called ""assault rifles"" account for a fraction (although a hefty number) of guns owned by citizens, not to mention the small number of murders. The vast majority of gun murders in the U.S. are with handguns, most of which are semi-automatic pistols. Banning sales of high-capacity rifle or handgun magazines will do nothing. If we did ban high-capacity magazines, I would imagine many law-abiding citizens would comply, but many would not; certainly criminals and nutcases would keep theirs. Since no reduction in overall gun violence would occur as a result, the next step would be to remove all guns from people's homes. Some are now calling for an Australian-style mandatory gun buyback program. I think this would fit most people's definition of ""confiscation."" Moreover, Australian taxpayers paid to get more than 650,000 guns out of the hands of previously legal owners. We have more than 300 million guns here. Clearly, the United States is not Australia. In fact, the job of knocking on people's doors asking for their guns might quickly become the most dangerous occupation in America. — Nick Sloane, Glendale Heights CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"

Some of his online posts compared Muslims to Nazis. His last post described a message from a Facebook member called “Med Ali Zarouk,” who wrote, “you will never sucsseed (sic) to make a country for jews… soon you’ll get your a– kicked, you will die and never see Israel as country believe me never.” On September 11, 2013, he posted, “On behalf of this guy… You can stick your Million Muslim March up your asses,” next to a photo of a shirtless victim plummeting from the burning World Trade Center in 2001. After the massacre, one person posted on Thalasinos’s Facebook page, “Nick was very courageous and spoke the truth. It is my honest belief that Nicholas was murdered because of his alliance with Israel and Jewish people.” Fellow San Bernardino County worker Vincent Armijo said Thalasinos was conservative and open about his views but was not aggressive about confronting others with them. That humility was evident in his Twitter name: @LeastServant. Those who knew Thalasinos called him “wonderful and compassionate,” according to USA Today.

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/126439095/0/usatodaycomnation-topstories~NJ-Assembly-fails-to-override-Christies-gun-veto/,"TRENTON, N.J. — A day after 14 people were killed in a mass shooting in California, lawmakers failed to override Gov. Chris Christie's veto of a gun-control bill by just three votes Thursday. The Assembly is likely to try again in two weeks. The Assembly voted 74-0 in June for the bill, S2360, which would require notifications to local police if a person who had once been involuntarily committed for psychiatric care wants a judge to erase those records so he or she can buy a gun. Christie rejected it, turning it into a much broader proposal about mental health reforms. Enacting the law without Christie’s approval would require 54 votes in the Assembly, but it wound up being supporting by 51 lawmakers Thursday. The vote was not recorded, meaning that the bill wasn’t officially defeated and can be brought back up at a future session. The Assembly has two more voting sessions before the legislative session ends: Dec. 17 and Jan. 11. ""Those who are here to do the right thing will get more chances to prove it,"" said Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto, D-Hudson. USA TODAY Olivia Nalos Opre: Why we hunt, even lions The Senate similarly failed in September in its first effort to override Christie’s veto, then succeeded in a second attempt in October. Wednesday's mass shooting in California was referenced repeatedly throughout the debate, though there's no indication that the shooters would have been prevented from obtaining their guns and ammunition if a mental-health expungement application had gone differently there. ""I didn't come here for a moment of silence. I came here for a moment of action,"" said Assemblyman Reed Gusciora, D-Mercer. ""And I think that we owe it to the 14 people that were killed yesterday, that we owe them a moment of action."" ""This bill has nothing to do with that situation,"" said Assemblyman Christopher Brown, R-Burlington. ""What happened there and what's happening in Paris and what's happening in the Middle East — we're at war. And we all have to recognize we are at war. They're not victims, they're casualties. This bill deals with mental illness."" There are 47 Democrats in the Assembly, and all of them voted for the override Thursday. Four of the 32 Republicans also voted for the override. USA TODAY Porch shooting defendant grilled by prosecutors Seventeen Republicans voted against overriding Christie's veto and 11 voted to abstain. Rumana contended that the original bill contains a significant flaw that would be fixed if lawmakers agreed to Christie's conditional veto. He said people with a history of mental health issues could have that expunged from the records without the expanded notification to law enforcement so long as they weren't seeking a gun permit at the time. They could then wait and get a gun permit later, he said. ""There is a loophole as big as a Mack truck in the bill,"" Rumana said. He suggested Democrats pushed for the override vote despite that flaw because they're interested in hurting Christie politically as he runs for president: ""This is not about getting a notch on your belt to override the governor's veto,"" Rumana said. ""This is certainly not the bill to do that on. This is a serious issue."" Democrats said the loophole Rumana cited doesn't exist. Assemblyman Joseph Lagana, D-Bergen, said applicants for New Jersey gun permits must disclose to law-enforcement agencies whether they've had mental health records expunged. Assembly Majority Leader Louis Greenwald, D-Camden, called the strategy that Rumana described ""mental gymnastics."" ""The question you have to ask yourself is: If one person, just one person, did not get access to a gun, (and that) would have saved the lives of innocent people, is it worth you standing by the vote that you cast in June?"" Greenwald said. ""These incidents that have occurred around the country have spurred people to buy more guns,"" said Assemblyman Ralph Caputo, D-Essex. ""Forgetting the politics of the situation, just think about the average person that you know that's talked to you that has never owned a gun before in their entire life now seeking to own a gun. When that person seeks to own that gun, they have to go through this process. And the fact that their medical records will be revealed at an early stage in the process will help slow down the purchase of these firearms. We don't need more guns in the system."" Republicans repeatedly, unsuccessfully, called for the Legislature to instead consider adopting the mental health reforms outlined in Christie's veto. AZCENTRAL Expert: Mental health of man accused in PV murders diminishing Those reforms, which were identical to ones Christie proposed last year in vetoing a bill that sought to reduce the maximum size of gun magazines, would require people who have been involuntarily committed to mental health treatment to demonstrate to a judge adequate medical evidence of suitability to obtain a firearms purchaser identification card, such as a certificate from a medical doctor or psychiatrist. He also called for a new standard for involuntary commitment to a treatment program and new training for first responders for deescalating a situation, among other changes. ""In order for this bill to have an effect, you have to be crazy enough to go for expungement and tell the court, 'I'm a little bit crazy, but I want a gun, so help me expunge my record.' If you're that crazy, you're not going to get expungement in the first place,"" said Assemblyman Declan O'Scanlon, R-Monmouth. ""We don't need this bill. Those people are already stopped from getting guns."" Under terms of a state law Christie signed in 2013, New Jersey is required to provide mental health records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, in compliance with federal laws passed in 1993 and 2007. It has transmitted 425,000 records of mental health adjudications dating back to the 1970s. Would-be gun buyers who were formerly committed to a mental institution but have since recovered may be ineligible to legally buy a firearm because of the mental health records, but a judge can direct the record to be expunged from NICS if he or she finds that the applicant isn’t likely to act in a dangerous manner. Another gun-related measure will be back before lawmakers next Monday, when the state Senate is scheduled to vote on a bill, S3249, requiring gun retailers to sell “smart guns” that are personalized using biometric technology so that they can only be fired by authorized and recognized users. That bill would alter a 2002 law that was designed to phase out the sale of guns in New Jersey that aren’t smart guns. Instead it has seemingly slowed the introduction of the personalized gun technology, in order to ensure traditional guns remain on the market. Follow Michael Symons on Twitter: @MichaelSymons_"

Special Correspondent The San Bernardino mass shooting was neither the biggest nor the most sophisticated terrorist attack on our shores, but it had to be the most disturbing. If Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik planned the horror on their own—and quite likely they did—they were about to prove themselves as diabolical and sociopathic as ISIS at its worst when they dropped off their 6-month-old daughter with Farook’s mother on Wednesday morning. The Southern California couple then drove to a holiday party being held by Farook’s fellow San Bernardino County health workers in a rented hall at a center for the disabled. Malik seems to have waited outside as Farook joined the festivities just as he had the previous year’s holiday party in the same hall. These same colleagues had thrown him a baby shower only a few months before, and they had more recently welcomed him back from paternity leave. Farook sat for a few minutes. Some 80 other colleagues had arrived. There was a Christmas tree. All the tables were decorated. The luncheon was about to begin when he abruptly left the hall, puzzling an office cubicle mate. Farook reappeared about a half-hour later with the Pakistani woman he had originally met through an online Muslim matrimonial site he joined in August 2013. He had subsequently married her at the Black Stone in the center of the Grand Mosque in Mecca. He settled with her back home in San Bernardino County, and there had been a nice wedding party at the local Islamic center. More than one person would speak of them as having lived the American dream on a good salary in a comfy apartment. That all turned to an absolute nightmare as the couple materialized in the hall’s entrance, both clad in black tactical outfits, both holding .223 caliber assault rifles. They proceeded to fire between 65 and 75 rounds into the holiday crowd of people who had on another day helped celebrate their child’s impending arrival into the world. After killing 14 and wounding 19, the couple withdrew to what would initially be described only as a dark-colored SUV and drove away with a lack of haste that surprised one witness. They left behind an explosive device that Farook might well have used part of his paternity leave to construct, building a bomb when he was supposed to be forging a bond with his child. The detonator was reportedly fashioned with a remote-control toy, as suggested by al Qaeda’s online magazine, Inspire, and likely used in the Boston Marathon bombs. The toy that Farook and Malik had chosen for their particular bomb was a yellow sports car. In this instance, the plan was apparently not only to kill more of Farook’s co-workers but also any number of the cops who raced to the scene and dashed fearlessly into the hall. Fortunately, the device failed to go off. One police expert suggested that there might have been some kind of electronic interference or that the couple may have been too far away when they tried to detonate it. The more likely explanation is that the hall’s sprinkler system had been triggered, apparently by one of the couple’s bullets. The resulting deluge almost certainly surprised the killers. It also might have soaked the remote control electronics. Among the officers who otherwise might have been killed was Lt. Mike Madden, one of the first four to arrive. A lesson of the Columbine massacre was that the police need to go in right away to prevent anybody else from being hurt. Madden reasoned when he entered the conference center that he had arrived just moments after the shooting. “There was the smell of gunpowder in the air,” he would later say at a press conference. He saw people who were beyond saving. “Victims who were obviously deceased,” he later said. “Unspeakable carnage.” He saw the total panic in the faces of the living. He heard people who were in desperate need of aid. “The moans and cries,” he recalled. “It was very loud.” Water was spraying from the sprinklers overhead and fire alarms were sounding, and everywhere the eyes went they beheld what should have never been. “What you’re seeing, what you’re hearing, what you’re smelling,” Madden remembered. “Surreal.” Some 50 survivors were huddled on the far side of the room, too terrorized to budge when the officers called to them. “We had to tell them to come to us, come to us,” Madden would report. One of the survivors came, and then they all came. There was no way of knowing if the killers were still in the building. A cellphone video recorded a cop—apparently a San Bernardino sheriff’s deputy—escorting some of the survivors to safety. His words are worth remembering the next time somebody condemns the police in general. “Try to relax, everybody, try to relax,” he told them. “I’ll take a bullet before you do, that’s for damn sure.” Not on the video was a witness who reported something that one of the responding cops immediately put over the radio. The cop relayed that the witness had been sitting next to a fellow county worker who had been “acting a little weird” and then suddenly left the hall. “Thirty minutes later, the shooting happens,” the cop said. The cop gave the name provided by the witness. “Syed Farook.” Another cop radioed that a follow-up on the tip had begun with the basics. “That Syed guy’s name and date of birth…” A third cop recalled aloud that one of the detectives had been “working up that name for something last week.” “I’ll have to check,” he said. Somebody else reported that the LAPD may have made a recent inquiry about Farook. The San Bernardino police now quickly determined two possible residences for Farook and set up surveillance on both. One of the teams radioed a report concerning a vehicle that passed one of the addresses. “Soft going by location.” That meant slow, as if the driver were cautiously checking to see if the coast was clear. “Black SUV, Utah plates, late model, probably 2014, front windows not tinted,” the cops on the scene further reported. The police had by then determined that Farook had rented a black SUV such as had been reported leaving the killing scene, such as was now proceeding away from the residence. The police followed. The black SUV suddenly accelerated from soft to careening. “East at a high rate of speed,” a cop reported. “We are in pursuit of the suspect vehicle. We have shots fired out the back window.” The cops’ voices on the radio remained remarkable even as shots could be clearly heard in the background. “Multiple shots fired,” a cop reported. Also in the background were the sirens of ever more cops racing toward the most mortal danger. An officer was hit, apparently by a ricochet, but the wound was not serious. The danger remained. “We have the suspect vehicle stopped,” a cop announced. “We need a Bearcat!” A Bearcat being an armored car. Three responded, but the shooting was done. The occupants of the car had fired 76 rifle rounds at the police. A total of 23 officers had fired 380 rounds in response. “We have one down outside the car,” a cop reported “One down inside the car.” The SUV’s emergency lights were on and kept flashing. The windshield wipers periodically worked in the rainless afternoon. A body could be seen sprawled in the street, a rifle nearby. Another body was in the back. There was also a second rifle, along with two 9 mm handguns, 1,400 more rounds of .223 ammunition, and 200 rounds of 9 mm ammunition. Another 2,500 rifle rounds and 2,000 pistol rounds were discovered when police armed with a search warrant went through the house where the couple who seemed to be living the American dream had been concocting a nightmare. The couple had not been bent on suicide. They had done everything they could to get away after the killings, and there is no way of knowing what else they may have been plotting. There have been reports that they were in touch with Islamist extremists, and perhaps that is what prompted the LAPD to have taken an interest in Farook. Part of the reason for leaving the bomb in the conference center may have been the hope it would aid their escape. Police now found in their home a dozen more pipe bombs, which, like the one at the murder scene, were identical to those that al Qaeda’s magazine depicted, along with step–by-step instructions on “How to Build a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom.” Only, Malik was a mom. And Farook was a dad. The thought of their 6-month-old daughter brought cause for thanks that mom and dad did not collect her from grandma and have her in the car with them when they encountered the police. Along with Johnson’s Head-to-Toe Baby Wash and Pampers Swaddlers Diapers, the mom’s baby registry with Target (“Tashfeen’s Baby Registry”) lists an Evenflo Tribute Convertible Car Seat. That would suggest some awareness of child safety, but there seems next to no chance the couple would have refrained from firing at pursuing officers out of concern for their daughter. And the police who were being fired upon would have had no way of knowing there was a tiny child behind those tinted windows in the back. Nobody would have felt worse than the cops if the child had come to harm. The child survived, the absolutely innocent beginning and end to her mom and dad’s diabolical plot. Other plots have reminded us that we are at war. This one tells us that we are in a war like no other, a war in which a couple drops their baby with grandma, then goes to a holiday party to murder co-workers who not long ago threw them a baby shower. A shudder accompanies the question of whether the murdered included anybody who bought one of the items on Tashfeen’s Baby Registry. Updated 9:40 p.m. Dec. 4, 2015"

But that doesn’t mean he’s run out of opinions on Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, and more. Senior Writer 2015 was a big year for Marc Maron. He got President Barack Obama to come to his garage in Highland Park, Los Angeles for an hour-long podcast interview that prompted yet another national discussion on race. He traveled to 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City to confront Lorne Michaels about why he didn’t get a coveted SNL gig 20 years ago. And this Friday, December 4, his second major stand-up special in three years makes its debut on the Epix channel. Maron is known for being a particularly angry comic, but he has noticeably mellowed with recent success. For example, his new special includes an entire bit about how much he loves ice cream. His WTF podcast, which just aired its 660th episode this week, regularly tops the iTunes charts and has managed to turn his career around in a way that nothing else could. For the first time in recent years, fans are actually paying to see him perform live. Even if, as he has mentioned on the podcast numerous times, an outsized portion of them are slightly depressed loners who purchase single tickets. When The Daily Beast caught up with Maron as he was stuck in Los Angeles traffic this week, some of that signature anger shone through an otherwise pleasant disposition. As the GPS on his phone kept interrupting his train of thought, he exclaimed, “How the fuck do I turn that off?” and later, “I don’t know how the fuck to turn this down, man.” A previously announced TV interview series with VICE, to be titled VICE Portraits, recently fell through, but he has so much else going on right now, from his IFC show Maron, which recently ended its third season, to memorable appearances on such critical hits as Louie and Girls, that it doesn’t seem to phase him. “That’s not happening,” he explains. “I had a time window and they didn’t have a network and the time ran out.” Ultimately, it’s VICE’s loss. Below is the condensed and edited conversation, in which Maron discussed the state of his comedy, his frustration with our political system and how he really has achieved some form of inner peace, despite the occasional outburst. It can be a little bit intimidating interviewing someone who has conducted so many incredible interviews over the past several years. Have you been particularly nervous to interview any of your recent podcast guests? I get nervous all the time for different reasons, you know. Sometimes I don’t know what I’m going to talk to somebody about. I don’t know how it’s going to begin or I don’t know the bulk of how it’s going to go, because I don’t really lay it out. I’m just kind of flying by the seat of my pants in terms of, hopefully, having a conversation evolve. Then other times I’m nervous about doing justice to someone who has had a particularly long career, or maybe I’m just nervous because I’m intimidated by somebody’s work. I’m always nervous for one reason or another. Let’s move on to your new special. A lot of it is about how you either express or try to control your anger, yet I’ve noticed in some of your podcast intros, you seem a lot more content than you used to be. What is that balance like in your real, everyday life? Well, I have enough peace of mind now to make different choices around my anger. You know there are some things in my life now that have never been there. There’s a certain amount of self-esteem that comes from doing something that people enjoy or that seems relevant or having accomplished something. I’m earning a living, which is something I’ve experienced not doing for years sometimes, so that is another piece to a peace of mind puzzle. But then what you’re left with is the sort of core wiring that is provoked or that activates anger and some of that runs pretty deep. So, it really is about making choices and figuring out what that is and why those feelings come. And a lot of times, it’s really just what we’re used to on a very deep level. It’s what is actually comfortable with us, and that’s the tragedy of being anxious or neurotic or angry. It’s something that we’re wired with and it feels like home to us. So to overcome it, it’s very cognitive. You have be like, “That feeling’s happening. I want to fucking snap, but why don’t we just ride it out?” Keep it inside and maybe it will pass. Just practical tools. But a lot of it is still there, it’s just that I know better. And a lot of it’s not connected to anything, so I’m more careful with it. In the epilogue to the special, you talk about how you don’t want to ‘divide people’ with your comedy. Can you expand on that a little bit? Is that something you see in other stand-ups and try to avoid? Look, I’ve done political comedy, I’ve done very opinionated comedy, I’ve done comedy in my life that was in its nature offensive. And as I’ve gotten older and detached myself from politics and even from pop culture to a certain degree, I just find that I can share my experience of personal struggles, which are emotional, psychological, and experiential. That’s the most honest thing I can share. And I think in varying degrees, most people, or certainly the people that are going to connect with me, also experience those things. There are plenty of people who are going to go, “That guy’s a whiner, that guy is just angry, that guy doesn’t know what he’s talking about.” Fine. That’s always going to happen. I’m not trying to please everybody, but I am trying to be honest and true to my own self enough that people feel that they can relate to it. One of the great things that comedy can do is make people go, “Oh shit, I thought I was the only one who felt that.” Or, “I never thought of it that way.” Or, “I’m not alone.” Laughter that is connected to those three things is powerful stuff. And it’s very satisfying for me to experience that connection with people. That’s a more positive view of comedy than you maybe had when you started your career. No, I always felt that comedy could blow minds and offer people a certain point of view that may disarm things that are terrifying or overwhelming or incomprehensible. I always knew that it could do that. It’s just finding your own place within it. And in different points in my career I was more fueled by self-righteousness or anger or an assumption that I knew more than other people. I sort of wandered around the terrain of anger and enlightenment and political awareness and having an extreme point of view for effect. But you get older and certain things that used to seem so important kind of fade a bit and you’re sort of left with an existential reality that you deal with on a day-to-day basis. The more personal I can be, the less possibility there is of me crossing streams with somebody or talking about something within pop culture that everybody has a similar take on. I just listened to your interview with Gloria Steinem, and you asked her about the impact of political correctness on comedy. I’m curious to know where you stand on that issue these days. Comics like Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Maher have accused audiences of being too sensitive. Is that something you’ve experienced with your crowd? And does it affect what you decide to joke about at all? There is a timidity of younger people in terms of what they should or shouldn’t be sensitive to. There’s a self-censorship that’s based on a vague paranoia of not wanting to offend anybody. And I think sometimes that’s a little dangerous. But I think having a discussion about that is not unreasonable….If you’re saying things just to push a point, just to create a controversy, you know what you’re doing. If you say something that is a mistake or has hurt a community’s feelings, then it’s on you to either defend it or apologize for it. It’s really just about taking personal responsibility. I don’t really believe in censorship in any way, but I do believe it is appropriate to be sensitive. If you still want to say something that is hurtful and challenging and you have a reason for doing it, and if you can defend that reason, do it. Say whatever the fuck you want, that’s part of the beauty of the freedom that we have, but you may have to take responsibility for it, so be prepared for that too. But I do think there is a profound amount of hyper-sensitivity that might be detrimental to emotional growth, both culturally and otherwise. Can you talk a little bit about how the recent Lorne Michaels interview and how that came together? Why was it so important to you and what wisdom or closure do you think you gained from the conversation? I’ve been relatively obsessed with a meeting I had with Lorne Michaels in ‘95 for a long time, in terms of what really happened there and what I remember and you know, what my life would have been like had it gone differently. And I had a certain feeling about him that had become malignant in my mind over time. But to actually be able to sit down with him and talk to him about that meeting, which he seemed to remember, it certainly provided a certain amount of closure. And there was one beautiful moment in it that I thought was great and well played on his part. The part about his condescending — what I perceived as a condescending comment about what we were doing below 14th street not mattering. And in the interview, he said something to the extent of, “I was trying to help you. I was just trying save you some time.” [Laughs.] I thought that was very funny. But ultimately, I felt great and I liked him and I saw him as a person, with a job that he’s had for a long time. I saw him as a lifer, a TV lifer. Outside of the fact that he has a tremendous amount of power and a tremendous amount of money, he loves television and that’s his job. And to see him as a guy with a job, with a system and a world that he operates in, was very humanizing for me. So it definitely worked out in terms of me getting some closure, but also finding some respect in a way that I didn’t really have and have now. And then of course, slightly less monumental than Lorne, was the interview with President Obama. The media immediately seized on his use of the “n-word” as the only thing they wanted to talk about. Did you know when that moment happened that it would get so much attention? No, I’m not usually very good at that. My producer, Brendan McDonald, is very acutely aware of those things. I knew he said it. But I’m a comic and discussions about that word or being around people that use that word — primarily black people — I didn’t think like, “Oh my God!” But it was sort of jarring and it was powerful and I think that in saying it in the context that he did, to make a point about using that word in the context of racial progress was a powerful thing. The tabloid media is going to do what it’s going to do, but I think he had a context that was a service to the conversation. The distinction that was kind of lost in the media was that people were saying he “used” the n-word, when in reality he said it in a very specific context. So I think that was the kind of nuance that can be gained in long podcast interview that was completely lost when people picked out that one moment. Yeah, because people don’t take the time to process. They impulsively react and that seems to be enough for a lot of people. Because of that, was there anything in that interview that you think got lost or buried because that singular focus happened? I don’t know, I had nothing to do with that. I don’t know how many people listened — well I do know how many people downloaded it — I don’t know how many people processed that whole interview. It was downloaded, I think, close to three million times. And I got very little bad feedback from the left or the right. I got some people saying, “I don’t like him, but that was great.” Or I got some people saying, “I forgot how much I liked him.” Or I got some people saying, “I like him now.” But there was very little hate. I was prepared for people thinking it was some sort of soft interview, but I thought it was very nuanced. I sort of intentionally avoided policy, because I didn’t want to get lost. I wanted to stay connected to him. And he knew when he was getting in the weeds. You’re dealing with a guy who has a fairly articulated position on most things and I wanted to get around that as much as possible. But it was a necessity to deal with what happened in Charleston because it was literally two days after that. And there was no way we couldn’t talk about that and a couple of other things that were going to be breaking the following week. But outside of that, we were able to change gears and we were able to have a lot of candid and nuanced conversations about fear and the job of president and about his family. And also the tone of it was unlike anything we’d really heard before [from him]. You mentioned Charleston. And now we’ve had this latest mass shooting in San Bernardino, California yesterday. What do you make of the country’s seeming inability to deal with the gun problem in any way? Now that people are describing this latest incident as terrorism, do you think that will somehow spur more action? [Pauses.] Well, the fact that it remains a political problem is troubling. This is really about fear on behalf of Americans about being armed or not being armed. And I don’t really know how you resolve that other than putting more restrictions on gun ownership and more thorough background checks, and all the stuff that has been suggested by people who are rightfully opposed to how easy it is to get guns. When and if Americans have had enough of something, it’s very hard to say. It’s just a sad fact that there’s such a stalemate around progress on this issue. Whatever the agenda is of any person shooting innocent people, whether it’s impulsive or whether it’s planned, whether it’s based on mental illness or an ideological agenda, what these people think constitutes their freedom basically puts them and everybody else in so much fear that our freedom is actually compromised because we can’t make reasonable decisions around guns. Amy Schumer recently jumped into this issue after there was a shooting at a screening of Trainwreck. I know you’ve really left politics behind since your days at Air America. Do things happen in this country that make you want to start talking about politics again or are you happy to leave it behind? There are political issues that affect everybody. But how do you get everybody to access the feelings that are necessary to create an urgency around any political issue that is really based on human progress? It becomes very tricky. So if I can attach my personal experience to some sort of logic around political issues, I’ll do it. I just don’t want to be in the dialogue because that just becomes a ridiculous fight of punditry that doesn’t seem to go anywhere. A lot of people seem to find that as entertaining as watching sports and picking teams. At some point you would hope that if Americans have the desire to live with a quality of life that is tolerant and progressive in terms of being civilized, it would happen. I guess I romanticize the idea that I still believe most people are innately good. I think a lot of people are distracted and self-involved, and I may be one of those people, but I never feel that I want to get into the political dialogue again because I think you end up honoring a dialogue that may not be your own, just to service a political system that is corrupted in a lot of ways. But I think what’s going on certainly with regard to guns, gun violence, terrorists, lunatics, even police gun violence to some degree, is disturbing and it’s heinous and it’s frightening. And I hope that something gives, but it’s hard to be optimistic when something like [the San Bernardino shooting] happens. On a personal level, are there any 2016 candidates that you are excited about in either a positive or negative way? I don’t want a Republican. [Laughs] I love a lot of what Bernie [Sanders] has to say and he’s created a dialogue around certain issues that this country needs to hear in a practical way. I don’t know how many people are hearing it. I think it would be exciting to have a woman as president and Hillary [Clinton], I would be OK with that. Talking to Obama, it’s a very difficult job, most of the people that can do that job or are voted to do that job cannot really fulfill their vision. Most of them are paying a lot of lip service to things they know they can’t do in order to get to where they want to be. So there’s a lot of bullshit involved in all of it. Ultimately, I’d like the country to move in a direction where there’s less angry people and less poor people and a little more justice and a little more fairness and a little more access to basic human services for everybody. I want all those things. Unfortunately, it’s very slow going in, theoretically, the most advanced country in the world. So is it safe to say you don’t think Donald Trump is up to that task? Donald Trump’s a clown. He’s a very traditional, populist, American clown. And whatever he’s doing seems to be fragmenting and befuddling the entire Republican [party], so that’s fine. But I don’t see him as a serious candidate even if other people do. I think that if somebody like Donald Trump actually got into office, he would very quickly be emasculated and neutered by Congress, probably his own Congress. So, whatever, he’s a great American asshole and it’s making people excited. Probably the wrong people, but what are you going to do? What do you think explains that excitement? What is it about the American people that make them want someone like Trump? They’re angry! And many of them, this is not what they expected in their life and in their country. Some of them are nostalgic for an America that I don’t even think existed, ever. I think it was always just an idea, this idea that everything was OK for everybody. Whoever speaks to rage and relieves it somehow with their rhetoric will be popular in the hearts of excited, angry people who feel like they’ve been dealt a bad hand. Now that you’ve interviewed the president and Lorne Michaels, who looms large as a guest that you haven’t been able to get on the podcast yet that you would really like to talk to? There’s always people I want to talk to. I’m talking to William Friedkin on Saturday, I’m excited about that. I’d like to talk to Albert Brooks at some point. I just interviewed Todd Haynes, the director. There’s always people that I find interesting and that do things I’m interested in or can learn from. But for some reason I’m mildly obsessed with Albert Brooks and I don’t think that’s ever going to happen. I don’t think he wants to do it, it’s just not something he does. Leading up to the Lorne Michaels interview, you joked about it being the end of your podcast. Can you imagine a time when you would actually let it go? No, because it’s sort of the core of what I do: stand-up and the podcast. I see other things — my life on television in a fictional way [on IFC’s Maron]. Acting, I’m OK at it, I’d like to try a little more of that. But the podcast is something I have complete creative control over, as well as my comedy. And I like having that. I like having time, for however long it lasts, where people want to see me and want to listen to the podcast. So as long as that audience is out there, I’ll keep working...I do have fantasies of going entirely off the grid and just living peacefully, but a lot of people think that’s some sort of weird dream of mine that’s impossible. So, I don’t know, we’ll see."
http://www.ocregister.com/articles/gun-694753-hernandez-checks.html,"Trending:  Deborah Hernandez of Laguna Hills explains, ""We don't let some people skip a TSA screening at the airport. Why would we let some people buy a gun without a background check?"" She founded Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, Orange County Chapter, in 2013.  The Dade Family of San Juan Capistrano, from left, Eddy his two kids Jordan, 7, and Travis, 11, and granddad John of Buena Park shoot together during a gathering in 2013 at Burro Canyon Shooting Park in Azusa. The group ""Cigars and Guns"" started as a client appreciation gesture of Sergey Malkov, a financial advisor from Laguna Niguel. The event grew into a family fun day where everyone gets to shoot a variety of firearms.  One month after Christmas, John Dade, his son and grandchildren will gather for a family excursion to a gun range deep in the San Gabriel Mountains. Like millions of Americans who own guns, Dade, a Buena Park resident and financial futures manager, preaches and practices gun safety. Two years ago, his grandchildren, one a fifth-grader, the other in second grade, learned to shoot. After Wednesday’s shooting rampage in San Bernardino, it’s easy to conclude that so-called gun-control advocates would be horrified that the Dade family tradition will go on as scheduled. But the national debate over the Constitution’s Second Amendment is far more nuanced than many politicians and media pundits would have you believe. Already, there is a shift in attitudes. And some states are tiptoeing toward implementing safer, tougher gun laws. GUNS HERE TO STAY Three years ago, I took firearms lessons, became friends with enthusiasts and learned to handle the same kind of assault-style rifles used in the San Bernardino killings. I also got to know dozens of men and women who advocate for what I call strict gun control, what they call “gun-violence prevention.” Understand, “gun-violence prevention” isn’t a euphemism. For most people who want change, it’s simply reality. There are as many guns in this country as there are people. Realistically, guns are here to stay, and control is a meaningless term. Deborah Hernandez, a South County mother and designer, was moved to take action after six adults and 20 children were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. With the three-year anniversary 10 days away, she’s still working at what she calls her unpaid job. Hernandez volunteers as the communications leader for the California chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, a national nonprofit organization that boasts chapters in all 50 states and works for tougher gun laws and stronger background checks. On Thursday, Hernandez shared that she has relatives who live near where the San Bernardino killings took place. One member is in law enforcement. “It’s horrifying,” Hernandez said of the tragedy. “I was absolutely shaking. These things are heartbreaking, especially when they hit this close to home. And they do make me furious.” With a husband, work and a son in elementary school, she admitted her volunteer work takes its toll. She said she has received threats. “It’s emotionally draining to think about issues of violence and death.” But Hernandez explained she feels her work is necessary to keep the country she loves from going down what she calls a dangerous path. “We are living in a state of terror when we expect our kindergarten teachers to defend against gunmen.” Indeed, the relatively new phenomenon of “active shooter drills” is becoming commonplace. When I was in Roseburg, Ore., in September covering the mass shootings at a community college, a Fullerton College professor told me her school couldn’t implement such a program soon enough. THIS IS NORMAL? According to the University of Alabama Department of Criminal Justice, the U.S. accounts for 5 percent of the world’s population but 31 percent of mass shootings. Touching on the FBI’s investigation into possible terrorist connections with the San Bernardino shootings, Hernandez said there is no coordination between the gun sales National Instant Checks System and the federal Terrorist Screening Center’s No Fly List. “We can’t stop every mass shooting,” she allowed. “But, clearly, there are steps we can take to prevent these things or to mitigate these things.” One of those things, she said, is the current effort by Moms Demand Action and other groups to toughen background checks on a state-by-state basis. She reported nearly 40 states have agreed to safer practices such as restricting large-capacity ammunition magazines, and half a dozen states have approved stronger background checks. Still, there is much work to be done. Hernandez noted 40 percent of guns are sold without background checks because some states have loopholes that allow private sales, including at gun shows. I mentioned there was a gun show last weekend at the O.C. fairgrounds. “The Orange County gun show is not necessarily a problem,” Hernandez said. “We have good laws in California. But the states that are trying to do the right thing are unfortunately being undermined by other states.” Echoing President Barack Obama, who this week promised executive action to tighten background checks, Hernandez asked, “For the next generation, are we going to sit here and let this become normal? “We need to take common-sense measure to keep guns out of dangerous hands,” Hernandez said. “If people are responsible in the way they acquire, keep, store and ultimately sell their weapons, then that’s all we can ask.” Like Hernandez and thousands of other Orange County residents, Dade said he, too, knows people who were directly affected by the San Bernardino killings. One works at Loma Linda University Medical Center. Dade said he has no problem with detailed background checks. Other enthusiasts have told me they welcome checks. “When I got my firearms, I had a background check,” Dade said. “It should be required.” But with 14 dead in San Bernardino, instead of tip-toeing toward tougher laws and beefier background checks we should be running.

http://www.inquisitr.com/2608778/ny-daily-news-accused-of-prayer-shaming-by-responding-to-san-bernardino-mass-shooting-with-god-isnt-fixing-this-cover/,"A New York Daily News cover is causing controversy in the wake of the San Bernardino, California mass shooting that left 14 dead and 17 injured. The NY newspaper's provocative cover calls Republican politicians out for continuing to send their ""thoughts and prayers"" to the victims of mass shootings instead of passing legislation to prevent them from happening. The NY Daily News asserts that these politicians' tweets about thoughts and prayers are empty gestures, but others believe that the NY paper is in the wrong and have accused the publication of ""prayer shaming."" The Thursday cover of the NY Daily News features a provocative headline that reads, ""God Isn't Fixing This."" It's surrounded by tweets from House Speaker Paul Ryan and four GOP presidential candidates: Ted Cruz, Lindsay Graham, and Rand Paul. Each Republican politician responded to Wednesday's mass shooting at Inland Regional Center in Bernardino by letting the surviving victims and their family members know that they are praying for them. The NY Daily News points out that Republican politicians have responded similarly to previous mass shootings, and so far their tweets and prayers haven't been very effective. According to ABC News, the U.S. is now averaging more than one mass shooting a week.  — New York Daily News (@NYDailyNews) December 3, 2015  — New York Daily News (@NYDailyNews) December 3, 2015  — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) December 3, 2015  — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) December 3, 2015  — Joe Koss (@joekoss) December 3, 2015  — Joe Koss (@joekoss) December 3, 2015  ""Perhaps the No. 1 problem with prayer shaming is that it is misunderstands the purpose of prayer,"" Callum Borchers wrote. ""As any prayerful person will tell you, God isn't a wish-granting genie. People don't pray because they expect God to make their lives — or the world — perfect. They make requests, sure, but they understand that God might have different plans. Mostly they pray for God to influence them, not the other way around."" Think Progress writer Zack Ford responded to Brochers' thoughts about the NY Daily News headline by agreeing that prayer isn't a bad thing, in and of itself. However, if a politician is relying on the power of prayer alone when it comes to matters of life and death like mass shootings, this is definitely problematic. ""The result of prayer isn't bad. It's just nothing (and thus wasted time),"" Ford wrote. ""If you want change, advocate for change. Look for solutions like the many successful gun violence prevention measures that other countries like Australia and the UK have passed and demand your lawmaker support them. We've had a lot of tragedies and a lot of prayer, and the prayer just ain't changing a d**n thing."" In other words, there's nothing wrong with praying to make yourself feel better. However, there's no proof that it will make the world around you better. According to CNN Money, there was a pretty big backlash to the controversial NY Daily News cover and story on social media. Most who were angered by the cover agreed with Borchers' claim that it was ""prayer shaming"" the faithful. However, NY Daily News Editor-in-Chief Jim Rich contends that the point of the provocative ""God Isn't Fixing This"" headline was not to mock prayer -- critics are misconstruing its meaning. According to Rich, the NY Daily News cover is simply trying to make the point that ""most GOP politicians have offered nothing but empty platitudes and angry rhetoric in response to the ongoing plague of gun violence in our country."" The NY Daily News attempted to stir up further controversy Thursday night by referring to NRA's Executive Vice President and CEO, Wayne LaPierre, as ""Jihadi Wayne.""  Now the NY Daily News is criticizing Wayne LaPierre for refusing to comment on the San Bernardino shooting -- he hasn't even reached out to offer his thoughts and prayers to the victims.

http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2015/dec/04/2-in-california-shooting-had-ammo-pipe-/,"SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. -- The couple who police say killed 14 people at a social-services center had built more than a dozen pipe bombs and stockpiled thousands of rounds of ammunition, officials said Thursday. The FBI is treating Wednesday morning's mass shooting as a potential terrorist act, two law enforcement officials said Thursday. But officials emphasized that they were unsure of a motive for the attack and were not ready to declare it terrorism. Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and Tashfeen Malik, 27, opened fire inside the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, Calif., on Wednesday, killing 14 people and injuring 21 others. The two fired 65 to 75 rifle rounds, leaving behind four spent high-capacity magazines, officials said. Four hours later, police cornered the two in a rented SUV in Redlands, Calif., 2 miles from the center. The couple opened fire at officers, who returned fire, killing Farook and Malik. ""The suspects are believed to have fired 76 rifle rounds at the officers,"" said Jarrod Burguan, the San Bernardino police chief. In the shootout with 23 officers from seven agencies, he said, ""law enforcement fired approximately 380 rounds at the suspects."" A San Bernardino police officer was shot in the leg, and a sheriff's deputy was cut by flying debris, Burguan said of the shootout. Most of the carnage at the Inland Regional Center was in a single room that was filled with people Farook knew, police said. While shots rang out, other people in the building took cover in their offices, and sent frantic text messages or made panicked phone calls. The two suspects carried two .223-caliber military-style rifles and two 9mm semi-automatic pistols. When they fled the service center, they left behind an explosive made of three pipe bombs that did not detonate, Burguan said. The three rigged-together pipe bombs had a remote-control detonating device that apparently malfunctioned, he said. In a rented Ford Expedition with Utah plates, the couple had 1,400 rounds for the rifles and 200 for the handguns with them at the time of the shootout with police, Burguan said. At the house where they apparently lived in Redlands, officers found more than 2,500 rounds for the assault rifles, more than 2,000 for the pistols, several hundred rounds for a .22-caliber rifle, and 12 pipe bombs. There were also supplies for making more explosives. ""Clearly they were equipped, and they could have done another attack,"" Burguan said at a news conference Thursday. ""We intercepted them before that happened, obviously."" Law enforcement officials said the FBI had uncovered evidence that Farook was in contact over several years with extremists domestically and abroad, including at least one person in the United States who was investigated for having suspected terrorist ties in recent years, but had not been charged. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Officials called the case perplexing, saying that no clear evidence of terrorism had emerged, although the attack was clearly premeditated. ""You don't take your wife to a workplace shooting, and especially not as prepared as they were,"" said a senior law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. ""He could have been radicalized, ready to go with some type of attack, and then had a dispute at work and decided to do something."" An overnight review of Farook's electronic devices did not provide clear answers to investigators' questions Thursday, but officials noted that the investigation was in its early phases. ""We do not yet know the motive. We cannot rule anything out at this point,"" said David Bowdich, the assistant FBI director in charge of the Los Angeles office. ""We don't know if this was the intended target or there was something that triggered him to do this immediately."" The shooters arrived at the Inland Regional Center at 11 a.m. Wednesday. They were wearing masks and carried four firearms. Some witnesses said the couple also wore body armor, but Burguan said that appeared to be wrong. Instead, the shooters wore ""tactical vests,"" with pockets for spare magazines and other equipment, he said. President Barack Obama said in a statement Thursday morning that it was possible the attack was terrorism-related but also possible that it was work-related. At this stage, he said, law enforcement officials still don't know why this ""terrible event occurred."" Echoing Obama, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in Washington: ""We don't know if this was workplace rage or something larger or both."" Those injured in Wednesday's shooting were taken to Loma Linda University Medical Center in Loma Linda, Calif. Two of the wounded remained in critical condition Thursday morning, and three others were listed in fair condition, said Kerry Heinrich, the chief executive of the hospital. ""All of the patients are gunshot wound victims,"" he said, declining to give more details. Coroner's teams were still working at the Inland Regional Center on Thursday, and law enforcement officials said some of the bodies of victims remained there. All four weapons in the shooting were bought legally, Burguan said. A senior federal law enforcement official said the military-style rifles were bought by a third person who is not considered a suspect in the shooting. Officials said the two rifles were variants of the AR-15, the semi-automatic version of the military M-16 rifle. One was made by DPMS Panther Arms, and the other was a Smith & Wesson M&P model, a designation meaning military and police. As for the two handguns, a senior law enforcement official said one was made by Llama, and the other by Smith and Wesson. Initially Wednesday, witness accounts varied as to the number of gunmen in the massacre. The numbers ranged from one to three. Officers detained a person who was running away from the gunbattle with officers as a possible third suspect. ""We did ultimately determine that he was not involved in the incident,"" Burguan said Thursday. ""He is not a suspect."" Investigators are now confident that two people did the shooting, he said.

http://www.ibtimes.com/2015-mass-shootings-security-experts-advise-companies-re-evaluate-safety-following-2210892,"Jeff Zisner, president and CEO at  Aegis Security & Investigations in Los Angeles, says his phone was “ringing off the hook” with new inquiries on Wednesday in the aftermath of a shooting that left 14 people dead and more than a dozen injured fewer than 100 miles away in San Bernardino. Several mass shootings in America over the past year have occurred in workplace settings, prompting companies to take a second look at security systems to prevent employees from coming in harm’s way. “Honestly, I think it behooves anybody to take some sort of an action at this point, whether that is re-educating your people on your safety programs or implementing them for the first time,” Edward Yost of the Society for Human Resource Management says. “To simply do nothing and believe you’re a low-risk environment, that’s not a legitimate way to look at it at this point. In this world we're living in, nobody is a zero-risk environment.” A string of high-profile attacks with multiple casualties have brought workplace safety to the forefront. In August, Vester Lee Flanagan II shot and killed two former co-workers and news anchors during a live morning broadcast in Roanoke, Virginia. Last Friday, a gunman fired on a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Christopher Hagon, managing partner at Florida-based  Incident Management Group (IMG), says companies and venues have contacted his international security firm in droves since the Paris attacks on Nov. 13 in which 130 people were killed. “I think the most contacts we've got are literally the last couple of weeks,” Hagon says. “We've been snowed under with calls.” In the San Bernardino shooting, two suspects fled the scene and were later killed by police after opening fire on a holiday party for employees of the  county health department where one of the suspects worked. Investigators haven’t identified a motive. “It is possible that this was terrorist-related, but we don’t know,” said President Barack Obama in a speech from the White House on Thursday. “It’s also possible that this was workplace-related.” Following news of an attack on a work group, companies are left wondering whether they should ramp up security, and if so by how much? Should office buildings install metal detectors? Should doctors’ offices have silent alarms at the reception desk? Do retailers need an in-store security guard? “Every business is different so security is going to be fundamentally designed around what the culture of your organization is suited for in the context of what are the risks, threats and vulnerabilities?” says  Arnette Heintze, a former Secret Service agent and co-founder and CEO of Chicago security company Hillard Heintze. In general, experts already know that certain industries are more vulnerable to workplace violence than others. Occupations that require workers to be alone in unfamiliar environments, carry cash or interact with the public are particularly susceptible -- including taxi drivers, librarians, home healthcare aides and water meter readers. The Inland Regional Center complex in San Bernardino, California, was the site of a mass shooting on Wednesday. Photo: Reuters/Mario Anzuoni Nearly 2 million Americans are victims of workplace violence each year, which encapsulates physical attacks as well as threats, harassment and intimidation. In the two decades between 1992 and 2012, a reported  14,770 people died as a result of on-the-job violence. Some of the most obvious protections that companies might consider following an attack such as the one in San Bernardino are physical -- security guards, surveillance systems, metal detectors and fences that line a facility’s perimeter. But security experts consistently say two of the most important first steps that companies can take are procedural ones -- creating a workplace safety policy and completing a risk assessment. Creating a safety policy is important because it serves as grounds for terminating employees who violate it. Companies are bound by the  Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to provide a workplace that is “free of known dangers.” Though OSHA does not have specific regulations on workplace violence or safety precautions, it offers  prevention programs and training materials. Since there’s no formula for a safe workplace, a risk assessment identifies physical vulnerabilities such as easy building access or poor lighting and also illuminates past threats or potentially volatile situations that have simmered beneath the surface. Companies can do this in-house, or hire an outside firm -- Zisner charges between $800 and $20,000 for risk assessments in the Los Angeles area, depending on the company’s size. “One of the easy things you can look at is multiple points of access,” Yost says. “If your building or offices have multiple places where employees come and go, that certainly could be a risk.” Heintze says former or disgruntled employees represent a far greater threat to most companies than random shooters, and training can help employees recognize signs and identify threats. The key to identifying which employees might become violent, says Dr. Harley Stock, a forensic psychologist and managing partner for IMG, is determining which not only have an ax to grind, but are likely to retaliate. Zisner adds that if an employee is fired, the likelihood that they will attack in the first 72 hours is far greater than at a later point. Stock also says there’s one motivating factor that has consistently proved particularly strong in his investigations: “Across all people around the world, it's the sense of perceived injustice,” he says. “When people move from intention to volition -- I've had enough, I can't stand it anymore and I’m going to get even -- those people are extraordinarily and immediately dangerous.” To contend with these risks, experts say employees must have a clear way to report both overt and potential safety concerns and feel confident that supervisors will investigate them. “If you look back with these incidents, it's nearly always the case that something could have been picked up in either a lack of communication or lack of follow-up or lack of procedures and policies in place,” Hagon at IMG says. Once a company has a safety policy, risk assessment and reporting protocol in place, experts say it’s important to keep these documents updated and remind employees of their contents through training or seminars. This framework can also inform a company’s decisions to hire a security guard, invest in a surveillance system or upgrade building entry procedures. For example, if a company suddenly cuts a fourth of its workforce, Yost recommends hiring a temporary security guard. At the end of the day, Stock reminds worried employees or executives that the chance of a shooting in any workplace is slim. “This kind of an event is extraordinarily unusual,” he says."
http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2015/12/04/San-Bernardino-shooting-victims-identified/8221449226214/,"SAN BERNARDINO, Calif., Dec. 4 (UPI) -- Federal authorities leading the investigation into the mass shooting in Southern California this week are now handling the case as an ""act of terrorism,"" a bureau official said Friday.
FBI Los Angeles assistant director in charge David Bowdich said at a news conference Friday that the case is being handled as terrorism, ""as of today, based on the information and facts as we know them.""

Bowdich said Thursday that it would be ""premature"" and ""irresponsible"" to label the attack as terror-related, suggesting that some new information has swayed the bureau's position on the matter.
Neither Bowdich or any other bureau official, though, detailed exactly what information made the difference, but the Los Angeles FBI official said Friday, ""a number of pieces of evidence ... have essentially pushed this off the cliff to where we are investigating this as an act of terrorism.""
RELATED FBI finds cache of weapons, explosives at Calif. suspects' home; Terrorist motives explored
One factor in the FBI's shift is likely the newly found allegiance to the Islamic State pledged via social media by accused shooter Tashfeen Malik, the 27-year-old woman who helped her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, stage the attack that killed 14 at a San Bernardino County holiday party at the Inland Regional Center on Wednesday -- about 60 miles directly east of downtown Los Angeles.

Investigators said they found a Facebook post by Malik that pledged support, to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. That posting has since been removed from the social site.
Bowdich also said investigators have been able to gain information from cellphones and computers that belonged to the couple. He said two of the phones were found in a trash can, indicating the pair attempted to ""destroy their digital fingerprint.""
RELATED Obama: No known motive in California shooting, terrorism 'possible'
The New York Times reported Thursday that Farook had deleted information from electronic devices at least a day before the attack.
Officials said earlier Friday that they had not yet ruled out the possibility that the attack was a religion-related workplace issue. It wasn't immediately clear how the FBI's new disclosure of terrorism impacts that theory.
Despite the bureau's new view of the attack as an act of terrorism, officials said they have found no evidence so far to indicate any known terror group or operative instructed the couple to carry out the attack.
RELATED Presidential candidates abide by party lines in reactions to California mass shooting
""At this point we believe they were more self-radicalized and inspired by the group than actually told to do the shooting,"" an anonymous official told The New York Times.

Investigators said Farook and Malik have never been in trouble with the law and neither was on lists of potentially radicalized people. They did find indications that Farook, 28, had occasional contact with at least one person with terror connections.
Also Friday, San Bernardino County's coroner released the names of the 14 victims -- ranging in age from 26 to 60 -- who were killed at the party. Most were employees of the county's public health division.

The only victim who did not work for the county was Larry Daniel Kaufman, 42, who ran the coffee shop at Inland Regional Center and trained the developmentally disabled. Friends remembered him as a warm person who enjoyed the annual springtime Renaissance Faire in Southern California.
""He was so full of life it was ridiculous,"" longtime friend Stachia Chadwick said.
Also killed in the massacre were Bennetta Betbadal, 46, who fled Iran ""to escape Islamic extremism and the persecution of Christians,"" and Nicholas Thalasinos, 52, a devoted Messianic Jew who was known to be outspoken about Islamic terrorism and had strong conservative views. Twenty one were wounded, some with injuries that include a shattered pelvis and multiple gunshot wounds.

Some of the wounded were able to contact family members during the shooting, including county environmental inspector Kevin Ortiz, who was shot twice in the leg and once in the shoulder.

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/126386721/0/news-opinion~James-Alan-Fox-In-San-Bernardino-focus-on-the-murderous-partnership/,"At least 14 killed and 21 injured in a mass shooting at an office building in San Bernardino, Calif., allegedly by a couple armed and dressed for battle. The extent of carnage is absolutely shocking, while the relationship of the suspected gunman and gunwoman is surprising, but only somewhat so. It is quite true that the vast majority of mass killings involving firearms are perpetrated by lone assailants. Of the more than 200 cases in the USA TODAY database of mass killings since 2006, over 80% implicated a single offender. The prototypical lone gunman bent on revenge usually reflects an angry, dispirited or sometimes deranged individual who seeks revenge against those whom he sees as his tormentors. The perceived enemy are those people who caused life to be so unlivable. They would have to pay for making everyday existence a living hell.  Occasionally, in the purely random massacres, the target is not some specific workplace, but society in general, seen as a corrupt world in which all the breaks go to other undeserving people. The lone shooter is enabled by his social isolation. He has no real support system to help him deal with life’s frustrations and disappointments and, more important, no one to provide a needed reality check on his unrealistic view of his victimhood. The lack of others allows the loner to see the world through a distorted lens. When couples kill — be it a married couple (as appears to be the case in the latest bloodbath), brothers (as in the Boston Marathon bombing), pseudo father and son (as in the DC sniper murders), the presence of a close confidant, rather than the absence, is enabling, so long as the other participant is of like-minded perspective. In these deadly duos, the association is emboldening and reinforcing. It is far easier to kill when someone else shares the responsibility and, more critically, reinforces the idea that it is the right thing to do. It becomes a case of ""us against the world' thinking. The key to understanding the motivation of partners in crime — both those that depend on familial connections and others such as the Columbine massacre that involve friends — is to focus more on the partnership than on the crime. It is at last arguable that the attack would not have occurred without the partnership bond. Typically, one person is the leader who thrives on having a willing foot soldier, while the other seeks approval from his or her mentor. Each brings out the worst in the other, and together they see the virtue in some deadly plan. As compared with lone gunmen, mass killer partnerships and teams are especially dangerous. Of course, two heads are almost always better than one in terms of planning a strategy of attack and making the necessary preparations. Plus, once at the targeted location, two shooters can wreak double the havoc in terms of body count. But the dangerousness of gangs of two or more lies also in the power of group think. While there is the possibility of a successful intervention to derail the deadly designs of the lone wolf, team killers feed off each other to find inspiration and resolve. They can easily insulate themselves from others, especially when motivated by some political ideology. Finally, a single would-be killer can abandon his fantasies of violence without having to appear  weak. However, when co-conspirators are involved, there is pressure to follow through, to stay loyal to the cause, and not let your accomplices down. It is said that ""everybody needs somebody sometimes,"" but sometimes that somebody is only there to facilitate an extreme act of violence.

http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/arts/~3/ZYPhlidYOG4/ct-san-bernardino-shooting-20151204-story.html,"SAN BERNARDINO, CALIF. — A change came over Tashfeen Malik two or three years ago. She started dressing more conservatively, wearing a scarf that covered nearly all her face, and became more fervent in her Muslim faith, according to some who knew her in Pakistan. But her path from there to the bloody events of this past week — when she and her husband slaughtered 14 people in a commando-style shooting rampage — remains a mystery. Playlist: Mass shooting in California FBI officials, family lawyers and others said they know little about the 29-year-old housewife and mother, apart from what came to light on Friday: that Malik had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group on Facebook as she and her American-born husband, Syed Farook, 28, went on their rampage. The turn in the investigation raised a host of questions, among them: — If the couple was radicalized, when, where and how did it happen? Were they influenced by Islamist material online or direct contact with extremists? — If it happened before Malik came to the U.S., did counterterrorism authorities miss any warning signs when they investigated her before approving her visa? — Which of them was the driving force in the attack? ""Malik seems to be a very nebulous figure,"" said Natana DeLong-Bas, an assistant professor of theology at Boston College. She said the case should cause people to rethink some of their assumptions about extremism. Coming to you live! MSNBC apologizes for broadcast from home of terror suspects ""We always seem to assume only a man would be capable of making a terrorist attack,"" DeLong-Bas said. ""Because we know so little about Tashfeen Malik, it's possible she might have been the main organizer in this event and talked her husband into doing it."" Husband and wife were killed in a furious shootout with police hours after they armed themselves with assault rifles and opened fire on a gathering of Farook's colleagues from the San Bernardino County health department, where he worked as a restaurant inspector. The FBI said it is investigating the rampage as a terrorist attack. President Barack Obama plans to deliver a prime-time address to the nation Sunday night on the attack and the government's efforts to keep the nation safe. Hundreds of FBI employees, meanwhile, are working the case, interviewing people, gleaning information off the Internet, conducting searches and analyzing evidence, bureau spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said. Tashfeen Malik's resident status puts spotlight on visa screening process Early Saturday, authorities with guns drawn raided a home next door to the house where Farook's family used to live in Riverside, California, breaking windows and using a cutting torch to get into the garage, neighbors said. The FBI would not say what it was looking for, but a neighbor said an old friend of Farook's lives there. More than three years ago, that person bought the two assault rifles later used in the shooting, but authorities haven't been able to talk to him because he checked himself into a mental hospital after the attack, said a law enforcement official who was not allowed to discuss the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity. The FBI has said the man is not a suspect in shootings, though they want to question him. U.S. officials said that Farook been in contact with extremists via social media, but one official said those contacts were not recent and did not involve any significant players on the FBI's radar. FBI Director James Comey said Friday there was no indication so far that the couple was part of a larger cell or was directed by a foreign terror organization. San Bernardino shooting victims: Who they were Farook was born in Chicago to Pakistani parents and raised in Southern California. Malik arrived in the U.S. in 2014 on a Pakistani passport and a fiancee visa but had spent extended periods of time in Saudi Arabia. She started studying pharmacy at Bahauddin Zakariya University in the Pakistani city of Multan in 2012. A maid who worked in the Multan home where Malik lived said that Malik initially wore a scarf that covered her head but not her face. A year before she got married, she began wearing a scarf that covered all but her nose and eyes, the maid said. The maid spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of jeopardizing her employment with the family. A relative of Malik's in Pakistan, Hifza Batool, reported hearing similar things from other family members about Malik, her step-niece. ""I recently heard it from relatives that she has become a religious person and she often tells people to live according to the teachings of Islam,"" said Batool, a teacher who lives in Karor Lal Esan, about 280 miles southwest of the Pakistani capital of Islamabad. The Farook family attorneys, David Chesley and Mohammad Abuershaid, said none of his relatives had any indication either Farook or his wife held extremist views. The lawyers described Malik as ""just a housewife"" and cautioned against rushing to judgment. Associated Press CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"
http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/126492659/0/usatoday-newstopstories~San-Bernardino-We-are-not-beaten/,"SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. — San Bernardino had one message for the world as thousands gathered in San Manuel Stadium on Thursday evening to mourn the victims of the previous day's mass shooting: We are broken, but not beaten. The Inland Regional Center shooting, which killed 14 and injured 21 on Wednesday, rocked the mid-size city that prides itself on its closeness. Jim Giannestras, who came from San Diego with the Billy Graham Rapid Response Team to help comfort the afflicted town, said he soon realized how small a 200,000-person city could be. AZCENTRAL Expert: Mental health of man accused in PV murders diminishing ""You happen to talk to someone that you think for sure is not involved, but no, they know someone or know someone who knows someone or works with someone or went to school with someone,"" he said. As locals asked themselves, ""How could this happen here?"" they refused to let the past 24 hours of horror pull them apart. Tears flowed freely at Thursday's vigil, but so did the comforting words and gestures of kindness. When an announcer approached the podium of the vigil's stage to announce that more than 1,000 extra cars trying to make their way into the parking lot would cause a delay, the already-full crowd let out cries of delight. Many of the thousands had driven from all over Southern California to offer their support. Denise Paciorek and her husband, Gordon, live almost 50 miles away in Temecula, but made the drive to show support to the city and their friends and coworkers who call it their home. AZCENTRAL Expert: Mental health of man accused in PV murders diminishing ""We wanted to support the families,"" Denise said. One man passing another in one stadium bleacher aisle asked what part of San Bernardino he was from. ""Moreno Valley,"" the other responded. ""We're all in this together."" It's this support and strength that has brought the town through the last two days, city and religious officials told the crowd. ""We are challenged over the last 24 hours but we are not broken,"" said Pastor Joshua Beckley of Ecclesia Christian Fellowship, in opening the vigil. ""We are a city of hopefulness and we will stand here and we will stay here because we know that God has something great planned for us. The enemy intended this to strike fear into our hearts but let us do the opposite."" While several speakers invoked the ""toughness"" of San Bernardino, the lives of those who were lost weighed heavily on the visibly exhausted Mayor Carey Davis. ""Let us remember the precious lives we have and dedicate and commit ourselves today the best we can to strengthen our families, to overcome, but to recognize that this tragedy will not paralyze us or keep us from moving forward or growing closer,"" said Davis. A morning phone call from President Obama offering his support to Davis and San Bernardino bolstered the beleaguered mayor, but he and the many police, fire and emergency personnel still wore the previous day's trauma on their face. AZCENTRAL Expert: Mental health of man accused in PV murders diminishing “(First responders) weren’t asked, they didn’t have to be asked or instructed, they put into effect their skills and their training, that brought to an end the violent crime that had been perpetrated against innocent lives,” Davis said. “I couldn’t be more proud of our police department, our fire department, our neighboring law enforcement that assisted in that event. They didn’t ask for that challenge, but they rose to the occasion.” Police Chief Jarrod Burguan's address was especially emotional as his voice shook while thanking the first responders who gave all they had in the midst of danger. His simple address, full of emotion, was met with the raucous applause of a standing ovation. Speakers at the vigil did not delve deep into the backgrounds of the 14 people killed, but chose a simple moment after everything that could be said to memorialize their lives and mourn their brutal ends. With 4,000 candles lifted high as the names were slowly read, the city showed that just a bit of light can drive out complete darkness. AZCENTRAL Expert: Mental health of man accused in PV murders diminishing ""We believe that love is greater than hate,"" said Bishop Gerald Barnes, of the Catholic Diocese of San Bernardino. ""We believe love is greater than fear and we believe that unity is greater than separation."" All acknowledged that any combination of words, regardless of how meaningful or heartfelt, can never replace the void in the hearts of the families and friends of the 14 victims. But with kind actions, those left behind can be comforted. ""Most of the words of those us on this stage will be forgotten by tomorrow,"" said Pastor Scottie Lloyd of Lutheran Church of Our Savior in San Bernardino. ""But the faces of those to your left, your right, in front and behind will remain. Those are the faces of support. Those are the faces of San Bernardino.""

http://www.inquisitr.com/2609116/gun-bill-voted-down-senate-unanimously-opposes-expanding-background-checks-for-gun-purchases/,"The Senate voted down a gun bill that was aimed at making it harder to purchase firearms. Underscoring the partisan divide over gun control, the Senate voted down rival proposals that would have made it a little harder for people to procure firearms in the country. The rejections come amid rising instances of mass shootings in the U.S., the latest of which has left 14 dead in California. The 50-48 vote followed the Senate's defeat on other similar gun control legislations, indicating the continued political gridlock in Washington despite a concerning rise in mass shootings. The gun bill, which advocated extensive background checks for guns purchased online and at gun shows, was co-authored by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Patrick Toomey, R-Pa. Incidentally, the proposal was the same one that was voted down by the Senate in early 2013, mere months after 20 children and six educators were gunned down at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, reported Business Insider. Currently, background checks are mandatory only when a gun is bought from licensed gun dealers. By 54-45, senators voted down a proposal by Dianne Feinstein a Democratic California senator, that would let the government bar sales to people it suspects of being terrorists, reported Fox News. The proposal sought to ""deny people on a federal terrorism watch list the ability to purchase guns."" Though Feinstein had introduced the proposal earlier this year, it received attention only after international terror attacks, which witnessed operatives of ISIS executing innocent civilians with semi-automatic and automatic guns.  A similar roll call about gun control in 2013 fell just five votes short of the 60 needed to overcome opponents' tactics aimed at derailing it in a Democratic-controlled Senate. As expected, the proposal was strongly opposed by the National Rifle Association (NRA). Incidentally, the NRA stepped up its tactics prior to the voting process by emailing its members asking them to contact their respective Senators and, ""tell them to vote against any gun control amendments."" With presidential and congressional elections coming up fast, Democrats were quite hopeful of rallying up support for tighter gun control, especially after rise in number of mass shootings since 2013, reported Chieftain. Democrats were confident that the public was anxious after the Paris attacks, which left 130 dead and subsequent attacks in other countries orchestrated by the terror group ISIS. Thursday's vote down, which was mostly party-line, was quite politically significant because the proposal was offered as an amendment to a bill that gutted President Barack Obama's health care law. It is presumed Obama will surely veto the same. Obama has consistently supported enhanced gun control. In the U.S. alone, there have been over 351 incidents that involved guns in 344 days. Such statistics are enough to spur a nationwide debate. Following the vote down, American citizens took to social media, calling out to Senators with their stance on the polarizing issue.

http://www.tampabay.com/news/nation/stories-of-those-who-survived-mass-shooting-in-california/2256461,"LOS ANGELES — Fourteen people died in a mass shooting at a California social services center where county health officials were holding their holiday party. But many more survived the attack by a county restaurant inspector and his wife, though some have serious injuries. Here are some of their stories: ——— JULIE PAEZ The San Bernardino County health worker was attending a holiday work party at the center when the two attackers stormed in and opened fire. Paez, who tests water safety for the health department, was shot at least twice and a bullet shattered her pelvis, her son, Nick Paez, told The Associated Press by phone. She managed to send her family a message through a group chat app to say she had been shot and included a selfie that showed just her face, her son said. ""It was a picture of her with a half-smile,"" he said. ""She just wanted to send us something so we would know what was happening."" After receiving the photo, the family ""didn't know if she was alive or dead. I mean, I see on the news 14 people dead and she told me she was shot,"" he said. Paez's father frantically checked hospitals for his wife. At the same time, she was giving nurses in the emergency room her husband's contact information. Her family had to wait eight hours to see her as she underwent surgery and then was whisked to the intensive-care unit, Nick Paez said. The photo she sent helped sustain her son. ""She's a really strong-willed, tough woman,"" he said. ""If there's anyone who could go through it, it's her."" ——— KEVIN ORTIZ Kevin Ortiz heard shots on the other side of the wall just seconds before the shooters burst into the conference room and started shooting. Ortiz, a 24-year-old environmental inspector for the county, was hit almost immediately and wound up taking five bullets to his back, shoulder and both legs, his father Carlos Ortiz said in an interview outside Arrowhead Regional Medical Center. He crawled under a desk after getting shot the first time, but was hit a second time as one of the shooters came back around and sprayed more bullets. One of them was at close enough range to leaving a gaping hole in his leg. The shooters were wearing black and had on black masks, he told his father. Ortiz, who is a deacon at his church, was married several weeks ago, his father said. ""He's mentioned a couple of times he doesn't want to go back, he doesn't want to back there, he wants to quit,"" Carlos Ortiz said. ""We're still in shock. Who would think it would happen to us?"" ——— PATRICK BACCARI A co-worker of one of the shooters said he was sitting at the same table as Syed Farook at the banquet before Farook suddenly disappeared, leaving his coat on his chair. Baccari said that when the shooting started, he was in the bathroom and suffered minor wounds from shrapnel slicing through the wall. The shooting lasted about five minutes, he said, and when he looked in the mirror, he realized he was bleeding. ""If I hadn't been in the bathroom, I'd probably be laying dead on the floor,"" he said."

Chris Murphy (D-CT) explained his tweet from Wednesday decrying those offering thoughts and prayers to the victims of the mass shooting in San Bernardino earlier this week. Your ""thoughts"" should be about steps to take to stop this carnage. Your ""prayers"" should be for forgiveness if you do nothing – again. — Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) December 2, 2015 Murphy said he believed “prayers and thoughts” were a mask for inaction and declared them “wholly insufficient.” “Listen, I come from Sandy Hook, CT,” Murphy said. “I know that prayers and thoughts — I know they’re important and I know they’re important to San Bernardino. But right now these thoughts and prayers sympathies a mask for inaction. And wholly insufficient. And so my point — I don’t know what the New York Daily News is trying to communicate, but my point is thoughts and prayers are great. But they’ve got to be followed up with action. And what’s so offensive is in the wake of another mass shooting, we have a gigantic menu of policy options that are at our disposal to try to cut down on this carnage.

As of Wednesday, we've marked our 355th mass shooting of 2015, according to the Mass Shooting Tracker, a website dedicated to counting the number of people shot in the country. Meanwhile, in New Jersey Thursday, the state Assembly failed to override a Gov. Chris Christie veto of a once popular gun bill. No change. For editorial cartoonists, it's been a lopsided debate when it comes illustrating what many think about gun control. The gallery represents drawings from editorial cartoonists from across the country -- and two foreign artists observing American affairs. Some of the cartoons were drawn to address specific mass shootings this year, but overall most deal with the ongoing gun control debate. Enrique Lavin may be reached at elavin@njadvancemedia.com.

http://www.mercurynews.com/opinion/ci_29198597/mercury-news-editorial-could-this-mass-shooting-san?source=rss,"Trending: Another day, another mass shooting in America. With 14 dead, 21 injured and Southern California reeling, the San Bernardino attack was the deadliest since the 2012 slaughter of 26 children in Sandy Hook. Yet it is an aberration only in the number of victims. This year we have seen 355 multiple shootings so far, more than one a day on average, using the statistical definition of four or more people shot. San Bernardino was the second one on Wednesday. The first, in Savannah, Georgia, with one dead, three injured and the shooter still on the loose, was a blip in the news cycle. What will it take for America to finally get a grip on gun violence? The murderous rampage of Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik has terrorist indications. They had thousands of rounds of ammunition stockpiled and had built pipe bombs. But most of these incidents are not what we define as terrorism. Most are rooted in anger, mental illness or both. What they have in common is guns. What will it take? Syed Farook would not have set off alarms as a gun shopper. He was American by birth, with no criminal record. It appears the weapons he and his wife wielded were legally purchased, although authorities haven’t yet said by whom. Here’s the thing. Shouldn’t anybody who wants to buy military assault rifles be automatically suspect? Does anybody really hunt deer with an AK-47? Law enforcement officials have been cautious and responsible in resisting speculation about the couple’s motive until there is proof. They did not publicly jump to conclusions because of Farook’s travel to Pakistan or his Muslim faith. This left the focus where it belonged: How can Americans, any Americans, so readily acquire an arsenal? As politicians and civic leaders reacted Wednesday to the latest killings, there was an interesting backlash on social media, as reported in The Atlantic. Nearly every public figure quickly expressed outrage, sorrow, sympathy for the victims — and invoked prayer. Some stopped there. Others, including President Obama, seized the moment to talk about sensible regulation. More than usual, people commented and tweeted frustration about the prayer-only reactions. Do something, they said, in essence. We didn’t elect you to pray. We elected you to keep us safe. To act. New Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has ventured some thoughts on gun control, at least attempting to prevent mentally ill individuals from buying firearms. That may signal a shift in Republican resistance. Obama points out that people on no-fly lists can still buy guns. A majority of Americans — even of NRA members — favors reasonable gun control. Perhaps this latest killing spree will go down in American history as the tipping point from worship of weaponry to valuing human life. If not — what will it take?

http://www.mercurynews.com/opinion/ci_29198981/dec-4-readers-letters?source=rss,"Trending: It’s time for gun control, not prayer Every time there’s a mass shooting we hear the same mantra: “Pray for the victims.” I, for one, won’t be praying. I’ll be voting — against any politician who isn’t for gun control. Scott Simmons Portola Valley Gun laws make U.S.  a ‘laughingstock’ My morning commute was once again highlighted by news reports of a tragic mass shooting, this time in San Bernardino, and predictably the report was punctuated by the all-too-familiar refrain that, ” … the guns used in the shooting were all purchased legally.” Since the NRA typically goes into sleep mode following these all-too-frequent, and uniquely American, mass shooting events, I would like to offer up one of their moronic sound bites to commemorate the slaughter in the Southern California, that these deaths, while tragic, are simply the collateral damage that accompanies our never-to-be-abridged constitutional right to bear arms. An Englishman, attending the recent Rugby World Cup in the U.K﻿., said it best when asked about the state of American rugby. His reply? “It isn’t the rugby that makes your country a laughingstock, it’s the guns.” Barry Goldman-Hall San Jose State needs to rethink closing group homes Will we never learn? We closed mental hospitals to move the mentally ill closer to their communities. The result? Our jails and prisons have become our new mental hospitals. Now, we want to replace group homes with “short-term residential treatment centers,” where foster youth stay no more than six months. The idea is to find enough foster homes to care for these youth. Some foster homes have proven less than optimum, worse than the abusive homes from which the youth came. There aren’t enough anyway. I’ve heard nothing to indicate this will change. While far from ideal, group homes that try to replicate a family feel are a better refuge than a bad family placement that results in the child morphing from a dependency to a delinquency youth in our juvenile justice system. This, I fear, will be the result of the current anti-group home initiative. Please rethink. Susan Swope Volunteer Juvenile  Offender Mediator Redwood City Report on Bay Area poverty misleading The story (Page 1A, Dec. 3) on both poverty and incomes going up in the Bay Area overlooked a key factor: Census data uses the federal poverty level as its benchmark, making such a report painfully misleading here. The real numbers of people living in true poverty are better told by honest measures that account for the very high cost of living here. The federal guidelines make no such distinction. To truly understand the growing challenge of living here, check out these tools that calculate the true cost and how many of our hardworking local families don’t make enough to get by: The Self-Sufficiency Standard (www.insightcced.org), the Real Cost Measure (www.unitedwaysca.org) and the California Poverty Measure (www.stanford.edu). We have to confront the real problem before we can come anywhere near addressing it. Carole Leigh Hutton San Jose Turkey’s arms, oil deals should impact relations If a country sold arms to terrorists and supplied them with money, surely that country would be branded a “state sponsor of terror” and would never be welcome in NATO (or the European Union). Surely that country is Turkey. Recently journalists were arrested in Turkey for reporting that Turkey was supplying weapons to ISIS. In the past several days, Russians have claimed that Turkey has purchased oil products from ISIS, which extracts oil from Syrian and Iraqi oil fields, and that Turkey’s President Recep Erdogan’s son has led that effort. If the claims are true, we should have nothing to do with Turkey in any military or commercial relations.

Malik and her husband, Syed Farook, died in a fierce gunbattle with authorities several hours after their commando-style assault on a gathering of Farook's colleagues from San Bernardino, Calif., County's health department Wednesday, Dec. 2, 2015. (FBI via AP)    SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) — The latest on the mass shooting in San Bernardino: 8 a.m. The wife of the couple blamed in the deadly California shootings pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group and the terror group’s leader on Facebook using an alias then deleted the messages before the attacks, a U.S. law enforcement official told The Associated Press on Friday. The remarkable disclosure about the online activities of Tashfeen Malik provided the first significant details suggesting a motive for her participation with her husband, Syed Farook, in the shootings that killed 14 people and wounded 21. Malik was a Pakistani woman who came to the U.S. in 2014 on a fiancee visa before Farook married her in California. Specifics details about her postings were not disclosed by the law enforcement official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because this person was not allowed to discuss an ongoing investigation. — From Associated Press writer Tami Abdollah ___ 5:50 a.m. The brother-in-law of one of the attackers in San Bernardino says Syed Farook was a ‘bad person,’ but he wasn’t radical. Farhan Khan also told NBC News he is beginning the legal process to adopt Farook’s 6-month-old daughter, who was dropped off with relatives Wednesday morning before the shooting that left 14 dead.

http://www.mercurynews.com/crime-courts/ci_29199412/oakland-officials-propose-stronger-gun-safety-laws-ban?source=rss,"Trending: OAKLAND — City officials want to strengthen Oakland’s gun laws after a series of high-profile killings in the Bay Area and California in recent months, proposing new requirements for storing firearms in homes and vehicles and banning high-capacity magazines. Council members Dan Kalb and Anne Campbell Washington are offering legislation to ban possession of large-capacity gun magazines in the city, unless otherwise exempted, such as those issued to a police officer. They also want to introduce a Safe Storage Act, requiring residents to keep firearms in a locked container or accessible only with a trigger lock. “You have no reason to own this. You don’t need it,” Kalb said of high-capacity magazines, which typically hold more than 10 bullets. “And parents should be liable for stolen guns.” Kalb said the proposal had been in the works for months, although Thursday’s announcement happened just a day after masked gunmen killed 14 people at a conference center in San Bernardino, the largest mass shooting in the U.S. since the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in 2012. “It was a coincidence,” he said. But mass shootings involving more than five people were “happening almost daily” across the U.S., he added. Kalb and Campbell Washington’s proposal would also require the city’s police force to secure firearms in vehicles. Separately, Vice Mayor Rebecca Kaplan and City Attorney Barbara Parker are proposing a broader ordinance requiring all Oakland residents to keep guns in cars secured. Handguns stolen from federal officers’ cars this year in separate incidents were used in the San Francisco killing of Kate Steinle in July and Oakland muralist Antonio Ramos in September. Kaplan also pointed to the city’s spike in reported auto burglaries. Oakland has recorded almost 7,500 this year, an 11 percent increase over last year. “If you leave a gun in your car it’s like handing it to a crook,” she said. But Oakland’s local laws might not be effective until state and federal lawmakers enact equally stringent gun control measures, experts say. Stanford law professor John Donohue, who has studied gun control laws’ effect on crime, said California’s proximity to gun-happy states like Arizona and Nevada would likely weaken Oakland’s efforts. “It is tough to have a positive impact if you’re a narrow municipality entity in a much broader universe,” Donohue said. California already has some of the country’s toughest gun laws, including a 10-day waiting period for all firearm purchases, an assault weapons ban, and a ban on making and selling magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. Donohue said California cities have the authority to enact stricter gun laws than the state and federal government — San Francisco and Sunnyvale have strengthened their laws in recent years — but he wasn’t sure how Kaplan’s car law might apply to federal agents. But “anything that can be done to encourage gun owners to secure their weapons would be helpful,” he said. “Some politicians say, let’s start the ball rolling, and if enough municipalities do it, we can help to get the state to take some similar action.” Kalb agreed. Although the council next week likely will endorse Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s gun control initiative, which could appear on the November 2016 ballot, Kalb said local governments must “do all we can.” “If the actions we take prevent even one death, and save one life, it’s all the more reason to do it,” he said.

http://www.tampabay.com/news/nation/breaking-wife-in-san-bernardino-attack-pledged-allegiance-to-islamic-state/2256488,"SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. The FBI announced Friday that it is investigating the mass shooting at a Southern California office party as an act of terrorism, but the agency's director said there is no indication the husband and wife who killed 14 people were part of a larger plot or members of a terror cell. If the investigation confirms those initial suspicions, the attack would be the deadliest inspired by Islamic extremism on U.S. soil since Sept. 11. While authorities did not cite specific evidence that led them to the terrorism focus, a U.S. law enforcement official, speaking to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said that the wife, Tashfeen Malik, had under a Facebook alias pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group and its leader. A Facebook official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, told the news organization that Malik praised Islamic State in a post at 11 a.m. Wednesday, around the time the couple stormed a San Bernardino social service center and opened fire. Malik and her husband, Syed Farook, died in a fierce gunbattle with authorities several hours after their commando-style assault on a gathering of Farook's colleagues from San Bernardino County's health department. An Islamic State-affiliated news service called Malik and Farook ""supporters"" of their cause but stopped short of claiming responsibility for the attack. FBI director James Comey would not discuss whether anyone affiliated with ISIS communicated back to Malik, but he said there was no indication yet that the plot was directed by any other foreign terror group. He also declined to rule out that future possibility. ""The investigation so far has developed indications of radicalization by the killers and of potential inspiration by foreign terrorist organizations,"" Comey said. He cautioned that the investigation has not yet shown evidence the couple were part of a larger group. Despite mounting signs of the couple's radicalization, there ""is a lot of evidence that doesn't quite make sense,"" Comey said in a nod to the fact that the investigation was just two days old. Attorneys representing Farook's family urged the public and media to wait for specific evidence before jumping to conclusions. They said none of his relatives had any indication either Farook or his wife held extremist views. David Bowdich, head of the FBI's Los Angeles office, said ""a number of pieces of evidence"" point to terrorism and that the agency was focused on that idea ""for good reason."" He would not elaborate. The Facebook official said the company discovered Wednesday's post on Thursday, removed the profile from public view and reported its contents to law enforcement. Bowdich said he was not aware of the ISIS-affiliated Aamaq news service report but was not surprised ISIS would attempt to link itself to the attack. He said investigators were looking carefully to determine if there is an ISIS connection. Farook and Malik rented a townhome where investigators said they found an arsenal of ammunition and homemade bombs. On Friday morning, the property's owner allowed reporters inside in an unusual scene broadcast live on cable TV. Bowdich said the FBI was done with the scene. Analysts were trying to retrieve data from two cellphones found nearby that had been crushed in an apparent attempt to destroy the information inside. ""We hope that will take us to their motivation,"" he said. Until Friday, federal and local law enforcement officials said terrorism was a possibility but that the violence could have stemmed from a workplace grudge. Attorneys for Farook's family urged the public not to rush to judgment. ""If the most evidence there is to any affiliation is a Facebook account under another person's name . . . then that's hardly anything at all,"" attorney David Chesley said. Chesley and another attorney described Malik as a housewife who closely followed religious traditions. They said Farook's mother, who lived with the couple, never saw any of the weapons or bombs authorities found. The FBI questioned her Wednesday night and, according to the attorneys, said they would not release her until Farook's siblings came for questioning. The couple's orphaned 6-month-old daughter is in the care of child protective services, and the family will try to recover her next week. Farook had no criminal record, and neither he nor his wife was under scrutiny by local or federal law enforcement before the attack, authorities said. Malik, 27, was a Pakistani who grew up in Saudi Arabia and came to the United States in 2014 on a fiancee visa. Farook, a 28-year-old restaurant health inspector for the county, was born in Chicago to Pakistani parents and raised in Southern California. Law enforcement officials have long warned that Americans acting in sympathy with Islamic extremists — though not on direct orders — could launch an attack inside the United States. Using slick propaganda, ISIS in particular has urged sympathizers worldwide to commit violence in their countries. Since March 2014, 71 people have been charged in the United States in connection with supporting ISIS, including 56 this year, according to a recent report from the George Washington University Program on Extremism. Though most are men, ""women are taking an increasingly prominent role in the jihadist world,"" the report said. It was not immediately clear whether Malik exhibited any support for radical Islamists before she arrived in the United States — or, like scores of others arrested by the FBI, became radicalized through online or in-person associations after arriving. Friends of the soft-spoken Farook who knew him from his daily prayers at a mosque in San Bernardino said they saw nothing to make them think he was violent. They said Farook reported meeting his future wife online. Pakistani officials said Malik moved with her family to Saudi Arabia as a young child. The Associated Press, speaking to a person close to the Saudi government, reported that Malik eventually returned to Pakistan."

Terrill/Associated Press) Today's news: Ted Cruz says the gun-control crowd, including President Barack Obama and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, have it all wrong. Times like these call for smart use of guns, not more gun laws, says Cruz, a Texas U.S. senator running for the Republican presidential nomination. ""Unfortunately, the goal of both President Obama and Hillary Clinton, is to consistently-at every turn-to look to weaken the constitutional rights of American citizens,"" he told Breitbart News in an interview Thursday. ""And in particular, to undermine our constitutional right to keep and bear arms. You don't get rid of the bad guys by getting rid of our guns. You get rid of the bad guys by using our guns."" More: ""The gun control push illustrates the misguided priorities of President Obama and Hillary Clinton. They refuse to stand up and do what is necessary to defeat radical Islamic terrorism, to defeat ISIS, to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Instead, they remain obsessed with disarming the American citizenry, of stripping us of our fundamental right to protect our homes, our lives, and our families."" And: ""I would note that the calls from liberals for more and more gun controls in the wake of the San Bernardino shootings ignores the fact that California already has some of the strictest gun control laws in the country-so their policies and solutions have already been implemented in California. And to the surprise of no one, the laws failed to prevent this horrific attack"": Breitbart News. You'll hear more from Cruz about guns today. From the New York Times: ""Against the backdrop of another national mass shooting, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas plans to appear on Friday at an Iowa shooting range to demonstrate his dedication to the Second Amendment and gun rights. ""The event, at CrossRoads Shooting Sports in Johnston, Iowa, will highlight the formation of the campaign's 'Second Amendment Coalition,' to which more than 24,000 people have signed on, according to a campaign spokesman, Rick Tyler. ""Mr. Tyler said that the event had been arranged before the shooting on Wednesday in San Bernardino, Calif., and that the campaign had no discussion about rescheduling."" Cruz and Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama on Thursday to top members of the Obama administration asking for detailed information on the immigration histories of the shooting suspects.

http://www.ibtimes.com/who-bennetta-betbadal-san-bernardino-shooting-victim-fled-islamic-extremism-iran-2211738,"Benetta Betbadal came to the United States to get away from violent religious persecution. The Christian Assyrian-American was among the 14 victims killed in Wednesday's mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, her family said. When she was 18, Betbadal fled to America to “escape Islamic extremism and the persecution of Christians that followed the Iranian Revolution,” according to a  fundraising page set up to help her family. An inspector for the San Bernardino County Health Department, Betbadal was at the Inland Regional Center Wednesday to give a presentation to her colleagues at their annual meeting. But by the end of the day, she was one of the 14 people killed in the mass shooting there. As with many of the victims, a  Gofundme page has been set up to collect donations what will benefit her family. The page had raised more than $31,000 as of Friday morning. The 46-year-old Betbadal lived in Rialto with her husband Arlen Verdehyou, a police officer at Riverside Community College, and their three children, ages 10, 12 and 15. She initially settled in New York City before moving to California and graduating from Cal Poly, Pomona, with a degree in chemistry, the Gofundme page said. “She loved her job, her community, and her country,” the page read. ""Her greatest love, however, was for her husband, her children, and her large extended family.” Verdehyou told the Daily Breeze of Torrance that he and his wife exchanged text messages at 8 a.m. Wednesday, before the shooting, according to the  Associated Press. He told her he had withdrawn money from their bank account to go Christmas shopping. She recently decorated the family’s Christmas tree. ""Everything she touched bloomed,"" Verdehyou told  CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Thursday. Betbadal excelled at her job, her husband added: ""She went above and beyond, even on her own time."" Betbadal was involved in the Assyrian Scouts, a group coordinated by the Boy Scouts and the Assyrian-American Association of Southern California, the group’s vice president told the Press Enterprise of Riverside. The Assyrian-American Association of Southern California  posted a message about Betbadal’s death on its Facebook page, and the post has received hundreds of responses, with many people saying they knew her. ""She was very active and very passionate about our children,"" Ramond Takhsh, vice president of the Assyrian group, told the Press Enterprise. He said Betbadal taught the Assyrian language and written script to scouts, among other activities. ""It is the ultimate irony that her life would be stolen from her that day by what appears to be the same type of extremism that she fled so many years ago,"" her family  said in a statement."
http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/uproxx/springboard/~3/lm3CrCYMDDc/,"On Thursday, authorities continued to dig into the previous day’s mass shooting in San Bernardino. The massacre resulted in at least 14 dead and many more wounded during what was supposed to be a holiday celebration at the Inland Regional Center. Many hours after the shootings occurred, police located the townhome of two married suspects, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik. After a pursuit, officers opened fire upon the suspects’ black SUV, which ended the manhunt. The hunt for a motive, however, remains ongoing. Was this the result of a workplace conflict with deadly retribution, or was it something else? After all, Farook’s co-workers are said to have recently thrown a baby shower for the married couple. Late Thursday evening, authorities stopped short of drawing an ultimate conclusion. Officials noted that Farook was “apparently radicalized” and “in touch with international terrorism subjects,” but they did not formally assign terrorism as a motive for the mass shooting. The FBI’s David Bowdich elaborated on the decision: “It would be irresponsible and premature for me to call this terrorism. The FBI defines terrorism very specifically, and that is the big question for us, what is the motivation for this.” The National Institute of Justice provides the precise definition of terrorism: Title 22 of the U.S. Code, Section 2656f(d) defines terrorism as “premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents, usually intended to influence an audience.” The FBI defines terrorism as “the unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.”  Authorities played it safe at Thursday’s press conference in their hesitation to make a declaration. Yet the “premeditated” aspect of the crime was satisfied by the level of preparation police discovered at the shooters’ home. Several pipe bombs and thousands of rounds of ammunition aren’t come by casually. Further, the NIJ elaborates that most law enforcement agencies accept the FBI definition, which “stresses methods over motivations.” On Friday morning, CNN’s Jake Tapper dropped news that investigators have found possible evidence that Malik pledged allegiance to ISIS. Sources tell CNN: investigators believe Tashfeen Malik during attack pledged allegiance on FB to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) December 4, 2015  CNN has followed up with more details. Authorities say that the Facebook posting, which was “a pledge of allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,” occurred during the massacre. Malik made the posting under an account with a false name, and “officials did not explain how they knew Malik made the post.” Officials conducted a thorough search of the shooters’ electronics, but the couple took great pains to erase their digital trail. The home computer was missing its hard drive and motherboard, and authorities uncovered two phones that had been destroyed with a hammer. However, a “newly purchased” phone was found near Malik’s body. Authorities have been quick to note there’s no evidence that ISIS ordered the attack. Instead, “this is looking more and more like self-radicalization.” UPDATE: 3:15pm- The FBI is now investigating the massacre as “an act of terrorism.” (Via Reuters, CNN, LA Times & Washington Times) "

The difference between public perception and reality on this point is stark. Loading... December 4, 2015 This week’s mass shooting in San Bernandino, which killed 14 innocents and wounded another 21, seems sadly routine. We’ve had so many of these incidents in recent years that they flow together. And yet, as Max Ehrenfreund notes at the Washington Post, we’ve actually had a “massive decline” in gun violence over the last two decades. Premeditated mass shootings in public places are happening more often, some researchers say, plunging towns and cities into grief and riveting the attention of a horrified nation. In general, though, fewer Americans are dying as a result of gun violence — a shift that began about two decades ago. In 1993, there were seven homicides by firearm for every 100,000 Americans, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By 2013, that figure had fallen by nearly half, to 3.6 — a total of 11,208 firearm homicides. The number of victims of crimes involving guns that did not result in death (such as robberies) declined even more precipitously, from 725 per 100,000 people in 1993 to 175 in 2013. Older data suggests that gun violence might have been even more widespread previously. The rate of murder and manslaughter excluding negligence reached an apex in 1980, according to the FBI. That year, there were 10.8 willful killings per 100,000 people. Although not a perfect measure of the overall rate of gun violence, the decline in the rate of murder and manslaughter is suggestive: Two in three homicides these days are committed with guns. This decline in gun violence is part of an overall decline in violent crime. According to the FBI’s data, the national rate of violent crime has decreased 49 percent since its apex in 1991. Even as a certain type of mass shooting is apparently becoming more frequent, America has become a much less violent place. Ehrenfreund suggests several explanations for the decline, including more cops on the beat, the use of computer data analysis to more effectively target policing, a sharp decline in alcohol consumption, the campaign to remove harmful lead from the environment, and an improved economy. There have also been demographic changes – an older population is less violent. Regardless, the difference between perception and reality here is stark. Mass shootings of strangers are, quite naturally, scarier and more attention-grabbing than ordinary homicides involving people known to the shooter. They make national news and spark debates over the state of our society and what public policy solutions ought be applied. And, yet, they are a statistically insignificant part of the overall homicide numbers. The Mother Jones article Ehrenfreund links, published in October 2014, notes that the rate of these mass shootings (defined as “attacks that took place in public, in which the shooter and the victims generally were unrelated and unknown to each other, and in which the shooter murdered four or more people”) has taken a sharp uptick since 2011. But the real news, from a dispassionate point of view, is how rare they are. The researches note that “a public mass shooting occurred on average every 172 days since 1982” but that “every 64 days on average” starting with an incident on Sept. 6, 2011. They estimate the likelihood of this spike occurring by chance at less than one percent. That is, of course, way too many. But it’s a tiny percentage of the overall homicide rate, whether measured in terms of incidents or deaths. The spectacular nature of the mass shootings makes them natural fodder for public debate. But their rarity and the fact that they’re overwhelmingly committed by the mentally ill make them a poor choice for basing our public policy. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. While I own multiple guns, I have no problem with background checks, registration, safety training, closing gun show loopholes, and various other measures offered in the wake of these incidents. They strike me as common sense for a variety of reasons. In combination, they’d make it slightly more difficult for petty criminals to get guns, make it slightly easier for police to investigate shootings after the fact, and help reduce accidental shootings. But they would have essentially no impact on mass shootings, which are rare and unique events. James Joyner is editor of the Outside the Beltway blog at http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/.

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it.

Fiorina appeared on MSNBC's Morning Joe on Thursday to discuss Wednesday's mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., that left 14 dead and 17 injured.

Fiorina blamed chronic gun violence on the failure to enforce existing gun laws. She pointed to the shooting in June in Charleston, S.C., at Emmanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Nine people were killed when 21-year-old Dylan Roof allegedly opened fire inside the church during a prayer service. The Washington Post reported Roof was able to purchase a gun because of a lapse in the FBI background check system.
""We have lists and lists of people who shouldn't own guns who have them,"" Fiorina told hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough. ""Less than 1 percent of them are ever prosecuted.""RELATED See Carly Fiorina on Thursday's Morning Joe
Fiorina also repeated a previous claim that states with more stringent gun laws have higher rates of mass shootings.

Factcheck.org debunked a similar claim in October, finding the states with the highest rates of gun violence and gun-related deaths were states that had more lax regulations.
The New York Times reported the guns used in 15 recent mass shootings, including the California shooting, were purchased legally.
Brzezinski and Scarborough pressed Fiorina on whether or not people named on the terror watch list should be allowed to purchase guns. The candidate called the question a ""red herring.""
""If somebody is a suspected terrorist on a watch list, they can be indicted at any time, and once you're indicted, you cannot own a firearm,"" she said, following up with a call to indict suspected terrorists.
In November, the Government Accountability Office found between 2004 and 2014, that 2,043 people on the terror watch list were able to purchase guns. The list consists of about 700,000 people. The Washington Post reported bills have been filed in Congress to stop terror suspects from being able to purchase guns as far back as 2007. The bills rarely make it out of committee, and the National Rifle Association strongly opposes them.
Such a bill was introduced by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., earlier this year: The Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act of 2015.

Scarborough pressed Fiorina: ""If you're on a terror watch list you can't get on a plane but you can buy a .223?""
Fiorina cited problems with the terror watch list: ""If I had utter faith in the competence of government, I might agree with that. But do you? I don't.""
Earlier this year, the National Counterterrorism Center's watchlisting guidance leaked, showing that people are implicated as terror suspects on ""reasonable suspicion,"" a standard that is not defined explicitly. The document showed nearly 300,000 people were nominated to the list that had no known affiliation with any terrorist group.

NEW YORK, Dec. 4 (UPI) -- When asked if people placed on the terror watch list should be allowed to purchase guns, GOP presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina called the question a ""red herring."" Fiorina appeared on MSNBC's Morning Joe on Thursday to discuss Wednesday's mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., that left 14 dead and 17 injured.
Advertisement Fiorina blamed chronic gun violence on the failure to enforce existing gun laws. She pointed to the shooting in June in Charleston, S.C., at Emmanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Nine people were killed when 21-year-old Dylan Roof allegedly opened fire inside the church during a prayer service. The Washington Post reported Roof was able to purchase a gun because of a lapse in the FBI background check system. ""We have lists and lists of people who shouldn't own guns who have them,"" Fiorina told hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough. ""Less than 1 percent of them are ever prosecuted."" Fiorina also repeated a previous claim that states with more stringent gun laws have higher rates of mass shootings.
Advertisement Factcheck.org debunked a similar claim in October, finding the states with the highest rates of gun violence and gun-related deaths were states that had more lax regulations. The New York Times reported the guns used in 15 recent mass shootings, including the California shooting, were purchased legally. Brzezinski and Scarborough pressed Fiorina on whether or not people named on the terror watch list should be allowed to purchase guns. The candidate called the question a ""red herring."" ""If somebody is a suspected terrorist on a watch list, they can be indicted at any time, and once you're indicted, you cannot own a firearm,"" she said, following up with a call to indict suspected terrorists. In November, the Government Accountability Office found between 2004 and 2014, that 2,043 people on the terror watch list were able to purchase guns. The list consists of about 700,000 people. The Washington Post reported bills have been filed in Congress to stop terror suspects from being able to purchase guns as far back as 2007. The bills rarely make it out of committee, and the National Rifle Association strongly opposes them. Such a bill was introduced by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., earlier this year: The Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act of 2015.
Advertisement Scarborough pressed Fiorina: ""If you're on a terror watch list you can't get on a plane but you can buy a .223?"" Fiorina cited problems with the terror watch list: ""If I had utter faith in the competence of government, I might agree with that. But do you? I don't."" Earlier this year, the National Counterterrorism Center's watchlisting guidance leaked, showing that people are implicated as terror suspects on ""reasonable suspicion,"" a standard that is not defined explicitly. The document showed nearly 300,000 people were nominated to the list that had no known affiliation with any terrorist group."

	Maane Khatchatourian News Editor, Variety.com UPDATED: The FBI is now investigating the San Bernardino mass shooting as “act of terrorism.” The official, assistant director David Bowdich, announced the shift in a press conference on Friday. The female culprit of the attacks, Tashfeen Malik, who, with her husband Syed Rizwan Farook, went on a shooting rampage that left 14 people dead and 21 others wounded on Wednesday, was linked on Friday to ISIS after evidence was found that she pledged allegiance to the organization in a Facebook post. The couple was killed in a shootout with police following the attack at a holiday party at the Inland Regional Center — the nation’s deadliest mass shooting in three years. The post has since been removed, according to the New York Times. Malik reportedly posted the message on an account under a different name. Malik and Farook deleted their digital footprint a day before executing the deadly attacks.  The ongoing investigation has not yielded any evidence that the Islamic State directed the attack. “At this point we believe they were more self-radicalized and inspired by the group than actually told to do the shooting,” a federal law enforcement official told the New York Times. San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said during the Friday press conference that the police department took a report from a security guard at a Regal Cinemas early on Tuesday morning, before the shootings, about a man who was asking questions about movies and showtimes. The man was described as being of Middle Eastern descent. The guard also reported seeing the occupant of another vehicle taking photos “in and around the theater.” “The security guard thought that was odd,” Burguan said. Burguan said that the report was circulated throughout the county. “At this point we have zero evidence of information that connects that to what happened here at the Inland Valley Regional Center,” he said. The FBI shifted its examinations into terrorist recruitment tactics this year as the Islamic State has been targeting homegrown extremists in the U.S. to perform violence acts in the States instead of persuading them to travel to Syria to join ISIS, the New York Times reports. The bureau uncovered evidence yesterday that Farook had contact with individuals already being investigated for possible terrorist activities. Malik, 27, who was born in Pakistan, recently lived in Saudi Arabia. Farook, 28, is of Pakistani descent and was born in Illinois. He visited Saudi Arabia in July 2014 and brought Malik to the U.S. to wed after meeting online. The Business of Entertainment"

http://feeds.inquisitr.com/~r/google/yDYq/~3/gf9P7zUR04k/,"Gun control advocates are calling for reforms to the legislation in the wake of the San Bernadino tragedy. While facts are still being ironed out after this week's tragedy, which saw 14 killed and 17 wounded, one consistency that has continued to be found in any news story surrounding the case is that stronger gun control is needed in the United States.   United States president Barack Obama has said that there needs to be stauncher gun control laws in the U.S. as ""this just doesn't happen in other countries,"" according to CNN. This would appear to be true; although there have been tragedies involving mass shootings in places such as Norway and Paris, the sheer volume of mass shootings simply does not occur in other countries the way it does in the United States. According to a report by Adam Lankford, a criminal justice professor at the University of Alabama, the United States had the greatest number of mass shooters over a 46-year period at 90. The Philippines is the next highest on the list at 18. Newsweek reported about Lankford's findings, published in a report called ""Mass Shooters, Firearms, and Social Strains: A Global Analysis of an Exceptionally American Problem,"" in mid September 2015.   Bloomberg View's Ramesh Ponnuru suggested that gun control in the U.S. will not necessarily lead to the confiscation and abolition of all guns. ""Americans have hundreds of millions of guns,"" Ponnuru wrote. ""We are not going to get rid of them. That's not because the National Rifle Association or the gunmakers' lobby or a contested conception of liberty stand in the way. It's because of the overwhelming opinion of the public -- 72 percent oppose a ban on guns -- and the practical impossibility of confiscation."" Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Martin O'Malley have proposed tougher gun control laws as part of their presidential platforms, and while Bernie Sanders has not stepped forward with his gun control proposal, it is expected that his proposal will cleave pretty closely to those proposed by Clinton and O'Malley. Clinton has suggested that ""straw purchasing"" - purchases of guns made by those who know they will not pass the vetting process - will become a federal crime as part of her proposal, and she has also suggested that those who are deemed to be mentally ill will have their access to gun purchases limited. O'Malley has suggested, as part of his gun control policy, that fingerprint licensing be used in addition to safety training being offered with each gun purchase. In addition, he wants to implement a national firearms registry and restrict gun ownership for those with any sort of domestic violence in their history. However, it is important to remember that not all gun violence occurs with guns that have been illegally obtained. While it would be quite easy to blame criminals for all gun violence, gun control advocates need to remember that mass shootings such as the one that just occurred in San Bernadino can still happen.

http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/white-house-seeks-way-for-president-obama-to-use-executive-powers-on-gun/2256501,"WASHINGTON — In the hours after the San Bernardino rampage, President Barack Obama reiterated the plea for ""common sense gun safety laws"" that he has made after virtually every mass shooting during his presidency. But top White House advisers say they are still struggling to find a way for Obama to use his executive powers and tighten restrictions on gun sales, sidestepping a gridlocked Congress. While he has ordered officials to find ways for him to act unilaterally, aides said they have run into legal and political hurdles that make that difficult. ""This policy-making process involves consideration of complex policy, legal and operational considerations, and the president's team wants to make sure that everything we do in this area makes good common sense, is on strong legal footing, and can be effectively implemented,"" said Eric Schultz, a White House spokesman. ""This work is very much under way."" The White House has focused its deliberations on an executive action that would detail who should be considered a high-volume gun dealer, a move that could expand background checks to a huge number of sales at gun shows, online, and elsewhere that now fall outside the law. But taking that step would also open Obama to new charges that he is abusing his authority, even as the Supreme Court considers whether to review the legality of his actions to provide work permits and protection from deportation to 5 million undocumented immigrants. While some gun control advocates had hoped to see Obama announce new rules on Dec. 14, the anniversary of the 2012 school shootings in Newtown, Conn., there is virtually no chance of that happening. With White House lawyers still poring over the legal questions, officials said any announcement would be at least a month away. Valerie Jarrett and other White House advisers have held a series of meetings in recent weeks with gun control advocates who are pushing for Obama to take strong executive action in the absence of any legislation from Congress. Among those who have attended the meetings is Gabrielle Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman who was shot in the head during a mass shooting in 2011. Her husband, Mark Kelly, said he thinks spelling out the definition for a gun dealer would help catch some of the improper sales that are done off the books at gun shows. He said he spoke with the president about that idea early this year. ""I'm optimistic that they will do something to improve the system,"" Kelly said in an interview. At the same time, opponents of any unilateral action by the president are preparing to mount political challenges and to file lawsuits if he acts on his own, without congressional involvement. ""We stand ready to fight any backdoor attempts at gun control from the president,"" said Jennifer Baker, a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association's lobbying arm, which has been monitoring the White House deliberations. ""As he gets closer to the end of his term, he's becoming more desperate to deliver a victory for gun control by executive fiat."" His advisers believe that by defining the number of gun sales or other factors needed to qualify as a ""high-volume"" dealer, Obama could greatly increase the number of sales subject to such screenings, weeding out more of those barred from buying guns because of criminal offenses, domestic abuse or mental health issues. Other steps under consideration by the president's aides include broadening a provision that bars domestic abusers from buying guns, as well as giving the FBI more time to run background checks. Taken together, the steps could require background checks for hundreds of thousands of additional gun sales. But the aides acknowledged in interviews that using the president's executive authority to take these steps would pose a complex set of obstacles. For instance, changing the definition of ""gun dealer"" is more complicated than simply lowering the threshold for how many gun sales are required to be considered a high-volume dealer. White House officials said it is highly unlikely that Congress would be willing to finance the additional costs of enforcing the new definition or pay for additional background checks, which are conducted by federal law enforcement agencies. In addition, officials said there was almost no accurate data about how many gun sales are made at gun shows or online by people who are not considered high-volume dealers. That makes it difficult to know how many people would be affected if Obama takes action to reinterpret the law. Even so, gun control advocates who have met with the White House say they are optimistic that Obama will move ahead with at least some of the steps under discussion. ""I think they've arrived at a place where they're committed to a set of executive orders,"" said Pia Carusone, executive director of Americans for Responsible Solutions, the gun control group started by Giffords after her shooting. Carusone, who has attended several meetings with officials recently, said of Obama: ""He doesn't want to leave the White House without doing anything on guns."" Officials said the president and his aides recognized that the Republican-controlled Congress was unlikely to pass any new gun measures before Obama leaves office. But on Thursday, Obama's spokesman insisted that the president remains committed to new gun laws if lawmakers would agree to pass them. ""I assure you that the president's passion for laws that would make it harder for individuals who shouldn't get guns from getting them has not waned,"" said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. Earnest repeatedly sought to place the blame for inaction squarely on Congress. He suggested that lawmakers should pass a law prohibiting people from buying guns if they have been placed on the country's no-fly list of terrorism suspects. ""Republicans can't even explain why they actively oppose the passage of that law,"" Earnest said, adding: ""The president is determined to do everything he possibly can to try to make our country safer. And he certainly believes that members of Congress should have the same impulse."""

Malik entered the country on a fiancée visa in July 2014. Malik, who CNN reported pledged allegiance to terrorist Islamic State group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on Facebook, and husband Syed Farook allegedly committed a mass shooting that left 14 people dead in San Bernardino on Wednesday. Malik entered the United States last year, traveling with a Pakistani passport and a K-1 visa -- a special visa for the betrothed that permits people to enter the country to marry an American citizen, David Bowdich of the FBI in Los Angeles told a news conference Thursday. The couple must marry within 90 days or the visa expires. Farook applied for a permanent green card for Malik at the end of September 2014, within the 90-day limit, and she was granted a conditional green card in July 2015, a federal official told the New York Times.  Investigators believe #SanBernardino female attacker Tashfeen Malik pledged allegiance to ISIS leader, officials say https://t.co/iJHMPrgAEd  U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services notes for a K-1 visa to be granted, the applicant must show that both individuals are free to marry, all previous marriages being legally ended, and that the two individuals have met in person at least once in the past two years, barring any exceptions for long-established customs or extreme hardship. There are a number of documents needed for a K-1 visa as well, including photographs, a valid passport and police certificates from the fiancé(e)'s country of residence, U.S. State Department website says. Applicants who are granted the visa receive a sealed file of personal and government documents, which must be kept sealed until they are turned over to security officials upon entering the United States. While the situation surrounding Malik has drawn scrutiny, K-1 visas reportedly are not among the leading security threats to the United State. David Seminara, a former diplomat who wrote a report about ""Green Card Marriages"" for the Center for Immigration Studies, told NBC News the screening process is more involved than other methods of entering the U.S. ""If you're bringing a fiancé(e) to the U.S., there's more scrutiny for that than for tourist visas,"" he said. Farook, 27, and Malik, 28, were killed in a shootout with police following a chase a few hours after the mass shooting. Farook and Malik met online and married in 2013 when he visited his future wife in Saudi Arabia, where she had moved from her native Pakistan."

          / CBS News BOSTON -- An area of Atlantic Avenue in Boston was shut down as bomb technicians blew up a suspicious suitcase left by an unknown man next to a Homeland Security vehicle, CBS Boston reports. The suitcase could be seen Friday morning on the ground next to a police SUV on Atlantic Avenue. Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said the suitcase was left by an unidentified man who then quickly left the area. Police say the man is not a suspect, but they want to talk to him about why he left the suitcase behind. A bomb robot picked the item up and carried it across the street. A short time later the suitcase was blown up on the side of the road. Evans said that when technicians used an x-ray to look inside the suitcase, wires and a power source could be seen. Police do not believe there were any explosive items inside, but decided to do a controlled detonation. ""What bothers us is the behavior and why this individual placed it next to a Homeland Security vehicle and then hurried away,"" said Evans. State Police closed several streets in the area but just after noon began to open them back up. Armed tactical officers were present in the area to keep people from coming near the suitcase. The person seen leaving the suitcase next to the SUV is described as a white man in his 40s. Despite the suspicious nature of the incident, Evans said there is no threat to the public. ""People are safe. There are no threats to the city,"" Evans said. Evans added that suspicious behavior is taken especially seriously in wake of the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. that left 14 people and two suspects dead. ""Unfortunately I think we're all on a little bit of a heightened alert because of what happened in San Bernardino. People have a right to be concerned,"" said Evans.

(File) Mourn fast, America. The San Bernardino massacre will be all but forgotten within a few days, maybe even before you read this. (I can only type so fast.) It will be supplanted by tomorrow's shooting, which will be overshadowed by the one the day after that, which will be eclipsed by the one after that. Massacres, it seems, are the new American norm. So much so, in fact, that the BBC opened its coverage of the San Bernardino massacre this way: ""Just another day in the United States of America, another day of gunfire, panic and fear."" Yup. Sounds like us. You disagree? You shouldn't. I'm actually underselling the problem, according to the Mass Shooting Tracker on reddit. By its tally there were 355 mass shootings in the U.S. - which they define as four or more people, including the gunman, killed or injured by gunfire - during the first 336 days of the year. That's more than one a day. Impressive. Say what you want about the U.S. of A, but whatever we do, we do it well. Even the evil stuff. Go us. You would think such a stunning number, in and of itself, would prompt wholesale outrage, which in turn would produce changes - God, at least tweaks - to our Wild West gun laws, which allowed terrorists Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, to amass a truly stunning 7,000 rounds of ammunition for their assault rifles, 9mm handguns and .22-caliber rifles. But it won't. Nor will the San Bernardino shooting. Why would it? If the literal execution of 20 grade-schoolers and six adults by a deranged man wielding his mother's arsenal doesn't move us to change anything, the mere murder of 14 county health department holiday party-goers in California certainly isn't going to do it. C'mon. In fact, we've seamlessly followed the usual emotional script on this one. Externally, we've expressed our shock and horror. But internally, in the secret place where we hide our truths, our collective reaction is more like ""Meh, we've seen worse."" The truth is we're used to slaughter. We've accepted the fact that every day or so people going about their lives are going to die horrific, military-style deaths at the hands of jihadists, disenfranchised teens or Mel, the bread truck driver who simply had a bad day at work and is cheesed off about  it. We've come to accept the fact that any time we're out in public - at the mall, at the movies, at a holiday party with co-workers - we may end up on the 5 o'clock news. Everyone secretly checks the exits and mentally rehearses what they'd do. Everybody. We've even come to accept the fact that our schools are prime targets. What kid or teacher hasn't been schooled on shooter-in-the-building protocol? As I said before, it's our new norm. We accept it. We don't fight back. We change nothing. We can't. We mustn't.

Chris Christie arrives to speak at the Republican Jewish Coalition Presidential Forum in Washington, Thursday, Dec. 3, 2015. (Susan Walsh, Associated Press) Today's Chris Christie news: Gov. Chris Christie said Thursday the mass shooting in California was a ""terrorist attack'' and he called out rivals for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination who supported limits on U.S. intelligence gathering. ""We've had Republicans who have stood on this stage today and said they were for a strong America, yet voted this summer in Congress to weaken America,'' Christie said. ""Voted to take away tools from our intelligence community that permits us to be able to connect the dots and do what President George W. Bush instructed me and the other 93 U.S. Attorneys in January of 2002 - to do everything we could under the law to make sure that not another American life was lost to a terrorist act on American soil.'' Christie and the other 13 GOP presidential candidates appeared in Washington, D.C., at a forum sponsored by the Republican Jewish Coalition: Asbury Park Press ""Paris was an intelligence failure,"" Mr. Christie said. ""You think these guys got together 15 minutes before the attack at a Taco Bell ... and planned that attack? There were multiple folks involved living in multiple countries with specific planning, and we didn't catch them."" He said ""no one"" knew the Wednesday shooting in San Bernardino that left 14 people dead was coming, either. ""You know, if you listen to the debate in Congress, what they'd have you believe is that we were listening into your phone calls with your wife and reading your emails with your children, through the NSA metadata program,"" he said. ""What we've done by taking away that ability is to stop us from being able to connect the dots,"" he said: The Washington Times Christie criticized the rhetoric used by some of his rivals, most notably businessman Donald Trump, the front-runner in opinion polls, who has called for deporting all 11 million unauthorized immigrants and said thousands of Muslims in Jersey City celebrated on 9/11. Christie has refuted the claims. ""People need to be more careful in selecting their words,"" Christie said. ""Sometimes the harshest words are the most entertaining. When you're a leader, you need to be blunt and direct but you need to know where the line is."" Christie said he was attacked in 2011 for nominating Sohail Mohammed, a Muslim, as a Superior Court judge. ""You need to stand up and say no to that,"" he said. Otherwise, he said, ""we diminish ourselves:"" NJ.com Where is the line between lucky and good in a presidential campaign? It's hard to know, but Christie has been walking right along that line for the last few weeks. Or at least it's possible that's the case. When Christie went to the lectern at a meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition in Washington on Thursday, he sought to show that the moment that has arrived--one of escalating concern about terror and security--is the moment for him. As he has at almost every appearance since the Paris terror attacks three weeks ago, he reminded his audience repeatedly that he isn't just a governor but a former federal prosecutor who dealt with terror cases in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It's an approach that he hopes has special resonance after the mass shooting in California this week. If anybody missed his point that this moment was made for him, he declared at the outset of his remarks: ""This entire campaign changed a few weeks ago:"" Wall Street Journal Lawmakers in Trenton failed again to override a veto by Christie over legislation dealing with guns and mental illness. The Assembly vote was suspended on Thursday, after falling short of the support needed to rebuke the Republican governor, who is running for the GOP presidential nomination. The Assembly fell three votes shy of the 54 votes needed to follow the Senate's lead and end the veto, WCBS 880's Marla Diamond reported. Assembly speaker Vincent Prieto said he was disappointed that the assembly couldn't get enough votes to bring the override to the floor. ""It's a sad day for the State of New Jersey when you have Republicans putting politics before policy,"" Prieto said: CBS After moving from New Hampshire to New Jersey to Washington D.C. this week, Gov. Chris Christie on Friday kicks off a two-day 250 mile, six-city tour of Iowa for his presidential campaign. Christie begins in West Des Moines Friday morning before heading to Jefferson and Fort Dodge. He's slated to start Saturday in Jewell, then head to Mason City and Iowa Falls.

The first priority, according to a French public-service poster, is to flee. But if escape routes are cut off, people are then urged to shelter in place and to hide. The poster also recommends such additional steps as locking doors, turning off lights and silencing devices such as televisions and phones. Finally, citizens are urged to alert authorities when possible and to obey law-enforcement officers. The new posters are to be displayed in public locations and widely distributed via social media, according to news reports. The French government’s recommendations mirror the “Stay Safe” guidelines published by the U.K. government in November. Those guidelines urged people to “run, hide and tell.” “There is a serious and sustained threat from both international and Irish-related terrorism to the U.K. and U.K. interests overseas,” states the U.K.’s National Counter Terrorism Security Office in a manual that includes scenarios involving suicide attacks and  chemical warfare as well as active-shooter incidents. That manual also has a section on an “insider threat,” a category under which attacks by disgruntled employees fall. “The risks posed by the insider threat can be lessened by carrying out thorough pre-employment checks and by having a strong security culture,” said the U.K. counterterror agency. Governments around the world have taken steps to protect their citizens in the face of escalating risk from global terrorism. The U.S. government issued a travel alert ahead of Thanksgiving, warning its citizens that attacks from ISIL — also known as ISIS and Da’esh — are likely to continue, noting that terrorists tend to target places where crowds gather, such as sporting events and theaters. “U.S. citizens should exercise vigilance when in public places or using transportation,” said the State Department. “Be aware of immediate surroundings and avoid large crowds or crowded places.” Meanwhile, although U.S. authorities have not formally declared the San Bernardino massacre an act of terror, several media outlets are reporting that Tashfeen Malik, the female suspect in the incident that left 14 dead, had pledged her allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Facebook message.

http://www.mercurynews.com/science/ci_29202737/california-jerry-brown-climate-change-paris?source=rss,"Trending: AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli Calif. Gov. Jerry Brown, discusses the  scaling back of proposal  to address climate change that he supported during a news conference, Wednesday, Sept. 9, 2015, in Sacramento, Calif.  Citing opposition from the oil industry, Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon, D- Los Angeles, said he was dropping a mandate in his bill, SB350, that the state cut petroleum use by 50 percent.(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli)    With glaciers melting, sea levels rising and 2015 about to break last year’s record as the hottest year in the world since modern measurements began in 1880, California Gov. Jerry Brown arrived Saturday at the international climate summit in Paris, bringing with him business executives, political leaders and huge hopes that the trip will make a major difference. Brown is not a president or a prime minister like the roughly 150 world leaders in Paris trying to strike an agreement to slow the rise in temperatures. But he has been acting like one — which is increasingly drawing both cheers and criticism. In recent months, the 77-year-old Democratic governor has met with the presidents of China and other countries, as well as Pope Francis, to discuss climate change. He has signed agreements with 60 states, cities and provinces in 20 countries, pledging to cut carbon pollution 80 percent by 2050. And this week he signed a pledge with 12 states and countries — including Germany, Norway, the United Kingdom and Quebec — to require that all new cars sold in their regions emit no pollution by 2050. “Jerry Brown was never elected president, but he sure wanted to be,” said Larry Sabato, a political science professor at the University of Virginia. “In this sense, I guess he’s playing president. Nobody says to him, ‘You’re a rookie; you don’t know what you are doing.’ He is probably the most experienced high-level official in the country. It’s unusual, but then Jerry Brown has always been unusual.” As Republican leaders in Congress have blocked efforts to pass national laws limiting the burning of fossil fuels, Brown is orchestrating an end-run around them, Sabato and other political experts say. Simply put, he is taking California — the eighth-largest economy in the world and a state with 38 million residents, Silicon Valley, Hollywood and political muscle — to a prominent world leadership role. He is locking in some of the toughest global warming laws and renewable energy targets on Earth — and striking deals to spread them. “Climate change is not limited to the borders of California,” Brown said this week in an interview with this newspaper. “If we do everything right, we will absolutely fail. We won’t even make a dent. But if we can enlist others who might otherwise be somewhat reluctant, we really do advance the cause.” California has been first in passing environmental laws for half a century, under both Republican and Democratic governors. In 1967, GOP Gov. Ronald Reagan set up the state’s Air Resources Board, which dramatically cut the pollution from cars and factories, in addition to phasing out leaded gasoline — moves later copied by the federal government. Brown approved America’s toughest coastal protection laws in his first term as governor in the 1970s. And in 2006 Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the nation’s only state law requiring power plants, factories and oil refineries to cut greenhouse gas emissions, over their protests and lawsuits. Now, Brown says, the state must demonstrate that it is possible to wean society off fossil fuels while still growing the economy. He notes that California has cut greenhouse gas emissions 7 percent since 2004, while the state’s annual economic output has grown from $1.5 trillion to $2.2 trillion. This time, however, GOP leaders in Sacramento aren’t joining the parade. “The most important issue in the world today is the lives of the people of this planet as affected by the Islamic terrorists who are trying to behead and kill us,” said Sen. Jim Nielsen, R-Roseville. “Climate change has ebbed and flowed for eons. Mankind can deal with it intelligently. But I have serious doubts about our resolve in dealing with terrorists.” In a city still reeling from the Nov. 13 terrorist attack, Brown will attend 20 meetings, speaking at many of them, over five days. On Thursday, to spend more time in San Bernardino following the mass shooting, he delayed the trip by one day, canceling an appearance in Paris with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Other Californians attending the climate conference include Schwarzenegger; billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer of San Francisco; the Democratic leaders of the state Senate and Assembly; Tony Earley, the CEO of PG&E; Bernard Tyson, CEO of Kaiser Permanente; and top executives from Bank of America, Calpine, Solar City, Dignity Health and Bloom Energy. Although Silicon Valley executives support the climate push, oil industry leaders say Brown is moving too fast, threatening their industry and risking leaving low-income residents behind. “There are areas in the state that are doing very well and other areas that are not doing very well,” said Jay McKeeman, spokesman for the California Independent Oil Marketers Association. “People in the Central Valley, and agricultural workers, have to drive long distances. It’s the nature of the business. If you are parked out in a field somewhere, you can’t easily recharge an electric car.” Of Republican leaders who say the science isn’t clear, Brown said: “It’s absolute nonsense. They are either intellectually lazy and have done no study at all, or they’re cynical.”The vast majority of the world’s climate scientists and organizations such as NASA, NOAA, the National Academy of Sciences and the World Meteorological Organization say the planet is warming because the buildup of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere from burning coal, gasoline and other fossil fuels is trapping heat. Greenhouse gas concentrations are now at their highest level in at least 800,000 years, according to measurements of air bubbles in ice cores from Antarctica. Environmentalists — who note the state has a lot at stake, including its Sierra snowpack and increased risks of droughts and forest fires — are praising Brown’s actions. He signed a law in 2011 requiring 33 percent of the state’s electricity to come from solar, wind and other renewable sources — and this year upped that requirement to 50 percent by 2030. “California has been a shining light that shows the rest of the world that Americans care about climate change,” said Kathryn Phillips, executive director of Sierra Club California. But environmental groups have also criticized Brown on several fronts — particularly for not banning fracking, a controversial oil production practice that has been banned in New York state and elsewhere. Brown said he’s trying to continue to reduce oil demand in California through boosting electric vehicle mandates and subsidies, along with other policies, but it must be done in an orderly way. “We already import 70 percent of the oil that goes into our vehicles,” he said. “And what do they want to do? Import 75 percent? And bring it in by train from North Dakota?” So far, Californians –if not Americans as a whole –seem to be on board. A Public Policy Institute of California poll this week found that 80 percent of Californians believe climate change is a “very serious” or “somewhat serious” problem. “California is a leader, taking bold steps,” Brown said. “But we don’t want to just be the exception. We want to be the norm. We want others to join with us, and they are.” Paul Rogers covers resources and environmental issues. Contact him at 408-920-5045.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/uproxx/springboard/~3/AQHuIS4jjho/," After Wednesday’s mass shooting in San Bernardino, a manhunt swiftly turned up two married suspects, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik. They were located at their apartment, which they fled, and police gunned down the heavily armed suspects. Authorities subsequently searched the apartment and found an arsenal of pipe bombs, guns, and ammunition. They also noted a missing hard drive and two crushed cell phones. Two days later, the investigation is not yet complete, but MSNBC, CBSN, and CNN found access to the apartment and delivered an on-air tour. This is a bizarre approach from a cable news station, and we may soon see other media outlets criticizing this tactic. Today’s fuss began when the shooters’ landlord invited the media into the apartment. These actions will affect the chain of custody of any evidence not yet gathered in this crime scene. Twitter lit up in disbelief, and much of the furor began with a series of tweets from Matthew Keys of Grasswire (formerly of Reuters) and Brian Ries of Mashable. CBS no better.

(Chris Carlson, Asssociated Press) SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. -- The FBI said Friday that it is officially investigating the mass shooting in California as an act of terrorism, while a U.S. law enforcement official revealed that the woman who helped her husband carry out the attack had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group and its leader on Facebook under an alias. David Bowdich, assistant director of the FBI's Los Angeles office, would not give further details about why the bureau made the determination, saying at a news conference that ""there's a number of pieces of evidence that has pushed us off the cliff."" Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people at the holiday party for his co-workers. The Muslim couple died hours later in a fierce gunbattle with police. A Facebook official says Tashfeen Malik praised the leader of the Islamic State group in a post at 11 a.m. Wednesday, when the couple were believed to have stormed a San Bernardino social service center and opened fire. The Facebook official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not allowed under corporate policy to be quoted by name, said the company discovered the account Thursday. It removed the profile from public view and reported its contents to law enforcement. Malik, 27, was a Pakistani who grew up in Saudi Arabia and came to the U.S. in 2014 on a fiancee visa. Farook, a 28-year-old restaurant health inspector for the county, was born in Chicago to Pakistani parents and raised in Southern California. Another U.S. official said Malik expressed ""admiration"" for the extremist group's leader on Facebook under the alias account. But the official said there was no sign that anyone affiliated with the Islamic State communicated back with her, and there was no evidence of any operational instructions being conveyed to her. The two U.S. officials were not authorized to discuss the case publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The FBI has been investigating the shooting at a social service center as a potential act of terrorism but had reached no firm conclusions as of Thursday, with authorities cautioning repeatedly that the violence could have stemmed from a workplace grudge or a combination of motives. Separately, a U.S. intelligence official said on Thursday that Farook had been in contact with known Islamic extremists on social media. Law enforcement officials have long warned that Americans acting in sympathy with Islamic extremists -- though not on direct orders -- could launch an attack inside the U.S. Using slick propaganda, the Islamic State in particular has urged sympathizers worldwide to commit violence in their countries. Others have done so. In May, just before he attacked a gathering in Texas of people drawing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad, a Phoenix man tweeted his hope that Allah would view him as a holy warrior. Two weeks ago, with Americans on edge over the Islamic State attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead, FBI Director James Comey said that U.S. authorities had no specific or credible intelligence pointing to an attack on American soil. Seventy-one people have been charged in the U.S. since March 2014 in connection with supporting ISIS, including 56 this year, according to a recent report from the George Washington University Program on Extremism. Though most are men, ""women are taking an increasingly prominent role in the jihadist world,"" the report said. It was not immediately clear whether Malik exhibited any support for radical Islamists before she arrived in the U.S. -- or, like scores of others arrested by the FBI, became radicalized through online or in-person associations after arriving. To receive her visa, Malik was subjected to a vetting process the U.S. government describes as vigorous. It includes in-person interviews, fingerprints, checks against terrorist watch lists and reviews of her family members, travel history and places where she lived and worked. Foreigners applying from countries that are home to Islamic extremists -- such as Pakistan -- undergo additional scrutiny before the State Department and Homeland Security approve their applications. Pakistani intelligence officials said Malik moved as a child with her family to Saudi Arabia 25 years ago. The two officials, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said that the family is originally from a town in Punjab province and that the father initially moved to Saudi Arabia around three decades ago for work. Farook had no criminal record and was not under scrutiny by local or federal law enforcement before the attack, authorities said. Friends knew him by his quick smile, his devotion to Islam and his talk about restoring cars. They didn't know he was busy with his wife building pipe bombs and stockpiling thousands of rounds of ammunition for the commando-style assault Wednesday on a gathering of Farook's colleagues from San Bernardino County's health department. ""This was a person who was successful, who had a good job, a good income, a wife and a family. What was he missing in his life?"" asked Nizaam Ali, who worshipped with Farook at a mosque in San Bernardino. Authorities said that the couple sprayed as many as 75 rounds into the room before fleeing and had more than 1,600 rounds left when they were killed. At home, they had 12 pipe bombs, tools to make more explosives and well over 4,500 rounds, police said. On Friday morning, the owner of their rental townhome allowed reporters inside. On a living room table was a copy of the Quran. An upstairs bedroom had a crib, boxes of diapers and a computer. The dead ranged in age from 26 to 60. Among the 21 injured were two police officers hurt during the manhunt, authorities said. Two of the wounded remained in critical condition Thursday. Nearly all the dead and wounded were county employees. They were remembered Thursday night as several thousand mourners gathered at a ballpark for a candlelight and prayer vigil with leaders of several religions. The soft-spoken Farook was known to pray every day at San Bernardino's Dar Al Uloom Al Islamiyah mosque. That is where Nizaam Ali and his brother Rahemaan Ali met Farook. The last time Rahemaan Ali saw his friend was three weeks ago, when Farook abruptly stopped coming to pray. Rahemaan Ali said Farook seemed happy and his usual self. Both brothers said they never saw anything to make them think Farook was violent. They said Farook reported meeting his future wife online.

Chiu)  SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. — The FBI says it is investigating the deadly mass shooting in California as an “act of terrorism.” David Bowdich, assistant director of the FBI’s Los Angeles office, made the declaration at a news conference Friday in California. He also said the shooters attempted to destroy evidence, including crushing two cellphones and discarding them in a trash can. He said authorities continue to investigate the case to understand the motivations of the shooters and whether they were planning more attacks. An IS-affiliated news agency Aamaq says the two shooters in the deadly California attack were “supporters” of the Islamic State group, but it stopped short of claiming responsibility for the attack. David Bowdich, assistant director of the FBI’s Los Angeles office, said he wasn’t aware of the report but wasn’t surprised IS would attempt to link itself to the attack. He said investigators are looking carefully to determine if there is an IS connection. Bowdich said at a news conference that the bureau is investigating the shooting that left 14 people dead as an act of terrorism. He says neither Syed Farook nor his wife, Tashfeen Malik, was under prior investigation. The couple opened fire at a holiday banquet for Farook’s co-workers before dying in a gunbattle with police Wednesday. Get Morning Report and other email newsletters"

http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2015/12/security_at_high_alert_and_hudson_county_buildings.html," Gallery: Hudson County Sheriff's officers on high alert after San Bernardino shooting JERSEY CITY - Hudson County Sheriff's officers wielding assault rifles greeted visitors to the Hudson County Administration Building today as local law enforcement across the United States went on high alert due to the mass shooting in California, officials said. ""Due to the recent events in San Bernardino, California, all local law enforcement agencies throughout the country have been placed on high alert,"" Hudson County Sheriff Frank X. Schillari said this afternoon. On Wednesday gunfire erupted in San Bernardino at a party at Inland Regional Center, killing 14 people and wounding 21 others. The killers, Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, were killed in a gun battle with police. The FBI said it is investigating the incident as a terrorist attack. ""Although there is no specific threat to Hudson County, we are stepping up security in county buildings to guarantee the safety of the general public, county employees and the Hudson County Superior Court judges,"" Schillari said. There is usually a sheriff's officer and marked vehicle posted in front of the Administration Building to assist with traffic and pedestrians crossing Newark Avenue. Following the terrorist attack in Paris, the office began stationing an armored vehicle there as well. On Nov. 13 a series of terrorist attacks in Paris claimed the lives of 130 people and 368 others were injured.

http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/city-council-could-add-small-strong-voice-on-guns/2256548,"By now the news is as regular as tornadoes ripping across the plains and hurricanes slamming into the coast. And by now we act like it is just as unstoppable. An armed madman bursts into a college, a church, a clinic, a holiday party at work. He storms a movie theater, a military base, even an elementary school filled with kids — places so everyday American we assume them to be safe. Fueled by hate, anger, insanity, the shooter — or shooters — easily bring enough firepower to leave behind the carnage they intended. We have become familiar with body counts within our own borders. Another tragedy, we say, again. Politicians wring hands or point fingers, lobbyists twist reality to suit their purposes, and not much changes. Maybe change, if it's even possible, has to start where people live. Maybe it starts really small. • • • The powers of the Tampa City Council are modest. Elected council members decide if businesses should serve alcohol. They rule on rezonings. They pass the budget. They listen to citizen complaints, work to get potholes fixed and occasionally butt heads with the mayor. And this week, they voted to explore taking part in a cause that aims to save lives by influencing the gun industry. ""We don't want this,"" said councilwoman Yvonne Yolie Capin, ""to be our new normal."" Do Not Stand Idly By is a national group already endorsed by the U.S. Conference of Mayors and adopted by governments in several states. The name comes from a Bible verse that says you should not ""stand idly by while your neighbor's blood is shed."" Made up of a network of citizens and religious groups, it focuses on the players with the power to make a difference — gun manufacturers. Here's some creative thinking for you: Since the military purchases 25 percent of the guns in America and law enforcement another 15 percent, bring them in and make good use of that purchasing power. Use it to influence gun manufacturers on everything from weeding out straw buyers who resell illegally and dealers with bad track records to developing ""smart guns"" that can be fired only by authorized users. That kind of thoughtful reform would not hurt law-abiding gun owners one whit. If the National Rifle Association is truly about protecting gun rights for responsible citizens rather than pushing for laws to allow more guns in more places, the organization would support such causes. I know, good luck with that. The City Council will hear back on this from its lawyers and the police next month. And it remains to be seen if a stranglehold of a state law that forbids cities from passing any local gun regulations might affect their next step. (That's the very law that kept Tampa from banning guns from the safe zone during the Republican National Convention three years ago, which makes no sense at all.) Given the latest mass shooting, this one in California, it was good to hear even very local public officials looking for answers. This tide of tragedy we're getting used to is only inevitable if we do nothing about it. Contact Sue Carlton carlton@tampabay.com. Consumer affairs reporter"

http://www.ocregister.com/articles/nguyen-694940-trinh-brother.html,"Trending:  Tin Nguyen, 31, of Santa Ana was a food inspector with the San Bernardino County health department. “She was the most amazing person anyone could ever meet,” friend Dan Phu Hiep wrote on Facebook. “Her heart was bigger than the sun, and her personality was addicting.”  Tin Nguyen, 31, of Santa Ana was a food inspector with the San Bernardino County health department. ""She was the most amazing person anyone could ever meet,"" friend Dan Phu Hiep wrote on Facebook. ""Her heart was bigger than the sun, and her personality was addicting."" Nguyen was slain Wednesday, Dec. 2, in the mass shootings in San Bernardino.  Tin Nguyen of Santa Ana, left, was a food inspector with the San Bernardino County health department. She was killed Wednesday.  Tin Nguyen spent Tuesday with her boyfriend Haisan Trinh celebrating his 32nd birthday. She had a surprise planned for him on Thursday. Together nearly six years, the couple had been talking marriage – Trinh had even been saving to buy an engagement ring – but the kind and generous Nguyen was already like part of the family, said Trinh’s brother Haian Trinh, 33. She was Haisan Trinh’s “first girlfriend, ever,” his brother said Friday as her boyfriend and parents prayed, “and in so many ways was the perfect girl for him.” Nguyen, 31, who moved to Santa Ana from Vietnam as a child, was one of 14 people killed Wednesday in the mass shooting in San Bernardino. Her friends and family remember her as “an incredible person with a contagious smile” who “had a heart bigger than the sun,” according to a GoFundMe site to help her mother, Van Nguyen, with the memorial costs. Like the other shooting victims, Tin Nguyen was at a holiday luncheon for the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health, where she worked as a food inspector. Nguyen long had an interest in health issues, earning her bachelor’s degree in health science in 2010 from Cal State Fullerton. While studying there, she became the first intern with the Office of Environmental Health and Safety to take and pass a Registered Environmental Health Specialist certification exam, according to Colleen Wilkins, a Cal State Fullerton occupational safety officer. “She was enthusiastic about life and opportunities before her, and she was dependable and down-to-earth,” Danny H. Kim, associate professor of health science, said in a statement. That October after Nguyen graduated, Kim received an email from her informing him of her new job with the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health. Outside of work, her day always started and ended with her boyfriend, his brother said. Every morning, Nguyen would call Haisan Trinh to wake him up for work and he would call her on his way back home from work, Haian Trinh said. The two had talked about buying a house somewhere in Orange County together and “she wanted five girls or something,” Haian Trinh said. Nguyen had tried on a wedding dress, and Haisan Trinh was saving up for an engagement ring. “He had all the intention of doing it,” Haian Trinh said about his brother’s plans to tie the knot. “He just thought he had a little bit more time.” The pair met at Valley High in Santa Ana, and after going separate ways for college they reconnected. In the nearly six years that they dated, “he has never been mad at her once,” the brother said. Getting mad at Nguyen seemed almost an impossibility, those who knew her at different points of her life said. At McFadden Intermediate, Nguyen was soft-spoken – perhaps because of her limited English – but her classmate Phi Luong, 31, recalls being drawn to her because “she was just a very nice person.” “She just had that personality, you know, that goodness about her,” Luong, of Costa Mesa, said. The two girls went on to play tennis together at Valley High. Luong, the team captain at the time, said Nguyen was “willing to do anything for everybody.” “This just literally breaks my heart,” Luong said of the shooting. “Because kids in Santa Ana, people don’t expect a lot from the inner city communities, but I felt that she had a lot to give.” She was a giving daughter and sister as well. From working through Adams Elementary, Carr Intermediate, McFadden Intermediate and Valley High School learning English as a second language, Nguyen came to be the sole provider for her mother and older brother at their home in Santa Ana, which she owned. “She provided everything financially and emotionally,” Haian Trinh said. One giving memory of Nguyen sticks out in the mind of her seventh-grade science teacher, Erin Sloan, at Carr Intermediate. As part of the gardening curriculum, Sloan had ordered 20 pounds of worms for his students to learn about feeding them garbage to create compost. The worms were expected to arrive in two weeks, but instead arrived in two days – at the end of the school day Friday. That worried Sloan, because the worms would die if they weren’t transferred from the packaging to plastic bins with wet newspaper shreds. Nguyen volunteered. “I thought, ‘that’s incredibly nice,’” Sloan, 57, recounted. “But that was just the way she was.” On Thursday, when Sloan heard the names of the 14 San Bernardino victims, he realized one was Nguyen – the girl who had sweetly volunteered to transfer worms on a Friday afternoon. “Another light in the world is out,” Sloan said. When her boyfriend, Haisan Trinh, a mechanical engineer for Boeing, got wind of the mass shooting Wednesday, he texted her, his brother said. No response. He “went to every single hospital in the San Bernardino area trying to find her,” Trinh’s brother said. Eventually, Trinh sent another text – to his brother, informing him that Nguyen had died in the carnage. “I know that she had a surprise for him,” Haian Trinh. “And now, he will never know.” Contact the writer: 714-796-7762, jkwong@ocregister.com or on Twitter: @JessicaGKwong Get the latest news delivered daily!

http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/hottopics/~3/ZYPhlidYOG4/ct-san-bernardino-shooting-20151204-story.html,"SAN BERNARDINO, CALIF. — A change came over Tashfeen Malik two or three years ago. She started dressing more conservatively, wearing a scarf that covered nearly all her face, and became more fervent in her Muslim faith, according to some who knew her in Pakistan. But her path from there to the bloody events of this past week — when she and her husband slaughtered 14 people in a commando-style shooting rampage — remains a mystery. Playlist: Mass shooting in California FBI officials, family lawyers and others said they know little about the 29-year-old housewife and mother, apart from what came to light on Friday: that Malik had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group on Facebook as she and her American-born husband, Syed Farook, 28, went on their rampage. The turn in the investigation raised a host of questions, among them: — If the couple was radicalized, when, where and how did it happen? Were they influenced by Islamist material online or direct contact with extremists? — If it happened before Malik came to the U.S., did counterterrorism authorities miss any warning signs when they investigated her before approving her visa? — Which of them was the driving force in the attack? ""Malik seems to be a very nebulous figure,"" said Natana DeLong-Bas, an assistant professor of theology at Boston College. She said the case should cause people to rethink some of their assumptions about extremism. Coming to you live! MSNBC apologizes for broadcast from home of terror suspects ""We always seem to assume only a man would be capable of making a terrorist attack,"" DeLong-Bas said. ""Because we know so little about Tashfeen Malik, it's possible she might have been the main organizer in this event and talked her husband into doing it."" Husband and wife were killed in a furious shootout with police hours after they armed themselves with assault rifles and opened fire on a gathering of Farook's colleagues from the San Bernardino County health department, where he worked as a restaurant inspector. The FBI said it is investigating the rampage as a terrorist attack. President Barack Obama plans to deliver a prime-time address to the nation Sunday night on the attack and the government's efforts to keep the nation safe. Hundreds of FBI employees, meanwhile, are working the case, interviewing people, gleaning information off the Internet, conducting searches and analyzing evidence, bureau spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said. Tashfeen Malik's resident status puts spotlight on visa screening process Early Saturday, authorities with guns drawn raided a home next door to the house where Farook's family used to live in Riverside, California, breaking windows and using a cutting torch to get into the garage, neighbors said. The FBI would not say what it was looking for, but a neighbor said an old friend of Farook's lives there. More than three years ago, that person bought the two assault rifles later used in the shooting, but authorities haven't been able to talk to him because he checked himself into a mental hospital after the attack, said a law enforcement official who was not allowed to discuss the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity. The FBI has said the man is not a suspect in shootings, though they want to question him. U.S. officials said that Farook been in contact with extremists via social media, but one official said those contacts were not recent and did not involve any significant players on the FBI's radar. FBI Director James Comey said Friday there was no indication so far that the couple was part of a larger cell or was directed by a foreign terror organization. San Bernardino shooting victims: Who they were Farook was born in Chicago to Pakistani parents and raised in Southern California. Malik arrived in the U.S. in 2014 on a Pakistani passport and a fiancee visa but had spent extended periods of time in Saudi Arabia. She started studying pharmacy at Bahauddin Zakariya University in the Pakistani city of Multan in 2012. A maid who worked in the Multan home where Malik lived said that Malik initially wore a scarf that covered her head but not her face. A year before she got married, she began wearing a scarf that covered all but her nose and eyes, the maid said. The maid spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of jeopardizing her employment with the family. A relative of Malik's in Pakistan, Hifza Batool, reported hearing similar things from other family members about Malik, her step-niece. ""I recently heard it from relatives that she has become a religious person and she often tells people to live according to the teachings of Islam,"" said Batool, a teacher who lives in Karor Lal Esan, about 280 miles southwest of the Pakistani capital of Islamabad. The Farook family attorneys, David Chesley and Mohammad Abuershaid, said none of his relatives had any indication either Farook or his wife held extremist views. The lawyers described Malik as ""just a housewife"" and cautioned against rushing to judgment. Associated Press CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"

""Two followers of Islamic State attacked several days ago a center in San Bernardino in California,"" the group reported on its Al-Bayan daily broadcast, according to Reuters. But the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS, stopped short of claiming responsibility for the violence.

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/126386721/0/phoenix/nation~James-Alan-Fox-In-San-Bernardino-focus-on-the-murderous-partnership/,"At least 14 killed and 21 injured in a mass shooting at an office building in San Bernardino, Calif., allegedly by a couple armed and dressed for battle. The extent of carnage is absolutely shocking, while the relationship of the suspected gunman and gunwoman is surprising, but only somewhat so. It is quite true that the vast majority of mass killings involving firearms are perpetrated by lone assailants. Of the more than 200 cases in the USA TODAY database of mass killings since 2006, over 80% implicated a single offender. The prototypical lone gunman bent on revenge usually reflects an angry, dispirited or sometimes deranged individual who seeks revenge against those whom he sees as his tormentors. The perceived enemy are those people who caused life to be so unlivable. They would have to pay for making everyday existence a living hell.  Occasionally, in the purely random massacres, the target is not some specific workplace, but society in general, seen as a corrupt world in which all the breaks go to other undeserving people. The lone shooter is enabled by his social isolation. He has no real support system to help him deal with life’s frustrations and disappointments and, more important, no one to provide a needed reality check on his unrealistic view of his victimhood. The lack of others allows the loner to see the world through a distorted lens. When couples kill — be it a married couple (as appears to be the case in the latest bloodbath), brothers (as in the Boston Marathon bombing), pseudo father and son (as in the DC sniper murders), the presence of a close confidant, rather than the absence, is enabling, so long as the other participant is of like-minded perspective. In these deadly duos, the association is emboldening and reinforcing. It is far easier to kill when someone else shares the responsibility and, more critically, reinforces the idea that it is the right thing to do. It becomes a case of ""us against the world' thinking. The key to understanding the motivation of partners in crime — both those that depend on familial connections and others such as the Columbine massacre that involve friends — is to focus more on the partnership than on the crime. It is at last arguable that the attack would not have occurred without the partnership bond. Typically, one person is the leader who thrives on having a willing foot soldier, while the other seeks approval from his or her mentor. Each brings out the worst in the other, and together they see the virtue in some deadly plan. As compared with lone gunmen, mass killer partnerships and teams are especially dangerous. Of course, two heads are almost always better than one in terms of planning a strategy of attack and making the necessary preparations. Plus, once at the targeted location, two shooters can wreak double the havoc in terms of body count. But the dangerousness of gangs of two or more lies also in the power of group think. While there is the possibility of a successful intervention to derail the deadly designs of the lone wolf, team killers feed off each other to find inspiration and resolve. They can easily insulate themselves from others, especially when motivated by some political ideology. Finally, a single would-be killer can abandon his fantasies of violence without having to appear  weak. However, when co-conspirators are involved, there is pressure to follow through, to stay loyal to the cause, and not let your accomplices down. It is said that ""everybody needs somebody sometimes,"" but sometimes that somebody is only there to facilitate an extreme act of violence.

http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/new-york-times-page-one-gun-control,"The New York Times called America’s lack of gun control regulations a “moral outrage” in an editorial published on page one of Saturday morning’s paper. The strongly worded piece labeled all mass shootings “acts of terrorism” and called for outlawing some large categories of weapons and ammunition for civilian ownership. “It is a moral outrage and a national disgrace that civilians can legally purchase weapons designed specifically to kill people with brutal speed and efficiency,” the editorial board wrote. “These are weapons of war, barely modified and deliberately marketed as tools of macho vigilantism and even insurrection.” The editorial was a response to the latest mass shooting to capture national headlines: a married couple’s rampage at an employee holiday party in San Bernardino, California that left 14 dead on Wednesday. Publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. told the Associated Press that this was the first time the newspaper has run an editorial on Page 1 since 1920. The Times’ intention is to “deliver a strong and visible statement of frustration and anguish about our country’s inability to come to terms with the scourge of guns.” The editorial board chastised national political leaders for failing to pass “the most basic restrictions on weapons of mass killing,” offering prayers to the families of victims of gun violence but no concrete solutions. The New York Daily News also called out politicians’ “thoughts and prayers” reaction to the San Bernardino shootings with a Thursday cover headline that read “GOD ISN’T FIXING THIS.” Planned Parenthood is leaving the federal government’s Title X program, which funds family planning services for low-income people, due to… Following the ousters of the Homeland Security secretary and Secret Service director, and the withdrawal of the would-be ICE director’s… Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on Monday called for ousted Secret Service Director Randolph “Tex” Alles to testify before…"
http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/uproxx/springboard/~3/7v_L3XVJyHI/,"Following this week’s mass shooting in San Bernardino, the media response has ranged from highly critical to disturbingly voyeuristic. The New York Times is taking a different approach. On Friday evening, the paper announced they would run their first front-page editorial since 1920. This is a bold move and one the paper hasn’t taken in 95 years (a moment when the paper voiced disapproval of Republican presidential candidate Warren G. Harding). Here’s what Saturday’s front page looks like with an “End the Gun Epidemic in America” headline: The piece published this morning and ran with fury, which was squarely aimed at at Speaker Paul Ryan’s Thursday announcement that Congress wouldn’t be drafting new gun control legislation any time soon: It is a moral outrage and a national disgrace that civilians can legally purchase weapons designed specifically to kill people with brutal speed and efficiency. These are weapons of war, barely modified and deliberately marketed as tools of macho vigilantism and even insurrection. America’s elected leaders offer prayers for gun victims and then, callously and without fear of consequence, reject the most basic restrictions on weapons of mass killing, as they did on Thursday. They distract us with arguments about the word terrorism. Let’s be clear: These spree killings are all, in their own ways, acts of terrorism. After the Oregon shooting, President Obama asked voters to demand legislation for increased gun control. This editorial could go a long way to make that happen. (Via New York Times) "

http://www.tampabay.com/news/nation/woman-at-center-of-fbi-investigation-of-terror-attack/2256622,"SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. — The Pakistani woman who joined her U.S.-born husband in killing 14 people in a commando-style assault on his co-workers is now at the center of a massive FBI terrorism investigation, yet she remains shrouded in mystery. The FBI acknowledges knowing little about Tashfeen Malik. Those who attended mosque with her husband, Syed Farook, said they know nearly nothing of her. Even Farook's mother, who lived with the couple and their 6-month-old daughter, knows little, according to attorneys for Farook's family. The lawyers on Friday described the 27-year-old as ""just a housewife"" who was quiet like her husband and strictly followed Muslim custom. She wore traditional clothing that covered her face so her male relatives didn't even know what she looked like, according to the lawyers who represent Farook's mother and three siblings. Authorities say she ditched the Muslim garb for a combat-style outfit Wednesday, when she and Farook attacked a training session and holiday luncheon in San Bernardino. A few hours later, they were killed in a shootout with police. The FBI announced Friday it is investigating the mass shooting as an act of terrorism. If proven to be terrorism, it would be the deadliest attack by Islamic extremists on American soil since Sept. 11, 2001. A U.S. law enforcement official said Malik used a Facebook alias to pledge her allegiance to the Islamic State group and its leader just before the shootings. FBI Director James Comey would not discuss whether anyone affiliated with IS communicated back, but he said there was no indication yet that the plot was directed by any other foreign terror group. ""The investigation so far has developed indications of radicalization by the killers and of potential inspiration by foreign terrorist organizations,"" Comey said. He cautioned that the investigation has not yet shown evidence the couple was part of a larger group. Despite signs of the couple's radicalization, there ""is a lot of evidence that doesn't quite make sense"" at this early stage, he said. The Farook family attorneys, Chesley and Mohammad Abuershaid, said none of his relatives had any indication either Farook or his wife held extremist views. ""If the most evidence there is to any affiliation is a Facebook account under another person's name ... then that's hardly anything at all,"" Chesley said. He and Abuershaid said the family was shocked by the attack and mourns for the victims. They cautioned against rushing to judgment on their motivations. David Bowdich, head of the FBI's Los Angeles office, said ""a number of pieces of evidence"" point to terrorism and that the agency was focused on that idea ""for good reason."" He would not elaborate. Bowdich said investigators were looking carefully to determine if there is a connection to IS. In Pakistan, a relative of Malik says she apparently became a more zealous follower of the Muslim faith about three years ago. Hifza Batool told The Associated Press on Saturday that other relatives have said that Malik, who was her step-niece, used to wear Western clothes but began wearing the hijab head covering or the all-covering burqa donned by the most conservative Muslim women about three years ago. ""I recently heard it from relatives that she has become a religious person and she often tells people to live according to the teachings of Islam,"" said Batool, 35, a private school teacher who lives in Karor Lal Esam, about 450 kilometers (280 miles) southwest of the Pakistani capital of Islamabad. A Facebook official said Malik praised Islamic State in a post at 11 a.m. Wednesday, around the time the couple stormed a social service center where Farook's co-workers from San Bernardino County's health department had gathered. An Islamic State-affiliated news service called Malik and Farook ""supporters"" of their Islamist cause but stopped short of claiming responsibility for the attack. The U.S. official who revealed the Facebook post was not authorized to discuss the case publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Facebook official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not allowed under corporate policy to be quoted by name, said the company discovered Wednesday's post the next day, removed the profile from public view and reported its contents to law enforcement. Farook and Malik rented a townhome in Redlands, a few miles from the attack scene, where investigators said they found an arsenal of ammunition and homemade bombs. On Friday morning, the property's owner allowed reporters inside. The surreal scene — reporters walking among baby items, handling family photos and looking at dirty dishes in a sink — was broadcast live on cable TV. While it appeared unseemly, Bowdich said the FBI had finished investigating the home. Among things authorities had found were two cellphones that had been crushed in an apparent attempt to destroy the information inside. Investigators were trying to retrieve the data. ""We hope that will take us to their motivation,"" Bowdich said. Until Friday, federal and local law enforcement officials said terrorism was a possibility but that the violence could have stemmed from a workplace grudge. The Farook family attorneys said he told relatives he had been teased at work about his beard. They described Malik as a devoted home-keeper who closely followed religious traditions. They said Farook's mother never saw any of the weapons or bombs authorities found. The FBI questioned her Wednesday night and, according to the attorneys, said they would not release her until Farook's siblings came for questioning. The couple's orphaned daughter is in the care of child protective services and the family will try to recover her next week. Farook had no criminal record, and neither he nor his wife was under scrutiny by local or federal law enforcement before the attack, authorities said. Malik, 27, reportedly moved from her home country of Pakistan to Saudi Arabia and eventually came to the U.S. in 2014 on a fiancée visa. However, Saudi authorities say there is no record of her ever being a resident there. Farook, a restaurant inspector for the county, was born in Chicago to Pakistani parents and raised in Southern California. Farook went to the Dar Al Uloom Al Islamiyah of America mosque in San Bernardino every day but abruptly stopped coming three weeks ago. While many members said they knew Farook and described him as quiet and very studious, ""no one knows anything about his wife,"" said Mahmood Nadvi, son of the mosque's founder. Nadvi said FBI agents have questioned the mosque's leaders about the couple. Law enforcement officials have long warned that Americans acting in sympathy with Islamic extremists — though not on direct orders — could launch an attack inside the U.S. Using slick propaganda, the Islamic State in particular has urged sympathizers worldwide to commit violence in their countries. Others have done so. In May, just before he attacked a gathering in Texas of people drawing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad, a Phoenix man tweeted his hope that Allah would view him as a holy warrior. Two weeks ago, with Americans on edge over the Islamic State attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead, Comey said that U.S. authorities had no specific or credible intelligence pointing to an attack on American soil. Since March 2014, 71 people have been charged in the U.S. in connection with supporting IS, including 56 this year, according to a recent report from the George Washington University Program on Extremism. Though most are men, ""women are taking an increasingly prominent role in the jihadist world,"" the report said."

http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/05/oregon-gun-control,"Two years after the Sandy Hook massacre a patient, coordinated campaign led to Oregon passing a law demanding universal background checks for gun sales Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.18 BST Each new mass shooting in America feels like a recurring civic nightmare: Before California, there was Colorado. And before that, Oregon, so nothing is changing. But that’s not true, gun control advocates say. Beneath that horrific sameness, a change is afoot. Consider Oregon, they say.  Three years ago, following the massacre of children at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, several states including Oregon tried to enact their own gun controls instead of waiting on the US Congress, which failed to pass a widely supported background checks bill. Connecticut, New York, Delaware and Colorado passed laws requiring universal background checks for gun purchases – but nationally, states passed as many laws weakening their gun laws as strengthening them two years out from Sandy Hook. And Oregon seemed stuck. Then in May this year – more than two years later – background checks passed in Oregon. Something changed, but how? “People think it’s impossible. It’s not,” said Penny Okamoto, executive director of a group called Ceasefire Oregon. “There is a path.” She and other gun control advocates have developed a three-step approach to effecting change, and in many places, it seems to be working. “In the three years since Sandy Hook, 39 states have enacted 117 laws that strengthen gun violence prevention,” said Allison Anderman, a staff attorney for the national Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. The big change – the most effective law – is the requirement of universal background checks, and 18 states have adopted it. Oregon was the most recent. The first of three steps toward that change, Okamoto said, was a grassroots effort. Just as mass shootings are symbols used to terrorize populations, they can also be used to galvanize. “Sandy Hook was the turning point for us,” she said. “People got really angry.” During the grassroots phase, she said, her group and others “gained a lot of legislative experience”, which looked a lot like failure. During the two years in which Oregon’s state government seemed stalled, gun control advocates were learning what doesn’t work. Their failures were repeated and public, she said, but: “We got a lot of branding.” Local grassroots efforts had limits, though, Okamoto said. So the second step required outside help. “When the big groups came in, they brought the muscle that we didn’t have,” she said. She reeled off a list of large national gun control groups – the Brady Center, Everytown for Gun Safety, the Center for American Progress – who swooped in with budgets for political lobbying. “They were our answer to the NRA,” she said, referring to the National Rifle Association. “That put us on equal footing, politically.” In 2014 during Oregon’s midterm elections, the NRA poured cash into the coffers of pro-gun candidates, and a coalition of opponents poured money into the campaigns of anti-gun candidates. According to Everytown, which is backed by billionaire Michael Bloomberg, it alone funneled $600,000 into the state. The NRA made phone calls, sent mail, urged its members to contact their legislators. In the meantime Everytown bought ads on television and online. That’s when the effort in Oregon reached its third step. “If you ask people about ‘gun control’, they might say they don’t like it. But if you ask people about specifics, like assault rifles or background checks, they’re overwhelmingly for it. People want change,” Okamoto said. “So we put the vote in their hands.” It’s simple to vote in Oregon, which holds all elections by mail. When residents apply for drivers’ licenses they are automatically registered to vote, and about three weeks before an election they receive a ballot in the mail. They fill it out at home and send it back. “It’s so easy,” Okamoto said. By focusing on gun control, activists had essentially turned the election into a referendum on guns. When the dust – and the dollars – settled, two new Democratic candidates won seats in the state senate, and tipped the balance in favor of gun control. By May of this year Governor Kate Brown signed Senate bill 941, requiring background checks for all sales. It was the first major gun control law passed in Oregon in almost a decade and a half. “Last year Oregon got a D+ on our annual state gun law scorecard,” Allison Anderman, the Law Center attorney, said. This year’s scores have not been released yet, she said, but “Oregon’s score is significantly higher.” Tim Daly, the director for gun campaigns at the Center for American Progress, said Oregon offers a template for other states. “That is replicable for sure,” he said. “With tragedies like the most recent mass shooting in San Bernardino, we expect that same intense level of interest and momentum to bring change to other states as well.” His colleague Chelsea Parsons, though, warned that people on both sides of the gun issue – for and against – tend to feel hopeless or entrenched, in light of headlines about infamous mass shootings. “The bigger threat is more interpersonal violence that becomes fatal because of easy access to guns,” she said. The good news, she said, is that in the past three years 18 states have adopted laws to protect victims of domestic abuse from gun violence. “Momentum is clearly on our side,” Daly said. Each of the gun control advocates said a federal law is dramatically preferable because of what Anderman called the “iron pipeline”, the movement of weapons across state lines, from states with looser gun laws to those with tighter restrictions. And over time, some gun laws in some states haven’t stuck. In Colorado, for example, sweeping gun reforms passed after mass shootings in Aurora, Colorado, and Sandy Hook ended in an NRA-led recall of the legislators who spearheaded them, and partial repeal of those laws. But the state-by-state change – requiring slower, calculated steps – is change nonetheless. “Over 90% of the general population wants universal background checks,” she said, echoing the findings of a poll by Mayors Against Illegal Guns. “Eighty-three percent of gun owners want it, and 70% of NRA members want it. The American public is ready.”"

December 5, 2015 The president of Liberty University is urging students at the Christian school to carry concealed weapons on the Virginia campus following the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. President Jerry Falwell Jr.'s call for an armed campus was greeted by applause at a Friday night convocation on the Lynchburg campus. The News & Advance reports that Falwell encouraged students to take a free class to obtain a permit to carry a concealed weapon offered by the campus police department. He said, ""Let's teach them a lesson if they ever show up here."" Falwell said it ""just blows my mind"" that President Barack Obama called for more gun control laws. Liberty was founded by the Rev. Jerry Falwell Sr., who also launched the Moral Majority. “There is a trend. The gun lobby is picking up around a state a year,”  Andy Pelosi, director of the campaign Keep Guns off Campus, told The Christian Science Monitor in March. “Texas is one of 15 states this year where bills have been introduced to allow arms on campus, so it’s been a busy year,"" Mr. Pelosi says. ""Four states have defeated the bills, so there are 11 states left to work through this year. The biggest are Florida, Texas, and Nevada.” At least 20 states allow some form of campus carry. However, only nine states have made it a right defined in state law, according to ArmedCampuses.org, a project of The Campaign to Keep Guns Off Campus and The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. Currently, schools in Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Oregon, Utah, Texas, and Wisconsin are required in some way to allow the carrying of firearms on their premises. Many of the Republican presidential candidates have supported moves to carry guns on campus. But in Texas, many faculty oppose the new law. In Texas, home to a massive public university system with more than 200,000 students, many faculty are staunchly opposed to a law set to go into effect this summer, which will let students bring their weapons not just on campus, but into class. The concealed carry law, which would apply to public schools, is set to go into effect on August 1, 2016, the 50th anniversary of University of Texas student Charles Whitman’s 1966 massacre, when he climbed the UT-Austin clock tower and killed 16 people – the worst US college shooting until 2007. Supporters say that more guns, not fewer, are exactly what it takes to stop such deadly attacks. But more than 300 faculty disagree, and have signed a petition stating they will not permit armed students into their class. Already a subscriber?

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in.

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/san-bernardino-shooting-attack-fears-us-cities/,"Watch CBSN Live  December 5, 2015 / 11:44 AM
          / CBS/AP HOOVER, Ala. -- Anita Jefferson didn't know much about San Bernardino, California, before the apparent terror attack there. The West Coast town is nearly the exact same size as her hometown of Birmingham and hardly a high-profile target like New York or Paris. Now, she finds herself worried about the possibility of an attack at a location like the suburban shopping mall where Jefferson works at a food kiosk for the Christmas shopping season. A place that's public but, unlike stadiums and other venues, has relatively lax security. ""You'd think they'd go to a larger place, but a smaller place may be easier,"" said Jefferson, 62. The FBI announced Friday that it was investigating the mass shooting that left 14 people dead at a holiday party as an act of terrorism. The couple who carried out the shooting, Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, died in a gunbattle with police. If there could be a terror attack at a social services center in San Bernardino, why not suburban Alabama, or downtown Louisville, Kentucky? The bloody attack made it all too obvious for some Americans that big cities with marquee names aren't the only potential targets. ""I can honestly say I don't feel as safe,"" said Tim Harrington, 50, of Jacksonville, Florida, while touring a museum in Louisville. There is plenty of security at the suburban Birmingham mall - ""and they're awesome,"" said Lindsay Alexander, 18, who also works there and feels safe. But her comfort level isn't what it was a few days ago. ""It could happen here,"" said Alexander. ""They could just pick something random."" FBI Director James Comey said it appears Farook and Malik were radicalized and potentially inspired by foreign terrorist organizations, but beyond that, much remains unknown, CBS News correspondent Julianna Goldman reports. Sources told CBS News that right before the rampage Malik, using another name, went on Facebook and pledged her allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, and its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. But the terror group isn't claiming responsibility for the attack. Comey said so far there's no sign anyone from ISIS communicated with them or provided any guidance. Psychology professor Marjorie Sanfilippo doesn't believe people will change their behavior because of the San Bernardino shootings. ""People are very resilient tend to get back to their regular lives,"" said Sanfilippo, who teaches at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, Florida. But, she cautioned, that could change if there were more ""random attacks"" in public places, such as coffee shops. ""That's when I think we would see fear,"" said Sanfilippo. Residents in Lincoln, Nebraska - which didn't experience its first homicide of 2015 until last month - said the attacks hadn't affected their sense of security. ""If they're looking for a mass killing, they're going to go to places with more people,"" said Nate Jurgensmeier, a 19-year-old sophomore at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. ""They're not going to kill nearly as many people if they crash into a dorm building or a building in downtown Lincoln."" Matt Eckhardt, 30, of Lincoln also considers his city safe. ""If you were living in New York, I think your perspective would be a lot different than ours,"" Eckhardt said. Yet in Louisville, Nautica Delacruz of Los Angeles said the attacks in her home state had shaken her sense of security. ""You kind of just want to go to work and home, or pick up your kid and go straight home,"" she said. ""You really don't want to go anywhere. You kind of feel like you're violated in a sense of your freedom, in a way. You don't feel safe going anywhere anymore."" At the Louisville museum, Harrington said the threat of terror already is making him re-evaluate his safety. He has cut back on international travel for business, and he said he doesn't feel as safe as he once did in office buildings. Harrington said he isn't changing domestic travel plans, and he feels secure going to NFL games in his hometown of Jacksonville, Florida. ""But definitely, I think if I'm in a crowd of people outside where I don't see policemen, I'd kind of be a little bit more fearful,"" he said. Standing in the middle of the Alabama mall crowded with holiday shoppers, a brightly lit carousel twirling in the food court, Jefferson said she is doing her best not to worry, but: ""It's in the back of your head.""

http://www.mercurynews.com/california/ci_29202737/california-jerry-brown-climate-change-paris?source=rss,"Trending: AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli Calif. Gov. Jerry Brown, discusses the  scaling back of proposal  to address climate change that he supported during a news conference, Wednesday, Sept. 9, 2015, in Sacramento, Calif.  Citing opposition from the oil industry, Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon, D- Los Angeles, said he was dropping a mandate in his bill, SB350, that the state cut petroleum use by 50 percent.(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli)    With glaciers melting, sea levels rising and 2015 about to break last year’s record as the hottest year in the world since modern measurements began in 1880, California Gov. Jerry Brown arrived Saturday at the international climate summit in Paris, bringing with him business executives, political leaders and huge hopes that the trip will make a major difference. Brown is not a president or a prime minister like the roughly 150 world leaders in Paris trying to strike an agreement to slow the rise in temperatures. But he has been acting like one — which is increasingly drawing both cheers and criticism. In recent months, the 77-year-old Democratic governor has met with the presidents of China and other countries, as well as Pope Francis, to discuss climate change. He has signed agreements with 60 states, cities and provinces in 20 countries, pledging to cut carbon pollution 80 percent by 2050. And this week he signed a pledge with 12 states and countries — including Germany, Norway, the United Kingdom and Quebec — to require that all new cars sold in their regions emit no pollution by 2050. “Jerry Brown was never elected president, but he sure wanted to be,” said Larry Sabato, a political science professor at the University of Virginia. “In this sense, I guess he’s playing president. Nobody says to him, ‘You’re a rookie; you don’t know what you are doing.’ He is probably the most experienced high-level official in the country. It’s unusual, but then Jerry Brown has always been unusual.” As Republican leaders in Congress have blocked efforts to pass national laws limiting the burning of fossil fuels, Brown is orchestrating an end-run around them, Sabato and other political experts say. Simply put, he is taking California — the eighth-largest economy in the world and a state with 38 million residents, Silicon Valley, Hollywood and political muscle — to a prominent world leadership role. He is locking in some of the toughest global warming laws and renewable energy targets on Earth — and striking deals to spread them. “Climate change is not limited to the borders of California,” Brown said this week in an interview with this newspaper. “If we do everything right, we will absolutely fail. We won’t even make a dent. But if we can enlist others who might otherwise be somewhat reluctant, we really do advance the cause.” California has been first in passing environmental laws for half a century, under both Republican and Democratic governors. In 1967, GOP Gov. Ronald Reagan set up the state’s Air Resources Board, which dramatically cut the pollution from cars and factories, in addition to phasing out leaded gasoline — moves later copied by the federal government. Brown approved America’s toughest coastal protection laws in his first term as governor in the 1970s. And in 2006 Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the nation’s only state law requiring power plants, factories and oil refineries to cut greenhouse gas emissions, over their protests and lawsuits. Now, Brown says, the state must demonstrate that it is possible to wean society off fossil fuels while still growing the economy. He notes that California has cut greenhouse gas emissions 7 percent since 2004, while the state’s annual economic output has grown from $1.5 trillion to $2.2 trillion. This time, however, GOP leaders in Sacramento aren’t joining the parade. “The most important issue in the world today is the lives of the people of this planet as affected by the Islamic terrorists who are trying to behead and kill us,” said Sen. Jim Nielsen, R-Roseville. “Climate change has ebbed and flowed for eons. Mankind can deal with it intelligently. But I have serious doubts about our resolve in dealing with terrorists.” In a city still reeling from the Nov. 13 terrorist attack, Brown will attend 20 meetings, speaking at many of them, over five days. On Thursday, to spend more time in San Bernardino following the mass shooting, he delayed the trip by one day, canceling an appearance in Paris with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Other Californians attending the climate conference include Schwarzenegger; billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer of San Francisco; the Democratic leaders of the state Senate and Assembly; Tony Earley, the CEO of PG&E; Bernard Tyson, CEO of Kaiser Permanente; and top executives from Bank of America, Calpine, Solar City, Dignity Health and Bloom Energy. Although Silicon Valley executives support the climate push, oil industry leaders say Brown is moving too fast, threatening their industry and risking leaving low-income residents behind. “There are areas in the state that are doing very well and other areas that are not doing very well,” said Jay McKeeman, spokesman for the California Independent Oil Marketers Association. “People in the Central Valley, and agricultural workers, have to drive long distances. It’s the nature of the business. If you are parked out in a field somewhere, you can’t easily recharge an electric car.” Of Republican leaders who say the science isn’t clear, Brown said: “It’s absolute nonsense. They are either intellectually lazy and have done no study at all, or they’re cynical.”The vast majority of the world’s climate scientists and organizations such as NASA, NOAA, the National Academy of Sciences and the World Meteorological Organization say the planet is warming because the buildup of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere from burning coal, gasoline and other fossil fuels is trapping heat. Greenhouse gas concentrations are now at their highest level in at least 800,000 years, according to measurements of air bubbles in ice cores from Antarctica. Environmentalists — who note the state has a lot at stake, including its Sierra snowpack and increased risks of droughts and forest fires — are praising Brown’s actions. He signed a law in 2011 requiring 33 percent of the state’s electricity to come from solar, wind and other renewable sources — and this year upped that requirement to 50 percent by 2030. “California has been a shining light that shows the rest of the world that Americans care about climate change,” said Kathryn Phillips, executive director of Sierra Club California. But environmental groups have also criticized Brown on several fronts — particularly for not banning fracking, a controversial oil production practice that has been banned in New York state and elsewhere. Brown said he’s trying to continue to reduce oil demand in California through boosting electric vehicle mandates and subsidies, along with other policies, but it must be done in an orderly way. “We already import 70 percent of the oil that goes into our vehicles,” he said. “And what do they want to do? Import 75 percent? And bring it in by train from North Dakota?” So far, Californians –if not Americans as a whole –seem to be on board. A Public Policy Institute of California poll this week found that 80 percent of Californians believe climate change is a “very serious” or “somewhat serious” problem. “California is a leader, taking bold steps,” Brown said. “But we don’t want to just be the exception. We want to be the norm. We want others to join with us, and they are.” Paul Rogers covers resources and environmental issues. Contact him at 408-920-5045.

http://www.ibtimes.com/even-guns-proliferate-us-official-data-firearms-remain-scarce-2212590,"Seventeen years after his father was shot and killed in a robbery attempt, Eduardo Franco, who is from Brazil, found a way to shed light on fatalities and injuries in another country with a long history of gun violence: the United States. True, he is an outsider on the topic. Franco is a cancer epidemiologist, not an expert in firearms and public health. Though he spent five years in the U.S., he now lives and works in Montreal where he is a professor and chairman of the oncology department at McGill University. But in 2013 Franco became editor-in-chief of the journal Preventive Medicine, giving him a “bully pulpit,” he says. Researchers have long tackled health consequences associated with tobacco, asbestos and automobile safety. With guns, however, the body of academic research on death and injury prevention is slim. It's so scarce, in fact, that when Franco dedicated an entire issue to the subject in October, he estimated that the mere 10 published papers would account a significant portion of this year’s output on guns in medical and public health literature. “I consider this the last low-hanging fruit in all of public health,” Franco said. With each tragic mass shooting like the one in San Bernardino, California, on Wednesday, Americans search for answers to basic questions about guns. Just how many guns are there in the U.S.? How many are sold each year? Are people more likely to die from a gun in areas where ownership is high? Guns kill more than 32,000 people a year in the U.S. and injure another 67,000, according to an analysis published in the October issue of Preventive Medicine. Firearm suicides and firearm homicides are among the leading causes of injury deaths in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Yet, there is much that public health researchers don’t know about firearms. By law, the federal government cannot register and track gun purchases. A dearth of financial support for research is also part of the reason little data exists, and many institutions and medical experts fear that pursuing the topic will attract controversy. But as a result, experts say they lack the data they need to make recommendations that might reduce injuries and prevent deaths. “How do we combat an epidemic?” asksed Bindu Kalesan, a professor at Boston University’s School of Medicine. “We do case control studies to see: What is the culprit? Where is the first case? Then we combat it. That is public health.” Employees and other people are evacuated by bus from the site of a mass shooting Dec. 2, 2015, in San Bernardino, California.  Photo: David McNew/Getty Images Kalesan’s research includes how firearm fatality rates differ by state, and by race, as well as how hospitalization rates of children with gunshot injuries vary by race, ethnicity and income. She is very interested in studying gun sales patterns -- which guns are used in crimes, where they were bought and who owned them along the way. To do that, Kalesan would need a control group -- a dataset of guns that haven’t been used in crimes -- so she can identify the factors that make a particular gun more likely to be used in committing a crime. The data she seeks is unattainable. The Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986 forbids the creation of a national registry of gun sales. “My science is about comparisons,” Kalesan said. “If you do not have the right comparison, my science kind of dies.” Jon Vernick, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, tells his students that our best estimate of how many guns are in private hands in the U.S., about 300 million, is just that -- an estimate. It comes from telephone survey data. The closest proxy for sales data is FBI background checks run on purchases conducted at federally licensed gun stores, but Vernick said “our best estimate” is that about 40 percent of gun transactions involve private sales, for which no background check is required. Thirty-two states don’t extend background checks into any private sales. Ten states and the District of Columbia have a licensing system. “It’s a problem that we don’t know with precision how many guns are sold, and it’s a problem that we don’t know about America’s gun stock with greater precision,” Vernick said. Data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives provides some insights into how many handguns and long guns are manufactured in the U.S., and exported and imported each year. However, “we don’t know, for example, how many are AR-15s,” he said, or how many handguns are good  quality “versus how many are poorly made, inexpensive guns.” How would such data be useful? Vernick draws a comparison to the data the federal government maintains on car safety and accidents, including analysis of crash scenes. Per mile driven, the rate of motor vehicle fatalities has decreased more than 75 percent since the 1960s, Vernick says. “One of the reasons we’ve been able to do that is through the kind of research that tells us what’s risky, and what’s not, and what kind of interventions reduce that risk, and which don’t.” By contrast, “we can’t figure out with precision, which guns are riskier than others,” Vernick says. Guns are piled on the ground during the destruction of approximately 3,400 guns and other weapons at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 22nd annual gun melt at Gerdau Steel Mill, July 6, 2015, in Rancho Cucamonga, California. California law requires the destruction of confiscated weapons.  Photo: David McNew/Getty Images Funding for public health research into firearm injuries took a hit in 1996, when lawmakers and the National Rifle Association (NRA) clamored for an end to federally backed studies that could advocate for gun control. That year, Congress sent a powerful message to researchers when it instructed the CDC it could not use funds to ""advocate or promote gun control."" The CDC has barely touched the topic of gun violence since, and researchers said the move had a widespread, chilling effect. Eduardo Franco said fear has held back the scientific community for too long. “They are not lobbying for more interest in gun violence because, well, I’ll tell you like it is: They’re afraid. They’re afraid they’re going to be ostracized. They’re afraid the NRA is going to ridicule them.” Recently some groups are speaking up. Hours before the mass shooting in San Bernardino Wednesday, the group Doctors for America presented a petition in Washington, demanding the effective federal funding ban be lifted. “Since 1996, the federal government has spent $240 million a year on traffic safety research, which has saved 360,000 lives since 1970,” the group said in a statement joined by more than 2,000 physicians. “During that same period, there has been almost no publicly funded research on gun violence, which kills the same number of people every year.” The dearth of government funding is not the only money problem. “Almost all major foundations are afraid to take this up because they don’t want the hassle,” said David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center. It’s also hard to piggyback on work being done by other organizations. “Gun questions are hard to put on other people’s surveys because they’re afraid to put them on,” he said. “They’re afraid they’ll get bad feedback.” The CDC used to include several questions in its Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey about whether the respondent had a gun in the house, and how the gun was stored. It stopped including those questions in 2004, Hemenway said. Hemenway is a leading researcher on gun deaths among children, and he was one of the guest editors for the special issue of Preventive Medicine. He finds it difficult to encourage doctoral students to follow in his footsteps. “You don’t want to go out into the field and be a gun researcher because you’re not going to be able to make ends meet.” An important advancement experts point to is the creation of the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). It captures details about a person’s death from multiple sources, including a medical examiner’s narrative, and, oftentimes, crime lab data about the make and model of the gun involved. This additional information can make a big difference in how a death is categorized and therefore in how researchers and policymakers might formulate a response to it. Hemenway said children’s firearm fatalities are often misclassified as homicides when many are, in fact, unintentional shootings that could possibly have been prevented. His research shows when using the NVDRS, compared to the long-standing vital statistics system, the real number of unintentional gun fatalities among children “is about 80 percent higher.” “It’s a wonderful data system,” Hemenway said. The NVDRS, however, isn’t employed in all states. It has gradually expanded to 32 states. The holdup? “It’s funded by Congress,” he said, “but in their wisdom, they don’t fund it all.” Franco said in public health there is no one article that cracks the case. “No individual study solves anything, but they do add this little building block of knowledge.” Researchers who studied tobacco, asbestos, and motor vehicles all encountered pushback from industry. Franco believes opposition pushed researchers in those areas to do better. Gun violence, he conceded, is a more complex undertaking than other public health concerns. All around the world firearms are integral to countries’ defense systems. In the U.S.  in particular, he said, “it is this combination of personal rights and entrepreneurial spirit, plus that fear of intervention by Big Brother, by the government.” It is not going to be simple. “Which,” said Franco, who dedicated the issue of Preventive Medicine in his father’s memory, “is going to require more brain power.”"
http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2015/12/woman_at_center_of_fbi_investi.html," Gallery: San Bernardino shooting - Suspect's apartment This undated photo shows Tashfeen Malik. SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) -- The Pakistani woman who joined her U.S.-born husband in killing 14 people in a commando-style assault on his co-workers is now at the center of a massive FBI terrorism investigation, yet she remains shrouded in mystery. The FBI acknowledges knowing little about Tashfeen Malik. Those who attended mosque with her husband, Syed Farook, said they know nearly nothing of her. Even Farook's mother, who lived with the couple and their 6-month-old daughter, knows little, according to attorneys for Farook's family. The lawyers on Friday described the 27-year-old as ""just a housewife"" who was quiet like her husband and strictly followed Muslim custom. She wore traditional clothing that covered her face so her male relatives didn't even know what she looked like, according to the lawyers who represent Farook's mother and three siblings. Authorities say she ditched the Muslim garb for a combat-style outfit Wednesday, when she and Farook attacked a training session and holiday luncheon in San Bernardino. A few hours later, they were killed in a shootout with police. The FBI announced Friday it is investigating the mass shooting as an act of terrorism. If proven to be terrorism, it would be the deadliest attack by Islamic extremists on American soil since Sept. 11, 2001. A U.S. law enforcement official said Malik used a Facebook alias to pledge her allegiance to the Islamic State group and its leader just before the shootings. FBI Director James Comey would not discuss whether anyone affiliated with IS communicated back, but he said there was no indication yet that the plot was directed by any other foreign terror group. ""The investigation so far has developed indications of radicalization by the killers and of potential inspiration by foreign terrorist organizations,"" Comey said. He cautioned that the investigation has not yet shown evidence the couple was part of a larger group. Despite signs of the couple's radicalization, there ""is a lot of evidence that doesn't quite make sense"" at this early stage, he said. The Farook family attorneys, Chesley and Mohammad Abuershaid, said none of his relatives had any indication either Farook or his wife held extremist views. ""If the most evidence there is to any affiliation is a Facebook account under another person's name ... then that's hardly anything at all,"" Chesley said. He and Abuershaid said the family was shocked by the attack and mourns for the victims. They cautioned against rushing to judgment on their motivations. David Bowdich, head of the FBI's Los Angeles office, said ""a number of pieces of evidence"" point to terrorism and that the agency was focused on that idea ""for good reason."" He would not elaborate. Bowdich said investigators were looking carefully to determine if there is a connection to IS. In Pakistan, a relative of Malik says she apparently became a more zealous follower of the Muslim faith about three years ago. Hifza Batool told The Associated Press on Saturday that other relatives have said that Malik, who was her step-niece, used to wear Western clothes but began wearing the hijab head covering or the all-covering burqa donned by the most conservative Muslim women about three years ago. ""I recently heard it from relatives that she has become a religious person and she often tells people to live according to the teachings of Islam,"" said Batool, 35, a private school teacher who lives in Karor Lal Esam, about 450 kilometers (280 miles) southwest of the Pakistani capital of Islamabad. A Facebook official said Malik praised Islamic State in a post at 11 a.m. Wednesday, around the time the couple stormed a social service center where Farook's co-workers from San Bernardino County's health department had gathered. An Islamic State-affiliated news service called Malik and Farook ""supporters"" of their Islamist cause but stopped short of claiming responsibility for the attack. The U.S. official who revealed the Facebook post was not authorized to discuss the case publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Facebook official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not allowed under corporate policy to be quoted by name, said the company discovered Wednesday's post the next day, removed the profile from public view and reported its contents to law enforcement. Farook and Malik rented a townhome in Redlands, a few miles from the attack scene, where investigators said they found an arsenal of ammunition and homemade bombs. On Friday morning, the property's owner allowed reporters inside. The surreal scene -- reporters walking among baby items, handling family photos and looking at dirty dishes in a sink -- was broadcast live on cable TV. While it appeared unseemly, Bowdich said the FBI had finished investigating the home. Among things authorities had found were two cellphones that had been crushed in an apparent attempt to destroy the information inside. Investigators were trying to retrieve the data. ""We hope that will take us to their motivation,"" Bowdich said. Until Friday, federal and local law enforcement officials said terrorism was a possibility but that the violence could have stemmed from a workplace grudge. The Farook family attorneys said he told relatives he had been teased at work about his beard. They described Malik as a devoted home-keeper who closely followed religious traditions. They said Farook's mother never saw any of the weapons or bombs authorities found. The FBI questioned her Wednesday night and, according to the attorneys, said they would not release her until Farook's siblings came for questioning. The couple's orphaned daughter is in the care of child protective services and the family will try to recover her next week. Farook had no criminal record, and neither he nor his wife was under scrutiny by local or federal law enforcement before the attack, authorities said. Malik, 27, reportedly moved from her home country of Pakistan to Saudi Arabia and eventually came to the U.S. in 2014 on a fiancee visa. However, Saudi authorities say there is no record of her ever being a resident there. Farook, a restaurant inspector for the county, was born in Chicago to Pakistani parents and raised in Southern California. Farook went to the Dar Al Uloom Al Islamiyah of America mosque in San Bernardino every day but abruptly stopped coming three weeks ago. While many members said they knew Farook and described him as quiet and very studious, ""no one knows anything about his wife,"" said Mahmood Nadvi, son of the mosque's founder. Nadvi said FBI agents have questioned the mosque's leaders about the couple. Law enforcement officials have long warned that Americans acting in sympathy with Islamic extremists -- though not on direct orders -- could launch an attack inside the U.S. Using slick propaganda, the Islamic State in particular has urged sympathizers worldwide to commit violence in their countries. Others have done so. In May, just before he attacked a gathering in Texas of people drawing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad, a Phoenix man tweeted his hope that Allah would view him as a holy warrior. Two weeks ago, with Americans on edge over the Islamic State attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead, Comey said that U.S. authorities had no specific or credible intelligence pointing to an attack on American soil. Since March 2014, 71 people have been charged in the U.S. in connection with supporting IS, including 56 this year, according to a recent report from the George Washington University Program on Extremism. Though most are men, ""women are taking an increasingly prominent role in the jihadist world,"" the report said.

http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/05/liberty-university-president-san-bernardino-shooting-concealed-weapons-carry-muslims,"Jerry Falwell Jr says remarks to students referred to San Bernardino attackers and notes that only students over 21 would be armed under Virginia law First published on Sat 5 Dec 2015 18.02 GMT The president of Liberty University urged students, staff and faculty at the Christian school to carry concealed weapons on campus to counter any possible armed attack like the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. “Let’s teach them a lesson if they ever show up here,” President Jerry Falwell Jr told an estimated 10,000 students at the weekly convocation held on Friday in Lynchburg.  The call-to-arms was met with rousing applause from students, but some said Falwell went too far when he appeared to be referring specifically to Muslims, the News & Advance reported. “I’ve always thought if more good people had concealed carry permits, then we could end those Muslims before they walked in,” Falwell said. The final words of his statement could not be clearly heard on a videotape of the remarks. Questioned by a student on social media, Falwell said he was referring to Islamic terrorists. “I was referring to ‘those Muslims’ that just carried out attacks in Paris and California,” he said in response on Twitter. Reached later by the newspaper, Falwell said, “There are many good Muslims, many good, moderate Muslims.” Falwell told the Associated Press on Saturday he was specifically referring to Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik, the husband and wife who shot and killed 14 people at a holiday party in San Bernardino on Wednesday. In his call to arms, Falwell encouraged students to take a free class offered by campus police to obtain a permit to carry a concealed weapon. Falwell’s message is apparently being heeded. He said more than 100 people had asked Liberty police about a free class to obtain a permit to carry a concealed weapon. More than 14,000 students are enrolled at Liberty. Following the San Bernardino shootings, which left 14 dead, Falwell said he began carrying a .25-caliber handgun in his back pocket. He said he’s had a permit for more than year. During his address Friday, Falwell mentioned the weapon and reached around seemingly to fetch it. “Is it illegal to pull it out? I don’t know,” he said, laughing, drawing some hoots from the audience. Asked if he was concerned by the prospect of thousands of armed young people on campus, Falwell said Virginia has a minimum age of 21 for a concealed-carry permit. He said that meant only older students would be armed. Falwell also said he believed the campus needed to be prepared in the face of the increasing frequency of mass killings. He cited, for example, the 2007 massacre of 32 people at Virginia Tech, the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, which took place less than 100 miles south-west of Liberty. “What if just one of those students or one of those faculty members had a concealed permit and was carrying a weapon when the shooter walked into Virginia Tech? Countless lives could have been saved,” he said. Falwell said he had also reached out to a first responder in San Bernardino to see if the school could offer scholarships to his children. Unlike his late father, the Rev Jerry Falwell, the younger Falwell has been a low-key leader at Liberty. His father’s barbed statements on contemporary issues made him a reviled figure to some and a pioneering conservative crusader to others. “That’s not my thing,” Falwell said in an interview with the AP earlier this year at Liberty, which was founded by his father. Students are required to attend the weekly convocations, although they may skip one convocation per term for personal reasons. Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders held a campaign event at the university in September."
http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/126686299/0/usatoday-newstopstories~New-York-Times-puts-gun-debate-editorial-on-Page-One/,"The New York Times published an editorial Saturday on its front page for the first time in nearly 100 years, one calling for greater steps on gun control. The editorial comes days after 14 people were gunned down at a social services center in San Bernardino, Calif., two weeks after a shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic and in a six-month span that has seen high-profile shootings in Charleston, S.C., Lafayette, La., and Roanoke, Va. USA TODAY ISIL radio: Two 'supporters' carried out San Bernardino massacre The words in ""End the Gun Epidemic in America"" are powerful, calling the gun situation ""a moral outrage and national disgrace."" The editorial calls for reducing the number of firearms in this country and even eliminating some types of weapons and ammunition. It is striking that in the digital age the Times was using the power of print to state its case. Still, the editorial was generating lots of buzz on social media Saturday morning. ""All decent people feel sorrow and righteous fury about the latest slaughter of innocents, in California. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies are searching for motivations, including the vital question of how the murderers might have been connected to international terrorism. That is right and proper,"" the editorial says. ARGUS LEADER Lawmaker asks education secretary to step down ""But motives do not matter to the dead in California, nor did they in Colorado, Oregon, South Carolina, Virginia, Connecticut and far too many other places,"" it continues. ""The attention and anger of Americans should also be directed at the elected leaders whose  job is to keep us safe but who place a higher premium on the money and political power of an industry dedicated to profiting from the unfettered spread of ever more powerful firearms."" The editorial concludes by asking this question: ""What better time than during a presidential election to show, at long last, that our nation has retained its sense of decency?"" The front page of The New York Times for Saturday, Dec. 5. pic.twitter.com/XsyKGA4Vrk In a statement, publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. said the paper wanted to ""deliver a strong and visible statement of frustration and anguish about our country's inability to come to terms with the scourge of guns."". The Times is not the first to use its coveted real estate on Page One to weigh in on the debate. On Thursday, the New York Daily News went with a provocative Page One that displayed a collection of Twitter posts from GOP politicians who offered thoughts and prayers for the California shooting victims built around the headline: ""God Isn't Fixing This."" The last time the Times ran a Page One editorial was in June 1920, when it commented on the nomination of Warren Harding as the GOP presidential candidate. On the day of the San Bernardino shooting, USA TODAY published ""Another (mass shooting) day in USA: Our view"" in which the Editorial Board wrote that ""restrictions that bar people from legally buying guns have remained largely the same for almost 50 years; they merit being updated to screen out more people who have displayed violent behavior.""

http://www.inquisitr.com/2612148/constituents-of-colorado-republican-organizing-recall/,"The mass shooting at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood on Friday has attracted a lot of opinions regarding who, exactly, is to blame for the attack. Adams County state Rep. JoAnn Windholz essentially condoned the mass killings when she blamed them for the attack, but her constituents are not having it and now aim to remove her from her position. Republican state Rep. JoAnn Windholz is about to be haunted by the words she so callously used to lay blame at the feet of an organization that is constantly being attacked. In a post that has since been removed, Windholtz said that Planned Parenthood needed to end their violence before violence against them is ended. The fact that three innocent lives were lost in the shooting seems to have had no bearing on the state representative's empathy.  The paper continues to outline that an attack carried out by an unhinged, well-armed extremist could never be the fault of an organization whose mission is to provide medical care to those in need. The fact that Windholz blames Planned Parenthood for the heinous murders and multiple injuries that occurred at their Colorado Springs clinic on Friday is being called the ""worst propaganda."" The hateful and hurtful comments are unbecoming of any elected representative. It is the view of a growing collective that if the representative fails to resign, then the Republican Party and her fellow members of the House should be prepared to oust her.  News.groopspeak has a quote from Cohen regarding his reasons for wanting Representative JoAnn Windholz out of office.    Rep. JoAnn Windholz - R faces recall after saying the 'real culprit' is #PlannedParenthood https://t.co/OVkob45W4F pic.twitter.com/PI2BoEODvn — WarOnWomen (@WarAgainstWomen) December 5, 2015  Rep. JoAnn Windholz - R faces recall after saying the 'real culprit' is #PlannedParenthood https://t.co/OVkob45W4F pic.twitter.com/PI2BoEODvn — WarOnWomen (@WarAgainstWomen) December 5, 2015  Some also remarked that anyone who won their seat by a small a margin as Windholz should really have been more careful with their words. One of the reasons why the recall may be entirely possible is because she reportedly only came to power after winning with 106 votes out of a total of 18,858 votes cast in 2014. In order for the recall to go through, those working towards that goal only need a total of 5,000 signatures. There is also no legal outline for why a recall is necessary, it is up to the voters. Anyone who lives in the Aurora/Adams County area of Colorado and wants to oust Windholz is being advised to join the Facebook group or to donate to the GoFundMe account.

http://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/05/san-bernardino-killers-were-our-followers-isis-claims.html," Islamic State said on Saturday that the married couple who killed  14 people in a mass shooting in California which the U.S.  authorities are investigating as an act of terrorism were its  followers. The militant group made the statement in an online radio  broadcast three days after U.S.-born Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and  his wife Tashfeen Malik, 29, from Pakistan, attacked a holiday  party for civil servants in San Bernardino, about 60 miles (100  km) east of Los Angeles. The pair were killed two hours later in a shootout with police. Officials with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is  leading the probe into the shooting, said Malik and her husband  appeared to have been inspired by foreign militant groups but  there was no sign they had worked with any of them or that  Islamic State even knew who they were. Read MoreFBI investigating San Bernardino shootings as 'terrorism' ""It is entirely possible that these two attackers were  radicalized to commit this act of terror,"" U.S. President Barack  Obama said in a radio address on Saturday. ""If so, it would  underscore a threat we've been focused on for years, the danger  of people succumbing to violent extremist ideologies."" If the Dec. 2 mass shooting proves to have been the work of  people inspired by Islamist militants, it would mark the  deadliest such attack in the United States since Sept. 11, 2001. Islamic State also claimed responsibility for a Nov. 13 series of  attacks in Paris in which gunmen and suicide bombers killed 130  people. ""Two followers of Islamic State attacked several days ago a  center in San Bernardino in California,"" the group's daily online  radio broadcast al-Bayan said on Saturday. An English-language version of the broadcast was later released  calling the attackers ""soldiers"" of Islamic State, rather than  ""followers"" as in the original Arabic version. It was unclear if  the English version was claiming them as members, or why there  was an inconsistency. The broadcast came a day after Facebook confirmed that comments  praising Islamic State were posted around the time of the mass  shooting to an account on the social media website established by  Malik under an alias. However, it was uncertain whether the comments were posted by  Malik herself or someone with access to her page. The couple had two assault-style rifles, two semi-automatic  handguns, 6,100 rounds of ammunition and 12 pipe bombs in their  home or with them when they were killed, officials said. The  large arsenal could indicate they were planning further attacks. The attack sparked a new round of the firearms debate with Obama  and the New York Times calling for new limits on gun ownership.  Many pro-gun voices, including some Republican contenders for the  White House, said the new laws would not have stopped the  rampage. ""It's another tragic reminder that here in America it's way too  easy for dangerous people to get their hands on a gun,"" said  Obama. The New York Times, in its first front-page editorial since 1920,  said it was ""a moral outrage and a national disgrace"" that the  sort of firearms used in the attack were readily available. ""These are weapons of war, barely modified and deliberately  marketed as tools of macho vigilantism and even insurrection,""  the newspaper said. The newspaper's publisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr, said that the  editorial was intended ""to deliver a strong and visible statement  of frustration and anguish about our country's inability to come  to terms with the scourge of guns."" But Republican White House frontrunner Donald Trump dismissed the  New York Times' call for action. ""People in this country and the world need protection,"" Trump  told reporters in Iowa before a campaign event. ""If you look at  Paris, they didn't have guns and they were slaughtered. If you  look at California, they didn't have guns and they were  slaughtered."" U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Republican also seeking  the presidential nomination, said restrictions on guns would not  have stopped the California attack or other mass shootings,  including recent attacks on an Oregon college and a Planned  Parenthood health clinic in Colorado. Citing an unnamed federal law enforcement official, the Los  Angeles Times reported that Farook had ""some kind"" of contact  with people from the Nusra Front and the radical Shabab group in  Somalia, though the nature of that contact was unclear. FBI Director James Comey said on Friday that the investigation  suggested the attackers had possibly been inspired by ""foreign  terrorist organizations"" but added there was no evidence they  were part of a larger group. Farook family attorneys on Friday denied there was any evidence  that either the husband or wife harbored extremist views. She spoke broken English and her primary language was Urdu,  Farook family attorney David Chesley said, adding: ""She was very  conservative."" They said Farook, too, largely kept to himself,  had few friends and said co-workers sometimes made fun of his  beard. Pakistani intelligence officials have contacted Malik's family in  her homeland as part of the investigation, a family member said. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/05/oakland-shooting-hearing-oikos-university-psychiatrist-one-goh,"Dr Jessica Ferranti was first of five experts to testify about mental fitness of One Goh, who allegedly killed seven people at Oikos University three years ago Last modified on Fri 14 Jul 2017 21.23 BST While the world focused its attention on the mass shooting in San Bernardino, a psychiatrist testifying in a northern California courtroom described the deranged thinking of a man believed responsible for another mass homicide. One Goh bought a gun he used to kill seven people at Oikos University in 2012 to try to “spook” the Oakland school’s administrators, who he believed planted a tracking device in his car and cameras in his home, Dr Jessica Ferranti testified this week.  Goh, 47, suffers from paranoid schizophrenia and is incompetent to stand trial for the killings at the tiny Christian college where he once studied nursing, she said. A University of California at Davis forensic psychiatry professor, Ferranti spent two days on the witness stand and was the first of five experts scheduled to testify about Goh’s fitness for trial in Alameda County superior court in Oakland this month. The hearing offers a rare view into the psyche of an alleged mass shooter who lived to tell his story. Wearing a red jail suit and flip-flops, Goh addressed the court only once at the beginning of the proceeding. When Judge Gloria Rhynes asked if One L Goh was his true and correct name, he looked at her, nodded, replied “yes”, then stared down through his black glasses at his hands shackled in his lap. The husband, the daughter and the fiancé of two women slain at Oikos struggled to find a comfortable posture in wooden courtroom chairs. They listened to Ferranti’s testimony in anguish, longing for justice and closure more than three years after their loved ones were shot to death in a nursing school classroom where they had studied with the man accused of killing them. As Ferranti testified, American politicians debated gun control and discussed overhauling the nation’s approach to mental illness as a possible shield against the death toll from almost daily mass shootings. Before Judge Rhynes called for the lunch recess on the first day of the hearing, shots rang out and killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California. The Oikos tragedy made the record books on 2 April 2012 as the deadliest outburst of violence at an American college since 2007, when a Virginia Tech University student killed 32 and wounded 25. Last month, a shooter in southern Oregon pushed Oikos down a notch on the macabre list when he killed nine at Umpqua community college. The Oregon rampage ended like many – the gunman killed himself. The massacre in San Bernardino concluded like others frequently end – with police killing the suspects. Goh considered suicide, he told Ferranti. He would nevertheless welcome the death penalty, she testified. “He expressed to me that he was too much of a coward to kill himself, for someone else to do it would be wonderful,” Ferranti said. But he does not want to plead guilty, does not believe he is guilty of seven murders and three attempted murders as charged, and first wants to make a statement to the families of the seven victims. He wants to tell them that he did not mean to kill his former classmates and instead intended to kill faculty. Goh turned himself in and confessed to police within hours of the massacre. But in 2013, after two psychiatrists found him incompetent to stand trial, a judge suspended criminal proceedings against him. Since then, he has been housed at Napa state hospital, a psychiatric facility, where he has been forcibly medicated. In July, psychologist Todd Schirmer found Goh competent to stand trial. Schirmer is scheduled to testify on Wednesday. The prosecution believes that Goh is now fit to stand trial on charges that could lead to a death sentence. The Alameda County district attorney has not yet decided whether to seek capital punishment. Ferranti deems Goh incompetent to stand trial because she believes he is incapable of assisting his attorney in his defense. She described him as plagued with delusions, auditory and visual hallucinations and undiagnosed schizophrenia stretching back for more than a decade. Goh moved into his car after coming to believe that Oikos staff had installed surveillance cameras in his home, Ferranti said. He then abandoned his car after becoming convinced that school staff planted a GPS device inside it, she said. “He was so certain that he was being followed that he went into a gun store to spook them,” she said. Goh admits going to Oikos armed with a .45-caliber handgun and four fully loaded magazines the day of the shooting looking for a school administrator who refused to refund his tuition after he failed a class. But the administrator was not there. Ferranti examined Goh twice, once in 2012 and again in September. Altogether, she spent about six and a half hours with him. She said Goh denies that he is mentally ill. Goh’s attorney showed the court video clips of Goh in police custody just hours following the morning massacre. One clip shows the short and stout Goh alone in a small interrogation room standing next to a table and agitatedly talking to himself in his native Korean. In another, Goh sits and repeatedly writes with his finger on an empty, white table. Judge Rhynes is expected to rule on Goh’s competency following the hearing, which continues until at least 15 December."

We enjoy banks of windows all the way around our floor. The desks and computers and telephones are either new or have been cleaned. We are hard-pressed to believe it, for we left a building held together by duct tape and crossed fingers.

The enemy appears to be among us, this time a man, Syed Farook, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, who allegedly killed 14 people and wounded 17 others at a social services center in San Bernardino, Calif. 
Why? We don’t know, but it can’t possibly be an exaggeration to say that the war has been brought to our soil. We are probably still trying to deny it. A number of news outlets apparently cling to the idea that the two, however allegedly we are still supposed to use the word “allegedly,” were upset about something said at a holiday party. Nonsense. They were armed to the hilt. All of us have been slighted at work at one time or another and did not have an arsenal to fall back on to exact revenge. 


It takes days for mass shooting incidents to sort themselves out. It takes days before facts and figures are established, motives vetted, the dead finally counted. But in the early stories following last week’s shooting, one story in particular might have grabbed everybody’s attention. A CBS News story out of Los Angeles reported that officers were searching a home in Redlands believed to be the residence of Farook’s sister and mother.
In fact, as officers approached that home, acting on a tip, the suspects fled and the gun battle ensued that killed Farook and Malik. The suspects were reported to have been armed with assault rifles and semi-automatic handguns. 
As darkness fell, police continued to search that home in Redlands. They used a battering ram to enter and then walked on eggshells because of the reasonable belief that the home could be rigged with explosives. 
The last two paragraphs of the story are the most telling:
“A man who has been working in the area said he noticed a half-dozen Middle Eastern men in the area in recent weeks but decided not to report anything since he did not wish to racially profile those people. 


“â  ‘We sat around lunch thinking, ‘What were they doing around the neighborhood?’â  ” he said. ‘We’d see them leave where they’re raiding the apartment.’ ”
Well, that’s what we have been taught, isn’t it? We are not to profile, for that would seem insensitive or impolitic. And in our normal daily lives, there is no need to sound the alarm on our fellow travelers any more than our fellow travelers need to sound the alarm on us.
But if one day out of the blue I notice a half-dozen unmistakably Middle Eastern men going in and out of a house on my block, I am going to at least ask my neighbor why a half-dozen Middle Eastern men are going in and out of his house. Depending on the answer I get, I am going to say something.
Too many days that start out brightly and in rolling clouds of fog are ending up wrong, and it isn’t because of what the misguided call climate change.

The new digs for our merry band of ink-stained wretches — we are across the river from downtown in the Comcast building — has me facing east at the keyboard, while seated in a new chair that has more adjustment dials and levers than the cockpit seat of a fighter jet. We enjoy banks of windows all the way around our floor. The desks and computers and telephones are either new or have been cleaned. We are hard-pressed to believe it, for we left a building held together by duct tape and crossed fingers. The sun is trying to break through a haze of rolling clouds that look like fog out across the river and up Mounds Park way. What a bright way to start the day, but I suppose all days are bright at the start and then anything can happen to turn everything upside down. The enemy appears to be among us, this time a man, Syed Farook, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, who allegedly killed 14 people and wounded 17 others at a social services center in San Bernardino, Calif. Why? We don’t know, but it can’t possibly be an exaggeration to say that the war has been brought to our soil. We are probably still trying to deny it. A number of news outlets apparently cling to the idea that the two, however allegedly we are still supposed to use the word “allegedly,” were upset about something said at a holiday party. Nonsense. They were armed to the hilt. All of us have been slighted at work at one time or another and did not have an arsenal to fall back on to exact revenge.

Every Monday Is the blending of two problems – international terrorist attacks and domestic mass shootings – the best way to solve them both? Each major political party has a different answer. Loading... December 5, 2015 The FBI says a married woman from Pakistan, who along with her husband killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., on Wednesday, “pledged allegiance” on Facebook to the Islamic State (ISIS), shortly before the shooting. That creates a peculiar situation for President Obama, The New York Times, and many other Americans who, in the immediate aftermath of the attack, called for more gun control in the US. If this is an international terrorist attack, not workplace violence, why the focus on more gun-control measures? The FBI is leaning now more heavily toward a terror motive in the mass shooting committed by Syed Farook and his wife Tafeen Malik, when they killed his co-workers at an office Christmas party. There’s growing ""evidence ... of extreme planning"" for the attack, said David Bowdich, assistant director of the FBI office in Los Angeles, on Friday announcing that the federal government was taking over the investigation. The agency, he said, believes it was an ""act of terrorism."" Still, The New York Times on Saturday ran its first front-page editorial in nearly a century, calling gun violence a “disgrace,” downplaying the possible terrorism motive, and calling for an elimination of military-style semi-automatic rifles  – and ammunition – like the ones used in the California attack. But is the conflation of two problems – international terrorist attacks by lone wolf extremists and domestic mass shootings by individuals with semi-automatic rifles – the best way to solve them both? Democrats seem to say yes, while Republicans disagree. Blending the two issues seems to put the nation “on new ground” for a debate about public and personal safety, Jim Kessler, who works for the centrist Democratic think tank Third Way, told the Los Angeles Times this week. The attack on the Inland Regional Center on Wednesday killed 14 mostly San Bernardino County workers at a Christmas party, and injured 21 others. The shooters – Mr. Farook and Ms. Malik – were killed four hours later in an intense firefight with police. Police later discovered $30,000 worth of guns, ammo and bomb-making supplies in their residence. Mr. Farook made $51,000 a year as an employee of the county health department, and there’s no record that Ms. Malik worked. Focus shifted toward Malik’s background on Friday, and on whether she had been radicalized to the point of planning and executing an actual attack. Mr. Farook has been described as a “deeply religious” Muslim by his family, and Malik was so conservative that male members of Farook’s family had never seen her face for her burqa. Republicans are now asking questions about the immigration vetting process for the K-1 ""fiancé visa"" obtained by Malik. As new details emerged about Malik’s communications, ISIS said the pair were “followers,” but stopped short of claiming responsibility, as it did for the Paris terror attacks late last month. ""Two followers of Islamic State attacked several days ago a center in San Bernadino in California,"" the group's daily online radio broadcast al-Bayan said on Saturday. According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the couple’s weapons were all purchased legally – in a state where gun ownership standards are among the highest in the US. President Obama acknowledged on Friday that the attacks are likely linked to violent extremism, but blamed laws that allowed somebody on a federal no-fly list to legally purchase weapons. On Thursday, Republicans scuttled a Democratic maneuver in Congress that would have barred anyone on the list from purchasing weapons. Republicans said that such a law would not have stopped the San Bernardino attack, given that Malik had been vetted for a US State Department visa. “Right now, people on the No-Fly list can walk into a store and buy a gun,” Obama said. “That is insane. … We may not be able to prevent every tragedy, but – at a bare minimum – we shouldn't be making it so easy for potential terrorists or criminals to get their hands on a gun that they could use against Americans."" He added that evidence that the couple were radicalized confirms the need for people ""to work together"" to prevent attacks, Obama said. It’s a problematic tack for gun control advocates, writes Zachary Goldfarb, in the Washington Post. He cites polls that show defending gun rights is a more popular position now than it has been in almost 20 years. Moreover, critics say that conflating gun control with international terrorism puts the onus on Americans to carry the weight for the actions of international terrorists, even, they add, as it ignores the dangers of failing to call Islamic terrorism by its name. The Obama administration consciously avoids using terminology that may rile passions in the Middle East. “We are not at war with Islam,” Obama said last month. “We are at war with people who have perverted Islam."" But The New York Times editorial Saturday wasn't focused on Islamic terrorists but the role of guns in mass killings: It is moral outrage and a national disgrace that people can legally purchase weapons designed specifically to kill with brutal speed and efficiency.... America’s elected leaders offer prayers for gun victims and then, callously and without fear of consequence, reject the most basic restrictions on weapons of mass killing, as they did on Thursday. They distract us with arguments about the word terrorism. Let’s be clear: These spree killings are all, in their own ways, acts of terrorism.” For many, including several Republican presidential contenders, that stance struck an odd chord. “It will take someone with a more extensive background in psychotherapy and the human mind to explain why the president and so many of his allies are going through life with blinders on” about the root cause of such attacks, Peter Roff, a contributing editor at US News & World Report, writes. Indeed, Liberty University president President Jerry Falwell Jr.'s response Friday to the San Bernardino shooting was to tell students they all should carry a concealed weapon. The disconnect on guns and international terrorists exposed by the reaction to the San Bernardino attack is relatively new.  Indeed, it only dates back seven years, to the election of President Barack Obama. That’s when the number of Republicans who opposed new gun laws spiked from 50 percent to 75 percent, while the two-thirds of Democrats in favor of gun control remained the same. Just over half of all Americans believe that guns do more to protect Americans than hurt them, according to a Pew Research survey. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. But such attitudes, too, may shift as the pace of mass shootings has accelerated three-fold since 2011, according to an analysis by the New York Times, using data gleaned by the liberal-leaning Mother Jones magazine. “There is a reset that may be going on with the American people” in the midst of changing threats, Mr. Kessler added to the Los Angeles Times. “... That may entail re-looking at a whole series of issues, including guns.” Already a subscriber?

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s hard for the world to figure out. We’re run by a church, but we’re not only for church members and we’re not about converting people. We’re known as being fair even as the world becomes as polarized as at any time since the newspaper’s founding in 1908. We have a mission beyond circulation, we want to bridge divides.

When a hail of bullets ripped through the air, through their conversation, through their lives — Shannon Johnson didn’t hesitate. “I’ve got you,” the 45-year-old San Bernardino man calmly told the young co-worker he’d just been chatting with, wrapping his arm around her as they hid behind a chair trying to escape the erupting fusillade. Just five minutes earlier, Johnson, a health inspector for the county, and 27-year-old Denise Peraza were quipping about the clock, she recalls. “We were seated next to each other at a table, joking about how we thought the large clock on the wall might be broken because time seemed to be moving so slowly,” she says in a statement released by her family. “I would have never guessed that…we would be huddled next to each other under that same table, using a fallen chair as a shield from over 60 rounds of bullets being fired across the room.” A bullet pierced Peraza’s lower back as she huddled with Johnson, who the Los Angeles Times says once worked as a trucker before joining the San Bernardino Public Health Department a decade ago. “While I cannot recall every single second that played out that morning, I will always remember his left arm wrapped around me, holding me as close as possible next to him behind that chair. And amidst all the chaos, I’ll always remember him saying these three words, ‘I got you.’ I believe I am still here today because of this amazing man,” Peraza says. Johnson was one of 14 people killed in Wednesday’s mass shooting by husband-and-wife terrorists Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik inside the Inland Regional Center. Johnson, who had several tattoos of beloved relatives, loved talking about religion with Farook, another co-worker, his longtime girlfriend told the LA Times. “He loved the department because he said it was like working in the United Nations,” Mandy Pifer tells the paper. An on-line fundraiser collecting money to pay for Johnson’s funeral in his native Georgia had nearly met its $35,000 goal in a single day. Peraza, who was released from the hospital Friday, said Johnson “always brought a smile to everyone’s face in the office with his lively stories about his hometown back in Georgia. “This is Shannon Johnson, who will be deeply missed by all. This is Shannon Johnson. My friend, my hero,” she writes. Share Selection"
http://www.inquisitr.com/2612936/san-bernardino-shooting-and-gun-control-obama-weighs-executive-orders/,"In the aftermath of the San Bernardino, California, mass shootings that left 14 people dead and many injured, President Obama and his White House lawyers are huddling about possible executive orders for additional gun control regulations. Other politicians, including Hillary Clinton, have expanded their saber rattling (as it were) for more gun control in the post-San Bernardino environment, as has much of the news media, which initially focused on the irrelevant proximity of the crime scene to a local Planned Parenthood clinic. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch oddly deemed the San Bernardino shooting ""a wonderful opportunity and a wonderful moment to really make significant change,"" which presumably is Washington code for more gun control via executive action. Gun control proponents apparently are hoping that Obama will or would put forth his executive orders on the upcoming December 14 anniversary of the horrible mass shooting at the Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, which occurred three years ago. It is unclear at this writing as to whether any announcement will take place in that time frame, however. While in Paris for a climate change conference last week, Obama disclosed at a press conference that he was considering invoking his administrative powers in the absence of action by Congress or state and local governments. The president also said that the U.S. is the only country plagued with mass shootings, even though Paris itself was just devastated by a mass terrorist shooting on Friday, November 13. On the day before Thanksgiving, the president proclaimed that ""we know of no specific and credible intelligence indicating a plot on the homeland."" On Thursday, Obama suggested that it was possible that the San Bernardino massacre was terrorist related or workplace violence. For years, the Obama administration repeatedly insisted that the Fort Hood shooting carried out by Major Nidal Hasan (now on death row in Fort Leavenworth) was workplace violence despite evidence to the contrary. The FBI is now officially conducting the probe into the San Bernardino attack as a terrorism investigation, however. ISIS has since described the husband-and-wife team who carried out the attack as supporters, but not necessarily members of the terrorist group. In his weekly radio address today, Obama conceded that ""It is entirely possible that these two attackers were radicalized to commit this act of terror.""  As one component of its plan to bypass Congress, the Obama administration is reportedly focusing on the so-called gun show loophole, but this corrective action is actually directed at requiring background checks for private sales or transfers of guns, not dealer transactions. Obama advocates common sense gun safety laws, but apparently his team determined that it is easier said than done, although the process for executive orders is nonetheless underway, in consultation with gun control advocates. ""But top White House advisers say they are still struggling to find a way for Mr. Obama to use his executive powers and tighten restrictions on gun sales, sidestepping a gridlocked Congress. While he has ordered officials to find ways for him to act unilaterally, aides said they have run into legal and political hurdles that make that difficult,"" the New York Times reported. ""The White House has focused its deliberations on an executive action that would detail who should be considered a high-volume gun dealer, a move that could expand background checks to a huge number of sales at gun shows, online, and elsewhere that now fall outside the law.""   Given this state of affairs, The American Interest claims that a renewed gun control push from Washington is an exercise in futility.  The couple who perpetrated the San Bernardino attack ""had amassed an armory of weapons and explosives in their Redlands home, including a dozen pipe bombs and thousands of rounds of ammunition,"" and had the capability to mount a second attack had they not been intercepted by cops, the Los Angeles Times separately chronicled. ""[P]olice recovered a dozen pipe bombs, 2,000 9-millimeter handgun rounds, 2,500.223-caliber assault rifle rounds and 'hundreds of tools' that could have been used to make additional explosive devices.""   Preventing guns from falling into the hands of those who are mentally ill may be something that both parties can agree upon, House Speaker Paul Ryan has indicated. Setting aside that issue, gun rights advocates have long maintained that government interventions that infringe on the rights of law-abiding citizens (and, they believe, could ultimately lead to gun confiscation) will have minimal impact on street criminals and terrorists who can readily obtain weapons via the underground economy. In an appearance on CBS News This Morning, presidential candidate and U.S. Senator Marco Rubio outlined why he voted against the proposals, adding that his home state of Florida already requires a background check.  Against the backdrop of the San Bernardino terrorist rampage, do you think that President Obama should use unilateral executive action to ""pull the trigger"" on new gun control regulations?

http://www.opednews.com/articles/It-s-messed-up-for-Democra-by-Trevor-Timm-Democrats_No-Fly-List_Republican_Rights-151205-528.html,"Reprinted from The Guardian In the wake of yet another mass shooting in the US, Republicans managed to vote down a bill that would bar people on the no-fly list from buying guns. It's hard to tell what is more sickening: that Republicans will refuse to vote for literally any gun control legislation despite the country's mass-murder epidemic, or that Democrats are trying to use the unconstitutional no-fly list, which makes a mockery of due process, to force the issue. Funny, I don't remember hearing a word of protest from party leaders when tens of thousands of people were added to the list and barred from flying during the Bush years -- and in fact, they were loudly cheering as the Bush administration tore down all sorts of due process rights in the aftermath of 9/11. The Republicans supposed newfound devotion to due process is nothing more than a naked political ploy to avoid passing any gun control, no matter how inconsequential. This is the party that invented the no-fly list -- it was a concoction of the Bush administration, just like a series of policies that did more damage to the principle of due process than anything since FDR's Japanese internment camps during the second world war. For years, Republicans have continually demanded (with much success) that the Obama administration not give constitutional due process rights to alleged terrorists, including the reading of Miranda rights, access to lawyers and trials in civilian courts. It's the party that has proudly endorsed indefinite detention of Guanta'namo detainees, drone strikes on Americans overseas and outright torture on countless detainees who were not, and have not, been convicted of a crime. Click Here to Read Whole Article Currently, the party's leading candidate for president has proposed immediately removing 11 million people from the country with a ""deportation force"" without a second thought to due process, put all Muslims in a mandatory database and potentially and arbitrarily start closing mosques that he deems too radical for his taste. At the same time, we should all acknowledge that the no-fly list is an abomination, and it's shameful that the Democratic party is not only defending its use but trying to further legitimize and intrench it into America's laws. On the surface, Republicans are right about one thing: the list is a due-process nightmare that is riddled with mistakes and has ensnared countless innocent people over the past decade and a half. A federal judge recently ruled the process for finding out if you're on the list and any attempt to get off it unconstitutional, given its Kafkaesque procedures and extreme secrecy, which make it impossible to challenge. The administration has supposedly been incrementally changing its procedures in response to that court order and other lawsuits brought by innocent people who have had their rights violated, but they have only been doing so while kicking and screaming. I am not arguing that Congress shouldn't pass more stringent gun control laws. Even the gun-loving US supreme court has indicated there are plenty of ways to do so without violating the Second Amendment. But we should stop pretending that this legislation will come close to stopping the mass murder problem we have in this country. How many of the hundreds of mass shooters in this country were on the no-fly list to begin with? While there is some political usefulness in showing just how in bed the Republican party is with gun lobbyists, using an awful tool like the no-fly list shouldn't be the way to do it.  2

Federal officials Saturday searched a Riverside home believed to be connected with Wednesday's attack in San Bernardino, FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said.  NOTE: The White House says President Barack Obama will address the nation from the Oval Office at 5 p.m. Pacific Time on Sunday about the steps the government is taking to keep people safe after the attack this past week in California. Obama will provide an update on the San Bernardino attack that killed 14 and wounded 21 and will also discuss the broader threat of terrorism. The terrorism investigation into the San Bernardino shootings ranged as far away as Pakistan and Saudi Arabia on Saturday, but the case remained rooted in the Inland Empire as authorities raided the Riverside house of a man suspected of buying the assault rifles used in attack. That man, identified as Enrique Marquez, once lived next door to slain gunman Syed Rizwan Farook. They used to fix cars together in their garages. Authorities are trying to determine whether Marquez knew about the plot. Fourteen people were killed and 21 wounded in the shootings Wednesday at a San Bernardino County Department of Public Health holiday party at the Inland Regional Center. Farook, 28, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, 29, were died later in a gunbattle with police. The FBI has said it is investigating the attack as an act of terrorism. Authorities have said Farook bought the handguns used in the attack, and they believe Marquez bought the rifles. San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said Saturday that the FBI told him that Marquez’s house on Tomlinson Avenue was searched for the purpose of gathering evidence in the purchase of the rifles. Burguan said he didn’t know whether Marquez had been arrested. San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon said that federal officials knew the location of the suspected buyer but that he did not know if the man would be taken into custody. A federal official said Marquez is believed to have checked himself into a nearby mental health facility. Marquez has lived at the house for at least 10 years, a neighbor said. Farook lived next door to Marquez for several years before moving three years ago, said that neighbor, Freddy Escamilla, 21. Farook and Marquez shared a common interest in repairing cars, Escamilla said. In other developments Saturday: An audio message broadcast by the Islamic State said that two “supporters” had executed the San Bernardino attack, but it stopped short of saying the pair were members of the extremist group. “Two followers of Islamic State attacked several days ago a center in San Bernardino,” the ISIS broadcast was quoted as saying. ISIS did not directly take credit for the attack, but praised Farook and Malik as “martyrs.” Saira Khan and Eba Farook, the two sisters of Syed Rizwan Farook, expressed anguish at the tragedy. But they said they had seen no warning that Farook and his wife, who most recently lived in Redlands, were preparing for an assault. “It’s harder for us to understand, especially knowing that he was our brother and he was so happy with her (Malik),” said Khan while talking to the press from a Riverside house. “How can he leave his only child, you know? And how could the mother do this?” Khan said she and her husband intended to adopt the couple’s 6-month-old daughter. The White House released a statement saying that information that has emerged since the attack suggests the couple was “radicalized to violence to commit these heinous attacks.” President Barack Obama is expected to discuss the San Bernardino investigation and other terrorist threats from groups such as the Islamic State in an address from the Oval Office at 5 p.m. today. Law enforcement officials are scouring social media for clues about the attackers’ intentions and are also examining evidence recovered after the attack, including several mobile phones that appeared to have been intentionally damaged to prevent their exploitation. The U.S. government’s ability to review and analyze five years’ worth of telephone records for the shooters lapsed days before the shootings when the National Security Agency’s mass surveillance program was formally shut down. Instead, under the new USA Freedom Act, authorities were able to obtain roughly two years’ worth of calling records directly from the phone companies. FBI Director James Comey declined to say whether the NSA program’s shutdown affected the government’s terrorism investigation. GUN RAID Escamilla, the Tomlinson Avenue neighbor, said he never saw Marquez with guns and that Marquez did little to attract attention to himself other than hold an occasional loud party. Escamilla said the four people who lived at Marquez’s house were “outdoorsy.” He didn’t talk with them much but said Marquez had seemed “withdrawn” in the past three weeks. Saturday’s raid left a garage door ripped open and a window broken. It was unclear whether anyone was at home in the afternoon. A handwritten sign propped up on the mailbox asked visitors to keep off the property. Two older cars sat in the driveway. Escamilla said he never spoke to Farook for more than 15 minutes at a time. “Just small talk,” Escamilla said. He thought Farook moved out about three years ago. Farook lived with his mother there. “There was never anything that would make me see the family as off or that they would hurt someone,” Escamilla said. The day before the raid, Escamilla said, his sister noticed a gray car parked on the street with someone inside staring at the Marquez home. Later, the car circled the street. The noise of the raid woke up Escamilla and his family sometime after 2 a.m. He heard an officer use a loudspeaker to order someone to step outside the house. When no one did, the demands took on a tone of annoyance, Escamilla said. ‘OUTSOURCING OF TERRORISM’ The Islamic State, under pressure after over a year of U.S. and allied airstrikes, has urged its followers to launch attacks in the West. Around the time of the attacks, Malik pledged allegiance on Facebook to the group’s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. But authorities have said they do not believe the couple are members of any terrorist network or cell. Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State San Bernardino, said Saturday that the ISIS statement does not convince him that Farook and Malik are members of ISIS or trained by the terror organization. “I think this is outsourcing of terrorism by ISIS,” Levin said. “This is one of their strategies to use, particularly in regard to the United States. It is hard for ISIS to get trained, sophisticated operators in place compared to Europe, where there are more foreign fighters who can travel quite easily. What you have is do-it-yourself type of terrorism, and where ISIS inspires and aids indirectly.” Levin said there is debate in the extremist world whether it is preferable to wait until terrorist groups can sneak trained fighters into a country or whether you cultivate players to join your team who are not sophisticated terrorists. “They are quite content and celebrating inspiring individuals to attack,” Levin said. Those outsourced terrorists are more difficult for law enforcement to detect because they do not usually communicate over channels that can be intercepted, Levin said. Levin, explaining why he believes the couple were not sophisticated, characterized the attack at the holiday party as chaotic. “What I’ve heard is a lot of shots were sprayed (rather than targeted). It looked to me haphazard,” Levin said. He noted that the attack happened near I-10 and I-215, yet the couple didn’t leave the area. “Why weren’t they out in the country? What was Plan B? To go back to one’s house didn’t make any sense to me. It seems to me that for every thing they did … that was planned, there were other things that were haphazard and disorganized. MALIK CHANGES LIFE New details about Malik surfaced Saturday during interviews in Pakistan. She came from a prosperous Pakistani family and grew up in Saudi Arabia. She returned to Multan, Pakistan, about 100 miles from her ancestral village, in 2007, pursuing a pharmacy degree at Bahauddin Zakariya University. One of her closest friends, Abida Rani, said Malik changed around 2009, suddenly paying more attention to Islamic studies than to pharmacology. Malik would travel across town, nearly every day, to a madrassa, an Islamic school, where she would spend her evenings, Rani said. Rani added that she thinks the madrassa belongs to the Wahhabi branch of Sunni Islam, a particularly conservative interpretation of the faith that is widely practiced in Saudi Arabia. “We were like, ‘What happened to Malik?’” said Rani, who attended school with Malik all six years. “She became so religious, so serious and so focused on Islamic teachings, and she lost her interest in her studies.” While students at the university were busy socializing, Rani said Malik would watch one of Pakistan’s 24-hour Islamic television channels. She always wore a burqa. She never sat in the front row in class. She would not interact with young men. The Washington Post, The Associated Press and The New York Times contributed to this story.

http://feeds.inquisitr.com/~r/google/yDYq/~3/SejQ9HmAFoQ/,"Police are investigating a series of Facebook posts that call for a mass shooting in Bakersfield, California, days after 14 people were killed and 21 others wounded in the San Bernardino shootings. A Bakersfield resident allegedly posted three messages to his Facebook account encouraging the type of mass shooting that occurred 160 miles away in San Bernardino, reports Eyewitness News. The first post:   Other online rumors about threats to public gathering places, like malls, continued to circulate Saturday, which prompted the FBI to denounce the claims as illegitimate. After learning of rumors claiming a local mall was on lockdown, San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon issued a statement instructing the public to check law enforcement Twitter and Facebook accounts before assuming the worst, reports the Sun.  In response to the sheriff's posting, an online petition from Change.org began to circulate drawing similar numbers. The petition attacked the sheriff as uneducated and illogical for encouraging people to go armed in public.  Tashfeen Malik used an alias to praise the Islamic State on Facebook shortly before or during the San Bernardino massacre this week. She's just the latest violent thug seeking attention on social media and it's only going to get worse, Karen North, a professor of digital social media at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School, told Bay News 9.

http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/06/fbi-searches-house-near-scene-of-san-bernardino-shooting,"Barack Obama to make national address on Sunday as agents search property thought linked to man who bought rifles Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik used First published on Sun 6 Dec 2015 00.31 GMT The FBI have raided a house in California that neighbors said belonged to a childhood friend of San Bernardino mass killer Syed Rizwan Farook. The searched house was next door to the home in which Farook lived with wife and fellow killer Tashfeen Malik and his family for more than a decade.  Federal agents confirmed they searched a property on Saturday in Riverside but declined to give the address or reason for the search. NBC News reported the house was home to a man authorities believe bought the assault rifles Farook and Malik used in the attack. Investigators are still trying to piece together the married couple’s history, family, friends and acquaintances to work out what drove them to slaughter 14 people and injure 21 in San Bernardino, California, last week. The personal history of Malik in particular – a 29-year-old Pakistani woman described as a “shy housewife” – remains largely unknown. The mass shooting has sparked nationwide debate on terrorism, and president Barack Obama is to address the nation on Sunday night. He is expected to provide an update on the investigation and the broader threat of terrorism, and reaffirm his conviction that the jihadi group Islamic State can be destroyed. Isis claimed on Saturday the couple were “followers” of the militant group in its daily online radio broadcast al-Bayan on Saturday but it did not claim to have directed Wednesday’s attack. US authorities are investigating the shootings as an act of terrorism. Neighbor Hellen Fernandez said Farook, when he lived in Riverside, appeared to have been friends with a man at the house that was searched. Part of the garage door was torn apart and a window to it was broken at the house that neighbors said was searched by federal agents. Farook, 28, and his wife, Malik, 29, most recently lived in Redlands, a community about 30 miles (48km) north-east of Riverside, when they shot to death 14 people on Wednesday at a party for civil servants in nearby San Bernardino. The couple died hours later in a shootout with police. Reuters contributed to this report"

	Marianne Zumberge News Editor, Variety.com President Obama will speak to the nation from the Oval Office Sunday night to address the threat of terrorism in the wake of Wednesday’s mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. Obama has canceled his planned appearance at Sunday’s Kennedy Center Honors evening ceremony, an annual ritual for presidents for nearly 40 years. Obama will still address the Kennedy Center Honors reception event at the White House at around 5 p.m. ET. The White House said Obama’s address to the nation will run from 8-8:30 p.m. ET. Fox, ABC and CBS  confirmed they would carry the speech, hastily adjusting primetime schedules to accommodate the President. According to a statement from the White House, the President “will provide an update on the ongoing investigation into the tragic attack in San Bernardino. He will also discuss the broader threat of terrorism — including the nature of the threat, how it has evolved, and how we will defeat it.”  In addition, “He will reiterate his firm conviction that ISIL will be detroyed and that the United States must draw upon our values — our unwavering commitment to justice, equality, and freedom — to prevail over terrorist groups that use violence to advance a destructive ideology.” The primetime address comes as the FBI has confirmed it investigating the massacre committed by a married couple as an act of terrorism. The female attacker, who was killed along with her husband in a shootout with police, is said to have pledged her allegiance to ISIS via Facebook prior to the attack at the office complex where her husband worked. The attack left 14 people dead and 21 injured. Moreover, it further rattled the psyche of the nation that was already grappling with a recent string of mass shootings and the fear stoked by terror attacks in the heart of Paris last month that left at least 130 people dead. Obama’s 8 p.m. address will surely jumble the primetime schedules of the broadcast networks on the East Coast. NBC’s live coverage of “Sunday Night Football” is likely to be affected although it’s possible that the Indianapolis Colts-Pittsburgh Steelers game will be postponed for the duration of Obama’s address. CBS had planned to air two episodes of “60 Minutes” from 7-9 p.m. ET followed by its “Sinatra 100: An All-Star Grammy Concert” special. Now Scott Pelley will anchor a special report ABC said it would slide its regular drama lineup back, starting with 8 p.m.’s “Once Upon a Time.” Fox was to air “The Simpsons” at 8 p.m. Tomorrow at 8pm ET, @POTUS will address the nation on the threat of terrorism and keeping the American people safe → https://t.co/b68B45RuKg — White House Archived (@ObamaWhiteHouse) December 5, 2015  The Business of Entertainment"

X OUR PICKS: SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. — Federal authorities raced Saturday to piece together clues about the California couple who carried out the deadliest terrorist assault on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2001, as President Barack Obama warned of the dangers of attackers who become radicalized at home.
As part of the expanding investigation, FBI officials early Saturday launched a raid targeting the house of a man thought to have bought two rifles used in the attack. The FBI is working to determine whether the man had any knowledge of the plot, which killed 14 people and wounded 21 at a holiday party in San Bernardino.
Investigators are pursuing leads as far away as Pakistan and Saudi Arabia that they hope will explain how Tashfeen Malik, a Pakistani woman who immigrated to the United States in 2014, and her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, an Illinois-born health inspector, pulled together what appeared to be an elaborate attack plan.
“We’re working to get a full picture of their motives — why they committed these revolting acts,” Obama said in his weekly address. “We’re going to get to the bottom of this.”
The incomplete picture of the attackers and their motives reflects the difficulty of detecting and preventing attacks by individuals with few or no substantial connections to militant organizations overseas.
An audio message broadcast by the Islamic State on Saturday said that two “supporters” had executed the San Bernardino attack, but it stopped short of saying the pair were members of the extremist group, which controls parts of Iraq and Syria.
The group has not claimed responsibility for Wednesday’s bloodshed, as it did for other recent attacks, including the coordinated assaults that killed 130 people in Paris.
While officials said they have not uncovered evidence to suggest that Farook, 28, and Malik, 29, were part of a larger militant organization, Malik appears to have admired the Islamic State. Around the time of the attacks, Malik, who gave birth to the couple’s first child in May, pledged allegiance on Facebook to the group’s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
The Islamic State, under pressure after over a year of U.S. and allied airstrikes, has urged its followers to launch attacks in the West.
U.S. authorities are now seeking to determine how the couple, who were living with Farook’s mother in a modest two-story townhouse in Redlands, a city close to San Bernardino, prepared for the attack. Investigators discovered a huge arsenal, including a dozen pipe bombs and thousands of rounds of ammunition.
Early on Saturday, law enforcement authorities raided a home next door to one where the Farook family once lived in Riverside, Calif. According to a law enforcement official, the raid targeted Enrique Marquez, who is believed to have bought the two military-grade rifles used in the attack. Both weapons were modified in a way that allowed them to be used with greater lethality, suggesting extensive planning for the attack.
Marquez is believed to have checked himself into a nearby mental health facility. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation, said Marquez is believed to have had contacts with individuals in Los Angeles who are already being tracked by the FBI. Officials intend to question Marquez about those links, but it was not immediately clear whether he had already been interviewed by the FBI.
At the site of the raid, the garage had been partially torn down and a window was broken. Two vehicles remained parked in the driveway, and a makeshift sign read: “please keep off the property.”
Earthell Bucknell, who lives across the street from the property, said the raid took place at 2:20 a.m. Saturday. Bucknell said that he doesn’t know much about the people who live in that home, but he has seen a man and a woman leaving for work every morning.
“I just see this lady, a Latino family,” he said.
Law enforcement officials are now scouring social media for clues about the attackers’ intentions and are also examining evidence recovered after the attack, including several mobile phones that appeared to have been intentionally damaged to prevent their exploitation.
Obama received an update on the investigation Saturday morning from FBI director James Comey, along with Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, the White House said in a statement.
Information that has emerged since the attack suggests the couple was “radicalized to violence to commit these heinous attacks,” the statement said.
In his weekly address, Obama said the attacks, if motivated by radicalization, “would underscore a threat we’ve been focused on for years — the danger of people succumbing to violent extremist ideologies.”
Obama is expected to discuss the San Bernardino investigation and other terror threats from groups such as the Islamic State in an address from the Oval Office on Sunday evening.
Three days after the attack, officials were not yet certain whether Malik or Farook was an instigator of the attack, which has triggered fears from American Muslims about being characterized as potential militants.
But a more clear picture is emerging of Malik, who was born to a prosperous family in Pakistan and earned a degree in pharmacy there. Those who knew her said she grew more conservative over time.
After her arrival in the United States in the summer of 2014, Malik avoided being in the room with male relatives. Because she used a face covering used by some Muslims, even her brother-in-law had never seen her face.
Malik also spent years living in Saudi Arabia, where women are, to a large extent, secluded from public life. Saudi officials have said she was not on any security watch list.
Lawyers representing relatives of Farook, including his mother, three siblings and brother-in-law, have described Farook and Malik as an average, if isolated, couple. Malik is only known to have been seen outside the couple’s home a handful of times.
Acquaintances from local mosques say Farook was devout, quiet and intensely private about his personal life. He is said to have stopped attending his mosque in San Bernardino months ago.
Law enforcement officials now think that Farook — who, like many of those killed, worked as a county health inspector — was the among the first to arrive at Wednesday’s gathering at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino.
That suggests he may have been scoping out the facility. It also could pour water on suggestions that the attack was a workplace dispute triggered by an argument.
The couple’s infant daughter, who was born in May at a local hospital and was left with Farook’s mother while Malik and Farook carried out the attacks, is in the custody of child protective services, at least temporarily.

http://www.eurweb.com/2015/12/what-drove-her-investigators-piece-together-portrait-of-tashfeen-malik/," *(Via Huffington Post) – Tashfeen Malik‘s path to accused mass killer in California began in a small city on the Indus River in Pakistan’s Punjab province. It was from here, when she was a toddler, that she moved with her father Gulzar 25 years ago to Saudi Arabia, where he became more deeply religious, more conservative and more hardline, according to a family member. A picture slowly emerged on Friday of the role and possible motivations of 27-year-old Malik in this week’s killing of 14 people in California, including her apparent pledge of allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State militant group, according to U.S. officials. Malik, with her husband Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, is accused of storming a holiday party on Wednesday in San Bernardino, California, and opening fire in America’s worst mass shooting in three years. The intensive search for clues, extending to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, could help U.S. investigators piece together what drove Malik and her husband to leave their infant daughter with his mother, don assault-style clothing and carry out the shooting.

http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/06/tashfeen-malik-who-was-the-shy-housewife-turned-san-bernardino-killer,"Only a vague sketch of Malik’s background has emerged as investigators struggle to discover why she and her husband became radicalised Last modified on Tue 31 Aug 2021 15.21 BST As law enforcement officials begin to piece together what led two California residents to shoot and kill 14 people at a social services centre in San Bernardino, the personal history of the one of the killers remains largely unknown: that of Tashfeen Malik, a 29-year-old Pakistani woman described as a “shy housewife”. Malik and her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, left their six-month-old daughter with Farook’s mother on Wednesday morning before going to the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino. There, the couple opened fire on a health department meeting, killing 14 and allegedly perpetrating the worst mass shooting since 26 were killed in Newtown, Connecticut in 2012.  The couple were killed four hours later and two miles away in a gun battle with police. The FBI said on Friday it is beginning to investigate the incident as an “an act of terrorism” after it appears Malik pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in a now-removed Facebook post. There is no evidence the group helped plan the attack. Local mosque leaders described Farook, who worked for the San Bernardino County department of public health, as a religious man who was shy, enjoyed working on cars, and appeared to be putting roots down in San Bernardino. Some reports suggested he became more withdrawn after meeting and marrying Malik, who was noticeable in the community largely by how little people knew about her. She, too, did not raise any obvious red flags, however. Criminal profilers contacted by the Guardian said the veneer of normality was a key component of the couple’s plan to build an arsenal of semi-automatic weapons and home-made pipe bombs and carry out the killings, because it minimised the risk of discovery. But the profilers said that it was highly unusual for a woman – and especially a new mother – to engage in a form of visceral, predatory violence that the clinical literature associates almost exclusively with men. “This is not a woman who has your typical maternal instincts,” Mary Ellen O’Toole, a former top behaivoural analyst for the FBI who now directs the forensic science program at George Mason university, said. “This is very planned, strategic behavior,” she said. “They have this baby, and what makes a family more normal or traditional than to have a baby? Yet they maintained a plan for mission-oriented, cold-blooded, maximum violence for weeks or months. It suggests the possibility that the baby was in part a prop to help them look normal.” Park Dietz, who has been profiling mass killers for more than 30 years, said he was unaware of any case of a couple erupting in mass violence when the targeted victims were not family members or people perceived to have harmed their child. “The necessary ingredients for an attack of this kind are to be willing to die that day and an inclination to blame other people, either out of paranoia or a direct grievance,” he said. The mystery surrounding Malik extends to her background in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, of which only a vague sketch has come to light. It is not known when she became radicalised, who, if anyone, radicalised her, and whether she drew Farook into the deadly plan or vice versa The FBI has indicated that she and Farook probably “self-radicalised” online,but even that process invites more questions than answers. According to Reuters, Malik moved to Saudi Arabia with her father at a young age and lived there until 2007, cut off from the rest of her father’s family after an inheritance dispute. “We feel a lot of sadness but we also feel ashamed that someone from our family has done this,” Malik’s uncle Javed Rabbani, a provincial education department clerk from central Punjab, told Reuters. “We can’t even imagine doing something like this. This is a mindset that is alien to us.” Malik’s step-aunt could only offer vague impressions about what had become of her niece after she and her father moved. “From what we heard, they lived differently, their mindset is different. We are from a land of Sufi saints ... this is very shocking for us,” school teacher Hifza Bibi, the step-sister of Malik’s father, who also lives in Karor Lal Esan told Reuters. “Our brother ... went to Saudi and since then he doesn’t care about anyone here,” Bibi said. “A man who didn’t come to attend his own mother’s funeral, what can you expect from him?” Malik is believed to have returned to Pakistan from Saudi Arabia in 2007 to attend pharmacology school at Bahauddin Zakariya university. She lived there at the university hostel until 2012, and was described as an introverted student without extremist views. “She was known to be good student with no religious extremist tendencies,” an intelligence official based in the nearby town of Layyah told Reuters. Syed Nisar Hussain Shah, one of Malik’s professors in the pharmacy department, said she was a diligent student and one of the small minority of women who wore a veil. “She remained always in a veil and she was not mixing with other students; she was shy,” he said. Pakistani media reported Malik had links to the Red mosque in Islamabad. The notorious mosque that was the scene of a bloody gun battle with the army in 2007 has denied claims Malik went there. Mullah Qadir, the personal assistant to mosque leader Abdul Aziz, said there was no truth in the claim. Last year female students at the mosque produced a video in which they pledge allegiance to Isis. Malik and Farook reportedly met in 2013 on hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca that Muslims are required to take at least once in their lifetime. They got married shortly after, and Malik entered the US on a K-1 visa, provided for spouses of American citizens. Mustafa Kuko, the Riverside Islamic Center director, told the Guardian that although he hosted the couple’s wedding celebration dinner at a mosque in Riverside and frequently talked with Farook, he had at most exchanged a few pleasantries with Malik. Kuko said Farook asked for blessings for the marriage in the middle of 2013, but his understanding was that the couple married in Saudi Arabia, where she lived after moving from her native Pakistan. The celebration dinner in Riverside was attended by 250-300 people who ate traditional Pakistani dishes. “It was a very joyous occasion, [Farook] was very much pleased, he looked relaxed, comfortable and happy. We didn’t infer anything about him that was abnormal at that time,” Kuko said. Malik visited Pakistan again in 2013 and 2014, security officials told Reuters, but it is unclear who she met or where she visited. Malik was not well known in the local Muslim community, local leaders have said. “I’ve really never seen her, I don’t know what she looked like,” Khaled Zaidan of the Islamic Community Center of Redlands told the Guardian. Farook occasionally worshipped there after moving to the area in 2014. “From my communication with our members, no one knew who she was.” Riaz Baqai and Mohammad Hossain, officials at a Redlands mosque a two-minute drive from the suspects’ home, also said they did not know them and were unaware of anyone who did. Doyle Miller, the landlord of the house in Redlands where the couple apparently lived with their six-month old baby and Farook’s mother, who looked after the child during the day, told the Guardian they “seemed like a very normal young couple”. Farook attended the Riverside mosque between 2012 and 2014. “He was a regular worshipper, he used to come on a daily basis,” Kuko said. “Farook would sometimes arrive as early as 4:30am, and returned for evening prayers after work, after 7pm. He came on Fridays, his day off from his job as a environmental health inspector, which he’d held since around 2010. He never mentioned any problems at work.” The FBI acknowledges knowing little about Tashfeen Malik. Those who attended the mosque with her husband, said they know nearly nothing of her, Associated Press reported. Even Farook’s mother, who lived with the couple and their six-month-old daughter, knows very little, according to attorneys for Farook’s family. The Farook family lawyers described the 29-year-old as “just a housewife” who was quiet like her husband and strictly followed Muslim customs. She wore traditional clothing that covered her face so her male relatives didn’t even know what she looked like, the AP reported."
http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/126762669/0/phoenix/nation~Determined-to-Kill-Can-tough-gun-laws-end-mass-shootings/,"The flag at Desert Hot Springs' Condor Gun Shop flew at half-staff on Friday morning. Less than two days had passed since two shooters, armed with four guns, killed 14 people and wounded 21 more at an office holiday party in San Bernardino. The shooting, which the FBI is investigating as an ""act of terrorism,"" forced the nation's attention to the city 40 miles west of Desert Hot Springs. It also prompted a flood of calls to Condor Gun Shop, an unheated cabin across from a swath of open desert at the edge of the city. ""Since (Wednesday), my phone has been ringing off the hook,"" said Torrey Harris, whose family has owned the shop since 1971. ""It didn't stop ringing until 11:30 at night."" Harris said that, after most mass shootings, longtime gun owners seek to stock up on weapons and ammunition that they think California will try to ban in reaction to the incidents of violence. The state legislature often passes a slew of gun control laws in the months after these tragedies. But Harris said the response she saw after San Bernardino was different. ""I would say a good 40% of my calls (Wednesday) were people who have never owned a firearm in their life,"" Harris said. Gun control activists already say Wednesday's shooting demonstrates the need for background checks for ammunition sales. But even California's gun control laws, among the strictest in the nation, haven't prevented seven mass shootings using legally purchased guns since 2006. Gun rights advocates maintain that laws don't affect criminals and only make it more difficult for people to protect themselves. Harris believes some of those people calling her shop have adopted a similar position. ""They looked at (San Bernardino) and said, 'You know what, we have to be able to fight back, and I'm not going to be the person cowering in the corner of a room waiting to be shot,'"" she said. National fears Data on mass shootings is sparse, and even the definition of ""mass shooting"" varies widely. The FBI, for instance, defines the events as incidents where at least four people are killed, while a popular online ""shooting tracker"" states that a mass shooting occurs when at least four people, including the shooter, are injured by gunshots. By the FBI's definition, as counted by USA TODAY, there have been 22 mass shootings this year; by the Shooting Tracker's analysis, San Bernardino was number 353 and one of two mass shootings that day. Despite this variance, experts don't believe mass shootings are happening more often than they did in past decades. In California and across the country, violent crimes with firearms have declined significantly since the 1980s. At the same time, however, we've become more afraid. ""It was Sandy Hook that really got people's attention and started this intense focus on (shootings),"" said James Alan Fox, a Northeastern University criminologist who's written several books on mass murder, referring to the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Since then, he said, ""Even though the incidence hasn't increased, fear has."" A 2015 Congressional Research Service report on mass public shootings found that 2012 was a particularly brutal year — seven mass public shootings, compared to an average of four per year — and suggested that the horrific year had a lasting impact on public opinion. ""Several such mass murders in 2012, seven incidents by most counts, compounded a fear among many people that, 'this could happen to me',"" the authors of the report wrote. After the December 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook, support for controls on gun ownership spiked to 51% of the U.S. population —its highest level in five years, according to the Pew Research Center. Support for laws protecting the right to own guns fell from 49% to 42%. Polls showed a return to pre-Sandy Hook opinion levels about six months later. But in comparison, a shooting that killed six people at a 2011 rally for Ariz. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords didn't significantly impact public opinion on gun control, according to a poll conducted in the following days by the Pew Research Center. Neither did a 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech that killed 32 people. For some, that fear has resulted in a new desire to bear arms. Pew data suggests that, in 1999, nearly half of gun owners bought them for hunting, compared to 26% for personal protection. By Feb. 2013, those positions had almost reversed: nearly half of gun owners wanted weapons for personal protection, compared to 32% for hunting. Condor Gun Shop owner Harris said, in the last five years, she's begun selling firearms to more women and first-time buyers. During the last 10 years, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the trade group for firearms manufacturers, has also seen a steady increase in first-time and female gun owners. About 25 to 30% of customers are first-time gun buyers, who often purchase a gun for protection. More than 30% of customers are women, NSSF spokesman Mike Bazinet said. Harris said she's started asking first-time gun owners what changed their minds about purchasing a firearm. More and more people tell her that they want to be responsible for their own safety. ""Just like buying car insurance, you go out and you buy it and you hope you never have to use it, but you're really thankful if you ever get into an accident. And a lot of people who buy these firearms do the same thing,"" Harris said. ""It really has changed, the whole mindset of a lot of people who are buying guns now."" But, according to San Bernardino police, Syed Rizwan Farook — one of the San Bernardino shooters — purchased his two guns legally from a federal licensed firearms dealer. Another person bought two .223-caliber rifles —a DPMS A-15 and Smith & Wesson M&P15 — legally. Only the shooters' modification attempts to the assault weapons, to make one rifle accept 30-round magazines and one rifle fully automatic, made them illegal to possess. So for gun control advocates, mass shootings are sirens, calling for further limits on access to guns. In California, strict gun control In the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting, for example, the California state legislature passed at least 14 bills tightening restrictions on gun ownership — more gun laws than it had passed in the previous six years combined. Gov. Jerry Brown signed laws banning conversion kits for ammunition magazines, toughening mental health reporting requirements and closing a ""loophole"" that allowed single-shot handguns to bypass safety requirements. In 2014, a bill cited a shooting in Isla Vista — when a gunman shot and killed three people and fatally stabbed three others near the University of California Santa Barbara campus — as the reason for its necessity. That measure, now a law, allows judges to temporarily keep people from purchasing or possessing guns if family members or law enforcement think they might harm themselves or others. While nearly 40 states have relaxed gun rules in the last two decades, California has enacted more than 50 major gun bills since 1994. The pro-gun control Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, based in San Francisco, gave California's laws an A- in 2014, the highest grade given to any state. Guns & Ammo Magazine, with a pro-gun rights stance, ranked the state fourth-worst in the country for gun ownership. Already, in the wake of the San Bernardino tragedy, gun control advocates are touting a 2016 ballot initiative that Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed in October. The measure proposes background checks for ammunition purchases and bans possession of high capacity magazines. ""Ammunition is what makes a firearm into a deadly weapon, and we should have background checks on firearms and ammunition,"" Law Center staff attorney Ari Freilich said. ""These individuals, it looks like they stockpiled 3,000 to 4,000 rounds of ammunition. They did it without having to show ID, without having to pass a background check."" Prior to San Bernardino, California had seen seven public shootings since 2006 that claimed four or more lives (not counting those police believe were gang-related), according to USA TODAY's ""Behind the Bloodshed"" tracker. In four of those shootings, the weapons shooters used were purchased legally and registered to the shooters. In two other incidents, the guns were purchased legally but registered to other people. In only one incident, the 2013 rampage near Santa Monica College, did law enforcement say that the weapons used were illegal in California. ""Here (in California), as pretty much everywhere in the country, anybody who isn't disqualified by virtue of them having a felony conviction can get a gun, and can get a bunch of guns, and can get guns that are quite deadly, because guns are deadly,"" said Eugene Volokh, a professor of constitutional law at UCLA and writer for ""The Volokh Conspiracy,"" a legal blog hosted by The Washington Post. Freilich believes mass shootings with guns that have been purchased legally, like Wednesday's in San Bernardino, emphasize the need for more stringent gun control. ""I do think (San Bernardino) highlights to legislators and to the California public that despite all that we've done — California has the toughest gun laws in the nation — more clearly needs to be done,"" Freilich said. Since the late 1980s, the crime rate has dropped in California and nationally by about 50%, according to the California Attorney General's Office and the FBI. Gun control advocates attribute that drop in California in part to gun control laws. However, some researchers, including Volokh, doubt that conclusion— pointing out that violence has dropped nationwide even though most states have loosened gun control laws and California is widely known to have the strictest laws in the nation. The percentage of homicide victims killed by firearms has remained steady in California since 1990, according to the California Attorney General's Homicide Report. Realistically, the battle to prevent mass tragedies with legislation may be futile, Volokh said. ""Let's look at somebody who is a would-be mass shooter. This person has essentially decided to have the defining event of his life, and possibly the concluding event of his life, be mass murder,"" Volokh said. ""This is somebody who is very motivated to commit the crime, and again, we know he is motivated because he's willing to give up his life to do that."" Wednesday's shooting was perpetrated by people determined to kill, Volokh said. The shooters, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, have been identified as husband and wife, and investigators found a dozen pipe bombs and more than 4,500 rounds of ammunition in the home they were renting in Redlands. The FBI is investigating the mass shooting as an 'act of terrorism.' While gun control may help reduce violence in general, criminologist James Alan Fox doesn't think legislation will help prevent mass shootings like these. ""Gun control can do a lot in terms of impacting the kind of gun crime you see every day. Will it avert mass killings? Not really,"" Fox said. ""They'll find a way to get a gun. If they can't get one legally, which most of them can, they'll borrow one, steal one — but they'll get one."" Business as usual For Torrey Harris of Condor Gun Shop, this tragic conversation is becoming routine. ""I've gone through this so many times now, I know how the cycle goes,"" Harris said. ""There are going to be people who are yelling and screaming for more gun laws and people who are going to be yelling and screaming for less, and unfortunately, probably nothing is going to happen, which I think frustrates both sides."" On Friday, it was business as usual at Harris' gun shop. A customer walked in the door, hoping to buy a handgun. Harris began the legal steps of selling a gun in California, asking the customer for identification, proof of residency and his Firearm Safety Certificate. Now, he'll have to submit to a background check. In 10 days, he can pick up his gun. The process of purchasing a gun in California •Obtain a Firearm Safety Certificate by passing a knowledge test. The test, made up of 30 true-false and multiple-choice questions, is drawn from a 46-page study guide available online. Copies of the test are available in English and Spanish. •Present the Firearm Safety Certificate, a California ID or driver's license and a utility bill or car registration with your current address to a licensed firearms dealer. •Choose your firearm. According to the California Department of Justice, there are currently 822 handgun models approved for sale in the state. Long guns are subject to individual regulations rather than a pre-approved list. •Complete federal and state background check paperwork. •Get a handling demonstration from the seller, including how to load, unload and lock the gun. The seller and buyer must both sign an affidavit saying the demonstration occurred. •Pay for the gun and keep your receipt. •Return in 10 days to pick up the gun, provided you passed the background check. •At this time, buy a gun lock or show a receipt to show that you bought one in the last 30 days."

http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2015/dec/06/isis-a-worry-on-u-s-soil-president-says-1/,"WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama on Saturday allowed the possibility the shooters in a San Bernardino, Calif., attack were radicalized, but he stuck to his prescription that gun limits are needed to stop such tragedies. Of 2 killers, wife's past life murkier Days before attack, NSA ended phone-data sweeps Of 2 killers, wife's past life murkier Days before attack, NSA ended phone-data sweeps ""It is entirely possible that these two attackers were radicalized to commit this act of terror,"" Obama said in his weekly radio address, broadcast a day after the FBI declared it was treating the massacre of 14 people as an act of terror. ""And if so, it would underscore a threat we've been focused on for years -- the danger of people succumbing to violent extremist ideologies."" Later Saturday, the White House said Obama will address the nation from the Oval Office at 7 p.m. today about the steps the government is taking to keep people safe after the attack. He will discuss the nature of the threat, how it has evolved and how the country plans to defeat it, according to the White House. During his radio speech, Obama said investigators must be allowed to complete their work. But he cited the efforts of the Islamic State, also known as ISIL and ISIS, to inspire people in Europe and the United States to stage terror attacks. ""We know that ISIL and other terrorist groups are actively encouraging people -- around the world and in our country -- to commit terrible acts of violence, oftentimes as lone-wolf actors,"" the president said. ""And even as we work to prevent attacks, all of us -- government, law enforcement, communities, faith leaders -- need to work together to prevent people from falling victim to these hateful ideologies."" Whatever their motives, Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik -- the husband and wife who authorities say walked into a conference center and killed 14 people, most of whom were Farook's co-workers -- had military-style firearms, Obama said. ""We know that the killers in San Bernardino used military-style assault weapons -- weapons of war -- to kill as many people as they could,"" he said. ""It's another tragic reminder that here in America it's way too easy for dangerous people to get their hands on a gun."" Obama repeated his administration's insistence that Congress pass a law forbidding those on the government's no-fly list from being able to buy a gun, a measure the Senate rejected Thursday in a 54-45 vote. ""Right now, people on the no-fly list can walk into a store and buy a gun. That is insane,"" Obama said. ""If you're too dangerous to board a plane, you're too dangerous, by definition, to buy a gun. And so I'm calling on Congress to close this loophole, now. We may not be able to prevent every tragedy, but -- at a bare minimum -- we shouldn't be making it so easy for potential terrorists or criminals to get their hands on a gun that they could use against Americans."" Obama also called on the country to uphold its values, which administration officials have said do not include efforts to discriminate against or demonize Muslims. ""We are strong. And we are resilient. And we will not be terrorized,"" he said. But Republican candidates for president demanded that the U.S. face up to a new world war, one that they said has threatened the safety of Americans and brought the menace of Islamic terrorism into the homeland. They accused Obama and his fellow Democrats of shrinking from an assault on the Islamic State and its tools for global recruitment. ""Our nation is under siege,"" Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey said at a cafe in Iowa on Friday. ""What I believe we're facing is the next world war. This is what we're in right now, already."" Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said: ""This nation needs a wartime president. ""Whether or not the current administration realizes it or is willing to acknowledge it, our enemies are at war with us."" Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush described the looming threat of ""Islamic terrorism that wants to destroy our way of life, wants to attack our freedom."" He added: ""They have declared war on us. And we need to declare war on them."" In Sioux City, Iowa, on Friday, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke not of war but of the need to ferret out ""those folks who are on the Internet radicalizing people"" and called for fighting ""terrorist networks"" from the air and from the ground. Clinton also urged sensitivity toward Muslims. Gun control was the focus of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who Friday clamored for expanded background checks and the closure of gun-purchasing ""loopholes."" In Greenland, N.H., Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida on Friday criticized the stance of the president and the Democratic candidates. ""Forty-eight hours after this is over, they're still out there talking about gun-control measures,"" Rubio said. ""As if somehow terrorists care about what our gun laws are. ""France has some of the strictest gun laws in the world, and they have no problem acquiring an arsenal to kill people,"" he said, evoking the terror attacks in Paris three weeks ago. The New York Times used space on its front page to call for greater gun regulation. Publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. said the newspaper ran its first Page 1 editorial since 1920 on Saturday to ""deliver a strong and visible statement of frustration and anguish about our country's inability to come to terms with the scourge of guns."" The Times' editorial suggests drastically reducing the number of firearms and even ""eliminating some large categories of weapons and ammunition."" On Friday, Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. urged students, staff and faculty at his Christian school to get permits to carry concealed weapons on campus to counter any attack similar to the deadly rampage in California last week. ""Let's teach them a lesson if they ever show up here,"" Falwell told an estimated 10,000 people at convocation in Lynchburg, Va. ""I've always thought if more good people had concealed carry permits, then we could end those Muslims before they walked in."" On Saturday, Falwell said he was specifically referring to Farook and Malik. Falwell also said he believed the campus needed to be prepared in the face of the increasing frequency of mass killings. He cited the 2007 massacre of 32 people at Virginia Tech, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. In a statement issued late Saturday, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe called Falwell's comments ""rash and repugnant.""

http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2015/dec/06/governors-want-more-pre-screening-of-fl/,"LAS VEGAS -- Governors from 19 Western states have called for expansion of a program that screens international travelers at airports abroad. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock told the Western Governors' Association in Las Vegas on Friday that expanding a U.S. government pre-clearance program would serve two purposes. ""First, it enhances national security by keeping potential terrorists from even arriving on U.S. soil,"" he said. ""Second, it encourages tourists to travel to the U.S. by reducing the hassle and wait times at customs checkpoints"" when they arrive. Security was a key issue for Bullock, a Democrat, and the Republican governors of Wyoming, Idaho and Nevada during the conference at the Four Seasons resort. But Bullock said the resolution endorsed by governors of 15 of the 19 states, with some ballots still pending, was in the works long before a mass shooting Wednesday killed 14 people and wounded 21 at a holiday event at a government office in San Bernardino, Calif. The husband-and-wife assailants, who had ties to Pakistan, were killed in a shootout with police. The governors' resolution asks U.S. customs and immigration authorities to put screeners at airports in Belgium, the Dominican Republic, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and England. It notes that screeners are currently stationed at 15 airports in Ireland, Canada, Aruba, the Bahamas, Bermuda and the United Arab Emirates. The governors also approved resolutions calling for federal funding for sustainable forest management in the West, implementation of the 2014 farm bill and safe transportation of defense-related radioactive waste. Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead, association chairman, called security the No. 1 priority for governors of every state, not just the 19 members of the association. Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Washington also are members. ""You can't think of security of any individual state without thinking of the security of the country as a whole,"" said Mead, adding that he expected the larger and separate National Governors Association might address the issue. Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval offered prayers and condolences to people affected by the shooting and pointed to preparations being made for New Year's Eve events, including fireworks, expected to draw up to 350,000 people to the Las Vegas Strip. Sandoval said 1,500 law enforcement officials and the National Guard will be involved. ""We have to be extremely vigilant how we protect our visitors [and] how we protect our residents,"" he said. U.S. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell focused during a keynote speech on issues including drought, wildfires, species protection and abandoned mines. She urged states to continue working with federal officials to address them. Jewell said adopting rules this year to protect habitat for the greater sage grouse in 11 Western states, rather than declare the chicken-sized bird an endangered species, was one example of cooperation. The nation's top land manager acknowledged the breadth of the regulations created lots of work for lawyers. ""But I will say that it's way better than a listing,"" she said. ""It provides certainty to developers ... states ... and the conservation community, as well."" Jewell and Sandoval met separately and reached agreement to use new maps of sage grouse habitat in Nevada to correct inaccuracies that showed the birds living near urban areas in Reno and Sparks -- stopping plans for a badly needed school and a veterans' cemetery. The budget-busting cost of fighting wildfires was another burning issue during the twice-yearly governors' meeting. Robert Bonnie, a U.S. Department of Agriculture undersecretary, said the cost of fighting wildfires has exploded from about 16 percent of the U.S. Forest Service budget in the mid-1990s to more than half the agency budget in recent drought-stricken years. Fires this year in Washington state and California were among the worst on record, and Idaho Gov. Butch Otter noted the so-called Soda Fire in the southwest of his state burned nearly 450 square miles. States are calling for the federal government to classify severe wildfires as natural disasters for funding purposes. Bonnie said the problem is that the Forest Service spent $3 billion of its $5 billion budget fighting fires that charred nearly 10 million acres in 2015, leaving few resources for needed forest management, research and recreation programs.

http://www.inquisitr.com/2613641/liberty-university-president-jerry-falwell-jr-urges-students-to-arm-themselves-video/,"At a Liberty University convocation on Friday, university President Rev. Jerry Falwell Jr. encouraged students to arm themselves in response to a recent terror attack in San Bernardino, California carried out by an American Muslim who may have been converted to radical Islam by his wife who had recently immigrated from Pakistan, as reported by the Inquisitr. ""It just blows my mind that the president of the United States can say that the answer to circumstances like that is more gun control,"" Falwell calmly stated to widespread applause from students gathered.    President Obama has recently described the fact that people who are named as terrorists on no-fly lists are still able to purchase firearms in the United States as being ""insane,"" as reported by the Inquisitr.  Falwell noted that he contacted Madden and inquired as to whether the law enforcement official had children, offering to help them with scholarships.   Falwell stated that if some of the people in the community center in San Bernardino had what he had ""in his back pocket"" then we could ""end those Muslims before they walked in,"" again garnering hoots and applause from the students. Though he did not produce a gun, it appeared that Falwell was ready to produce one from his back pocket. The Second Amendment supporter then encouraged students to ""get your permits"" and pointed out that the university offers a free course in how to become a registered, legal gun owner and carrier. ""Let's teach 'em a lesson if they ever show up here,"" Jerry Falwell Jr. stated to hoots and applause from the Liberty University student body. According to the Washington Post, Jerry Falwell Jr has had a concealed-carry permit for about a year, but that Friday had been the first time he actually carried a gun. The reverend reported carrying a 0.25 pistol in response to the San Bernardino attacks. Falwell also clarified that when he referred to ""those Muslims"" in his convocation statement he was referring to ""Islamic terrorists, specifically those behind the attacks in Paris and in San Bernardino.""

http://feeds.inquisitr.com/~r/google/yDYq/~3/sFcKMYFu89g/,"December 14 marks the three-year anniversary of the Sandy Hook shootings that prompted politicians to concentrate on gun control, increasing the regulations that don't seem to have any impact on the rising gun violence in America. Nonetheless, President Obama intends on strengthening the laws of gun ownership through private dealers. This new law will have no impact on licensed gun dealers who can be monitored through business transactions. Meanwhile, the FBI set a record on Black Friday for 185, 345 investigations while the total number of checks, in an increased effort of gun control, was a bit over 175,000 for last year in its entirety.

https://t.co/wkQEaQN11v #TeamMarco #Rubio2016 — Lissette Kron (@rightwinglatina) December 6, 2015  ""Right now, people on the no-fly list can walk into a store and buy a gun. That is insane,"" the president said, concerning gun control laws in the United States. ""If you're too dangerous to board a plane, you're too dangerous, by definition, to buy a gun."" All this commotion comes after another investigated shooting, this time in San Bernardino, California, disrupts citizens in the United States and claims 14 lives. Islamic State of Iraq and Syria celebrate the shooting as a victory for ISIS. The event has a sobering effect on the United States and President Obama declares another re-evaluation for gun control. [embed]https://youtu.be/2Gmb_56skZw[/embed] President Obama made yet another plea to Congress to close the gap in order to enhance gun control laws making it even more difficult to sell, purchase, or own a firearm. He says the laws of the United States should decrease the potential for terrorists and criminals to get their hands on weapons to use against citizens of the country. The clear way to achieve this end, according to Obama, is through stricter gun control laws. Some citizens suggest a ""thoughts and prayers"" fund of which monies are garnished from the 535 Congress members to donate to the victimized families. If each life that was lost cost each member $25, each family would stand to gain $13,375, which isn't much in exchange for a human life, but it may be enough to gather attention. If the amount were higher, perhaps something more would be done. Having an impression on the individual's pocketbook in Congress may stimulate some deeper thinking on the matters of gun control.

That equates to over one mass shooting per day, thus far. President Obama claims to call for ""common sense"" gun control laws with the opinion that new legislation will cause the number of shootings to decrease. But, not everyone agrees. In fact, most people tend to believe that the media coverage of gun control and mass shootings heightens the dangers and doesn't have a positive impact at all. The graphic violence, grief-stricken individuals, and laughable efforts of prevention have many Americans scratching their heads and trying to determine if gun control is the way to go at all.

http://www.ibtimes.com/london-police-investigating-leytonstone-stabbing-terrorist-incident-2213227,"UPDATE: 9:15 p.m. EST -- Police early Monday, London time, filed attempted murder charges against a 29-year-old man who went on a stabbing rampage in the Leytonstone Underground Station. Muhaydin Mire was in custody at Westminister Magistrates' Court. UPDATE: 12:33 p.m. EDT -- The British Transport Police announced Sunday they are employing additional security measures in the wake of the stabbing, and asked the public to remain calm and continue using public transportation in their normal fashion. ""The safety of the traveling public remains our top priority. In addition to our usual specialist response teams, last week we launched Project Servator deploying even more highly visible police patrols designed to identify and deter terrorism,” assistant chief constable Mark Newton said in a statement. “Following the incident last night, we are now deploying still more officers in this role. They involve both uniformed and plain-clothed officers, supported by other resources, such as armed officers, police dogs, a network of CCTV cameras, and the thousands of rail staff we work alongside.” Original story: Detectives are investigating a violent and seemingly unprovoked knife attack at London's Leytonstone subway station -- which left one man seriously injured -- as a “terrorist incident,” London's Metropolitan police said in a statement Sunday. The 29-year-old suspect was arrested after being Tasered by police Saturday evening, with witnesses saying he shouted, “This is for Syria.” “As a result of the information received at the time from people who were at the scene and subsequent investigations carried out by the Counter Terrorism Command, I am treating this as a terrorist incident,” Richard Walton, commander of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command Division. “I would continue to urge the public to remain calm but alert and vigilant. The threat from terrorism remains at severe, which means that a terrorist attack is highly likely.” The man attacked the 56-year-old victim -- punching and kicking him before knocking him to the floor and pulling out a 3-inch knife, witnesses said, before shouting threats at others in the subway station. The victim suffered “serious” knife wounds but is expected to survive. Graphic video footage recorded by bystanders shows a large amount of blood spread over the floor of the Leytonstone station. The attack comes weeks after the Islamic State terrorist group claimed responsibility for a series of attacks in Paris that killed 130 people. That attack was followed by a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, that killed 14 people and, while police have yet to identify a motive, the FBI is investigating it as a terrorist incident. “Whilst this is clearly a serious incident and the mayor's thoughts are with the victim, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage on what is an ongoing investigation,” a spokesman for London mayor Boris Johnson said in a statement. “The incident, and the swift and professional response of the officers involved, remind us of the dangers faced by the police every single day in their efforts to protect Londoners and keep the city safe.”"

http://www.ibtimes.com/pakistani-security-seeks-tamp-down-reporting-california-shooter-2213296,"MULTAN, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistani security forces appeared to be trying to dampen down reporting this weekend on the background of Tashfeen Malik, who mounted an attack alongside her husband that killed 14 people in California. Three professors at Malik's university said they had been advised not to talk to the media, while men claiming to be from Pakistan's security agencies told reporters to drop their investigations into her background on pain of arrest. An official at the interior ministry later said this was due to a ""misunderstanding"". U.S. authorities are treating last Wednesday's mass shooting in San Bernardino as an ""act of terrorism"". Malik, 29, and husband Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, were killed two hours later in a shootout with police. The Iraq- and Syria-based Islamic State jihadist group has claimed the couple as its followers, although it has not said it was in contact with them or that it directed the attack. Malik was born in Pakistan but spent most of her life in Saudi Arabia before she came to the United States to marry her husband, a U.S. citizen. She had a degree in pharmacy from a university in Pakistan's central city of Multan. On Sunday, three professors at Bahauddin Zakariya University, which Malik attended, said they had been instructed by security agencies not to speak to reporters. One, who asked not to be named, said security officials visited the university on Saturday and removed records and pictures of Tashfeen. ""She was a very reserved person, a very quiet girl, she kept to herself,"" the professor said. ""I could have never imagined she was capable of something like this. And there was nothing on the surface to suggest she had such extremist tendencies."" ""I think this change in her mind, whenever it happened, must be very recent. The girl I remember ... she could not have the guts to do this."" Another former professor said he did not remember her at all. ""She was probably not someone who stood out, academically or otherwise,"" he said. Unspecified Offenses Men claiming to be from security agencies, but who refused to provide identification, also sought to discourage Reuters from further reporting on Malik's background, threatening journalists with arrest for unspecified offences. ""Whether you consider this a request or a dictation (order), I would advise you not to pursue this story,"" one said. Tim Craig, a reporter from the Washington Post, tweeted that police had prevented him from leaving his hotel in Multan. ""I've lost track of how many different security/intel officials I've had to talk to, copy my passport, etc in past 17 hours - think 12 to 16,"" he tweeted. Reuters was eventually allowed to continue reporting with a police escort provided for security reasons. An interior ministry official later told Reuters the situation had been the result of a misunderstanding by over-enthusiastic local police. ""This is not our policy. We have nothing to hide, and we want to facilitate journalists,"" the official, who did not wish to be named, said. Several security officials said the restrictions on the press were partly due to Pakistani fears that the country would be blamed for Malik's actions. ""Pakistan has nothing to do with this but it will be used to malign Pakistan. So of course we have to care about how this is being seen and reported,"" one official said. On Sunday, Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar said Pakistan was willing to give any assistance that the United States required to investigate Malik, and highlighted that she spent most of her life in Saudi Arabia. ""Such acts of terrorism which take place across the world bring a bad name to Islam,"" he said. ""You cannot blame the religion and the nation due to the personal actions of one person."""
http://www.ocregister.com/articles/farook-695031-nwadike-one.html,"Trending:  Police officers stand watch at one of the entrance to the  Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino after the mass shooting there that killed 14 people.  Tashfeen Malik, 29, of Redlands was the wife of Syed Rizwan Farook. She was a native of Pakistan who came to the United States from Saudi Arabia in 2014 on a fiancée visa. She became a legal permanent resident after they  married. Federal officials have said she pledged allegiance to an Islamic State leader in a Facebook post under an assumed name.  San Bernardino  police Lt. Mike  Madden,   the first  on the scene, called the carnage  unspeakable.  Denise Peraza, 27, of Upland, was shot in the back attack on Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino.  Angelika Robinson is a licensed clinical psychologist with The Counseling Team International in Murrieta. At the time of the shooting, she was counseling a family in an adjacent building of the Inland Regional Center, which provides services for people with developmental disabilities, such as autism.  Chris Nwadike, 62, of Rialto, has been an environmental health specialist with San Bernardino County for 25 years. At one point, he sat next to Syed Rizwan Farook. He is married and a father of four children aged 13 to 23. He was in the bathroom at the time of the shooting.  Unspeakable carnage -- San Bernardino County environmental health specialist Chris Nwadike, licensed clinical psychologist Angelika Robinson and San Bernardino police were at the epicenter of the worst mass shooting in America in three years.  Two people embrace after being evacuated to a golf course across the street from the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino following Wednesday's mass shooting.  Works are escorted to waiting buses after the shooting at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino on Wednesday, Dec. 2.  Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, of Redlands; an environmental health specialist for San Bernardino County. He graduated from Cal State San Bernardino in 2010. Experts believe he was self-radicalized, possibly under the influence of his wife of one year, Tashfeen Malink, whom he met through an online dating service. He was one of the gunman who killed 14 people and injured 21 in a Dec. 2 attack at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino; killed in a shootout with police.  San Bernardino County employee Chris Nwadike was happy to go to work Wednesday. It was the annual end-of-year training meeting and holiday party, with a potluck, games and gift-card prizes. Several hours after the event began, the group of about 85 environmental health workers took a break. They chatted with colleagues, ventured outside and noshed on doughnuts and tamales from the buffet table near a Christmas tree in a rented room at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino. Nwadike and a few other men took a restroom break. That’s when two masked intruders with assault rifles and handguns burst through the east doors off the parking lot, just feet from where Nwadike had been sitting. First, there was a loud blast. Nwadike thought the building had collapsed. Others wondered if it was a bomb. Then came the distinctive, rapid bursts of semi-automatic gunfire: pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. The shooters, dressed in black and wearing tactical vests laden with ammunition, sprayed as many as 75 bullets across the room. The impact broke water glasses on tables and triggered overhead fire sprinklers that rained on the chaos below. The acrid smell of gunpowder filled the room, and the steady blasts of the fire alarm mingled with the wails of the unsuspecting employees. The festive mood turned to terror as the partygoers dived for cover. They clung to each other under buffet tables and took meager shelter behind fallen chairs. They prayed. They cried. They wondered, when will it stop? Minutes felt like hours. The steady blasts continued for about 30 seconds. There was a pause while the gunmen reloaded. Then came single shots, followed by the screams and moans of their victims. Some, like Julie Swann-Paez, played dead after she was shot. As she lay motionless on the carpet with a wound to her stomach, one of the shooters returned and fired into her upper thigh. Work friends Denise Peraza and Shannon Johnson huddled together behind a chair, his left arm tight around her, pulling her close. “I got you,” he told her just before a bullet pierced her back and another killed him. RELATED: A terrible toll: Here are the stories of the 14 people killed in San Bernardin Eurich Santiago cowered beneath a table with nothing between him and the shooters but a tablecloth. Water from the broken and overturned glasses above dripped onto his back as he waited for the siege to end. Another woman bear-crawled out of the room and hid in a cabinet. Survival instincts kicked in for John Ramos, who scrambled frantically to get away from the carnage. He injured his hands, wrists, knee, toe and back falling and jumping over a hedge. But he is alive. Nwadike and Patrick Baccari are alive too, probably because they were in the restroom across the hall from the conference room. Baccari was standing at the towel dispenser when the shooting started. He was hit in the face by flying debris, possibly tiles blasted off the wall. “Get down on the floor!” he yelled to his colleagues. Baccari and another man lay down and held the restroom door closed with their feet. The shooter “wasn’t going to be able to get in. I guess if he did, it would have been over our dead bodies,” Baccari said. Nwadike lay prone and still on the floor of a stall. “I prayed. I wondered, ‘When will it be my turn?’” In the four minutes it took for police to arrive, the frightened victims texted and called their families, many not knowing if they would live or die. Swann-Paez texted her husband and children a photo of herself on the floor with the words, “Love you guys. Was shot.” Jennifer Stevens left her mother a voice mail when she didn’t pick up the phone. “Mom, I’m OK, but I’ve been shot.” RELATED: ‘She sounded terrorized’ — loved ones frantic after mass shooting SURVIVOR’S GUILT Elsewhere in the building, Inland Regional Center employees also took cover. Huddled beneath a desk, a bookshelf shoved against a locked office door, Regina Kuruppu held tightly to her co-workers’ hands and began to pray aloud, unable to drown out the terrifying cries coming from one story below. “Heavenly Father,” she said as her colleagues tried to offer words of comfort, “watch over my family. Watch over us.” When the fire alarm had sounded minutes earlier, Kuruppu was sitting at her desk on the second floor of Building 3. Kuruppu, a 19-year veteran of the organization that helps those with developmental disabilities such as autism and cerebral palsy, was wrapping up her pre-vacation emails, sending notes of thanks to the center’s supporters. She was anticipating being off for the month and home doing what she loved: baking for the holidays and stringing Christmas lights outside her home. The alarm, she thought, was just a drill – until she got downstairs and saw two bodies in a pool of blood by the door of the auditorium, the victims’ eyes open and unblinking. She didn’t stop to wonder what evil had come to the center that morning or why. Those questions would come later, for her and for a nation left shocked not only by another mass shooting, but another act of terrorism at home. Barricaded upstairs, Kuruppu could only pray for protection – even as she prepared to die. She thought of her son. She texted her sister. They exchanged their “I love yous.” A woman of strong faith, Kuruppu tried to hold fast to hope. But she kept remembering the unseeing eyes downstairs. San Bernardino police Lt. Mike Madden, the first on scene, entered the fray with three other officers, passing dead bodies along the way. Madden was struck by the panicked faces of survivors. He felt guilty as he bypassed the injured who were so obviously in need of help. But his team had to secure the building first. Police didn’t know whether the shooters were still inside. “It was unspeakable, the carnage that we were seeing,” he said. RELATED: ‘It was unspeakable, the carnage,’ says one of first officers on scene Licensed clinical psychologist Angelika Robinson was in an adjacent building when she heard rapid pops. Not recognizing the sounds as gunfire, she went into the hall to investigate. Through the glass doors, she saw frightened people running out of the other building. Someone ran down the hall telling people to find inside offices, close blinds and stay away from the windows because of an active shooter. “It felt unreal,” Robinson said. She comforted two people who had escaped the conference room shooting. One was distraught, the other wept quietly. “I think what I’m really experiencing most powerfully is a sense of helplessness. And a sense of having wanted to do more. Of having wanted to do something – anything,” she said. Eventually, officers began evacuating the building. They worked to calm those in a hallway, who whispered and wrung their hands, wondering who the shooter was. They had to keep their hands raised, since the gunmen were at large. A young boy held the hands of two women as they walked slowly from the scene. An officer told the crowd, “Relax. Everybody try to relax. I’ll take a bullet before you do, that’s for damn sure.”  In the end, 14 people died, 21 were injured, making it the nation’s deadliest mass shooting since 27 were killed at Newtown, Conn., in 2012. HOURS OF UNCERTAINTY It wasn’t until several hours later that the victims learned that one of the gunmen was a colleague – Syed Rizwan Farook, who worked as a county environmental health inspector for five years. The other shooter was his wife, Tashfeen Malik. Malik was a native of Pakistan who moved to Saudi Arabia as a young adult. She wasn’t on any terrorism watch lists, but at least one terrorism expert thinks she may have radicalized Farook after they connected through an online dating service. Farook had attended the event that morning, sharing a table with Nwadike and Baccari. It wasn’t until event organizers were handing out clickers for a true-false trivia game before the break that the other men noticed Farook’s seat at the end of the table was empty, his belongings still there. Nwadike asked that a clicker be left at Farook’s place, assuming he was coming back. When Farook returned at about 11 a.m., he came with his wife, guns and plenty of ammunition. No one was spared their murderous rage, not even Farook’s best friend at work, Isaac Amanios. He was the first one killed as he sat on a bench outside the conference room’s glass walls. “They didn’t stay long. They were just spraying bullets everywhere,” Nwadike said. “He came to kill.” The couple fled in a black SUV they had rented a few days earlier. Police were tipped to Farook’s identity by someone who had been inside the building. That person expressed concern about how Farook had abruptly left the party. That information led to a Redlands townhouse rented by Farook and Malik. As police approached, the couple sped off in the SUV, sparking a chase and standoff in San Bernardino. Farook, who stepped outside the vehicle, and Malik, who shot through the rear windows, fired 76 rounds. Police fired 380 shots, killing the couple. One officer was struck and went to the hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening. On their bodies and inside the car, the couple had more than 1,600 bullets. A search of their home turned up an arsenal of 12 pipe bombs, and 3,000 rounds of ammunition in the garage. The FBI is calling the attack an act of terrorism. Nwadike believes Malik, who came from Saudi Arabia and married Farook in the United States last year, corrupted his former cubicle mate. Federal investigators have said she pledged allegiance to an Islamic State leader on the Internet. Nwadike said Farook was a good worker; he was quiet and never made trouble or had a confrontation with his co-workers. Though Farook rarely initiated conversations, he always answered inquiries about his wife and infant daughter with a smile. Before the shooting, the couple left their 6-month-old baby with her grandmother, saying they had a doctor’s appointment. Employees in the environmental health division were a tight-knit group. When Farook’s wife was pregnant, his colleagues took up a collection for a gift and threw a potluck baby shower. Nwadike still has trouble believing his friend could be responsible for such a tragedy. “When I found out it was him, I shouted, ‘No!’ I couldn’t believe it was him,” he said. Nwadike can’t bring himself to watch accounts of the massacre on TV. It makes him too sad to see the faces and hear the stories of the friends he lost. He wonders how much higher the death toll would have been had they not been on break. The horror is setting in for other survivors as well. Tracie Thompson, who was shot, teared up when asked about the attack. “It’s too soon,” she said. San Bernardino County closed down all but critical operations on the two days after the shooting. Employees will return to work Monday, except for those in environmental health, who will remain off for at least another week. “I don’t want to go back to work,” John Ramos said. “Two who sat next to me are gone.” Staff writer Suzanne Hurt contributed to this report.

http://feeds.inquisitr.com/~r/google/yDYq/~3/QcRoCRsjNkM/,"Should Muslims be racially profiled in the U.S. to prevent attacks of terror like the recent San Bernardino shooting? Donald Trump seems to think so. Think Progress reports that the presidential hopeful wants to ""track and racially profile"" people and their families to prevent terrorism. The comments were made during an interview with Face the Nation host John Dickerson. Dickerson asked Trump how the U.S. could prevent another mass shooting from happening again, to which Trump bluntly answered with his support of racial profiling. He also used the opportunity to attack the POTUS, Barack Obama.  This isn't the first time Donald Trump has called for Muslims to be racially profiled. Last month indicated his support for ""warrantless searches"" and ""increased surveillance"" of Muslim people. He also indicated support for registering Muslims on a database registry, much like how sex offenders are registered. Some critics have compared this opinion with what Hitler did to Jewish people during the holocaust. Trump's points of view have angered liberal Americans, and Americans who are practicing Muslims. Negative sentiment toward Muslims is active on social media, while others are arguing against lumping an entire religion into the actions of extremists. Meanwhile, ABC News reports that Muslims in the U.S. are ""struggling"" to find the way to condemn the recent acts in San Bernardino. Other reports are arguing that Muslims don't need to apologize for the actions of what they see as only a few extreme people.  — Santsuh (@Santsuh_) December 6, 2015  — Santsuh (@Santsuh_) December 6, 2015  — Huffington Post (@HuffingtonPost) December 2, 2015  — Huffington Post (@HuffingtonPost) December 2, 2015  [Image via Shutterstock]"

Mr. Obama isn’t expected to announce in an Oval Office address an overhaul of his counterterrorism strategy at home or overseas or the U.S.-led fight in Iraq and Syria against Islamic State, people familiar with the matter said. In his third Oval Office address to the nation since becoming president, Mr. Obama is broadly seeking to convey to an increasingly jittery nation that his administration is vigilant in addressing the ability of terrorists to strike within the U.S. The president’s remarks begin at 8 p.m. EST.

http://www.opednews.com/articles/An-Incompetent-FBI-Dropped-by-John-Kiriakou-Intelligence_Metadata_Police_Shooters-151206-552.html,"Reprinted from Reader Supported News The FBI has, yet again, dropped the ball. For all the billions of dollars in their budget, for all the metadata they and their intelligence colleagues are collecting on every American citizen, and for all the years they've had since the September 11 attacks to recruit informants to infiltrate terrorist groups, two people with ties to Muslim militants were able to perpetrate yet another mass shooting, this time resulting in 14 dead in San Bernardino, California. One of the shooters, Syed Farook, was ""in contact"" with terrorism suspects, but the FBI now admits that it did nothing about it. Indeed, a spokesman said that the contact was ""soft,"" meaning that it wasn't frequent. The implication is that Americans aren't supposed to worry when somebody is in direct contact with a terrorist suspect overseas. It's not important enough for the FBI to follow up on. Until, of course, that person shoots up a social services center and kills 14 people. The problem here is deep, and it is one of longtime FBI incompetence, mismanagement, and intransigence. I wrote in my book, ""The Reluctant Spy: My Secret Life in the CIA's War on Terror,"" of an incident in which I personally witnessed FBI incompetence -- in Peshawar, Pakistan, in 2002, when I was the chief of CIA counterterrorism operations there. I was part of a team that raided the Taliban embassy in Peshawar that year. As part of our ""haul,"" we confiscated a set of file folders that contained more than a year's worth of the embassy's phone bills. Those bills showed hundreds of calls from the Taliban to phone numbers all across the United States -- Buffalo, Kansas City, Sacramento, Tampa, Detroit, and elsewhere. Those calls ended abruptly on September 10, 2001, and then started up again on September 16. Who was receiving these calls? Why were they receiving calls from the Taliban? It was possible that they were Afghan nationals with legitimate consular issues. But it was equally plausible that they were working for or with the Taliban in some way, possibly against the United States. Could they have been spies? Were they ""sleepers,"" tasked with living quiet lives until called upon to carry out an attack? We didn't know. I informed CIA Headquarters and was told that it was an FBI issue. I then sent the original phone bills to the FBI, with copies to the CIA, and then I returned to my regular business. Months passed. I returned to CIA Headquarters and, in the summer of 2002, I ran into an FBI agent with whom I had worked in Pakistan. ""What happened with those Taliban phone bills?"" I asked. The FBI was waiting for Pashto translators to become available. ""Pashto translators?"" I asked. ""But those bills were written in English. That's how I knew what they were."" I resigned from the CIA a year and a half later. Again I ran into a former FBI colleague. ""Whatever happened to those Taliban phone bills?"" ""Oh,"" he said, ""they ended up being shipped to an FBI storage facility in suburban Maryland."" Just like in the final scene of Raiders of the Lost Ark, the box of phone bills was never even opened. We'll never know if there was or is a threat to Americans originating with the Taliban or Taliban sympathizers. We'll never know why those Americans were in contact with the Taliban immediately before and immediately after September 11. This seems to be what happened again last week in San Bernardino. Metadata collection is no substitute for human intelligence and good police work. But even with the information that Farook was in contact with terrorist suspects, the FBI did nothing. This time people died. Heads should roll.  11

http://nypost.com/2015/12/06/she-was-a-honey-trap-wife-led-the-charge-in-california-massacre/,"Submit Submit Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Terrorist housewife Tashfeen Malik led the charge in last week’s ISIS-inspired attack in California, firing the first shots at a group of government employees gathered around a Christmas tree, according to witness accounts reported Sunday. The fusillade from the female jihadist’s high-powered rifle sparked chaos as bullets tore into victims who fell to the floor dead or wounded, while the Christmas tree toppled over, witnesses told the Sunday Times of London. Meanwhile, Malik’s husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, seemed to hesitate in pulling the trigger on his co-workers — either because he temporarily chickened out or because he was searching for a specific target, the Times said. The paper suggested Farook may have been trying to find Nicholas Thalasinos, a Messianic Jew and ardent Zionist with whom Farook had argued over his Muslim faith. Thalasinos was among the 14 killed in the bloodbath. Another 21 people were wounded. Witnesses said each of the black-clad killers assumed “a stance” for shooting when they entered the conference room at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino at around 11 a.m. Wednesday. Malik, 29, moved to the right of the door, and Farook, 28, went to the left as they leveled their AR-15-style rifles at the holiday party that followed a training session. Farook had left about 30 minutes earlier, before the party began. After the shooting, as workers with the county health department lay dead and bleeding, Farook stepped over them to plant a remote-controlled bomb, which did not detonate, on the table at which he had earlier been seated. The couple, parents of a 6-month-old girl, were both killed in a shootout with cops about four hours later. Bottles of the anti-anxiety drug Xanax and the stimulant Adderall were found on the kitchen counter back at their home in Redlands, Calif., the Times said. Authorities suspect that Malik, who praised ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on Facebook moments before the attack, “was the catalyst for sympathetic views and extreme views toward jihad in this relationship,” an official briefed on the investigation told The Post. “They believe that she was responsible for radicalizing Farook, and they believe that this happened over a period of time during their marriage,” the official said. “It just didn’t happen overnight. It took some time, but she was able to instill her sick, twisted views into his mind.” A former co-worker of Farook’s endorsed that notion, saying he noticed a change in Farook’s personality after his August 2014 wedding to Malik in Saudi Arabia. “I think he married a terrorist,” Christian Nwadike told the Times. Farook, who was born in Illinois, met Malik online. She was born and raised in Pakistan but moved to Saudi Arabia as an adult. A relative who lives in Malik’s hometown of Karor Las Esan, Pakistan, told the Los Angeles Times that Malik began posting extremist messages on Facebook that alarmed her family shortly after she arrived in the United States. The relative said Malik had once been a “modern girl” but embraced her Islamic faith while in college and “started asking women in the family and the locality to become good Muslims.” “She used to talk to somebody in Arabic at night on the Internet. None of our family members in Pakistan know Arabic, so we do not know what she used to discuss,” the relative said. Farook’s dad, also named Syed, told the Italian newspaper La Stampa that his son supported ISIS and was fixated with the idea of fighting Israel. “My son said that he shared al-Baghdadi’s ideology and supported the creation of the Islamic State. He was also obsessed with Israel,” the father said. Farook’s father described his son as “very religious.” “Once we had a dispute over the historical figure of Jesus,” he said, according to a translation by the Times of Israel. “My son called me a godless person, and he decided that my marriage with my wife had to end,” added the elder Farook, who was divorced by his son’s mother, Rafia, in 2006 over allegations of alcoholism and abuse.

http://www.ibtimes.com/obama-couldnt-stop-san-bernardino-shooters-expect-more-isis-details-sunday-speech-2213315,"As he addresses the nation Sunday evening, President Barack Obama is under more pressure than ever to protect Americans from attack on their own soil. After 130 people were slaughtered in Paris and 14 in San Bernardino, California, conservatives, liberals, presidential hopefuls and security experts all agree the United States must use every available resource to stop the Islamic State terrorist group. The best approach, though, and how to implement it is where decision-makers quickly and bitterly divide. That's the political landscape Obama faces Sunday, when he is to deliver an address to the nation at 8 p.m. EST about the threat presented by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. The president will pledge to deploy “every single aspect of American power” to stop ISIS, as well as give an update on the investigation into the San Bernardino shooters, Reuters reported Sunday. “He will reiterate his firm conviction that ISIL will be destroyed and that the United States must draw upon our values, our unwavering commitment to justice, equality and freedom, to prevail over terrorist groups that use violence to advance a destructive ideology,” White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement announcing the address. The president may have no choice but to work outside the obvious channels in facing the threat within U.S. borders. Surveillance conducted by the National Security Agency and other intelligence arms is primarily designed to detect anomalous interactions between Americans and overseas contacts, including suspicious communications and large financial transfers, rather than activities within the country. The couple blamed for the San Bernardino mass shooting may have been ISIS sympathizers, but may have been acting on their own initiative. They also purchased their weapons legally, and initial reports suggest they left little evidence of their plot online. “You just can't stop it all,” Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said on “Fox News Sunday.” “We've stopped a lot of bad things from happening, but you can't just stop it all. ... You can't be right every time.”  Watch @POTUS deliver a statement on the shooting in San Bernardino.&#10;https://t.co/JixeyA8M2f  Aside from tougher gun control laws, which have consistently failed to get through Congress, the president could increase investment in safety technology and research at home. Surveillance companies and cybersecurity researchers have responded to the mass shooting epidemic and increased terror concerns not by focusing on policy, but technology. One possibility under consideration by Brickhouse Security, a New York company that works with U.S. government contractors, is a modernized metal detector that's hidden in windows or doors. “Traditional metal detectors aren't effective because people have cell phones, belts and so many other things that create a false positive,” said Todd Morris, CEO of Brickhouse Security. “In reality, what people want is a gun detector, or something that can be installed inexpensively at schools and stadiums.” That kind of technology currently exists, but, because it's so expensive, is primarily used by the military for detecting improvised explosive devices in overseas combat zones. There's also a growing amount of research about how ISIS reaches potential recruits on the other side of the world. The Department of Defense is funding a three-year grant research program at Arizona State University meant to determine how ISIS determines which social media users might be most suspectible to its propaganda. “Our focus now is looking at how things spread in a network of individuals, then based on that we can predict what will go viral,” Dr. Paulo Shakarian, a director of the Cyber-Socio Intelligent Systems Lab at ASU, previously told International Business Times. “We can look at things like what kind of persuasive techniques are being used and how effective they are. ... What we hope to do is provide recommendations for how to counter those messages.” That's a more concrete suggestion than the ones offered by presidential hopefuls on both sides. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., have suggested working with technology companies, or forcing them, to remove encrypted messaging from their consumer offerings (no public evidence has yet indicated the San Bernardino shooters used encrypted messaging). Others, including Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have suggested increased international intelligence sharing. ""We have got to do everything that we can to protect the American people,” Sanders said Sunday on CBS' “Face the Nation.” “That's a no-brainer, and that means much tougher screening polices than we have right now. ... I think clearly Paris was an intelligence failure and we need to be tapping the intelligence information that is being ascertained from countries all over the world.” Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump plans to insert himself into the debate during Obama's remarks. The real estate mogul earlier Sunday called for overt racial profiling to counter domestic terror threats. I will be live-tweeting President Obama&#39;s prime-time speech tonight starting at 7:50 P.M. (Eastern).Will he finally state the real problems?  "

Like most 16-year-olds, we could not process what had happened. We lightened the news by making jokes. It was not until I got home and spoke to my family that I learned that the shooter was the child of a very good friend and colleague of my dad. Due to that terrible incident, his and his wife's lives were ruined. They moved to Florida to escape the endless barrage of news people hounding them. One of the last times I spoke with him, he said, ""Josh, I am done trying to figure out the world."" I wrote that down as he said it, thinking that was poignant. It seemed enormously unfair that this kind, positive, loving person could in any way be connected to the horrible actions of his child. Any time I see a school shooting or mass shooting, and people look for motive, all I think about are his words. Obviously, no reason will justify the insane actions of lunatics or provide any sense of relief or closure. I am done trying to figure these things out. I have only grief for the victims, their families and the witnesses. I am also acutely aware of the terrible pain and possibly fear that the family of the shooters must face. Not to mention all the children going to school afraid today. As a teacher during the Columbine shooting, I recall how terrified kids were to come back to school, and discouraged that more teachers did not take time during class to address these fears with kids. That is the only advice I can give — talk about it with kids. People will rally against guns, engage in dialogues about mental illness, speculate about terrorism, but all I can think of is talking to children about their feelings and hoping to find some glimmer of hope in that. Because, frankly, I am sick of adults. — Josh Flanders, Chicago CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune"

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/126865263/0/phoenix/nation~Sandy-Hook-families-The-weapon-that-binds-us-to-San-Bernardino/,"Coverage of Wednesday's mass shooting that claimed at least 14 lives and left 21 wounded in San Bernardino, Calif., has made repeated references to the murders in Newtown, Conn., that robbed us of our children, daughter and sister nearly three years ago. Comparisons to past massacres are now automatic when news breaks of the latest mass shooting: How many more dead? How many weeks or months has it been since a shooting with a higher body count? These parallels do little more than underscore the harrowing monotony of American gun violence. We should be talking about San Bernardino and the 26 killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in the same breath, but for a different reason. One of the assailants in San Bernardino used a DPMS AR-15 semiautomatic rifle; in Sandy Hook, the shooter was armed with a Bushmaster AR-15. The DPMS and Bushmaster brands are owned by the same company, a firearms conglomerate known as Remington Outdoor, formerly the Freedom Group. In its most recent annual report, Remington boasts that it is one of the largest suppliers of these guns, which it calls modern sporting rifles, to civilians — and that the company owes its leading market share position to the Bushmaster and DPMS brands. USA TODAY Olivia Nalos Opre: Why we hunt, even lions The fact that mass shooters are attracted to Remington's product line is hardly surprising. The AR-15 was designed as a combat weapon for the U.S. military, establishing its bona fides in the trenches of Vietnam. With semiautomatic fire and a detachable magazine, the AR-15 can unleash a torrent of bullets in a matter of seconds. For individuals bent on inflicting maximum civilian carnage, the AR-15 is the unparalleled choice. (And it is often a choice: The San Bernardino assailants were in possession of handguns but gunned down their victims with AR-15s, including the DPMS model and another made by Smith & Wesson. In Sandy Hook, the shooter selected the Bushmaster AR-15 from an extensive arsenal in his home.) What should surprise — and horrify — us is that Remington actively promotes the AR-15's capacity to inflict mass causalities. Remington markets its AR-15s with images of soldiers and SWAT teams; it dubs various models the ""patrolman"" and the ""adaptive combat rifle""; and it actively encourages the notion that the AR-15 bestows power and glory upon those who wield it. USA TODAY Olivia Nalos Opre: Why we hunt, even lions Remington's advertising copy for its assault rifles has included the following: ""The uncompromising choice when you demand a rifle as mission-adaptable as you are."" ""Forces of opposition bow down — you are single-handedly outnumbered."" DPMS boasts that its GII AP4 model is ""built on award-winning badassness."" In an era when mass shooters are often equipped with fatigues, vests or other combat gear, this type of marketing is not only unethical, it also is reckless. What does Remington have to say? In response to the tragedy in Sandy Hook, the company's then-CEO George Kollitides said: ""It's very easy to blame an inanimate object. Any kind of instrument in the wrong hands can be put to evil use."" This familiar refrain rings hollow because it fails to acknowledge that our country continues to prove itself incapable of keeping deadly weapons out of the wrong hands. Perhaps more to the point, it ignores the fact that extolling a weapon's destructive potential might actually attract the wrong hands. David and Francine Wheeler, parents of Benjamin Wheeler, 6.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/kPGmOMCRPc0/,"President Obama delivered a rare prime time address from the Oval Office on Sunday in an effort to quell fears that the U.S. is particularly vulnerable to terrorism following last week’s mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. “I know that after so much war, many Americans are asking whether are we are confronted by a cancer that has no immediate cure,” Obama said Sunday, standing behind a lectern in the Oval Office. “The threat from terrorism is real but we will overcome it. We will destroy [ISIS] and any other organization that tries to harm us…we will prevail by being strong and smart.” “Lets make sure we never forget what makes us exceptional,” said Obama, who spoke before heading off to the Kennedy Center Honors celebration in Washington, D.C., a trip he almost canceled for the address. “Let’s not forget that freedom is always more powerful than fear.” The 15-minute speech was more about reassuring the public than announcing any major changes to the ongoing fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS) or revealing new details about the ongoing investigation in California. On Sunday night, the Commander in Chief sought to take on the role of the nation’s teacher, soberly outlining the threat of terrorism based on high-level intelligence and giving a broad overview of the existing efforts the U.S. is putting forward to defeat and ultimately destroy the terrorist network. President Obama also acknowledged the changing nature of terrorism amid the rise of ISIS, saying it’s imperative that the American people remain vigilant and aware while resisting urges to discriminate against Muslims and immigrants to America in efforts to keep the homeland safe. He called on all Americans, of every faith to reject “discrimination.” That kind of “betrayal of American values” plays into the hands of groups like ISIS, he said. “[ISIS] does not speak for Islam, they are thugs and killers,” the President continued. “We cannot turn against one another by letting this war be defined as a fight against Islam.” Obama stopped short of delivering news of any new efforts to take out the terrorist network ISIS, instead insisting that the international coalition the U.S. is leading has already ramped up targeted attacks against the group’s strongholds. The end goal, he said, is to destroy the group, which may have inspired the shooting in California, and bears responsibility for the Nov.13 attacks in Paris. Since the shooting, President Obama has spoken to both British Prime Minister David Cameron and French President François Hollande about increasing strikes abroad. The U.K. Parliament voted last week to join the coalition air campaign in Syria. But he insisted that Americans would not be drawn into another ground war like in Afghanistan and Iraq. The speech Sunday focused more on the terrorism aspect than Obama has in recent days, though he also called for stricter gun-control measures — a line that’s drawn ire from Republicans in Congress and seeking to succeed him. “I know there are some who reject any gun-safety measures, but the fact is that every intelligence and law-enforcement agency cannot identify every mass shooter,” Obama said. “What we can do and must do is make it harder for those to kill.” Obama did call on Congress to block people on no-fly lists from getting guns — a measure that failed in the Senate this week — and urged them to vote to authorize the use of military force against ISIS. “I think it’s time for Congress to vote to demonstrate that the American people are united and committed to this fight.” Read more: 2016 Presidential Candidates React to San Bernardino Shooting There are still few clues as to motive in the shooting rampage of husband and wife Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik that killed 14 people and injured over a dozen more in San Bernardino. Federal authorities are currently investigating the attack as an act of terrorism, with investigators citing evidence they had been radicalized and inspired by ISIS terrorists — though there is currently no indication that either were directly linked to the terrorist network. Assault weapons, ammunition, and supplies to make bombs were discovered in the couple’s home. The husband had reportedly traveled to Saudi Arabia in 2014 and the wife is believed to have pledged herself to ISIS ahead of the massacre. “We are looking at everything we can find out about these two killers’ lives,” said Attorney General Loretta Lynch during an appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday. But, she said, the nature of the attack and the apparent lack of a link to a broader terrorist group indicates the “evolving nature” of the threat of terrorism. “We have come from a time of the large scale, planned al-Qaeda-style attacks to the encouragement of lone wolves,” Lynch said. “The encouragement of people to act on their own.” Read more: San Bernardino Shooting Victim Died While Shielding Survivor A senior Administration official said Sunday that because the San Bernardino shooting was an act of homegrown terrorism, federal investigators likely would not have detected plans set out by the California couple beforehand. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told the New York Times on Sunday that terrorists have “outsourced” attempts to attack the U.S., which calls for a “whole new approach.” Read more: London Stabbing Being Treated as a ‘Terrorist Incident,’ U.K. Police Say As the 2016 race ticks on, Obama was in the position of having to deliver his remarks as Republican presidential candidates upped their hawkish tones on Sunday talk shows and on the campaign trail. Senator Marco Rubio blamed Obama for weakening U.S. intelligence gathering; former Florida Governor Jeb Bush said Obama “hasn’t had a strategy” on destroying ISIS; and businessman Donald Trump didn’t rule out tracking Muslims who may be linked to terrorism. “You have people that have to be tracked. If they’re Muslims, they’re Muslims. But you have people that have to be tracked,” said Trump, who live-tweeted criticisms of the President’s speech. A senior Administration official said Obama’s goal on Sunday was to provide context to the American people, and counter rhetoric that can be seen as divisive, particularly among American Muslims. Obama has repeatedly said that without the help of the Muslim community it will be difficult to reach individuals who are susceptible to radicalization. On Sunday, he called on Muslims across America to reject extremist narratives and provide alternatives to those who could be radicalized.  Contact us at letters@time.com."

http://www.eurweb.com/2015/12/president-obama-address-the-nation-post-san-bernardino-freedom-is-more-powerful-than-fear/,"*(Via Huffington Post) – In a rare Sunday evening Oval Office address, President Barack Obama spoke directly to the American public about Wednesday’s mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, reaffirming his commitment to fighting the so-called Islamic State, or ISIS, though he did not announce any new policies to do so. “I am confident that we will succeed in this mission, because we are on the right side of history,” he said. “Freedom is more powerful than fear.” Obama reiterated that the U.S. would continue its current strategy, consisting of hunting down terrorists, training Iraqi and Syrian forces on the ground, disrupting potential ISIS plots, in cooperation with authorities in Europe and the Middle East, and pursuing a political resolution to the ongoing Syrian civil war. He asked Congress to vote to authorize military force, which it has not done, despite more than a year of U.S. military action against ISIS. He also requested measures such as reforming the visa waiver program and closing a loophole that allows someone on a no-fly list to buy a gun. As he has done many times after mass shootings, Obama also implored Congress to renew consideration of gun control measures in response to Wednesday’s attack, which killed 14 people and wounded 21. It was the deadliest shooting since the elementary school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, the last time Congress attempted to take legislative action on guns. Billed by White House officials as a way to assuage Americans’ fears, the speech — only the third Obama has delivered directly from the Oval Office during his presidency — addressed growing concerns about fighting terrorism and threats from the so-called Islamic State, or ISIS.

http://feeds.inquisitr.com/~r/google/yDYq/~3/OuMoQpgUeDA/,"President Barack Obama said the attack in San Bernardino was part of a ""new phase"" of terrorism that his government intends to address and defeat, but he refused to engage in ""a long and costly war"" to achieve it. As reported by Reuters via Yahoo! News, Obama warned Americans on Sunday of the terrorist threat to the United States, and in the rare primetime address he laid out plans to keep Americans safe and defeat the Islamic State group. ""This was a terrorist act designed to kill innocent people,"" Obama said in a speech to the nation from the Oval Office of the White House. ""The threat from terrorism is real but we will overcome it,"" Obama continued. ""We will destroy ISIL and any other organization that tries to harm us. We've surged intelligence sharing with our European allies. We're working with Turkey to seal off its border with Syria. We cannot turn against each other by letting this fight be defined as a war between America and Islam."" Obama said U.S. forces will continue to pursue and dismantle terrorist plots ""in any country where it is needed."" ""We will continue to provide training and equipment to tens of thousands of Iraqi and Syrian forces fighting ISIL on the ground so that we take away their safe havens,"" Obama said. ""In both countries, we're deploying Special Operations Forces who can accelerate that offensive. We've stepped up this effort since the attacks in Paris, and we'll continue to invest more in approaches that are working on the ground."" Obama also called for greater action in the United States after the attacks in Paris, and said that Congress should act to make sure no one on a no-fly list is able to buy a gun.

http://rssfeeds.cincinnati.com/~/126751031/0/cincinnati-letters~Typical-ivory-tower-approach-to-campus-guns/,"The Nov. 30 guest column by University of Cincinnati history professor John McNay was a typical response by an ivory tower academic (“Guns on campus a dangerous proposal” Nov. 30). He completely misses the point of concealed carry on campus. It’s not to prevent mass shooting, but for an individual to protect oneself. But since he mentions it, here are examples of mass shootings that were prevented by citizens with concealed carry permits: 2012 – Gunman stopped in Free Will Baptist Church in South Carolina. 2014 – Chicago veteran stops man firing at friends. 2015 – Uber driver in Chicago stops man firing into crowd. 2015 – Firefighters prevent shooting at fire station in New Holland, Wisconsin. Otherwise, by the time the police respond, terrible acts have already been committed. The recent Paris attack is an example of what happens when persons must wait for help. They were slaughtered. I bet these survivors wished someone had a firearm to stop the attackers. Concealed-carry citizens are responsible people. They are not fast and loose with their firearms as you imply. As a professor, you must see what little success “weapons-free zone” signs have around schools and public buildings. They are a joke. Criminals and the mentally ill look for these places. Stop deluding yourself and everyone with your feel-good preaching of “guns are bad” philosophy. To quote Robert Heinlein: “An armed society is a polite society.” John Gallagher, Loveland"

http://www.ocregister.com/articles/church-695094-service-hope.html,"Trending:    Celia Martinez, 86, left, and Chris Gobin, 61, both of Colton, pray Saturday at St. Bernardine Church.  Kathy Cisneros, 59, of San Bernardino prays on Saturday for victims of the mass shooting last week.  In the wake of the mass shooting at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino on Wednesday, Inland churchgoers gathered on Sunday to mourn and pray. Pastors and reverends spoke of grief. They spoke of love. They spoke of hope. CHOOSING LOVE, NOT HATE Esther Montoya was at St. Catherine of Siena Catholic Church in Rialto for two services on Sunday. Victim Yvette Velasco of Fontana was a parishioner there. Montoya said the feeling inside was somber because the shooting took place so close to home and friends of Velasco were present, but she also said there was a sense of hope and forgiveness. The two attackers, Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik, were Muslim and have been reported to be supporters of the Islamic State. The pastor told those present that “God gives us the choice to love him or hate him,” and the same can be said for Farook and Malik. “This was not an act of God,” Montoya relayed the pastor as saying. “It was an act of hate.” A MESSAGE OF HOPE At Church of the Woods in Lake Arrowhead, where San Bernardino shooting victim Mike Wetzel was a member, pastor Rod Adkins opened the 11 a.m. service by praying for all of the victims of the shooting. “We need to hear a message of hope,” he said. About a minute into the service, Adkins got choked up. “This event has rocked so many people’s lives,” he said. About 30 minutes into the service, the church showed a video of a previous service with Wetzel, infant daughter in his arms, and four of his other children as they lit candles and told the story of the Advent. On Nov. 29, days before he was killed, Wetzel lit the “candle of hope.” During Sunday’s service, churchgoers lit the “candle of peace” as they spoke of Wetzel. Adkins’ sermon talked about events that changed the world. “We grieve, but we do not grieve without hope. We grieve the loss of Mike,” Adkins said. BEING PRESENT Harry “Hal” Bowman was a member of Our Lady of the Assumption church in Claremont, where a prayer was said during a Sunday Mass for the 14 killed. Deacon Joe Domond asked the crowd to reach out to the families who lost loved ones. “Even those who kill our own loved ones, we are called to love,” he said. The Rev. Charles Ramirez noted that Bowman’s funeral will be held at the church 2 p.m. Friday. He asked church members to remember the families of the shooters, “especially that 6-month-old baby, who now has to live with that stigma.” After the service, Ramirez said he had prayed with Bowman’s mother, who would have to clean out his Upland apartment in the coming days. Bowman’s ex-wife, also of Upland, would be at his funeral with Bowman’s two children, Ramirez said. “I hope we can provide some comfort to her,” he said. “Sometimes you can’t say anything, you just need to be present.” A PRAYER Members of St. Catherine of Alexandria Catholic Church in Riverside said a prayer for their brother, Damian Meins, at a Sunday morning service, said the church’s liturgy coordinator, Marty Swanson. Meins, an employee of the San Bernardino County Division of Environmental Health Services who was among the 14 killed Wednesday, also worked as an extended care coordinator at St. Catherine of Alexandria School. That school, the church and Notre Dame High School, where Meins had attended, are all on the same campus at Arlington and Brockton avenues in Riverside. HEALING AND LOVE The Diocese of San Bernardino sent a recommended set of prayers to its parishes in wake of the incident. The prayers talk of loving all people, regardless of race or religion, and asks parishioners to speak for the common good. “Give us sympathetic hearts to reach out to those around us who are in deep grief – especially the children of our diocese who are suffering from fear, confusion and profound loss,” the prayer reads. The prayer also mentions local authorities, asking Jesus Christ to “grant us the grace to join with our law enforcement and public officials to be sources of change, of healing and of love.” Staff writer Vanessa Franko contributed to this report.

http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2015/dec/07/change-the-conversation-20151207/,"It was just after the Newtown massacre of 20 children--nearly three years and thousands of deadly shootings ago--when a group of Boston doctors wrote a journal article about a different solution to gun violence. Amid the tired political debate about whether we need fewer guns or more guns, they offered this advice: Change the conversation. Start talking about public health. In other words, take the same approach to guns that our society has taken to reduce deaths from cigarettes or motor vehicle crashes. It's hard to ban dangerous things outright or eliminate risks entirely. But you can do your best to mitigate the damage. In the 1960s, thousands of children were poisoned every year by eating baby aspirin. Now those numbers are minuscule, and not because anyone banned aspirin. We required safety caps on bottles of pills. We regulated the number of pills manufacturers could put in a bottle. The analogies to firearm laws are clear. Sometimes, the wrong person will try to get his hands on a gun. But if we required smart locks, triggered by a gun owner's fingerprint, we could keep a child from accidentally firing the gun in the cabinet or a criminal from firing a stolen gun. If we reduced the legal size of a magazine clip, we could limit the number of bullets a would-be mass shooter could fire at once. A lot of small solutions, added together, could save countless lives. Many of the doctors' proposals were so sensible and simple that they should have been political no-brainers. That was three years ago. During which Congress has done precisely nothing. If you're looking for a reason why so many people are cynical about national politics, distrustful of institutions, and drawn to outsiders during presidential races, the lack of national action on gun violence is all you need. Still, David Hemenway, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health and a co-author of that journal article, doesn't feel the same sense of futility. He's playing the long game, remembering the years of resistance to seatbelts and speed limits and other government-imposed risk reductions, the stagnancy that eventually gave way to victories and lives saved. ""Being in public health, it's hard not to be an optimist,"" he said. In Hemenway's glass-half-full view, a lot has changed in the past few years. We're talking about gun violence more than ever. Shootings that once were sad local stories are national news. Democratic presidential candidates, who shied away from the issue for decades, are touting it on the stump. There's more political organization around gun regulation, more pro-regulation money in the system, from the likes of former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg. There's more talk about the ""public health approach"" to solving problems. This seems a prime moment, when things are bubbling up: People are willing to listen and there's a political will to act. The stopper in the bottle is Congress. The hope is that a few politicians will be able to change the paradigm. As Hemenway points out, Australia passed its sweeping, effective gun laws in the 1990s because of bipartisan action. After one terrible mass shooting, the country's newly elected conservative prime minister stepped up and led the way. We need the same thing here: a few brave Republicans who will take the side of the majority of gun owners and U.S. citizens, instead of a vocal minority. A presidential candidate or two who will give them cover, by talking about practical solutions instead of the standard political rhetoric. Reducing gun violence doesn't have to be divisive. It just has to be smart. How about it, Congress? You're up. Again. Take the same approach to guns that our society has taken to reduce deaths from cigarettes or motor vehicle crashes. It's hard to ban dangerous things outright or eliminate risks entirely. But you can do your best to mitigate the damage. ------------v------------ Joanna Weiss is a columnist for the Boston Globe.

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/126865263/0/news-opinion~The-weapon-that-binds-Sandy-Hook-and-San-Bernardino-Sandy-Hook-families/,"Coverage of Wednesday's mass shooting that claimed at least 14 lives and left 21 wounded in San Bernardino, Calif., has made repeated references to the murders in Newtown, Conn., that robbed us of our children, daughter and sister nearly three years ago. Comparisons to past massacres are now automatic when news breaks of the latest mass shooting: How many more dead? How many weeks or months has it been since a shooting with a higher body count? These parallels do little more than underscore the harrowing monotony of American gun violence. We should be talking about San Bernardino and the 26 killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in the same breath, but for a different reason. One of the assailants in San Bernardino used a DPMS AR-15 semiautomatic rifle; in Sandy Hook, the shooter was armed with a Bushmaster AR-15. The DPMS and Bushmaster brands are owned by the same company, a firearms conglomerate known as Remington Outdoor, formerly the Freedom Group. In its most recent annual report, Remington boasts that it is one of the largest suppliers of these guns, which it calls modern sporting rifles, to civilians — and that the company owes its leading market share position to the Bushmaster and DPMS brands. USA TODAY Olivia Nalos Opre: Why we hunt, even lions The fact that mass shooters are attracted to Remington's product line is hardly surprising. The AR-15 was designed as a combat weapon for the U.S. military, establishing its bona fides in the trenches of Vietnam. With semiautomatic fire and a detachable magazine, the AR-15 can unleash a torrent of bullets in a matter of seconds. For individuals bent on inflicting maximum civilian carnage, the AR-15 is the unparalleled choice. (And it is often a choice: The San Bernardino assailants were in possession of handguns but gunned down their victims with AR-15s, including the DPMS model and another made by Smith & Wesson. In Sandy Hook, the shooter selected the Bushmaster AR-15 from an extensive arsenal in his home.) What should surprise — and horrify — us is that Remington actively promotes the AR-15's capacity to inflict mass causalities. Remington markets its AR-15s with images of soldiers and SWAT teams; it dubs various models the ""patrolman"" and the ""adaptive combat rifle""; and it actively encourages the notion that the AR-15 bestows power and glory upon those who wield it. USA TODAY Olivia Nalos Opre: Why we hunt, even lions Remington's advertising copy for its assault rifles has included the following: ""The uncompromising choice when you demand a rifle as mission-adaptable as you are."" ""Forces of opposition bow down — you are single-handedly outnumbered."" DPMS boasts that its GII AP4 model is ""built on award-winning badassness."" In an era when mass shooters are often equipped with fatigues, vests or other combat gear, this type of marketing is not only unethical, it also is reckless. What does Remington have to say? In response to the tragedy in Sandy Hook, the company's then-CEO George Kollitides said: ""It's very easy to blame an inanimate object. Any kind of instrument in the wrong hands can be put to evil use."" This familiar refrain rings hollow because it fails to acknowledge that our country continues to prove itself incapable of keeping deadly weapons out of the wrong hands. Perhaps more to the point, it ignores the fact that extolling a weapon's destructive potential might actually attract the wrong hands. David and Francine Wheeler, parents of Benjamin Wheeler, 6.

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/126981343/0/phoenix/opinions~Reasons-to-celebrate-San-Bernardino/,"As Americans consider how they will respond to the terrorist attack on San Bernardino last week, its worth noting how successful we’ve been at thwarting global terror over the near decade-and-a-half since al-Qaida brought jihadism to our shores. The attack on San Bernardino is the most deadly terror strike on American soil since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. And as incongruous as it seems, that is something to celebrate. In terms of scale the two events are not even comparable. Sept. 11 killed nearly 3,000 Americans, brought down two towering symbols of American financial might and penetrated the hardened shell of the Pentagon, the nucleus of the largest fighting force in the world. Those same attacks destroyed four airliners and all of their crew and passengers, shut down the national air transportation system and drained billions from the American economy. Furthermore, they filled Americans with a deepening dread that their world had forever changed. AZCENTRAL Expert: Mental health of man accused in PV murders diminishing San Bernardino, despite its human agony, is a pinprick by comparison. And that is important to remember as we think about how we adapt to the ever morphing enemy we face in Islamic extremism. Since 2001, only 45 people have lost their lives to jihadist terrorism on American soil, the New York Times reports. Compare that to the 200,000 Americans who have lost their lives to conventional murder in the same period and you begin to see the problem in context. And it’s not as if the jihadists didn’t want to strike us. Think of all the ways the United States has antagonized the fevered minds of Islamic extremists worldwide since Sept. 11. We’ve launched two wars: One in Afghanistan that drove the extremist Taliban leadership from their own country, and one in Iraq. We planted our Armed Forces in the heart of the Middle East, striking fear in Iran, the world’s largest sponsor of global terror. USA TODAY ISIL radio: Two 'supporters' carried out San Bernardino massacre We’ve used drones to deliver vengeance to hundreds of the top leaders of the global jihad and we’ve helped the Kurds and other moderate Muslims take back territory from ISIS. We have given extremists the world over endless excuses to strike our homeland, and they have only managed to kill 45 on our soil in 14 years. That’s not an excuse to let down our guard. We cannot. We are at war with an ideology whose ambitions begin with regional conquests – the Middle East and North Africa – and probably end with world domination. Its adherents are nihilists who would use any means to slaughter unbelievers and less fervent Muslims. Fortunately, their ambition is their greatest weakness and our modernity is their greatest foe. We live in an advanced world that has grown more enlightened about the fruits of free societies and free markets. It is a world more interconnected and informed thanks to international travel, news, television and especially the Internet. Muslims across the globe want to enjoy those modern staples. They don’t want to live yoked by dictators and thugs. AZCENTRAL Expert: Mental health of man accused in PV murders diminishing Muslims who apprehend that there are better ways to live will be our friends in this mult-generational struggle. On Sunday night, President Obama urged Americans not to give into their fears. The president understands that we are not about to go to war with the Muslim world. We are not, because we are not damned fools. We are not going to fight 1.6 billion Muslims, the larger portion of whom are eager to see extremists defeated. We will win this war, and we will win by allying with others who are closest to the threat that ISIS and al-Qaida pose. In a battle with asymmetric foes who melt into the civilian population and wait to kill, mainstreams Muslims are the asymmetric counter-measure. They are our eyes and ears who will help us find and root out the terrorists. To allow our fears to close ourselves off from the Muslim world is to surrender one of the great advantages we have in this war."
http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/126986619/0/phoenix/opinions~AZ-Talk-Can-America-stop-gun-violence/,"TODAY’S QUESTION: Can America ever put an end to its constant eruptions of gun violence? Yes. But ridding the country of guns to stop gun violence is almost as silly as ridding it of men to stop rape. Our culture is increasingly one of extreme selfishness, in which life is being degraded. Many minds are twisted by pandemic use of pornography and drugs. We need to promote a culture of respect and love of all humankind. We also must maintain our right to protect ourselves with our own guns. Robin Finlinson Stay-at-home mom, writer Chandler USA TODAY NCAA president 'very pleased' with revisions to Indiana religious freedom law No. In January 2011, when nothing was done after the Gabby Gifford’s shooting except to loosen gun laws further, I told my husband, “It will take a mass shooting of a bunch of little children to get lawmakers to do anything.” Then came Sandy Hook in December 2012, and to my shock and disbelief, nothing was done after the NRA went into full offensive. We demand action and justice only if a mass shooting is by an Islamic terrorist. Otherwise, we just “pray for the victims” and wait for the next shooting to happen. This is insanity. Suzanne Tveit Retired business consultant Phoenix USA TODAY NCAA president 'very pleased' with revisions to Indiana religious freedom law Absolutely. When our society values and respects life again, we will end the eruptions of violence. Not just cradle-to-grave life but life amongst each other. I see parents with faces in their phones while their kids stare at their devices. How can one “love thy neighbor” when one doesn’t know them? How can one respect others when we lack self-respect? Pride in our country does not exist like it once did. Service to our country, our community, our family, is now service for myself. Moses Sanchez Educator, South Mountain Community College Phoenix USA TODAY Obama mourns passing of Saudi king No. We’ve opened Pandora’s Box and nothing will change. Except become worse. When the most modest gun reform is hysterically labeled “They’re taking our guns!,” reform has no chance. Even something as logical as preventing people on the terrorist-watch list from legally purchasing guns. A bill for which is currently bottled up by Republicans in the House, no doubt terrified not by terrorists but by the NRA’s clout. The best we can do is improve our mental-health programs and apply “If you see something, say something.” Mike McClellan Retired English teacher Gilbert"

Acting only days after two Muslim terrorists killed 14 people and wounded 21 others in San Bernardino, Calif., the high court declined to reconsider two lower courts' rulings that the ban was constitutional. The action, hailed by gun control advocates, signaled that the majority of justices agree with the lower courts, or at least feel it's a matter to be left up to state and local governments.

Farook advised his son to be patient, telling him change in the Middle East would come with time. “I kept telling him always: stay calm, be patient, in two years Israel will no longer exist,” he said, as quoted by USA Today. “Geopolitics is changing: Russia, China, America too, nobody wants the Jews there.” The father also told the Italian paper an argument about religion between his “mama’s boy” son and wife once escalated to the point of Rizwan declaring their marriage had to end. “Once we had a dispute about the historical figure of Jesus, my son yelled that I was an unbeliever and decided that marriage with my wife had to end,” Farook said, as quoted by USA Today.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/NfwNFxSPL6k/,"MULTAN, Pakistan (AP) — The woman who carried out last week’s mass shooting in California with her husband had attended an Islamic religious school or madrassa while she was living in Pakistan, intelligence officials and the school said Monday. Few details have emerged about Tashfeen Malik’s life in Pakistan, where she lived from 2007 to 2014 before she left for the United States on a fiancee visa. Malik studied pharmacy at the Bahauddin Zakariya University in the central city of Multan where she got a degree in 2013. While in Multan, she also attended a religious school, which Pakistani intelligence officials on Monday identified it as the Al-Huda International Seminary. The school is a women-only madrassa with a chain across Pakistan and branches in the U.S. and Canada, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. Al-Huda’s founder, Farhat Hashmi, who now lives in Canada, has been criticized for promoting a conservative strain of Islam, though the school has no known links to extremists. In Pakistan, it is mostly popular among upper middle class and urban Pakistani women interested in Islamic studies. Malik spent more than a year at Al-Huda, taking classes six days a week, the school’s spokeswoman Farrukh Chaudhry told The Associated Press. She enrolled in a two-year course to learn the Muslim holy book, Quran, its translation and interpretation but did not finish the course, Chaudhry added. Malik was a student there from April 17, 2013 until May 3, 2014, when she handed in her last paper in the first-year curriculum, the spokeswoman said. “According to our records, this girl didn’t complete the course,” Chaudhry said, speaking over the phone from the southern port city of Karachi where she is based. “She told us that she was going to get married in two months, and after that she will leave for America.” Malik promised to complete her studies by mail correspondence but that never happened, Chaudhry said. “I have talked to her teachers, her classmates and everybody says she was a hardworking, friendly, helpful and obedient student,” Chaudhry said, adding that according to what the staff and students told the spokeswoman, “no one ever noticed any signs of radicalization in her.” One of the teachers at the seminary, Aalia Qamar, said Malik attended classes regularly, and introduced three or four of her friends to the school. She asked many questions in class about religion and at times debated religious matters with teachers and classmates. On Monday, Pakistani police barred local and international media from entering the pharmacy department where Malik studied. Police inspector Muhammad Ali said the reporters did not have valid documents to work in the city. The university administration deployed extra private security guards outside the facility and after an argument with some reporters, university security officials called in the police. The police escorted the two journalists out of the campus. Malik and her American-born husband Syed Farook were killed in a shootout with police, hours after they opened fire with assault rifles on a gathering of Farook’s colleagues last Wednesday in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people. The FBI said Friday that it is investigating the shooting as an act of terrorism. If the massacre was inspired by Islamic extremism, it would be the deadliest such attack on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2001. Israel / Middle EastNational Security .

http://www.tampabay.com/news/courts/civil/supreme-court-will-not-hear-challenge-to-assault-weapons-ban/2256804,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear a Second Amendment challenge to an Illinois ordinance that banned semi-automatic assault weapons and large-capacity magazines. As is their custom, the justices gave no reason for turning down the appeal in the case, Friedman vs. City of Highland Park, No. 15-133. Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia dissented, saying that lower courts have been ignoring Supreme Court precedents on Second Amendment rights. The ordinance, enacted in 2013, banned some weapons by name, including AR-15s and AK-47s. More generally, it prohibited possession of what it called assault weapons, defining them as semi-automatic guns that can accept large-capacity magazines and have features like a grip for the nontrigger hand. Large-capacity magazines, the ordinance said, are those that can accept more than 10 rounds. In 2008, in District of Columbia vs. Heller, the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that banned keeping handguns at home for self-defense, finding for the first time that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to bear arms. In 2010, the court extended the principle to state and local governments. Since then, the court has turned away appeals in any number of Second Amendment challenges to gun control laws. The ordinance, from Highland Park, Ill., in the Chicago suburbs, was challenged by the Illinois State Rifle Association and Dr. Arie S. Friedman, who at his home had kept guns and magazines for self-defense that were banned by the ordinance. The term ""assault weapons,"" they told the justices, ""is an imaginary and pejorative category."" The Illinois rifle group and Friedman urged the Supreme Court to address what they called ""the lower courts' massive resistance to Heller and their refusal to treat Second Amendment rights as deserving respect equal to other constitutional rights."" A supporting brief filed by 24 states said the ordinance ""bans many commonly used firearms and the standard capacity magazines for many popular firearms."" In April, a divided three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, upheld the Highland Park ordinance. ""A ban on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines might not prevent shootings in Highland Park (where they are already rare), but it may reduce the carnage if a mass shooting occurs,"" Judge Frank H. Easterbrook wrote for the majority. In any event, he added, ""if a ban on semi-automatic guns and large-capacity magazines reduces the perceived risk from a mass shooting, and makes the public feel safer as a result, that's a substantial benefit."" Judge Daniel A. Manion dissented. ""By prohibiting a class of weapons commonly used throughout the country,"" he wrote, ""Highland Park's ordinance infringes upon the rights of its citizens to keep weapons in their homes for the purpose of defending themselves, their families and their property."""
http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/scotus-highland-park-assault-weapons-ban,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Acting in the aftermath of the San Bernardino mass shooting, the Supreme Court on Monday rejected an appeal from gun owners who challenged a Chicago suburb’s ban on assault weapons. Two conservative justices said they would have heard the case and struck down the ban. The court, though, left in place a lower court ruling that found that local governments have leeway in deciding how to regulate firearms. The federal appeals court in Chicago upheld the city of Highland Park’s 2013 gun law that bans semi-automatic weapons and large-capacity magazines. In October, the federal appeals court in New York largely upheld similar laws in Connecticut and New York, among a handful of states that ban semi-automatic weapons. The Supreme Court has repeatedly turned away challenges to gun restrictions since two landmark decisions that spelled out the right to a handgun to defend one’s own home. Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Antonin Scalia, said the Chicago appeals court ruling “flouts two of our Second Amendment precedents.” Without mentioning any mass shootings in California and elsewhere that involved semi-automatic guns, Thomas said the weapons ban “is highly suspect because it broadly prohibits common semi-automatic firearms used for lawful purposes” by roughly five million Americans. “The overwhelming majority of citizens who own and use such rifles do so for lawful purposes, including self-defense and target shooting,” Thomas wrote. The case had been under consideration at the high court for two months, but the delay in dealing with it now appears mainly due to waiting for Thomas to finish his opinion. The appeal filed by Dr. Arie Friedman and the Illinois State Rifle Association argues that Highland Park has violated their constitutional rights by banning some of the most popular semi-automatic guns in the United States, as well as ammunition magazines of more than 10 rounds. Even though lower courts have mainly upheld gun restrictions, the Highland Park case arises out of a decision by the federal appeals court in Chicago that struck down the only statewide ban on carrying concealed weapons, in Illinois. In 2013, when state lawmakers reacted to the court ruling by making it legal to carry a gun, they gave cities around the state 10 days to come up with local restrictions on assault weapons, or forfeit their right to do so. Highland Park was one of fewer than 20 municipalities, all in the Chicago area, to enact regulations or bans, according to the rifle association. The city’s assault weapons ban was upheld by the appeals court in a 2-1 decision. Judge Frank Easterbrook wrote for the court that there is a “substantial benefit” to the Highland Park ordinance if it makes the public feel less at risk from a mass shooting. Variations of the Bushmaster AR-15, one of the guns specifically banned by Highland Park, were used in the Newtown, Connecticut school massacre and the theater shootings in Aurora, Colorado. The gun control laws that the appeals court in New York upheld in October were passed after the 2012 massacre in Newtown. Seven states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws banning assault weapons. The others are California, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts and New Jersey, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. In addition, Minnesota and Virginia regulate assault weapons, the center said. The case is Friedman v. Highland, 15-133. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

http://feeds.inquisitr.com/~r/google/yDYq/~3/xUdjxktElgU/,"Ex-Congressman Joe Walsh is apparently no fan of U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch and probably won't be sending her a Christmas card this year, which he made clear in a anti-Islam video rant embedded below that is going viral. The former lawmaker (not the Eagles guitarist) took to Facebook to strongly denounce Lynch's comments made on the day after the San Bernardino mass shooting carried out by Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, that left 14 people dead and many more injured. According to multiple media accounts, Malik pledged allegiance to ISIS on her Facebook page shortly before the attack. ""Farook and his wife later died in a fierce gun battle with authorities several hours after their commando-style assault on the gathering of Farook's colleagues from San Bernardino County's health department,"" the Daily Mail explained. In a speech to the nation last night, President Obama said, among other things, that he has ordered a governmental review of ""the visa waiver program under which the female terrorist in San Bernardino originally came to this country."" He also underscored that ""just as it is the responsibility of Muslims around the world to root out misguided ideas that lead to radicalization, it is the responsibility of all Americans, of every faith, to reject discrimination."" In remarks made before a Muslim advocacy group that prompted the Walsh rant, Lynch vowed to prosecute anyone for anti-Muslim rhetoric, which she described as her ""greatest fear,"" and also advised parents to contact the Justice Department about instances of bullying of Muslim children. Parenthetically, it's unclear as to whether Lynch ever expressed similar concerns about potential discrimination against Christians or Jews. [Update: Lynch this morning recalibrated her earlier remarks by acknowledging that ""Of course, we prosecute deeds and not words.""] Separately, Lynch -- who replaced Eric Holder in April as the top Department of Justice official in Washington and previously was the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York -- deemed the San Bernardino shooting ""a wonderful opportunity and a wonderful moment to really make significant change,"" which presumably could be Washington code for more gun control via executive order or administrative rulemaking.   Former Rep. Walsh posted the video commentary on his Facebook page, which has been viewed more than 700,000 times (with another 40,000 views on YouTube) in response to Loretta Lynch, in which he claimed that Islam is evil and dared Lynch to prosecute him for the backlash he claims he intends to encourage.

The supreme court has repeatedly turned away challenges to gun restrictions since two landmark decisions that spelled out the right to a handgun to defend one’s own home. Two conservative justices said they would have heard the case and struck down the ban. Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by justice Antonin Scalia, said the Chicago appeals court ruling “flouts two of our second amendment precedents”. Without mentioning any mass shootings in California and elsewhere that involved semi-automatic guns, Thomas said the weapons ban “is highly suspect because it broadly prohibits common semi-automatic firearms used for lawful purposes” by roughly 5 million Americans, “including self-defense and target shooting”. The case had been under consideration at the high court for two months, but the delay in dealing with it now appears mainly due to waiting for Thomas to finish his opinion. The appeal filed by Dr Arie Friedman and the Illinois State Rifle Association argued that Highland Park had violated their constitutional rights by banning some of the most popular semi-automatic guns in the US, as well as ammunition magazines of more than 10 rounds. Even though lower courts have mainly upheld gun restrictions, the Highland Park case arose out of a decision by the federal appeals court in Chicago that struck down the only statewide ban on carrying concealed weapons, in Illinois. In 2013, when state lawmakers reacted to the court ruling by making it legal to carry a gun, they gave cities around the state 10 days to come up with local restrictions on assault weapons, or forfeit their right to do so. Highland Park was one of fewer than 20 municipalities, all in the Chicago area, to enact regulations or bans, according to the rifle association."

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/127008271/0/phoenix/nation~Grieving-San-Bernardino-Co-staffers-back-at-work/,"Emotional San Bernardino County employees began ramping up normal functions amid tight security Monday, five days after 14 people were killed in a shooting rampage at a county employee holiday event. Meanwhile, federal authorities are trying to determine when and how the shooters — Syed Rizwan Farook, a county restaurant inspector, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik — obtained the rifles used in the attack. ""Our hearts are heavy, but we must move forward,"" County Board Chairman James Ramos said. David Bowdich, FBI assistant director in charge of the investigation, said at a news conference Monday in San Bernardino that authorities believe both shooters were ""radicalized"" but that so far there is no evidence that the killers were part of an international plot. Bowdich said there was evidence that Farook and Malik had practiced shooting at local ranges in recent days, including just before the attack at the Inland Regional Center. Bowdich called the investigation ""massive,"" saying more than 400 interviews had been conducted and more than 300 pieces of evidence amassed. USA TODAY Aunt: San Bernardino suspect 'became more devout' USA TODAY Obama mourns passing of Saudi king ""We believe that both were radicalized and had been for some time,"" Bowdich said of the couple. He said it was not clear if one or the other had led the attack. Authorities are taking a closer look at the source of the assault-style rifles: a Riverside, Calif., man and former Farook neighbor, according to a federal law enforcement official who is not authorized to comment publicly. The (Palm Springs, Calif.) Desert Sun reported Monday that Farook and Malik were armed with guns obtained between 2007 and 2012, and that investigators are still trying to determine when and how the pair acquired two rifles from former neighbor Enrique Marquez. Twelve of those killed in Wednesday's attack were county employees, and only essential employees have worked since. Ramos said security will be stepped up at many county buildings, including the addition of armed guards at some locations. The sheriff's department also was increasing surveillance, he said. Increasing security is a major task for a county with more than 20,000 employees and a population of more than 2 million people spread over 20,000 square miles. ""We are hearing from employees about what would make them feel safe in their (work) environment,"" Ramos said. ""This has hit us all hard."" The shooting took place in a conference room where about 80 county environmental health employees were gathered for a training session and holiday celebration. Farook briefly attended the event, but left and then returned minutes later with his wife. The couple, armed with semiautomatic rifles and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, opened fire on the crowd, then fled. In addition to the fatalities, 21 people were wounded. A short time later both Farook and Malik were killed in a shootout with police. Authorities are investigating the case as a terrorist attack. Environmental health workers won't return to work until Dec. 14. Authorities said grief counselors were available for all county workers. Trudy Raymundo, head of the county health department, said her department appreciated the outpouring of support from across that nation and around the world. The Arrowhead United Way in San Bernardino has helped establish a relief fund for the victims. Raymundo said she has visited the wounded at various area hospitals. ""We mourn the loss of our fallen friends and pray for those injured to recover,"" she said. ""Some of us witnessed horrific scenes unfold in front of our eyes. This has shaken all of us. Yet, we are grateful for the many lives that were spared."" Investigators have found Malik posted a message of support for Islamic State just prior to the attacks. The Facebook post, authorities have said, was made in another name. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch cautioned Monday that authorities were not yet ready to ascribe the attack as specifically inspired by the Islamic State. “We’re not prepared to limit the ideology to what inspired these individuals,’’ Lynch said at a Justice Department briefing. Both Lynch and FBI Director James Comey have said there is no evidence yet to indicate that the assault was directed by a terror group or that the two shooters were part of a larger network of operatives. Although authorities have been examining whether Malik may have engineered the radicalization of her husband, the federal law enforcement official said Monday that investigators also are pursuing a parallel track: that their mutual interest in radical ideology brought them together. The official said authorities believe that the pair had harbored radical leanings for an extended period, perhaps indicating that they brought those beliefs to the relationship and built on that foundation after the marriage. Speaking on Monday at the All Dulles Area Muslim Society in Sterling, Va., Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson urged Muslims nationwide to help stop the expansion of radical Islamic terrorism. ""Terrorist organizations overseas have targeted your communities,"" he said. ""They seek to pull your youth into the pit of violent extremism. Help us to help you stop this."" He urged the group to ""say something to law enforcement, or to one of your community or religious leaders"" if they see community members turning toward violence. ""When people self-radicalize, someone close to them is almost always in a position to see the signs,"" he said. ""Help us to help you amplify your message about the true meaning of Islam, as a religion of peace."" Johnson urged Muslims not to become ""bitter"" about the USA, which has historically heaped ""prejudice, scorn and suspicion"" upon outsiders in times of conflict. He invoked the Cold War-era congressional hearings on Communism and noted that his own grandfather was called to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee that he was not a member of the Communist Party. In responding to terrorist threats, Johnson said, ""we must not vilify American Muslims. We must not throw a net of suspicion over American Muslims and an entire religion. We must not force American Muslims to run and hide, and retreat to the shadows. This would be counter to our homeland security efforts, and it is un-American."" On Monday evening, hundreds of county employees gathered for a candlelight prayer vigil the San Bernardino courthouse, not far from the health department where most of the victims worked. An upbeat gospel choir led the vigil, desperate to give the city something to smile about, and many mourners swayed with their rhythm, a candle in one hand and a camera phone in the other. In the middle of that crowd stood Shenaz Makati, 28, a petite Muslim woman who works at the library. Flickering candlelight revealed glistening tears in her eyes. “It’s overwhelming,” Makati said. “I’m grieving just like everybody else.” After the vigil, Makati said she was — once again — struggling to understand how someone had hijacked her religion, twisting it into a weapon of meaningless violence. And now, as county employees returned to work, Makati was unsure if the community would welcome her back. She was frightened that strangers would see her as an enemy. She worried that some friends might too. If only they knew, she said. “When people like this do stuff in the name of my religion, it’s too much, and it’s not fair,” Makati said. “How do they even get an idea to twist our beliefs so much to use it to kill people? … That is not what I believe. This is not what I pray about five times a day. My faith teaches me to be a stronger American.” “There is a lesson in our religion that says you are supposed to care about your neighbors — 40 neighbors in front, 40 neighbors behind, 40 neighbors to the right and 40 neighbors to the left. If anybody even knew just that little bit of our religion, they would know (these attacks are) completely absurd.” Contributing: Kevin Johnson and Greg Toppo, USA TODAY, and  Brett Kelman, The (Palm Springs, Calif.)

By BRIANNA EHLEY 12/07/2015 10:00 AM EST Presented by With help from Rachana Pradhan and Joanne Kenen WHAT’S NEXT IN THE GOP’S WAR AGAINST OBAMACARE? — Not a whole lot. At least for a while. Congressional Republicans are preparing to send their first major Obamacare repeal bill to President Obama’s desk for a certain veto. For now, most seem to agree that there’s really not much more they can do while Obama is still in the White House. ""We will have done everything we have promised to do and everything we can do,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said as the Senate voted on repeal last week. “We're really just teeing it up for the next president and the next administration."" Of course, Republicans are still weighing potential changes to the law — but only if they have bipartisan support. That means the Cadillac tax may still be in play, after the 90-10 vote to repeal it on a reconciliation amendment.,But the path forward on that isn't clear and in terms of the larger health law, it seems as though the Republican plan is to keep blasting Obamacare until someone new moves into the White House. Pro’s Jen Haberkorn has the story:
http://politico.pro/1TqnlVo DENIED: SCOTUS REJECTS DALEIDEN’S REQUEST — Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy rejected a request from David Daleiden, the young activist behind the undercover Planned Parenthood videos, to block a lower court order to turn over the names of people who supported his work. Lawyers for Daleiden asked Kennedy on Friday to block the order from a district judge in California who had ordered the videomake to say who he had shared confidential information that he obtained during National Abortion Federation conferences. MICHIGAN WAIVER PUTS CMS IN TOUGH SPOT — The federal waiver Michigan needs to extend its Medicaid expansion has put CMS in a bind — either approve controversial conditions or let the program end next spring. Pro’s Rachana Pradhan writes, “The 2013 Michigan law expanding Medicaid included a provision requiring CMS to approve a waiver with drastically conservative changes by the end of this year. The waiver would require Medicaid enrollees earning above the poverty line to make a choice after four years of Medicaid coverage: Either enroll in a private subsidized plan on HealthCare.gov, or stay in Medicaid and pay up to 7 percent of household income toward health care costs — notably higher than the 5 percent ceiling CMS has held other states to.” If the waiver isn't approved, Medicaid expansion coverage is scheduled to end in April.

Instead, the final deal will require countries to establish a protection period of up to eight years.” Merck spokeswoman Clare Gillespie said in a statement: “We are disappointed that the TPP, which, by failing to secure 12 years of data protection for biologic medicines, will compromise the next wave of innovation and disrupt the development of new, critically-needed medicines.” AN OBAMACARE LOVE STORY! — Hawaii exchange official Eric Alborg sent around an “Aloha” email Friday as he wrapped up his job at the closing Hawaii Health Connector.

Multiple attackers opened fire on a banquet at a social services center for the disabled in San Bernardino on Dec. 2, 2015, killing multiple people and sending police on a manhunt for suspects. (San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department via AP) A decision by the U.S. Supreme Court not to hear a challenge to a ban on assault-style weapons leaves intact New Jersey's statewide assault weapons ban, experts said Monday. The court's decision, coming on the heels of the mass shooting in San Bernadino, Calif. in which assault-style weapons were used, means New Jersey's law remains firmly in place, said Prof. Bernard Bell, who teaches constitutional law Rutgers University School of Law. However, the nation's highest court has not decided whether a municipality can ban certain types of weapons, he said. Until then, New Jersey residents should be ""reasonably certain"" the state ban is constitutional, Bell said. ""The Supreme Court's decision to not hear the Highland Park case sends a strong signal that laws prohibiting military-style assault weapons, such as New Jersey's assault weapon ban, do not violate the Second Amendment,"" added Mike McLively of the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which supports assault weapons bans. He said the Law Center has tracked more than 1,000 cases since the Supreme Court decided that citizens had a right to bear arms, ""and more than 93 percent of Second Amendment claims have been rejected by the lower courts, demonstrating that sensible gun regulation is completely compatible with the Second Amendment."" A spokesman for the National Rifle Association said it's not surprising that the court did not hear the case, since the vast majority of cases brought before it are not heard. ""It's important to remember the Supreme Court has regularly maintained that a denial is not an affirmation of a lower court's ruling,"" added the spokesman, Lars Dalseide. He agreed that New Jersey's law won't change because of the decision. New Jersey has had a ban on so-called assault weapons since 1990. It prohibits individuals from owning more than 50 specific types of guns or copies of them. It also prohibits guns with fixed magazine capacities of more than 15 rounds, as well as guns that can be converted into assault firearms. The law being challenged was enacted by Highland Park, a suburb of Chicago, in 2013. Like New Jersey's law, the Highland Park ordinance also tightly restricted the sale of high-capacity magazines to feed bullets into the gun. A Highland Park resident, Arie Friedman, and the Illinois State Rifle Associaiton, appealed the ordinance, but lost in district court and in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, court records show. MORE: In N.H., Christie pivots away from gun laws he once backed The Supreme Court did not state its reason for not hearing the appeal. Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas dissented in the decision not to hear the case. The subject of restricting the availability of assault-style weapons came up in President Obama's Oval Office speech Sunday evening. ""We also need to make it harder for people to buy powerful assault weapons like the ones that were used in San Bernardino,"" he said. The two shooters there were armed with pistols and .223-caliber rifles that were purchased legally but altered in ways that made them illegal under California law, according to The Wall Street Journal. New Jersey State Police and the Attorney General's office declined to comment about the Supreme Court's decision. Gov. Chris Christie has supported some laws banning assault weapons but recently has changed his position as a candidate for president. ""We need an attorney general who's going to understand that we don't need to pass new laws,"" Christie said in July. ""We have plenty of laws on the books to stop this."" Two years earlier, Christie proposed banning .50 caliber assault-style weapons but later vetoed the bill. Six other states have some form of an assault-style weapons ban: Maryland, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts and New York. In October, the federal appeals court in New York largely upheld bans in Connecticut and New York, among a handful of states that ban semi-automatic weapons.

Cosmopolitan reports that a sister of one of those victims is an apparent target of so-called ""truthers"" who believe the entire incident was a hoax perpetrated by the government. It's been nearly three years since Adam Lanza fatally shot 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Since the horrifying shooting, a number of conspiracy theories have surfaced, but the ""truthers"" are ones who believe the government hoaxed the incident -- much like the Boston Marathon bombing. So why are so-called ""truthers"" attacking family members of the victims?   @xmaseveevil1 @truthaboutsandy @worldnetdaily Let's take a look at just some of the #Sandyhook-Satanists: #2a #hoax pic.twitter.com/2sOP4Yvqv4 — LAKSHMI SINGH (@LAKSHMlSlNGH) December 1, 2015  @xmaseveevil1 @truthaboutsandy @worldnetdaily Let's take a look at just some of the #Sandyhook-Satanists: #2a #hoax pic.twitter.com/2sOP4Yvqv4 — LAKSHMI SINGH (@LAKSHMlSlNGH) December 1, 2015  Raw Story reports that the threats online were so bad that a woman and her husband were too afraid to go home on Saturday. The victims were loved ones of Victoria Leigh Soto, a teacher who died while protecting children from Adam Lanza's rampage. She has been remembered as a hero from the day Lanza walked through the doors of Sandy Hook Elementary to murder more than two dozen innocent people. Now her sister and her husband are having to relive the horror of what happened in the form of threats made by delusional people who believe the whole disaster never actually happened. https://www.facebook.com/VictoriaLeighSoto26/posts/1111380675562497 One message received by Brent Parisi (the husband of Soto's sister) blatantly intended to put fear into the family's hearts.   The message left Soto's sister and her husband afraid to return home on Saturday, where they feared they would be put in harm's way. Their fears also come close to the three-year anniversary of the shooting that took the lives of numerous innocent people, including their loved one. This also isn't the first time they've been targeted personally by Sandy Hook conspiracy theorists. In November, a Brooklyn man was arrested after he harassed the sister of Vicki Soto. The New York Daily News reports that 32-year-old Matthew Mills was charged with breach of peace after he entered a benefit marathon for the slain teacher in order to confront her sister and her family with his conspiracy ideas.

http://www.ibtimes.com/can-radical-islam-be-prevented-san-bernardino-shooting-puts-spotlight-countering-2214639,"Now that the FBI has deemed last week’s mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, an act of terrorism, new questions are arising about how perpetrators Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, may have been radicalized, and whether anything could have prevented it. Those questions are at the heart of government-led programs called Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) in the United States, which aim to prevent individuals from being swayed by extremist ideologies. Such efforts have gained traction in recent years, but Muslim community leaders often don’t agree on how to implement them, or even if they should be implemented at all. “Domestic CVE efforts are in the nascent stages,” said Seamus Hughes, deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University’s Center for Cyber and Homeland Security. “The administration has not put serious resources behind this effort, and the community partners are all doing it on a shoestring budget.” While many European countries have long had CVE efforts in place, the U.S. government only officially launched a CVE strategy in 2011, and that strategy went through a rocky implementation process due to lack of resources and focus. It gained greater attention earlier this year when the Obama administration held a high-profile  “White House Summit on Countering Violent Extremism” that brought together local, federal and international leaders to discuss steps communities can take to counter radicalization. The government worked with three cities -- Boston, Los Angeles and Minneapolis -- to create pilot programs that foster partnerships between local governments, law enforcement, local Muslim communities and more. 'Surveillance States' But some Muslim communities and civil rights organizations argue that such efforts led by the government are not effective at reducing violence -- and often infringe on the rights of Muslim-Americans by essentially creating “surveillance states” within Muslim communities. Critics were most vocal after a House bill introduced by U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, proposed the creation of a CVE office within the Department of Homeland Security. Some 42 civil rights organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law, signed an open letter in July decrying the bill as a threat to “freedom of speech, association and religion” if passed. Rabiah Ahmed, a spokeswoman for the Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC), one of the signatories of the letter, said that government-led CVE programs are simply not effective. “When it comes to intervention and prevention, CVE needs to be community-led. When a person crosses the point of no return, that’s when law enforcement agencies need to take over,” Ahmed said. MPAC has created its own CVE module that Muslim communities can implement called “Safe Spaces.” “It’s a toolkit that provides a model for mosques and communities to implement when tackling violent extremism, based on prevention and intervention,” said Ahmed, adding that several mosques around the country, including her own in northern Virginia, have implemented MPAC’s strategies. But Ahmed added that it can be difficult to reach those who are at risk for radicalization, because they often pull away from their communities at large, as they don’t easily find sympathy for their views. “That poses a challenge to us [Muslim-Americans] because they are out of our reach,” she said. In the end, though, it's difficult to know whether these efforts are having any effect on radicalization. “The most difficult question when you talk about prevention is: how do you prove the negative on these things?” said Hughes. See Something, Say Something? Another challenge, said Hughes, is that most local communities don’t know how to proceed when they notice that there might be a problem with a community member who is heading down a trajectory toward radicalization. Even if such a person does pull away from the community, “there’s usually a friend or family member who saw something concerning, but didn’t know how to respond.” There’s also the legitimate fear that alerting the authorities will send a person to prison or worse. “There’s only a subset of people you should arrest,” said Hughes. “But there is a subset of people you can reach. So we need a viable third way that’s not just calling your local FBI or ignoring the situation. We need programs where you can say, ‘I’m concerned about my loved one’ and talk to mental health professionals, social workers, religious leaders.” Rabia Chaudry, an attorney and national security fellow at the New America Foundation, has worked as a CVE consultant and says that many Muslim communities in the U.S. have shut down the conversation on CVE out of legitimate concerns about civil rights and marginalization. “What is the right balance for Muslim leadership to strike? We haven’t even been able to have these conversations because it’s been made into such a controversial issue by anti-CVE activists within the community,” said Chaudry. But she adds that extremists can reach teenage Muslims in seconds via social media and the Internet, and that Muslim communities need to get their heads out of the sand. It’s up to the community itself, she says, to develop the “third way” that Hughes describes. “This is one of the greatest failures of our Muslim leadership. They have failed to create a viable alternative beyond straight prosecution because we don’t allow, much less take the lead on, these conversations,” said Chaudry. “We should go head to head on these issues with local leaders and government. You want us to engage on CVE? Then promise us that if our community leaders engage on these issues, create off-ramps and interventions, they’re not going to go to jail. They won't get caught up in a terror probe or the target of bigotry. We need to take these demands to the government as a community. The government is not going to do it.”"

Every Monday In a modest victory for gun control advocates, the Supreme Court again declines a Second Amendment case. The Court hasn't heard such a case since 2010. Loading... December 7, 2015 The US Supreme Court handed gun control advocates a modest victory on Monday, deciding not to hear a challenge from gun rights activists to a Chicago suburb’s ordinance banning assault weapons. The ordinance from the city of Highland Park, Ill., passed in 2013, bans various semi-automatic weapons (it also bans some weapons by name, including AR-15s and AK-47s) as well as magazines holding more than 10 rounds of bullets. The Illinois State Rifle Association and Dr. Arie S. Friedman, a Highland Park resident, challenged the ordinance in the Chicago-based United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. A divided three-judge panel for the appeals court upheld the ordinance in an April ruling. The plaintiffs asked the Supreme Court to review the appeals court decision, but the high court declined. The justices gave no reason for turning down the appeal, as is their custom, and the ruling continues a trend that has seen the Court refuse to hear a Second Amendment since 2010. The Second Amendment to the US Constitution protects an individual’s right to keep and bear arms, but legal arguments over its scope have persisted for decades. In 2008 case District of Columbia vs. Heller the Court ruled for the first time that the Second Amendment guaranteed an individual right to bear arms, although the ruling only applied to firearms kept in the home for self-defense. In 2010, the court extended that principle to the states. Four members of the nine-person court need to vote to take up a case. Only Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia, two conservatives on the court, said the justices should have taken the case. Justice Thomas wrote in a six-page dissent that several lower courts ""have upheld categorical bans on firearms that millions of Americans commonly own for lawful purposes."" The Supreme Court should have heard the appeal of the Seventh Circuit’s ruling, he added, to prevent the appeals court ruling ""from relegating the Second Amendment to a second-class right."" The Highland Park ordinance specifically bans only ""unusual and dangerous firearms."" Questioning whether semi-automatic rifles fit that definition, Thomas argued in his dissent that semi-automatic rifles are popular, and that the majority of owners use them for lawful purposes. ""Under our precedents, that is all that is needed for citizens to have a right under the Second Amendment to keep such weapons,"" he added. Lawyers for Highland Park, in defense of the ordinance, noted that it was enacted ""following a series of tragic mass shootings across the nation,"" including the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, where a gunman killed 20 first graders and six adults. Armed with a semi-automatic rifle, the gunman was able to fire 154 rounds in less than five minutes. The states of New York and Connecticut passed assault weapons bans in the wake of that shooting. ""The Second Amendment is not unlimited,"" said Stephen Elrod, an attorney for Highland Park, according to the Associated Press. ""The Supreme Court recognizes that there are certain categories of guns that do not fall within the protections of the Second Amendment."" Outside the constitutionality of local assault weapons bans, some question whether such bans are even effective at reducing gun violence. Citing FBI statistics, The Christian Science Monitor's Harry Bruinius previously reported that only 248 of the nearly 12,000 murders committed in the United States in 2014 were perpetrated with rifles of any sort. Handguns, meanwhile, were used in nearly half of murders in the US in 2014. A 2004 study led by the University of Pennsylvania criminologist Christopher Koper examining the federal assault weapons ban – which was implemented in 1994 but allowed to expire by a bitterly-divided Congress ten years later – concluded that the bans success was ""mixed."" Mr. Bruinius writes: ""Crimes involving assault weapons did decline, but this decline was offset, the report concluded, by an increase in the use of other guns equipped with high-capacity magazines. It also concluded, however, that it was 'premature to make definitive assessments of the ban’s impact on gun crime,' and its overall effects were 'still unfolding' when the law expired."" Yet the split Seventh Circuit decision, which the Supreme Court has chosen to not review, illustrates the tension in the issue that, for the moment, favors those who support gun control. ""A ban on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines might not prevent shootings in Highland Park (where they are already rare), but it may reduce the carnage if a mass shooting occurs,"" wrote Judge Frank H. Easterbrook in the Seventh Circuit’s majority opinion. He added: ""If a ban on semiautomatic guns and large-capacity magazines reduces the perceived risk from a mass shooting, and makes the public feel safer as a result, that’s a substantial benefit.""

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in.

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/127061091/0/usatodaycommoney-topstories~Rieder-Bold-statements-for-gun-control/,"There are times when a problem is so intractable, when solutions seem so elusive, when even confronting the problem seems too much to ask, that you have to step out of the box. Business as usual is just not good enough. You have to find bold, creative ways to underscore the significance of the problem, and the need to address it head-on regardless of the obstacles and the roadblocks. Particularly when it's a matter of life and death. Lots of death. That's what two news organizations did recently — and commendably — in connection with the nation's seemingly endless series of mass shootings. On Saturday, The New York Times  ran an editorial on its front page headlined, ""End the Gun Epidemic in America."" It was the paper's first page-one editorial since 1920. Two days before, the day after the latest carnage, which occurred in San Bernardino, Calif., New York's Daily News weighed in with an attitude-laden front page castigating politicians for responding with platitudes rather than taking meaningful action. The headline on the tabloid's cover: ""GOD ISN'T FIXING THIS."" Ordinarily, of course, newspapers run editorials inside the paper on the opinion pages. It's part of the strict separation of news and opinion that is built into American journalism, regardless of what ideologues and cynics might think. To take an editorial out front is something that is, and should be, done sparingly. It says that this is a matter of extreme urgency. As the mass shooting epidemic is. USA TODAY Obama mourns passing of Saudi king No one thinks gun control is a panacea, something that would prevent all of these massacres. There isn't one. But there are some sensible measures that could help, without unduly infringing on Americans' cherished ability to acquire firearms. The Times is hardly calling for the disarming of the American people. The editorial was a common-sense call to regulate assault weapons, which played a prominent role in the bloodletting in San Bernardino, among other places. There is no reason why these killing machines should be in the hands of the populace. But the gun lobby holds Congress so completely in its thrall that when the federal ban on selling assault weapons expired in 2004, Congress let it die, and it has not been revived. Even a modest — and perfectly sensible — measure to keep Uzis and AK-47s out of the hands of those on the terrorist watch   list went down to defeat last week in the Senate. The Times' front-page editorial reflects widespread exasperation over the lack of response to the shootings, the paralysis in Congress and the sense that many Americans have become numb to the killings or, as my colleague Trevor Hughes suggests, see them as the price of maintaining gun ownership rights. USA TODAY Obama mourns passing of Saudi king So why did the Times take such an unusual step? “We do so today to deliver a strong and visible statement of frustration and anguish about our country’s inability to come to terms with the scourge of guns,"" wroteTimes Publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr., who came up with the idea. The powerful editorial had an enormous and instantaneous impact, galvanizing the public around the need for action, right? Well, no, of course not. It was greeted with no shortage of mockery in the digital world. ""The New York Times today published the newspaper's opinion on the front page. The last time it did that was yesterday,"" tweeted The Wall Street Journal's James Taranto. Conservative blogger  Erick Erickson shot the editorial full of bullet holes and posted a picture on Instagram to prove it. Obviously, there is no guarantee that the Times' gambit will bear fruit. The odds against any gun control measures passing anytime soon are awfully long. But the worst thing to do is to simply cave in the face of a difficult situation. And that oldest of old-school conventions — the newspaper editorial — certainly attracted quite a bit of attention online. The Daily News front page last Thursday played off of quotes from four Republican politicians — Sens. Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Lindsey Graham﻿ all presidential hopefuls, and House Speaker Paul Ryan — invoking prayer for the shooting victims. The subhead read, ﻿ ""As the latest batch of innocent Americans are left lying in pools of blood, cowards who could truly end gun scourge, continue to hide behind meaningless platitudes."" Upping the ante Monday, the financially struggling paper, which has been waging a crusade for gun control, featured a cover dedicated to those who had been offended by its previous front page: blue sky, lots of puppies and the headline ""Everything is awesome!"" Clearly, these front pages would have been totally inappropriate in a traditional broadsheet. But tabloids have long been known for their edgier approach. The Daily News' rival, Rupert Murdoch's New York Post, has made the tab cover an art form, if a slightly deranged one. In this instance, the Daily News has been wielding the cover as a cudgel for social change. Rieder is USA TODAY's media editor."

http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-supreme-court-highland-park-assault-weapons-ban-20151207-story.html,"The U.S. Supreme Court's refusal Monday to take up a challenge to Highland Park's ban on assault weapons protects similar restrictions in Chicago and other parts of Illinois and sends a message that municipalities have the right to determine how to best protect their communities, according to legal experts. The lack of action was a blow to the National Rifle Association and other pro-gun advocates who had hoped the high court would issue a ruling that once and for all clarified whether weapons such as AK-47s, AR-15s and Uzis are protected under the Constitution. The court's decision to reject the case comes on the heels of a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., in which AR-15-style rifles were used to carry out what officials have determined was a terrorist act. The case placed Highland Park, a mostly affluent suburb on the North Shore, in the midst of the heated battle over Second Amendment rights, but city officials said their goal always has been simply to keep mass shootings such as the one in Newtown, Conn., from happening there. With its ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines intact, Highland Park Mayor Nancy R. Rotering said the city and other cities and villages in Illinois are now better equipped to protect their citizens. ""No parent sending a child to school, to the park or to the movies should have to worry about whether they will come home or not,"" Rotering said. ""Banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines is one common-sense action to reduce gun violence and protect our children and our communities from potential mass violence and grief."" The Supreme Court effectively let stand the decision by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upholding a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines that Highland Park and about 20 other Illinois cities hurriedly passed two years ago. Highland Park, whose defense was backed by the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, likened itself to communities such as Newtown, where a gunman murdered 20 children and six adult staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. Attorneys for Highland Park argued that ""military-style"" weapons with high-capacity magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition were a threat to the public and that banning them was the city's best effort to prevent such a massacre. While the appellate court ruling allows the law to remain on the books for now, the battle is not over in Illinois. Another lawsuit brought against an assault weapons ban in Cook County is still pending in the Illinois Supreme Court. The larger question of whether assault rifles are protected by the Second Amendment was left unanswered in Heller v. Washington D.C. in 2008 and McDonald v. Chicago in 2010, the two recent Supreme Court rulings that reaffirmed citizens' rights to have firearms for self-defense. However, Steven Elrod, a Chicago attorney who works as the corporation counsel for Highland Park, said the 7th Circuit ruling answered that question. ""The issue was whether the Second Amendment has any exceptions to it,"" Elrod said. ""We saw from the U.S. Supreme Court cases in Heller and McDonald that not all firearms are covered by the Second Amendment. What the 7th Circuit said in our case is that firearms that constitute a clear danger or uncommon usage of self-defense are not protected."" Gun rights advocates disagreed and said they won't back down from efforts to protect the use of rapid-firing, semi-automatic rifles that are among the most popular firearms for hunting, recreational shooting and self-defense. ""The Supreme Court hears less than 1 percent of the cases submitted every year, so it's never a surprise to learn a petition for cert has been denied,"" said NRA spokesman Lars Dalseide. ""It's important to remember that the Supreme Court has regularly maintained that a denial is not an affirmation of a lower court's ruling."" The appellate ruling is not broad in scope, Dalseide said, pointing out that it only applies to Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin. But anti-gun leaders said it continues a trend in the lower courts. In October the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a similar assault weapons ban in New York and Connecticut. Those bans were passed after the Sandy Hook shootings. The Highland Park case was brought by pediatrician Arie S. Friedman, 49, who claimed that the ban passed by the Highland Park City Council in 2013 denied him the right to use his semi-automatic weapons to protect his home and family. The Illinois State Rifle Association was a co-plaintiff. Richard Pearson, director of the Illinois State Rifle Association, was disappointed the Supreme Court did not hear the case but said his organization is still waiting for the conclusion of the state court case challenging the Cook County ban. He said the group will also keep looking for new plaintiffs in areas that have enacted assault weapons bans. ""We are not going to give up and we're not going to go away,"" Pearson said. Gun advocates said their claims are supported in a lengthy dissent written by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and supported by Justice Antonin Scalia. Both justices said they would have heard the case and struck down the ban. Thomas wrote that the appeals court ruling ""flouts two of our Second Amendment precedents."" Thomas said the weapons ban ""is highly suspect because it broadly prohibits common semi-automatic firearms used for lawful purposes"" by roughly 5 million Americans. ""The overwhelming majority of citizens who own and use such rifles do so for lawful purposes, including self-defense and target shooting,"" Thomas wrote. The case had been under consideration at the high court for two months, but the delay in dealing with it appears mainly due to the time it took for Thomas to finish his opinion. Assault weapons have been a heated issue in Illinois since 2013, when the General Assembly declined to include a ban in the Illinois concealed carry law. In a compromise, the legislature gave cities 10 days after the bill's passage to enact their own bans or forfeit the right. Chicago, which already had a ban in place, strengthened its restrictions. Cook County, which initially upgraded its assault weapons ban in 2006, moved to strengthen the law and its penalties in 2013. The county's 2006 law already was being challenged in the state courts. The Illinois Supreme Court has yet to rule on whether it violates the Second Amendment. The Highland Park ordinance, which is based on the Cook County ordinance, prohibits the sale, purchase or possession of semi-automatic weapons that can hold more than 10 rounds in a magazine. It also bans semi-automatics equipped with a folding, telescoping or thumbhole stock; a shroud attached to the barrel; a muzzle brake or muzzle compensator; a protruding pistol grip; or a pistol grip with a stock attached. It also prohibits the sale and possession of magazines that fire more than 10 rounds.

http://feeds.inquisitr.com/~r/google/yDYq/~3/IdAintC3aNI/,"President Obama has apparently convinced actor James Woods to join the National Rifle Association. Woods, a long-time foe of Obama on social media, tweeted out that decision around the time that the president was delivering his televised speech on terrorism in the aftermath of the San Bernardino mass shooting. In October, Woods criticized Obama for failing to recognize that the Oregon shooter at Umpqua Community College allegedly singled out Christians in the attack. Last year, he wondered out loud on social media if Obama ally and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was mentally ill after she got into a confrontation with another lawmaker. In his address last night, Obama asked Congress to enact a law preventing a person placed on the no-fly list from being eligible to buy a firearm and to make it harder for anyone to buy an assault weapon. In the past, liberals have decried the no-fly list itself because of overinclusive errors, its arbitrary nature, and the lack of due process. The president has also been huddling with key advisors about how to implement other forms of gun control through executive orders rather than via the legislative process. According to Woods, ""I don't even own a rifle, but I'm just sick to death of Obama's gleeful degradation of constitutional sanctity,"" in an apparent reference to the Second Amendment, the right to keep and bear arms.   Woods, who has 136 acting credits on IMDB, said in October 2013 that he didn't expect to work again in the movies because of his outspoken Obama criticism which goes against the grain in liberal Hollywood. In January of that year, firearms and ammunition began flying off the gun shop shelves all over the country because of White House gun control rhetoric in the aftermath of the horrible tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Gun rights advocates believe the end game is government confiscation of firearms. For political, recreational, or self-defense reasons, the uptick in personal gun ownership is continuing. As the Inquisitr previously reported, the FBI apparently processed a record number of background checks most likely related to Black Friday gun sales. Averaging two per second, the FBI received 185,345 background check requests in on Black Friday 2015. The previous all-time Black Friday record for background checks was set in 2014. Last year, the total number of screenings related to gun sales was a little over 175,000.  Separately, on The Kelly File tonight, Megyn Kelly reported that San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook allegedly received a big deposit in his bank account about a week before the attack, a development that did not escape the notice of James Woods.

He started by offering his thoughts and prayers for the victims. ""Of course, these days, even thoughts and prayers have become controversial,"" Colbert noted, holding up a copy of the New York Daily News from last Thursday, with ""God Isn't Fixing This"" on the cover. ""First, I'd just like to defend thoughts and prayers, as someone who occasionally thinks and prays. The reason you keep people in your thoughts and prayers is admittedly not to fix the problem, but to try to find some small way to share the burden of grief."" Still, he said, ""the Daily News is right that if we really want to fix it, we can't just stop there."" So what to do? Colbert didn't really have an answer, but he did have some questions. Like: ""Why is it so easy to buy bullets when I have to show three forms of ID to buy Sudafed?"" President Obama called the San Bernardino shooting an act of terrorism on Sunday night, and motive matters, Colbert said.

What’s the difference between these two incidents? Well, for one thing Malik and Farook were clearly more successful in that they killed more people. On the other hand Dear was clearly more successful in that he’s still alive. Some will say that the ability of these three people to secure enough weapons to carry out these attacks is proof that it is too easy to get your hands on a gun (or several). Others will say that the ability of other armed people was the only thing that ultimately stopped the rampages. It has been claimed that Dear was fundamentalist believer and that his sincere beliefs inspired him to exact vengeance on people he perceived to be morally repugnant. Malik and Farook are currently being investigated posthumously to determine to what degree they had been become radical Muslims; ISIS has claimed to have had the couple’s support. Everyone will point to these shootings as indicative of what’s wrong with our country – but with different rationale. I have written about gun violence and the problem with theocracy in the past so I won’t dive back into my positions on those things. But if we can all agree that no one should go around shooting others (we can agree on that, right) then why is it taking so long to take preventative measures. I understand that liberals and conservatives believe the correct solution are two very different things. But I cannot understand why neither side is willing to try the other side’s ideas. When faced with a potentially lethal threat it is justifiable to take in information and consider options. But there needs to be an action step taken at some point. For our elected officials to still be in the bickering stage with this issue is unacceptable.  Because the more they bicker the less they act to prevent the next mass shooting from happening. Beyond the details of these two situations is the obvious fact that people are shooting and killing other people. We must do better at stopping these events.

http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2015/dec/08/u-s-plans-terror-alert-system-changes-2/,"WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration will announce changes to the terror alert system ""in the coming days,"" Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Monday. Johnson described the change as a new alert system, which he said would better inform the public about threats to the United States, but he did not provide specific details. This will be the third change to how the Homeland Security Department warns the public about security concerns since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The much maligned color-coded system was replaced in 2011 by the National Terrorism Advisory System, which has never been used. Johnson announced the new alert system during a forum with Defense One magazine. He said the National Terrorism Advisory System hasn't been used because it requires a ""specific, credible threat"" to the U.S. in order to be activated. The new effort will include an ""intermediate"" step, he said. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said later Monday that the alert system wasn't being replaced but rather tweaked to be more effective. He said a review of the system had been going on for ""quite some time."" ""You should not consider this a replacement of this program but rather some important reforms of the program that would allow it to be more effectively used to communicate with the American public,"" Earnest told reporters. The plan to change the system was announced after the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., over which the FBI has declared a terrorism investigation. The FBI is investigating the possibility that shooting suspects Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik were inspired by the Islamic State group to carry out the attacks that killed 14 people attending a holiday luncheon at a social services facility. Johnson said that while a specific motive has not been determined in the California case, the threat from home-grown radicals or those inspired by foreign groups is a growing concern in part because such attacks may not be discovered in advance. The new terror alert system, he said, better ""reflects the current environment and current realities."" ""We need a system that adequately informs the public at large ... about what we are seeing, what we are doing and what we are asking the public to do about it,"" Johnson said.

http://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/affirmative-action-supreme-court-anthony-kennedy-texas-216511,"Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy is expected to be the court’s swing vote deciding whether race-based affirmative action will survive on college campuses. | AP Photo Education The Supreme Court justice holds the swing vote in a case that could end affirmative action in college admissions. By KIMBERLY HEFLING 12/08/2015 05:19 AM EST Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy has been lionized as a liberal hero since his sweeping opinion authorizing same-sex marriage last summer. But Wednesday, the court will hear arguments in a case in which he may crush the hopes of his liberal fans. Kennedy is expected to be the court’s swing vote deciding whether race-based affirmative action will survive on college campuses. And on this issue, he’s been decidedly more skeptical. The case, Fisher v. University of Texas, could impact admissions policies at nearly every college and university, and it’s coming before the court at a moment when campuses are awash in racial protests. Indeed, some observers believe a key turning point in the case will be whether Kennedy, whose same-sex marriage opinions took full note of the nation’s changing attitudes about homosexuality, will again be willing to consider evidence that race on campus continues to be a point of division. “Judges are human and I don’t think anyone can fail to recognize that race certainly matters on college campuses across the country today and I don’t think that anybody can fail to notice that there is a value in a diversity of perspectives and opinions and experience,” said Peter McDonough, the general counsel at the American Council of Education, which represents college presidents and has filed a brief backing affirmative action. The plaintiff in the case is Abigail Fisher, a white woman who says the university’s rejection of her application in 2008 violated the equal protection clause. Many in academia fear that in agreeing to rehear a case it considered just two years ago, conservative justices may be ready to end affirmative action in higher education, although some court watchers believe they may only rein in the practice or limit their decision to Texas’ program. By CAITLIN EMMA Despite his skepticism of racial preferences in admissions, Kennedy has so far been reluctant to do away with them altogether. He wrote the 7-1 decision in Fisher’s first turn before the court in 2013, writing that the lower court had not forced the university to explain exactly why it needed to take race into account or, in legal terms, applied “strict scrutiny” of the means the university had used to attain diversity. Courts ""must ultimately be satisfied that no workable race-neutral alternatives would produce the educational benefits of diversity,"" Kennedy wrote. That sent the case back to the lower court, which once again upheld the university’s program, prompting Fisher’s déjà vu appeal to the high court. Through its top-10-percent plan, the University of Texas fills much of its class with students who are admitted automatically because of their class rank. After that, administrators employ what they consider a “holistic” admissions process, which takes race into account “only as one factor among many.” While the case involves a public university, experts said nearly all private colleges and universities would be affected by the court’s decision because institutions that accept federal aid are subject to Title VI of the federal Civil Rights Act prohibiting racial discrimination. Eight states outlaw race-based admissions policies in public institutions, but such policies are widely used. About 60 percent of the most selective four-year schools that take 40 percent or fewer applicants consider race in admissions, an American Council on Education survey found. In a Gallup Poll, 58 percent of Americans said they support affirmative action for minorities. Fisher brings her case back to the court at a time of more intense racial ferment following high-profile shootings of African-American men in Ferguson, Mo., Charleston, S.C., Chicago and elsewhere. In the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement, campuses across the country have lit up with sit-ins and other protests on a level reminiscent of the 1960s and ‘70s. Students have argued that racism remains rampant, sometimes in shockingly blatant form such as University of Oklahoma fraternity members singing a chant with racial slurs or a noose popping up on the Duke University campus. Most spectacularly, a hunger strike and a strike by football players helped force out the president of the University of Missouri System after what protesters called a pattern of ignoring racist incidents. Protesters at many campuses have demanded that university leaders address the social isolation of minority students and what they view as institutional racism, for example Princeton’s celebration of Woodrow Wilson or Harvard’s use of the term House Master, which it said last week it would abandon. In a court brief filed in October, the University of Texas seized upon the renewed racial turmoil, describing how in the wake of the tragic mass shooting at a church in Charleston last summer, students led a movement to get a statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis removed from an outdoor mall on campus. The university cited that debate as an example why it needs its current admissions policy. Helen Tran, left, and Jennifer Hicks protest in front of the U.S. Supreme Court in 2012, before the justices heard arguments on Fisher V. University of Texas at Austin, on whether the university's consideration of race in admissions is constitutional. | Getty “UT’s student body brought many different viewpoints to that debate, and this event is just one of many constant reminders that race remains relevant in Austin, as in America, today,” it said. Yet Edward Blum, director of the Project on Fair Representation, which is representing Fisher, says it may be wishful thinking to imagine that these events will shape the justices’ decision. “Justices on the Supreme Court in earlier cases seemed to have ignored flare-ups in various policy arenas and have stuck to applying the law outside of current events,” Blum said. Certainly on gay rights, however, Kennedy has been mindful of society’s transformation. As an appeals court judge in the 1970s and early 1980s, he made rulings upholding legal discrimination against gay people. But in legalizing same-sex marriage in June, he wrote in lofty terms about how the Constitution offers gay couples “equal dignity in the eyes of the law.” That ruling is giving liberals hope that he is watching the anguish of many minority students and will refrain from striking down affirmative action. “He’s been a champion for human dignity and I think that’s why he was so celebrated in those decisions and I think this case leaves another opportunity to do the same,” said Rachel Kleinman, senior counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. “We really see this again as a dignity issue, much like the marriage equality case.” Justice Elena Kagan, who was solicitor general when the administration weighed in on the Fisher case in the appeals court, has recused herself. So if Kennedy sides with the more liberal justices, there would be a 4-4 decision, which would set no binding precedent. If he sided with the conservative wing, a 5-3 decision could alter the legalities of affirmative action programs. Another possibility is that he could put himself somewhere between the two ideological camps. John Brittain, a longtime civil rights lawyer and law professor at the University of the District of Columbia, said the court could still uphold its precedent, but some parts of the Texas program could be declared unconstitutional. “The worst-case scenario in the UT case for proponents of diversity is that the justices finally muster up enough votes to strike down any use of race in higher education admissions,” Brittain said. The case is being watched closely in the higher education community. Two other admissions-related cases filed against Harvard University and the University of North Carolina, both alleging they put Asian-Americans at a disadvantage, have been put on hold awaiting the Fisher ruling. By MAGGIE SEVERNS In the Grutter v. Bollinger case in 2003 involving Michigan law school’s admissions, the court upheld race as a factor. Kennedy dissented. “Preferment by race, when resorted to by the State, can be the most divisive of all policies, containing within it the potential to destroy confidence in the Constitution and in the idea of equality,” Kennedy wrote. Last year, the Supreme Court in Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action upheld a constitutional amendment approved by Michigan voters that banned preferential treatment based on race in college admissions policies. Kennedy said that case wasn’t about the merits of race-conscious admissions policies in higher education, but whether voters could prohibit such racial preferences. “Deliberative debate on sensitive issues such as racial preferences all too often may shade into rancor,” Kennedy wrote. “But that does not justify removing certain court-determined issues from the voters’ reach. Democracy does not presume that some subjects are either too divisive or too profound for public debate.” For those reading Kennedy’s tea leaves on race, another telling case was the 2007 ruling that came down against desegregation efforts in Seattle and Louisville public schools. Kennedy sided with the conservative justices in opposing the plans, but also separated himself from their views — perhaps a signal that he is not ready to shut the door on racial considerations in education. “To the extent the plurality opinion suggests the Constitution mandates that state and local school authorities must accept the status quo of racial isolation in schools, it is, in my view, profoundly mistaken,” Kennedy wrote.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/S9hZsvrSfLU/,"Is it now time to invoke Section 4 of the 25th Amendment? Has our president officially lost his ability to discharge the powers and duties of his office? Anyone who listened to President Obama speak to reporters in Paris last week would reasonably conclude it is high time to start drawing up the papers to transmit to Congress for his removal. If you are one of the millions and millions of literate Americans out there who have simply tuned this president out the past three or four years, that is certainly understandable. But if you tuned in to the long, rambling, empty press conference, you would have been truly alarmed. Without the use of the teleprompter, his speech can be described only as “halting.” It was impossible to count the number of times he seized up, able to deaden the silence with only a drawn-out “uh,” “um” or “ahhh.” The White House dutifully scrubbed all the halts and stutters from the official transcript, and it was impossible to count them in real time. But a sample of his incoherent word salad found him stuttering about every 15 words, which comes to more than 330 “uh-um-ahhs” in a single appearance. This is not the same soaring speaker who inspired so many in 2008. This is a broken-down man who has lost the only gift he ever had. Hope and Change have been hijacked by Hopeless and Changed. President Obama is so old and gaunt, he makes Keith Richards look like Justin Bieber — no offense to Keith Richards. At least Mr. Richards makes sense when he opens his mouth. It took the doddering president 47 minutes and over 5,000 words to answer just six questions. And by “answer,” I simply mean he unspooled a torrent of disjointed words and broken sentences. Part of the looniness of it all stemmed from the giant scam he and other world leaders are trying to put over on advanced countries, punishing them for their industriousness by redistributing billions and billions of dollars from hardworking American taxpayers and handing it over to tin-pot dictators in disheveled Third World countries. “You go down to Miami, and when it’s flooding at high tide on a sunny day fish are swimming through the middle of the streets,” he said at one point. As if this were some kind of evidence that high tides or flooding are somehow caused by global warming. Never mind that a) the argument makes no sense; and b) local media refuted the canard. But President Obama’s fevers went well beyond global warming hysteria. Asked about the “mass shooting” where a nut job shot three people at a Colorado abortion clinic, President Obama once again became exasperated with the American people. “I say this every time we’ve got one of these mass shootings: This just doesn’t happen in other countries.” He actually said this. In Paris. Not three weeks after gunmen mowed down 129 people enjoying freedom in the French capital. Either the man is incapable of remembering Islamist terrorist attacks or he’s simply losing his marbles. Then, of course, there is this business of comparing radical Islamic terrorism to — global warming? He actually insisted that global warming is an even greater threat than terrorism itself. Again, he said this. In Paris. Not three weeks after the worst terrorist attacks in a civilized country since 9/11. Someone alert the Senate president pro tempore. Somebody call the speaker of the House. And let’s all dust off the 25th Amendment. Charles Hurt can be reached at charleshurt@live.com and on Twitter via @charleshurt.

http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/12/08/the_ignorant_gun_control_crusade_128971.html,"Self-righteousness is liberating. The same people who are most exercised about guns in America, and want to ban and even confiscate entire categories of firearms, know little about them and evidently feel no compunction to learn. The worst terror attack in the United States since September 11 has become the occasion for another frenzied, poorly informed push for new gun restrictions. President Barack Obama gave a prime-time address on the terror threat, in which he resolutely reaffirmed the status quo in the campaign against ISIS. Except that he hopes that gun control, one of the signal political and policy failures of our time, will now be deployed to help foil the apocalyptic terror group. Almost every time there is a mass shooting, there is a rush to push old gun-control chestnuts, regardless of their applicability. The San Bernardino terror couple didn’t buy their guns at a gun show (making the effort to close the so-called gun-show loophole irrelevant); they weren’t on the terrorism watch list (so the proposal to ban people on the list from buying guns wouldn’t have stopped them); and Syed Farook passed a background check when he bought two handguns (rendering calls for universal background checks moot). The president and the New York Times, which saw fit to publish a front-page editorial for the first time since it thundered against Warren Harding in 1920, have fastened on the two “assault weapons,” AR-15s, used in the attack. The Times called them “weapons of war, barely modified.” President Obama referred to them as “powerful assault weapons.” On this question, the Left has fallen for its own propaganda. Decades ago, gun-controllers decided to play on the confusion between semi-automatic versus automatic weapons to push for a ban on nasty-looking assault weapons, even though they are, for the most part, functionally indistinguishable from other semi-automatic rifles. The AR-15 is one of those semi-automatic guns. It isn’t exotic or particularly powerful. It is the most popular rifle in the country. At least 3.5 million are in circulation. It is lightweight, accurate, and without much kick. You wouldn’t use it in combat and, in fact, wouldn’t necessarily use it to hunt. A .223-caliber gun, it is less powerful than many handguns. Some states forbid .223-caliber rifles in deer hunting because they aren’t powerful enough to reliably take down the game. If gun-controllers know any of this, they hide it well. Nor do they seem to care that a prior version of the assault-weapons ban, in effect in the ten years after 1994, was wholly ineffectual. A Department of Justice-backed study concluded, “Should it be renewed, the ban’s effects on gun violence are likely to be small at best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement.” (Rifles of all types, let alone assault rifles, are used in gun homicides only rarely.) The proposal to keep people on the terrorist watch list from buying guns sounds sensible, yet it is problematic in that it denies people an explicit constitutional right on the basis of little or no due process. Last year, the Times itself inveighed against “the shadowy, self-contradictory world of American terror watch lists.” If the watch list is to become a no-gun list, it has to be cleaned up, and listees should have an opportunity to challenge their status upon attempting to buy a gun. Such a prohibition would affect a tiny slice of gun purchases and would likely be mere symbolism, like the assault-weapons ban. The overriding reality that gun-controllers ignore is that almost all gun homicides are committed with handguns in routine street crime, and are often obtained in informal networks operating outside the gun rules we already have. But please don’t confuse the anti-gun campaigners with facts. Their ignorance is invincible, and necessary to their crusade. © 2015 King Features Syndicate"

http://www.ibtimes.com/muslim-crowdfunding-campaign-raises-more-83k-san-bernardino-shooting-victims-2216182,"A group of Muslims and Muslim organizations have raised more than $83,000 through a fundraising effort for the victims of last Wednesday’s mass shooting in San Bernardino. The campaign was launched by a network of local California, regional and national Muslim organizations last Thursday on the crowdfunding site LaunchGood.com, under the name “Muslims United For San Bernardino Families.” “We wish to respond to evil with good, as our faith instructs us, and send a powerful message of compassion through action. Our Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, said: ‘Have mercy to those on earth, and the One in the Heavens (God) will have mercy upon you.’ And the Quran teaches to ‘Repel evil by that which is better,’” reads the appeal on the LaunchGood page. It also asks Muslim-American imams, mosques and other leaders to endorse and promote the project. Dr. Faisal Qazi, a neurologist from Fullerton, California, started the initiative with the goal of raising $100,000 to cover expenses like funeral costs, medical treatments, rent and mortgage payments for the San Bernardino victims and their families. At the current rate, the campaign, which ends on Dec. 30, will blow past its goal in less than a week. Qazi is the co-founder of MiNDS, a development organization dedicated to supporting specialty healthcare organizations and mental health programs for underserved families in the Inland Empire, Pomona and North Orange County. He first launched a small fund on behalf of the organization Wednesday after he learned about the shooting, as many of his patients’ families take their children to the Inland Regional Center, the site of the attack, for help with developmental disabilities. A Muslim-led crowdfunding effort is underway to help the victims of last week's mass shooting in California. Photo: LaunchGood.com On Thursday, Qazi reached out to MiNDS’ partner organizations, including Muslim groups like the Sahaba Initiative and Uplift Charity. That’s when area Muslim leaders, including Imam Mohammed Faqih of the Islamic Institute of Orange County, asked Qazi to expand the effort into a national, Muslim-led interfaith fundraising campaign. “This is something that affects all of us; it affects us as [U.S.] citizens,” Faqih told the Los Angeles Daily News. “This particular incident affected us as Muslims. This is the response that everyone, especially Muslim-Americans should [have] in every case, regardless of who the perpetrators are.” Qazi says that he is partnering with San Bernardino County public health officials and the Arrowhead United Way in San Bernardino to distribute the funds once they’re collected."

http://www.startribune.com/opinion/commentaries/360955541.html,"Batman used to carry a gun. It’s true. Back in the 1930s, not only did he carry a gun, but he killed bad guys with it. The very first official “Batman” comic featured the Caped Crusader firing a machine gun. But the public grew uneasy. So the editors adopted a new rule: no guns for Batman. Bob Kane, the character’s co-creator, would later explain that his editors worried “that mothers would object to letting their kids see and read about such shootings.” That tale from a simpler age comes to mind as, once more, we cringe at the ease with which carnage can be inflicted by a determined shooter. We’ve long passed the point when parents can shield their children from seeing and reading about horrific violence, whether or not inflicted by guns. And reports about violence — especially terrorism — frighten them. A lot. If children are scared, what do we tell them? Do we say, “Don’t worry, there’s no chance of a terror attack or a mass shooting in our neighborhood?” If we say it, do we believe it? Do the children believe it? Moral panics don’t lend themselves to rational analysis. Do we say, “Despite what you might see on television, the rate of gun violence in the U.S. is down?” I doubt that will do any good. Children are as vulnerable as anyone else to the availability heuristic — probably more so. Do we say, “The government has matters in hand?” We can try, but we’d be lying. This is an era, after all, when the left thinks the problem is too many guns and the right thinks the problem is too many bad people, and we can’t even discuss policy without an eruption of mindless savagery in the Twitterverse. And most children, by a relatively young age, have likely heard enough political fury in their own homes to get the point that government isn’t working very well just now. Do we say, “Let’s pray for the people who got hurt?” Well, if we happen to be praying people, we might try. But see the previous paragraph, about the mindless savagery of the Twitterverse: Apparently, people who don’t believe in the efficacy of prayer are really angry these days at people who do. (I’m betting the kids already know that, too.) I don’t know the answer. Our children are grown now, but if they weren’t, I have no idea how my wife and I would explain the state of the world to them. We’d do our best to reassure them — we are praying people; erupt in the comments as you like — but we would also understand that our best efforts would be unlikely to fully quiet their fears. Our Connecticut home is half an hour’s drive from Newtown. Studies of children in areas where terrorism is far more common than in the U.S. tell us that many develop symptoms of post-traumatic stress even when they themselves do not directly witness terror attacks. Some work suggests that the children who do best are those whose families maintain their routines. Parents from parts of the world sundered by violence have told me they do exactly that. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, in its fact sheet on how to talk to children about terrorism, reminds us that young people “will usually know if you’re not being honest” and also advises, in words unintentionally chilling, “don’t make unrealistic promises.” (So maybe we should stop pretending to believe that bombing in Iraq and Syria will make Islamic State disappear.) The fact sheet adds a reminder that children will learn how to deal with their fears largely by watching how we deal with ours. Yet they are surely waiting for grown-ups to do something. (And, no, calling each other nasty names for disagreeing on exactly which something we should do doesn’t count.) The trouble is, we don’t know quite what to do. Whether facing acts of terror inspired abroad or mass murders concocted at home, we spend a lot of time flinging charges and wringing hands. The nation does not seem terribly confident just now. Our children must sense the uneasiness of the generation that’s running things — and be made uneasy by it in turn. Which brings us back to Batman. The Caped Crusader, says Will Brooker in “Batman Unmasked: Analyzing a Cultural Icon,” has always been more fluid than other comic book heroes. He’s undergone dramatic shifts in character to reflect the public sensibility of the moment. In World War II, he fought the Axis powers. During the Cold War, he often battled communist spies. He went from using guns to throwing baddies off buildings to refusing to kill. For a long time, the writers emphasized his superior intelligence, so that he did not so much outfight the bad guys as outthink them. In his latest incarnation, the Batman of the graphic novels has become a dark, brooding, violent character, much like the original. That first Batman appeared when criminal gangs were rampant in many cities and the shadow of fascism loomed over Europe. People were scared. They wanted a superhero who’d protect them by any means necessary. We’re scared today, too. If we could bring one of those many Batmen to life, I wonder which we’d choose.

http://www.ibtimes.com/white-house-press-secretary-donald-trump-muslim-controversy-disqualifies-him-being-2216533,"Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump’s call for a ban on all Muslims traveling into the United States disqualifies him from being president, the White House press secretary said Tuesday. Josh Earnest said Trump’s comments not only increase anti-Muslim sentiment but also endanger national security, Talking Points Memo reported. ""What Donald Trump said yesterday disqualifies him to serve as president,"" Earnest said, according to a reporter at Tuesday's briefing. ""The Trump campaign for months now has had a 'dustbin of history'-like quality to it, from the vacuous sloganeering to the outright lies to even the fake hair — the whole carnival barker routine we've seen for some time now. The question now is about the rest of the Republican party and whether or not they're going to be dragged into the dustbin of history with him."" Trump said Monday the U.S. should bar Muslims from entering the country, saying hatred among Muslims for Americans is unprecedented and that the U.S. should determine where the hatred comes from, the New York Times reported. Trump's call for a ban came several days after a deadly mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, which authorities said was perpetrated by two Muslims who may have been radicalized. Earnest’s comments follow an earlier condemnation from a GOP lawmaker, among a range of mostly negative reactions from both sides of the political aisle. Rep. David Jolly, R-Fla., said in a House speech Tuesday that Trump should withdraw his presidential candidacy because of the comments, the Hill reported. Billionaire businessman Trump has topped the GOP polls for the past few months. “I’m a born-again Christian. I believe in the saving grace of the Jesus Christ that I call my God. And the beautiful thing about this country is I can stand here on the House floor among my peers and in front of the nation and declare that faith without fear of any reprisal,” Jolly said, according to the Hill. “But if Donald Trump has his way, we may not have the liberty to do that anymore.”  &quot;What Donald Trump said yesterday,&quot; says @PressSec, &quot;disqualifies him from serving as President.&quot; pic.twitter.com/PjCF1UJ7Fs   Many lawmakers, including those outside the United States, have criticized Trump’s call for banning Muslims from coming into the U.S., saying it’s unconstitutional to single people out because of their faith, Reuters reported. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said that Trump is feeding hatred, and British Prime Minister David Cameron has said Trump’s comments are unhelpful and wrong. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said that Trump’s plan would undermine national security."

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/127204937/0/phoenix/nation~Schools-comb-cafeterias-Farook-inspected/,"Federal authorities are examining a deposit of $28,500 into an account linked to California shooter Syed Farook shortly before Farook and wife Tashfeen Malik launched last week’s deadly assault that left 14 dead and 21 others wounded in San Bernardino, a federal law enforcement official said Tuesday. The official, who is not authorized to comment on the developing investigation, said the money appeared to be a loan. The connection, if any, as a possible funding source for the attacks was not immediately clear. The deposit turned up in investigators’ analysis of the San Bernardino couple’s financial and personal records as part of a wide-ranging effort to determine how they were radicalized and what drove them to mount the attack on a holiday party packed with many of Farook's co-workers. Los Angeles FBI chief David Bowdich said earlier this week that the couple had been radicalized for “quite some time.’’ He said investigators are still searching for how the radicalization occurred and whether others were involved in their apparent embrace of extremist ideology. Meanwhile, a San Bernardino public school official said that within a day of the Dec. 2 attack, bomb-detecting dogs swept through local schools that Farook had visited in recent weeks. The ""extra precaution"" was necessary, city schools spokeswoman Linda Bardere said, after the district learned that Farook was a health inspector for San Bernardino County's Environmental Health Services and had visited 10 sites, nine of which were schools. The visits were made in late October and early November. County records provided to USA TODAY show that Farook inspected the cafeterias from Oct. 22 through Nov. 5. Bardere said the district sent bomb-detecting dogs through a local high school that Farook inspected on Oct. 23, less than six weeks before the attacks. A bomb-sniffing canine unit from the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians searched the pool and kitchen areas at Arroyo Valley High School on Dec. 3, ""as an extra precaution,"" she said in an e-mail. Nothing unusual was found, Bardere said. Local police swept nine sites the same day and ""did not find anything abnormal,"" she said. School district officials learned less than a day after the shootings that Farook had inspected the high school. She said the district called in the San Miguel Band of Mission Indians because school police were busy at the shooting site. ""Because this was such an unexpected attack at the Inland Regional Center, we didn't want to take any chances,"" Bardere told KPCC. After nothing suspicious was found, officials pulled records for other school cafeteria inspections carried out by Farook and found that he had visited the other campuses as well, the San Bernardino County Sun reported. A county spokeswoman said records showing which other schools Farook inspected were unavailable because they are part of the federal investigation of the shootings. FBI officials have said they have no evidence so far that Farook, 28, and Malik, 27, had other targets in mind, but school security consultant Ken Trump on Tuesday told USA TODAY that if terrorists ""want to strike at the heart of America, they will strike at our children. Schools remain soft targets and sustained resources for comprehensive school emergency planning have been all but eliminated from federal and state budgets."" Farook also inspected private cafeterias, and on Monday, Stephen Porter, the pastor of St. Catherine of Siena church in Rialto, Calif., told county officials that he had removed from the church kitchen an inspection sign signed by ""S. Farook,"" out of respect for the families of victims, The Orange County Register reported. One of the 14 victims, Yvette Velasco, was a parish member. ""I didn't want anyone going into the kitchen, photographing the sign or Googling it, especially if the family was around,"" Porter told The Register. ""Technically, we have to display the sign, but I didn't want it out. We told the county we didn't want to offend anybody."" Follow Greg Toppo on Twitter: @gtoppo"

http://www.inquisitr.com/2619663/california-bakersfield-shooting-suspects-identified-vigil-held-for-victims-of-the-san-bernardino-terrorist-attack/,"In California, two Bakersfield shooting suspects have been identified by police after they were in an officer-involved shooting. Some workers also felt a connection to the San Bernardino terrorist attack, and on Monday night they held a vigil for the victims of the mass shootings. In a related report by the Inquisitr, California police are investigating a series of Facebook posts that call for a mass shooting in Bakersfield, California. Police have identified two of the three Bakersfield shooting suspects involved in an incident which took place on Friday, December 4. Authorities say Jeriel Fite, 31, and Reginald Moland, 30, were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, firearms-related offenses, and gang enhancements in connection with a local shooting. During the shooting incident, Bakersfield police found a man with multiple gunshot wounds inside a vehicle. The man was taken to the hospital and police began searching for a gray compact vehicle which contained the three suspects. After police caught up with them, a car chase ensued but the shooting suspects eventually crashed their vehicle into a fence. Police officer Danny Melendez fired on the three suspects with his sidearm, striking Fite with a non-life threatening injury. Moland was eventually captured and taken into custody without any further confrontations. The third suspect, who is not named in the reports, managed to evade police. The Bakersfield Police Department is still investigating the shooting and police pursuit, and anyone with information is asked to call 327-7111. According to Bakersfield Now, officer Melendez is also on routine paid administrative leave pending a review of the incident by the Critical Incident Review Board.   ""This may be a little more distant connection, because we're up here in Bakersfield and they're down in San Bernardino,"" explained Frank Meyer, the president of the Kern Regional Center's board. ""But there's even the connection, we are human beings. We're human beings, and we're having lives taken for senseless reasons."" About 50 people gathered around Kern Regional Center while holding candles and signs with the shooting victim's name on them. Meyer also read aloud the names of all 14 victims. ""We need to have that opportunity to express grief, to encourage each other, to comfort each other. There is that part of our humanity that we need,"" said Meyer. Roxanne Sarabia does not work at the Kern Regional Center, but she also showed up to show support. ""I felt that I needed to be here,"" she said. Sarabia says that she is concerned by the seeming randomness of the San Bernardino terrorist attack since it seemed to come out of nowhere with no warning. ""I have many friends, many colleagues myself that work throughout the county, and this could happen to us. It could have been us,"" she said. Meyer also felt the same unease generated by the massing shooting. He admitted that the terrorist saddened him but he was not surprised when it happened. ""I wish I could say shock, but unfortunately this seems to be happening week after week,"" he said. According to the Dallas Morning News, there have been 353 massing shootings in America during 2015 alone. All in all, 462 people were killed and 1,312 were injured. A recent report also indicated that American authorities have arrested 51 members of ISIS in America in 2015, and many of the threats were out of California.   [Image via KBAK]"
http://www.jsonline.com/news/opinion/love-of-guns-driven-by-unfounded-fears-b99630146z1-361102161.html,"Three thousand, four hundred: Americans who died by terrorism since 2001. Three thousand, four hundred: Americans who died by household firearms since five weeks ago. What's wrong with this picture? Could it be the fact that the country seems more intent on demonizing people seeking refuge from violence than it does on admitting that the biggest problem is homegrown? I'm tired and heartbroken. It was a hard week last week. For the first time, death by gun is poised to surpass death by automobile as the leading cause for Americans under 25. By some metrics, the number of mass shootings has officially exceeded the number of days in the year — though by any metric, one is too many. There are too many people who see these awful events unfold and offer only empty words in response — the ""thoughts and prayers"" of our NRA-funded politicians come to mind. There are also too many people who look at shooting deaths and use them to justify a call for more guns. They believe that more armed citizens mean less crime and less death when the data shows the opposite. It's hard to argue with folks who refuse to acknowledge hard numbers. Why does that happen? What causes a person to so stubbornly cling to an idea of safety-by-gun even when study after study shows that lower rates of firearm ownership in a particular area do in fact correlate with lower incidents of gun death? More guns equals higher rates of homicide. See the proof. A good guy with a gun has not stopped any mass shooting in the past 30 years. Adding more bullets to often volatile situations is not a recipe for less mayhem. When I take a good, hard look at the prevailing rhetoric of many of our politicians and pundits, though, a theory starts to form. It's fear. Fear is driving people to take up arms against threats that only exist in their minds, planted there by people with a vested interest in keeping them afraid. How else to explain that white men are the most likely to own guns in this country? White, suburban or rural men from the South, the most likely of all. African-Americans are victims of homicide at twice the rate of white people, but own less than half as many guns. Why are white people stocking up at such higher rates than anyone else? Because they've been sold a lie by those who would most benefit from keeping them afraid and armed: that their lives are in danger from the mythical Other, in whatever form that most conveniently takes. So buy up those guns and ammo and line the pockets of the folks who spend their millions to strong-arm laws into place that keep common sense gun controls off the books and scientific research into gun-related violence unfunded and unpopular. I can already hear the cries of ""Second Amendment!"" No one seems to care about the ""well regulated militia"" part of that clause, or the fact that it was written during a time when the firepower available today was simply unimaginable. Also probably wouldn't do any good to point out to the ardent adherents that their beloved amendment was passed into law at a time when it was also legal to own other human beings. Things change, thank goodness. I'm not against legal gun ownership across the board. I support the tradition of responsible hunting. But you will never convince me that there is any good that can come from arming ourselves to the teeth in the name of some elusive sense of ""safety."" Australia had one mass shooting years ago, passed a gun ban in response and has not had an incident like that since. It's past time that we fight back against the fear mongering of groups such as the NRA that profit off our pain. Get rid of politicians who kowtow to the gun lobby at the expense of the actual safety and well-being of their constituents. Remove the gag order and fully fund the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention so that real, scientific research into this public health menace can happen. I can't live in a place that would let author Dan Hodges' theory come true when he mused that ""Sandy Hook marked the end of the U.S. gun control debate. Once America decided killing children was bearable, it was over."" Cast off fear. Beat your swords into plowshares. Enough. Emily Mills is a freelance writer who lives in Madison.

http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/12/white_house_denounces_trumps_muslim_ban_proposal.html,"TRENTON -- In a rare rebuke of an active presidential candidate, the White House spokesman said Tuesday that the controversial proposal from Republican front-runner Donald Trump to temporarily block all Muslims from entering the U.S. to prevent terrorism ""disqualifies"" him from being president. Josh Earnest, the press secretary for President Obama's administration, said during a news conference that Trump's comments are ""morally reprehensible,"" run ""counter to the Constitution,"" and ""absolutely"" damage national security. Earnest explained that every president must take an oath of office to ""preserve, protect and defend"" the U.S. Constitution. That, he added, makes Trump -- a billionaire businessman and former Atlantic City casino tycoon -- ineligible for the job. ""What he said is disqualifying,"" Earnest said of Trump, who leads the race for the 2016 Republican nomination in the national polls. ""And any Republican who's too fearful of the Republican base to admit it has no business serving as president, either."" On Monday, Trump proposed a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"" until the nation's leaders ""can figure out what is going on"" in the wake of the Paris attacks and California mass shooting. The plan, however, has drawn widespread criticism -- including from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, one of Trump's rivals for the Republican nod, who called it ""a ridiculous position and one that won't even be productive."" But Trump defended the plan in interviews Tuesday, saying it's a ""common sense"" idea that would be temporary. ""We have to get our hands around a very serious problem,"" he said. Despite the outcry from the real estate mogul's Republican opponents, Earnest called out all of the GOP's presidential contenders because they signed a pledge to support whoever wins the party's nomination in the end -- even if it's Trump. The spokesman also referred to Trump as a ""carnival barker"" with ""fake hair."" ""The Trump campaign for months now has had a 'dustbin of history'-like quality to it,"" Earnest said. ""From the vacuous sloganeering to the outright lies to even the fake hair, the whole carnival-barker routine that we've seen for some time now."" ""The question now is about the rest of the Republican Party and whether or not they're going to be dragged into the dustbin of history with him,"" he added. ""And right now, the trajectory is not very good."" Earnest said it would be more effective for U.S. authorities to ""work in partnership"" with the Muslim community to combat terrorism and that Trump's ""offensive bluster"" makes it ""much harder to build and solidify that relationship."" A spokesman for the Pentagon suggested to CNN on Tuesday that Trump's comments put the U.S. at risk. Republican Donald Trump speaks during a rally in Mt. Pleasant, S.C., on Monday night. Peter Cook said it's possible the remarks will boost the recruitment efforts of terrorist group the Islamic State -- also known as ISIS or ISIL. ""Anything that bolsters ISIL's narrative and pits the United States against the Muslim faith is certainly not only contrary to our values but contrary to our national security,"" Cook told the news network. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry -- who, like Obama, is a Democrat -- also called out Trump on Tuesday. ""I would simply say that nondiscrimination and equal treatment are a pillar of not just American values but of our immigration and our admission policies in this country, and the State Department remains totally committed to treating all religions with respect and without discrimination,"" Kerry said during a news conference in Paris. ""As I travel around the world,"" he added, ""it is clear to me and how both our friends and our adversaries watch and listen to the discourse in the U.S. And I believe that comments such as those that we just heard are not constructive. And I would say that is putting it diplomatically."" Meanwhile, Trump's proposal also drew condemnation abroad. British Prime Minister David Cameron called it ""divisive, unhelpful, and quite simply wrong."" French Prime Minister Manuel Valls called Trump out on Twitter, writing: ""Mr. Trump, like others, feeds the hatred and the confusion: our ONLY enemy is radical Islamism."" Monsieur Trump, comme d'autres, entretient la haine et les amalgames : notre SEUL ennemi, c'est l'islamisme radical. J.K. Rowling, author of the ""Harry Potter"" books, suggested Trump has surpassed the villain in her series. How horrible.

              since The Daily News is set to continue its recent streak of provocative front pages on Wednesday. According to a tweet from the New York tabloid, the newspaper will depict Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump cutting off the head of the Statue of Liberty. ""When Trump came for the Mexicans, I did not speak out — as I was not a Mexican. When he came for the Muslims I did not speak out — as I was not a Muslim. Then he came for me,"" the headline blared. In smaller text, the Daily News said the headline was based on Martin Niemöller's poem ""First They Came,"" which dealt with Nazi Germany's oppression of socialists, trade unionists, and, finally, Jews. Trump has faced intense backlash since Monday, when he proposed a temporary halt to all Muslim travel to the US, including immigrants and tourists. The real-estate mogul says a hard-line approach is necessary to keep the US safe from terrorist groups like ISIS. The Daily News ignited some of its own firestorms in recent days with its front-page crusading on behalf of gun control. One of its covers shamed Republican politicians for only offering ""prayers"" after last week's mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. A separate publication, the Philadelphia Daily News, also compared Trump's proposal to Nazi Germany on Tuesday. Here's Wednesday's New York Daily News cover below: For you For you"

              since The Republican presidential front-runner did this by touting a poll showing that his supporters would still back him if he ran as an independent. ""A new poll indicates that 68% of my supporters would vote for me if I departed the GOP & ran as an independent,"" Trump wrote on Twitter and Facebook. The implied threat comes as a wide swath of Republicans, state-party chairs, and others have criticized his new proposal to suspend all Muslim travel to the US, including immigrants and tourists. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin), Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky), 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, the chairs of the New Hampshire and South Carolina Republican parties, a number of GOP operatives, and most of the Republican presidential field have dismissed Trump's provocative plan. Trump announced the proposal Monday, in the aftermath of last week's mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, that was linked to the Islamic State terrorist group. He argued that ""hatred"" from even American Muslims justifies stopping additional Muslims from entering the US until ""our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on."" Trump first toyed with the idea of an independent presidential bid earlier this year, but amid intense pressure from national Republicans, he and the other candidates eventually signed a pledge to support the eventual GOP nominee. At the time, Trump said he was assured that the Republican National Committee would treat him ""fairly."" But the billionaire businessman again wouldn't rule out an independent bid last month, suggesting that a former RNC aide's threats to run an ad campaign against him could motivate him to reconsider the pledge. ""Well, we'll see what happens,"" Trump said during an ABC interview. ""It will be very interesting. But I'm leading every poll by a lot. It's not even a little bit anymore, it's a lot."" ABC's George Stephanopoulos pressed Trump to elaborate. ""Well, I'm going to have to see what happens,"" Trump repeated. ""I will see what happens. I have to be treated fairly. You know, when I did this, I said I have to be treated fairly. If I'm treated fairly, I'm fine."" Former Florida Gov.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gvh-live-/was-attack-on-planned-par_b_8719996.html,"Contributor By Siraj Hashmi Last week, Planned Parenthood was the target of a tragic mass shooting when 57-year-old Robert Lewis Dear killed three people and injured nine others. Dear walked into the Colorado Springs clinic on the day after Thanksgiving and opened fire on Planned Parenthood staff and patients who were there to receive care. Before being apprehended, Dear engaged in a standoff with police that involved a lengthy shootout. When in police custody, Dear reportedly hinted his motive for the shooting by saying, ""no more baby parts."" Dear, of course, is alluding to several controversial videos that were released by the Center for Medical Progress earlier this year in which a number of officials depicted as representing Planned Parenthood were secretly videotaped negotiating the sale of fetal organs and tissue. Many critics of the video believe the footage was heavily edited and is, therefore, misleading to the public. No matter where individuals fall on the issue of the validity of those videos, the ""anti-Planned Parenthood"" narrative has been played up well in the 2016 presidential race. During the second GOP Debate on CNN, Republican presidential candidate and former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina famously stated, ""I dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama to watch these tapes,"" she said on the stage at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library September 16th. ""Watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says, 'We have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.'"" That became one of the more memorable moments from the debate by Fiorina and has resonated with the Pro-Life movement as well as Congressional Republicans who have been seeking to defund Planned Parenthood over its use of taxpayer dollars to perform abortions. The House Oversight and Government Reform committee held a hearing in late September to investigate Planned Parenthood's practices by having Cecile Richards president of Planned Parenthood, testify before the committee. Richards' testimony was seen as necessary by Republicans and conservatives, but viewed as a ""partisan witch hunt"" by Democrats and liberals. However, with the shooting of the Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado, many are starting to wonder whether the political rhetoric coming from the Right was, if not, what instigated the mass shooting, but a contributing factor to it. Representative Brenda Lawrence (D-Michigan, 14th) believes the shooting was not only politically motivated, but that the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security should get involved in the investigation, saying to GVH Live, ""I believe this was a terrorist act. This should be investigated. He should be tried accordingly. We must stop this in America. It's not acceptable."" Yet, with authorities stating that Dear was acting ""erratically"" while in custody and the fact that he was not involved in the Pro-Life movement, many are starting to believe that Dear has been suffering from a mental disorder, and therefore couldn't be carrying out a politically motivated terrorist attack. Despite how this matter is investigated, Congress is preparing to decide what to do about how the federal government will be funded next year and whether or not to fund Planned Parenthood. If Congressional Republicans and Democrats can't negotiate and pass a massive omnibus spending bill by December 11th, they could risk another government shutdown.

http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2015/dec/09/city-s-assault-style-gun-ban-holds-2015/,"WASHINGTON -- Acting in the aftermath of the San Bernardino, Calif., mass shooting, the Supreme Court on Monday rejected an appeal from gun owners who challenged a Chicago suburb's ban on assault-style weapons. Two conservative justices said they would have heard the case and struck down the ban. The Illinois State Rifle Association, one of the plaintiffs, indicated it would keep challenging local gun restrictions. The court, though, left in place a lower court ruling that found that local governments have leeway in deciding how to regulate firearms. The federal appeals court in Chicago had upheld the city of Highland Park's 2013 law that bans military-style semi-automatic weapons and large-capacity magazines. In October, the federal appeals court in New York largely upheld similar laws in Connecticut and New York, among a handful of states that ban such weapons. The Supreme Court has repeatedly turned away challenges to gun restrictions since two landmark decisions that spelled out the right to a handgun to defend one's own home. Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Antonin Scalia, said the Chicago appeals court ruling ""flouts two of our Second Amendment precedents."" Without mentioning any mass shootings in California and elsewhere that involved semi-automatic guns, Thomas said the weapons ban ""is highly suspect because it broadly prohibits common semi-automatic firearms used for lawful purposes"" by roughly 5 million Americans. ""The overwhelming majority of citizens who own and use such rifles do so for lawful purposes, including self-defense and target shooting,"" Thomas wrote. The case had been under consideration at the high court for two months, but the delay in dealing with it now appears mainly due to waiting for Thomas to finish his opinion. The appeal filed by Dr. Arie Friedman and the Illinois State Rifle Association argues that Highland Park has violated their constitutional rights by banning some of the most popular semi-automatic guns in the United States, as well as ammunition magazines of more than 10 rounds. Steven Elrod, an attorney for the city of Highland Park, said the court's decision didn't surprise him. ""When we drafted the ordinance in the first place, we did it in a way that fell within the teachings of prior United States Supreme Court decisions,"" he said. Richard Pearson, the director of the Illinois State Rifle Association, was disappointed that the Supreme Court did not hear the case, but he said his organization is still waiting for the conclusion of a state-court case challenging a similar ban in Illinois' largest county, Cook County. He said the group will also keep looking for new plaintiffs in areas that have enacted prohibitions on assault-style weapons. ""We are not going to give up and we're not going to go away,"" Pearson said. Even though lower courts have mainly upheld gun restrictions, the Highland Park case arises out of a decision by the the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago that struck down the only statewide ban on carrying concealed weapons, in Illinois. In 2013, when state lawmakers reacted to the court ruling by making it legal to carry a gun, they gave cities in Illinois 10 days to come up with local restrictions on assault-style weapons, or forfeit their right to do so. Highland Park was one of fewer than 20 municipalities, all in the Chicago area, to enact regulations or bans, according to the rifle association. The city's assault-style weapons ban was upheld by the appeals court in a 2-1 decision. The Highland Park ordinance lists specific weapons features that are prohibited, such as weapons that can hold more than 10 rounds in a magazine. It also bans semi-automatics equipped with a folding, telescoping or thumbhole stock and that have a shroud attached to the barrel; a muzzle brake or muzzle compensator; a protruding pistol grip; or a pistol grip with a stock attached. Judge Frank Easterbrook wrote for the court that there is a ""substantial benefit"" to the Highland Park ordinance if it makes the public feel less at risk from a mass shooting. Variations of the Bushmaster AR-15, one of the rifles specifically banned by Highland Park, were used in the Newtown, Conn., school massacre and the theater shootings in Aurora, Colo. Highland Park Police Chief Paul Shafer said his department has confiscated weapons under the ban three times, and in all three cases police discovered the guns while responding to unrelated actions involving the guns' owners. The gun-control laws that the appeals court in New York upheld in October were passed after the 2012 massacre in Newtown. Seven states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws banning assault-style weapons. The others are California, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts and New Jersey, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/09/petition-calling-for-donald-trump-to-be-banned-from-uk-signed-by-85000,"Petition calling for US presidential candidate to be denied entry to UK on grounds of hate speech racks up nearly 360,000 signatures in 24 hours. First published on Wed 9 Dec 2015 11.24 GMT The government has signalled it will not refuse the US presidential candidate Donald Trump entry to Britain following his controversial comments about Muslims, despite a petition calling for a ban gathering more than 360,000 signatures in just over 24 hours. At the height of its popularity on Wednesday afternoon, the petition, which calls for Trump to be stopped from entering Britain on the grounds of hate speech, was racking up more than 30,000 signatures an hour, according to parliament’s petitions website.  Parliament considers all petitions that receive more than 100,000 signatures for a debate. The petition to ban Trump, which became open for signatures at 4.39pm Tuesday, had been signed by 360,0090 people by midnight on Wednesday. It says: “The signatories believe Donald J Trump should be banned from UK entry. The UK has banned entry to many individuals for hate speech. The same principles should apply to everyone who wishes to enter the UK. “If the United Kingdom is to continue applying the ‘unacceptable behaviour’ criteria to those who wish to enter its borders, it must be fairly applied to the rich as well as poor, and the weak as well as powerful.” The petition comes after Trump was widely criticised for saying on Monday that Muslims should be banned from entering the US. He said in a speech following a mass shooting committed by a Muslim couple in San Bernardino, California, last weekend: “We need a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States while we figure out what the hell is going on. We are out of control.” On Tuesday, there was widespread condemnation of Trump’s comments, including from fellow Republican presidential contenders. And later comments from the presidential hopeful in a radio interview that there were districts of London and Paris so “radicalised” that they were off limits to police led to further angry rebuttals from UK politicians and the police. The London Metropolitan police said Trump “could not be more wrong”, while the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: “London has a proud history of tolerance and diversity and to suggest there are areas where police officers cannot go because of radicalisation is simply ridiculous.” The UK chancellor, George Osborne, said on Wednesday it was best to combat Donald Trump through robust democratic debate and not to try to ban him from the UK on the grounds that his remarks incited racial hatred. Speaking at prime minister’s questions, Osborne said Trump’s views “flew in the face of the founding principles of the American founding fathers”, adding that those principles had been an inspiration all round the world. He continued: “The best way to defeat nonsense like this is to engage in robust and democratic debate, and to make it clear his views are not welcome.” Osborne’s aides said the previous occasions when foreigners had been banned from the UK reflected moments when individuals had been repeatedly convicted of race hate crimes, and this did not apply to Trump. A Downing Street spokesman said there were no known plans for Trump to visit the UK, so suggestions of a ban from Britain were hypothetical. He added the remarks should be seen in the context of an internal Republican election campaign. Jon Trickett, the shadow communities secretary, praised Osborne’s remarks as clear and straightforward. He said it was “entirely inappropriate to suggest every follower of one of the world’s great religions has to be suspected of terrorism”. He added it was “wrong, divisive, dangerous and may speed up the radicalisation of individuals”. Although he said it was interesting that so many people had called for a ban, Trickett said he preferred staging a debate, rather than imposing travel bans. The home secretary can decide to exclude a person from the UK if it is believed that an “individual’s presence in the UK would not be conducive to the public good”, according to government guidance. In effect, that usually means people seen to be preaching hate or inciting extremism. However, individuals can also be blocked on the grounds of their criminal records. People previously banned from Britain include Mike Tyson, over his rape conviction, Dieudonné M’bala M’bala, the controversial French comedian accused of antisemitism, and Stephen Donald Black, founder of the white-supremacist website Stormfront. The Home Office said it did not comment in individual cases. Meanwhile, Nicola Sturgeon has moved to sever all Scottish government business links with Donald Trump. The first minister withdrew Trump’s membership of the GlobalScot business network, run by Scottish Enterprise, with immediate effect. A Scottish government spokesperson said: “Mr Trump’s recent remarks have shown that he is no longer fit to be a business ambassador for Scotland and the first minister has decided his membership of the respected GlobalScot business network should be withdrawn with immediate effect.” Sturgeon described Trump’s comments as “obnoxious and offensive”, and “rightly … condemned by people across the political spectrum”. Trump was invited to join the GlobalScot network, which describes itself as a “diverse network of business leaders, entrepreneurs and executives with a connection to Scotland”, in 2006. Meanwhile, more than 10,000 people have so far signed a petition calling for Aberdeen’s Robert Gordon University (RGU) to revoke the honorary degree awarded to Trump in 2010 in recognition of his “business acumen and entrepreneurial vision”. The decision was controversial at the time, with a former RGU principal handing back his own honorary doctorate in protest. A RGU spokeswoman said the current principal, Ferdinand von Prondzynski, was “considering the position”, adding: “Professor von Prondzynski is totally committed to equality of opportunity and to respect for different cultures, values which are an important part of RGU’s ethos.”"

Despite increasingly tense exchanges with Republican presidential rival Donald Trump, Christie said during his radio show that the billionaire businessman is still on his Christmas card list. Meanwhile, Star-Ledger columnist Tom Moran writes that Christie vs. Trump is a steel cage match that might kill both. Trump defended his controversial call to ban Muslims from entering the U.S., even as it drew more fire. Meanwhile, the White House said the proposal ""disqualifies"" Trump from being president. Here are the top 20 reactions to Trump's proposal from Monday. The Star-Ledger's editorial board writes that Trump's ""open bigotry"" is a challenge to mainstream Republicans. And here is a tale of two GOP polls in Iowa. Star-Ledger columnist Paul Muslhine writes that gun-rights advocates say Christie is ""shooting blanks"" on the Second Amendment. * The state Senate have final legislative approval to a bill that would create a training program for anyone in New Jersey willing to administer EpiPens to help people suffering a life-threatening allergic reaction. * A bill that would remove clashing legal restraints controlling the use of the former Showboat casino took another step forward this week, winning approval from the state Senate. * Commuters will see more law enforcement officers from New Jersey and New York in regional transit hubs under an agreement renewed by Christie and New York Gov.

http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2015/12/was_trenton_shooting_that_wounded_4_a_mass_shootin.html,"Scene of Wood Street shooting in Trenton. Four shot. Police at the scene of a shooting on Wood Street in Trenton April 25, 2015 that wounded four people. (Rich Cuccagna | For NJ.com) TRENTON -- In the days after the San Bernardino shooting in California last week, news organizations' reports varied on how often the country suffers from a ""mass shooting."" The definitions ranged from four or more people killed, to four our more people wounded, and were culled from databases that were not official, some just tracked from media accounts, like shootingtracker.com and gunviolencearchive.org Using databases that tallied four or more people wounded in an incident, newspapers like the New York Times and Washington Post reported the country had seen 355 mass shootings as of  Dec. 2 - more than one per day. Landing on the list was Trenton, and the ""mass shooting"" the city had on April 25, when a gunman opened fire on Wood Street and wounded four people, none fatally. The Trenton shooting making a ""mass shooting"" list garnered some discussion on social media among incredulous Trenton police officers this past weekend. NJ Advance Media wrote just four paragraphs about the shooting on the same Saturday it occurred. None of the victims were named. ""There's no comparison,"" Trenton Police Director Ernest Parrey Jr. said this week of the Trenton incident versus San Bernardino. ""You're talking about an incident in which 14 people lost their lives and with mass casualties,"" the director said. ""It's unfortunate that we even had that event in April, but San Bernardino was a clearly defined incident with an underlying motive with things like religious beliefs,"" Parrey said. The April shooting, police Detective Sgt. Carmelo Rodriguez said Tuesday, appears to be an incident where one person was targeted and three others were caught in the gunfire. The motive is believed to be a beef over neighborhood cliques, Rodriguez said. Rodriguez, who leads the city's joint Shooting Response Team, said however databases label the incident, his team's main concern is solving it, and it's still under active investigation. ""We have developed two possible suspects, but not enough probable cause to charge,"" Rodriguez said. Trenton police do not typically name victims who survive shootings. Police said in April that one person was shot in the torso, two suffered leg wounds and the fourth was grazed by a bullet during the 6 p.m. crime that evening.

http://www.ibtimes.com/san-bernardino-massacre-means-brisk-business-shooting-ranges-2216903,"In the days and weeks before Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik stormed a holiday party with semi-automatic rifles and killed 14 of Farook’s work colleagues in San Bernardino, California, the couple took part in a beloved American tradition: blasting targets at a shooting range. But the revelation isn’t likely to dent the shooting range business, as the same citizens motivated to buy guns in the wake of the tragedy head to the ranges to practice firing them. “We’re definitely seeing an increase in gun sales as well as training,” said Debbie Block, owner of Reno Guns & Range in Nevada, which sells firearms and merchandise in addition to maintaining an indoor shooting range and providing instructional classes. “There’s a much bigger interest in personal protection,” Block said, citing growing attendance at courses in concealed-carry and home defense. “Our classes are filling up.” 'People Don’t Want To Be Victims Anymore' Every mass shooting puts a harsh spotlight on the gun industry. But the Dec. 2 massacre in San Bernardino has brought attention to shooting ranges as well. Wherever there are guns, there are ranges. As many as 18,000 facilities dot the 50 states, according to estimates from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The business brings in $1.3 billion in annual revenue, according to market research company IBISWorld, and it's poised for growth of roughly 2 percent in coming years as a broader swath of Americans pick up guns and learn to use them. Firearms sales have pushed higher in recent years, bolstered by fears of tighter gun-buying restrictions in the wake of gun-related tragedies such as the Aurora, Colorado, movie theater massacre in July 2012, and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012. Every bump in gun sales means a boon for gun ranges. “Any time [President Barack] Obama opens his mouth you see more sales,” said Jeff Posuniak, who manages a large shooting range and gun shop in Michigan. Posuniak sees a combination of factors explaining growing gun sales and range use. Recent events, he said, have driven even more Americans to arm themselves. “People are sick of what’s been going on, and people don’t want to be victims anymore,” Posuniak said, citing not just robberies and assaults, but also terror incidents. “It’s sad and unfortunate, but you know, it’s happened too many times on our soil.” Suspicious Activity No one raised any alarms at Riverside Magnum Range over the husband-and-wife team who eventually carried out the San Bernardino attacks. “How are you able to determine what somebody's intents are?” instructor John Galletta told ABC News. Tashfeen Malik and Syed Farook pass through Chicago's O'Hare International Airport in this July 27, 2014, photo. Photo: Reuters Depending on which state you live in, buying a gun can entail waiting periods, background checks or mental health evaluations. But if you want just to rent a Luger and mow down some targets at the range, few laws will get in your way. That means felons convicted of violent crimes can practice shooting without any impediment, save for the better judgment of shooting range attendants. Absent federal standards, those judgments can run the gamut. Block said Reno Guns & Range works closely with law enforcement and requires shooting range customers to show identification. “It’s prudent for a business in our line to be actively watching for issues,” she said. “But I don’t know if others do.” National scrutiny fell on the shooting range industry last year, when a 9-year-old girl handling an Uzi lost control of the automatic weapon and fatally shot her instructor in the head. Some were shocked to learn that the shooting range, the Last Stop, was acting within the law with its policy of allowing children aged 8 and up to fire submachine guns. The variability in range policies underscores the relatively fragmented nature of the industry. Unlike firearms manufacturers, where three companies together produce more than 40 percent of weapons for personal use, no single company accounts for more than 1 percent of the shooting range industry’s revenue. In some states, gun laws regulate how many shooting ranges can operate per 100,000 residents. Other states, such as Kentucky and Florida, have few restrictions on how many ranges can operate. Often, gun shops run their own indoor or outdoor ranges, giving customers a chance to test their wares. “People want to try something out before you buy,” said Jack Donald, who works behind the counter at Maryland Small Arms Range. “Do I want to buy a Glock, do I want to buy a Smith & Wesson?’ You can go out there and shoot them,” he said."

http://rssfeeds.cincinnati.com/~/127397055/0/cincinnati-home~FBI-director-Calif-killers-radicalized-before-meeting/,"WASHINGTON — FBI Director James Comey told a Senate panel Wednesday that the killers responsible for last week's California massacre were individually radicalized before they ever met online and discussed jihad more than two years before the deadly assault that left 14 dead and 21 wounded. Comey's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee offers the fullest timeline yet for the radicalization of Sayed Farook and wife Tashfeen Malik and appears to undercut an earlier theory that the Pakistani-born Malik may have converted her husband to an extremist ideology, leading to the assault. Comey said Malik appears to have discussed jihad and martyrdom before she was granted a so-called fiancée visa in 2014 to enter the USA, where she later married Farook. Those early communications, Comey said, indicate the shooters were ""at least in part'' inspired by the Islamic State terror group, also known as ISIL or ISIS. Because the earliest discussions of jihad in 2013 appeared to come before the Islamic State's emergence as a global threat, Comey said investigators were reviewing other sources of similar radical thought that may have inspired the couple. Asked by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., whether the marriage of the two with similar extremist interests may have been arranged to allow the couple to develop an attack in the USA, Comey said investigators do not know. ""It would be a very important thing to know,'' he said. He said there was no reason to believe that ""cells'' of operatives linked to the Islamic State were embedded in the USA, planning to strike. Largely based on the arsenal of ammunition and bomb components found in a search of the couple's Redlands, Calif., home, Comey said authorities  continued to try to determine whether they had identified other possible targets. The FBI director said the San Bernardino assaults represented another ""dimension'' of the terrorist threat, one distinct from last month's attack in Paris, which left 130 dead. In that case, teams of heavily armed killers attacked a series of targets, including a sports stadium and a crowded concert hall where most of the fatalities were inflicted. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for those attacks. He described the San Bernardino killers as violent extremists who prepared themselves below the radar of local and federal authorities while pursuing seemingly normal lives, only to strike out on their own. Investigators continued to question a Riverside, Calif., man and former neighbor of Farook who purchased the two semiautomatic rifles used in the attack, a federal law enforcement official said. The former neighbor, Enrique Marquez,  provided authorities information to establish a firmer history of Farook's embrace of radical beliefs and the gunman's apparent interest in striking an undisclosed target years earlier, said the official who is not authorized to comment publicly on the developing investigation. ""Finding these (suspects before their plots are carried out) is a very, very hard thing,'' Comey said. In October, Comey said the FBI had about 900 active investigations involving Islamic State sympathizers or other violent extremists across the USA. He said Wednesday that those inquiries remained open in every FBI field division in the country. USA TODAY Comey: Feds have roughly 900 domestic probes about Islamic State operatives, other extremists The new timeline for the San Bernardino couple's radicalization immediately prompted questions from  lawmakers, including Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who asked the director why Malik's references to jihad and martyrdom were not detected by authorities or explored as part of a vetting process before she was granted the U.S. visa. Though he declined to comment directly on that part of the investigation, Comey suggested  the couple's communications were private and not accessible on public forums that could be monitored by authorities. USA TODAY Feds examining bank deposit linked to San Bernardino shooter In Wednesday's wide-ranging Senate hearing, Graham,  a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, sought to draw Comey into the heated debate over GOP front-runner Donald Trump's call for banning Muslims from entering the USA. Graham asked whether the remarks represented a possible national security threat. Comey said that although he would not wade into the political discussion, he said ""estrangement gets in the way"" of protecting the nation. Follow @bykevinj on Twitter"
http://www.ibtimes.com/gun-control-rhetoric-rises-shooting-range-patrons-worry-about-losing-rights-their-fun-2218148,"CENTENNIAL, Colorado -- Marc Rabinoff lines up the paper target in the sites of his Wilson Combat 9 mm handgun and squeezes the trigger. “I love doing this,” he says as the shot echoes around the shooting range. “It’s a great feeling when you hit that target. It’s an accomplishment.” Rabinoff is engaged in target practice in one of eight V.I.P. lanes at Centennial Gun Club. At 35,000 square feet, the $10 million, 2-year-old facility is Colorado’s largest shooting range and among the biggest in the country. It offers the sort of upscale amenities that have led some to label it a ""guntry club."" Patrons can rent a sleek boardroom for corporate gatherings. The 5,000-square-foot gun shop offers “Gun Tote’n Mamas” concealed carry purses and other items marketed to women, who make up 35 percent of the operation’s clientele. And Rabinoff pays a hefty membership fee to frequent the Statesman’s Lounge, an exclusive section of the range -- accessible via a retina scan -- where professional athletes and other luminaries enjoy private lockers, a cigar bar, a pool table and a private shooting range. The Centennial Gun Club in Colorado. Photo: Joel Warner/International Business Times Lately, business at Centennial Gun Club has been booming, as it has at other shooting ranges nationwide. Ever since the terrorist attacks in Paris last month, the gun club has been welcoming roughly a thousand people a day on the weekends and 600 daily during the week. That amounts to 30 percent more traffic than usual. And this week, CEO Richard Abramson says he’s received three calls from local corporations that are interested in security training classes. “I’ve never had those calls before,” says Abramson. “I think we are seeing a lot of people buying guns out of fear.” Never mind that Colorado is still reeling from a shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs late last month. The incident left nine people wounded and three dead. The state was already known for two of the country’s worst gun massacres: the 1999 Columbine High School shooting and the 2012 Aurora movie theater shooting. Never mind that over the past few days President Obama and a front-page New York Times editorial suggested the answer to such bloodshed was less civilian access to firearms, not more. And never mind reports that the San Bernardino attackers frequented shooting ranges, which suggests that some of these operations could be used to train potential mass killers. As in the rest of the country, where gun sales have reached record highs, more people than ever in Colorado are embracing the world of firearms. And in places like Centennial Gun Club, they’re finding that guns offer not just protection but also escape, empowerment and, above all, personal enjoyment. The situation hints at the difficulties ahead for those who aim to restrict gun ownership in a nation of approximately 100 million gun owners: How do you implement gun control when you’re not just talking about taking away attack weapons but also an integral part of many people's lives? Zen of Shooting Rabinoff first picked up a firearm three years ago, after a lifetime of being afraid of guns. One of his sons was enrolled at Columbine Middle School during the 1999 mass shooting, and his other son nearly attended the 2012 “Dark Knight Rises” midnight movie screening where James Holmes killed 12 people. They encouraged their father to look into defending himself. Little did they know just how thoroughly Rabinoff, a retired sports and human performance professor and self-described “liberal Democratic New York Jewish kid” would become enmeshed in gun culture. Now, he shoots at the Statesman’s Lounge several times a week, has taken nearly all of the Centennial Gun Club’s many training courses and is armed with his Wilson Combat 9mm, with a bullet in the chamber, wherever he goes. His wife, Diana, has become a gun aficionado too; she has a pink camouflage AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, and they both compete in a variety of shooting matches each month. “This is what we wanted to do with our retirement,” says Rabinoff with an accent that hints at his years growing up in the Bronx. “Other people take trips around the world. We shoot guns.” Shooting is something they can enjoy together and with like-minded friends, like playing tennis without having to worry about the weather or skiing without bothering with long winter drives into the mountains. But it’s also the ultimate calming activity, they say. All their minor troubles melt away when they’re looking down the sites of a locked-and-loaded weapon. “When I come here, I have to concentrate,” says Rabinoff. “You are not allowed to be distracted.” The Centennial Gun Club's Statesman's Lounge Photo: Joel Warner/International Business Times Finally, in a world where technology has made nearly everything easy and convenient, there’s something galvanizing for them, something intoxicating, about the ultimate responsibility that still comes with properly handling a firearm. “You take the gun out of its holster, you point the muzzle and you pull the trigger – it is 150 percent you,” says Rabinoff. If you don’t know how to use a gun, it’s a pretty dangerous tool. If you know how to use a gun, it’s a great tool.” Knowing that they’re armed and properly trained in something so formidable and deadly when they go shopping or out to dinner is a potent feeling. “I feel empowered when I walk through the mall,” says Diana. “It’s just addictive, that’s what it is.” These aren’t the only reasons people fill Centennial Gun Club’s 28 firing lanes day after day, honing their skills far beyond simple practical purpose. Some are drawn to the historical aspects of gun culture, including Bart Miller, the range’s head gunsmith, who’s quick to show off his prized 400-year-old Japanese matchlock musket, his oiled, calloused hands tracing its intricate etchings of bounding rabbits and samurai helmets. Others come for the social opportunities, like those who flock to the ladies night gatherings that draw 100 women a month. And still others come with a sense of responsibility, a belief that the Second Amendment isn’t just a privilege, but a duty. It’s why 500 people have recently been attending a church security training course at the range. Gunsmith Bart Miller shows off his Japanese matchlock musket. Photo: Joel Warner/International Business Times Since the San Bernadino shooting last week, however, the Centennial Gun Club’s management has been concerned about another potential reason for folks visiting the range: practicing for nefarious purposes. “It’s absolutely a concern,” says CEO Abramson, a soft-spoken, genial fellow. He notes that according to the U.S. State Department, visitors from certain countries aren’t allowed to visit shooting ranges, and his operation collects identification from everyone who shoots there. Still, he says, “I am talking to our local sheriff about what additional screening can be done. We don’t have a good answer right now, but we are certainly looking into it to see what options there are.” Bridging the Divide For people like Rabinoff and his wife, it’s not just that gun control advocates want to restrict their access to firearms, it’s also that these outsiders don’t know the first thing about the gun culture they’re so concerned about – nor do they attempt to learn about it. Rabinoff bristles when folks confuse gun clips and magazines, mistakenly call an AR-15 an assault weapon, and act like having a thousand rounds of ammunition in your house is unhealthy. (Rabinoff and his wife easily burn through that much in a typical month of competitive shooting.) He hates that people like Michael Bloomberg and Oprah Winfrey say he shouldn’t be able to defend himself, when they’re protected by a phalanx of armed security. And he’s frustrated by gun violence measures that position gun owners like himself as a liability rather than a resource. That includes the creation of gun-free zones that he thinks do nothing other than make such locations “soft targets,” as he puts it, for violent extremists. While he shoots for the fun of it, the polarization of the gun debate has impacted Rabinoff’s personal politics. He won’t vote for Obama, Hilary Clinton or anyone else who’ll “take away our right under the Second Amendment of the Constitution to protect ourselves.” And while he doesn’t agree with every position espoused by the National Rifle Association, he’s now a card-carrying NRA member because “they’re the only ones doing the work in Congress to keep my rights.” Centennial Gun Club CEO Richard Abramson is looking into additional screening procedures for his Colorado shooting range. Photo: Joel Warner/International Business Times And while he believes proper firearms education is of utmost importance – he’s offered to pay for people’s training classes when he heard they purchased a gun without learning how to properly use it – his frustration with the government’s handling of gun issues has reached the point where he’s against federally mandated firearm training. “I don’t trust the government to come up with how much training you have to have,” he says. Bridging the divide, culturally and politically, between pro- and anti-gun advocates might therefore seem impossible. But Rabinoff is at least willing to give it a shot. It’s why he’s happy to open up about his newfound love of guns to anyone who will listen. It’s why he’s more than happy to bring guests into the exclusive confines of Statesman’s Lounge and let them take a few shots with his $4,000 handgun, letting them feel for themselves the difference between firing one of his preferred polymer-coated bullets and the standard full metal jacket variety. As the casings fly and the smell of gunpowder fills the air, Rabinoff grins infectiously. “You gotta admit this is fun,” he says. If folks on the other side of the gun debate are willing to admit that, maybe there are other things they can all agree on, too."
http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/127382309/0/alternet~Fox-News-Tells-Young-Children-to-Run-at-Active-Shooters,"A Fox & Friends demonstration where children neutralized a gunman during an active shooter situation offered dubious advice to parents, as experts emphasize that confronting the gunman should be ""a last resort."" The Fox News segment never explained that in an active shooter situation people should prioritize escaping and hiding over physically confronting the gunman -- only mentioning the first two actions in passing -- and instead emphasized engaging the gunman in a physical confrontation. The December 8 broadcast of Fox & Friends featured two krav maga instructors and three children who demonstrated martial arts techniques that could be used to disarm an active shooter. Co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck introduced the segment saying, ""In an active shooter situation five seconds can mean the difference between life and death. But there are some things that you can do, and your children can do, to make a difference"" before asking the instructor to ""display for us and exemplify what would happen in an armed shooter situation."" The instructor then used a stapler as a prop while his co-instructor demonstrated how to disarm a gunman from behind.  Attempting to evacuate or hide only came up in passing when Hasselbeck asked the instructor what to do if you find yourself in an active shooter situation with alongside another potential victim. The instructor said, ""Once we're hiding, let's say we couldn't run away, and we hide and then we've realized that we might be discovered, we have to basically communicate with each other and say, 'Listen, this is what is going to happen, if I grab the gun, you guys are going to tackle the person.'"" The comment didn't clearly explain that these steps should be taken first -- whether if you are alone or with someone else -- and the segment then moved on to another demonstration of disarming a gunman. An on-screen chyron described Fox & Friends' flawed discussion about what steps should be taken during an active shooter situation as, ""Safety First"": [[{""type"":""media"",""view_mode"":""media_original"",""fid"":""605641"",""attributes"":{""alt"":"""",""class"":""media-image"",""height"":""423"",""style"":""width: 600px; height: 338px;"",""typeof"":""foaf:Image"",""width"":""751""}}]] The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has specific guidelines on how to act when one's life is threatened in a shooting situation. The first objective is to evacuate, and if you cannot evacuate, objective two is to find a hiding place: ""If evacuation is not possible, find a place to hide where the active shooter is less likely to find you."" DHS recommends that people take action against an active shooter only ""as a last resort"" and when your life is in imminent danger. From the DHS manual: [[{""type"":""media"",""view_mode"":""media_original"",""fid"":""605642"",""attributes"":{""alt"":"""",""class"":""media-image"",""height"":""911"",""style"":""width: 600px; height: 763px;"",""typeof"":""foaf:Image"",""width"":""716""}}]] Following the December 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, then Newsweek correspondent Megan McArdle was criticized for advising people in an active shooter situation to ""gang rush"" the gunman as a first, rather than last, resort.

http://hotair.com/archives/2015/12/09/florida-sheriffs-advice-be-ready-and-be-armed/,"After two mass shootings in two weeks, the response from government officials has mainly been that we need to strip law-abiding citizens of their ability to defend themselves. Not so Sheriff Wayne Ivey of Brevard County, Florida, who says, “It’s time for America to get back to being America.” Ivey tells those licensed to carry firearms that they have a duty to protect themselves and others. “You and you alone may very well be the first line of defense for you, your family, and others around you in a terrorist or active-shooter-based scenario.” He has a few things to say about political correctness from politicians, too (via Fox Insider): “The best law enforcement agencies in the country have response times in minutes, and a violent criminal can take your life in seconds,” Ivey said, echoing his video address. “It’s a known fact the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. “So, we’re looking for our citizens to either have the ability to eliminate the threat or at the very least stall it until the cavalry can arrive.” In case readers wonder about Brevard County, it sits on Florida’s Atlantic coast and hits the midway point between south and north. Sometimes called “Space Coast,” Brevard is the home of the John F. Kennedy Space Center. While not technically part of the I-4 Corridor geographically, it’s close enough politically to matter. As might be expected with a sheriff as outspoken as Ivey, Brevard is a fairly conservative and Republican county, with an R+9 registration advantage and an unbroken record for at least 20 years of supporting the GOP in presidential and gubernatorial races. Romney beat Obama by almost 13 points in Brevard. Ivey makes a lot of good points in the video, especially his admission that police response is necessarily limited even with the best of intentions and circumstances, but he should have gone on in more length about the difference between defense and vigilantism. For people who see concealed or open carry permits as frightening and an endorsement of “frontier justice,” a detailed explanation from law enforcement leaders would be at least helpful in dispelling these myths. More than most citizens, carry permit holders know the limits of self-defense under the law, because they have to know it to pass their exams in states which require training. If anything, carry-permit training is a cold slap in the face about just what people can expect if they ever have to use their weapon to defend themselves or others — interrogations, second-guessing, and a not-insubstantial chance of prosecution. Regardless, it’s good to see Ivey offer some straight talk about the reality of self-defense in these situations. He joins a few others, including the chief of police in Washington DC, in recognizing that the only way to stop these incidents before they play all the way out is to have someone armed to put an end to them. Too bad that Chief Cathy Lanier has only approved 48 permits all year: Despite her call on Sunday night for civilians to “take the gunman down” in a mass shooting scenario, Washington DC’s chief of police has approved just 48 concealed carry licenses in the past year and nearly 80 percent of all applicants have been rejected. Of 233 applications sent for review since the Metropolitan Police Department began accepting permits on Oct. 23, 2014, 185 licenses had been denied as of Nov. 14, a department spokesperson told FoxNews.com on Monday. That low approval rate is seemingly at odds with remarks Chief of Police Cathy Lanier made on Sunday night’s episode of “60 Minutes.” “If you’re in a position to try and take the gunman down, to take the gunman out, it’s the best option for saving lives before police can get there,” Lanier said. “And that’s – you know, that’s kind of counterintuitive to what cops always tell people, right? We always tell people, ‘Don’t, you know, don’t take action. Call 911. Don’t intervene in the robbery.’ We’ve never told people, ‘Take action.’ It’s a different – this is a different scenario.” Law enforcement is beginning to catch up with law-abiding citizens on this issue — but obviously, some have a long way to go.

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/2Q22-g0V-6Y/,"Guns rights groups are planning to stage a fake mass shooting at the University of Texas at Austin in an attempt to end gun-free zones at the university. The event will begin with an open-carry walk with real guns, to be followed by a mock mass shooting using cardboard guns and fake blood, the Austin American-Statesman reports. The groups, Come and Take It Texas and DontComply.com, argue that this will demonstrate the need for armed good samaritans who can take down attackers before police can arrive on the scene. While loaded weapons are currently prohibited on campus, a new Texas law will go into effect in August allowing concealed weapons to be carried in all but certain restricted places on campuses. These groups want to make sure there are as few gun-free zones as possible. “We want criminals to fear the public being armed,” spokesperson Matthew Short told the Statesman. “An armed society is a polite society.” When asked by the paper if he was concerned that the event would be found in poor taste after recent mass shootings in Paris and San Bernardino, Short said no. “Not at all,” the spokesperson replied. “People were able to be murdered people because no one was armed.” [Austin American-Statesman] Contact us at letters@time.com."

http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/09/shooting-survivors-gun-control-sandy-hook-everytown-video,"Gun control group Everytown releases video ahead of the third anniversary of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.18 BST Julianne Moore and Amy Schumer joined activists and shooting survivors to rally for gun control on Wednesday, ahead of nationwide vigils to remember the victims of more than 1,000 mass shootings in three years. Ahead of the third anniversary of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, gun control group Everytown has released a video of actors and activists declaring “we can end gun violence”.  The video also features actors Laura Dern and Kevin Bacon, comedians Nick Offerman and Sarah Silverman, and victims of gun violence and their families. The group also released a report touting the progress made on gun control in 2015, although the US has experienced more mass shootings than days so far this year, according to the crowdsourced site Shooting Tracker. The site defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people were shot. The self-published report card finds good news for gun control advocates on the state level despite grim national headlines, most recently regarding an attack in San Bernardino, California, last week in which shooters killed 14 people with legally purchased weapons. Everytown praises state lawmakers in nine states for new laws that prohibit people convicted of domestic abuse from buying or possessing firearms, as well as three governors who vetoed NRA legislation. In New Hampshire, Governor Maggie Hassan vetoed a bill that would have allowed concealed handguns without a license, earning her the gun lobby’s ire. Montana governor Steve Bullock and West Virginia governor Earl Tomblin vetoed similar bills, citing concerns brought by police. Everytown also claimed credit for defeating dozens of pro-gun rights bills in favor of concealed carry systems without permits or training, guns on college and university campuses, and guns in public schools. The group said it had doubled its donor base – which includes billionaire and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg – to 85,000 people. The gun control group has spent most of its time and energy working to convince state lawmakers of its cause, and notes that Oregon became the 18th state to expand background checks to all handgun sales. In the courts, the US supreme court recently rejected a challenge to an Illinois city’s ban on assault weapons, allowing local governments leeway in how they regulate firearms. But Everytown’s tentative optimism in its struggle against pro-gun lobbyists is undercut by a year that saw mass shootings in the US become more frequent and more deadly, with the firearms involved often legally purchased, as in San Bernardino and in Oregon that left 10 people dead. Americans also rushed to buy guns after nearly every high-profile shooting. Smith & Wesson’s stock rose over 125% in the last year, and on the Black Friday, the busiest shopping day of the year, gun background checks hit a new record. The FBI reported that it performed 185,345 background checks – two per second – on the same day that a gunman killed three people and wounded nine others at a Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado. To the chagrin of Barack Obama, police chiefs and activists, gun control measures such as expanded background checks, limits to ammunition, and an end to the ban on gun violence research, all remain frozen in Congress. The president has urged local governments to take the lead on the issue, mirroring the strategy used by both Everytown and the NRA. The issue has also entered the presidential campaign for the first time in 15 years, albeit along partisan lines. Although Republican candidates have rejected any suggestion of expanded checks or other measures, Democrats have given gun control center stage during debates, raising activists’ hopes that candidates will no longer treat the issue as an untouchable idea."

http://www.inquisitr.com/2622058/accused-planned-parenthood-shooter-i-am-a-warrior-for-the-babies/,"The so-called Planned Parenthood shooter appeared in court on Wednesday, and what he said has appeared to reveal his true motive behind the attack. Raw Story reports that Robert Lewis Dear has declared his guilt before a Colorado judge, in an apparent attempt to avoid going to trial. This is a brand new development in a disturbing case that began on November 27, when Dear allegedly opened fire on multiple people at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood facility. CBS News Denver reports that Robert Lewis Dear cried out his guilt in the middle of court, while his attorney was discussing whether or not cameras should be allowed in the courtroom.  Wednesday's hearing was supposed to be a hearing on the formal filing of charges against the accused Planned Parenthood shooter. Prosecutors plan on entering 179 various counts against Dear, which include murder charges associated with the deaths of the three people who died in the November shooting. Those three victims were Garrett Swasey, Ke'Arre Stewart, and Jennifer Markovsy. Numerous other people were shot, but survived.  — snopes.com (@snopes) December 1, 2015  — snopes.com (@snopes) December 1, 2015  — Irin Carmon (@irin) December 8, 2015  — Irin Carmon (@irin) December 8, 2015  — Joseph (@Joseph100960) December 8, 2015  — Joseph (@Joseph100960) December 8, 2015  — Dab Aggin (@DabAggin) December 2, 2015  — Dab Aggin (@DabAggin) December 2, 2015  — Jessica Leicht KKTV (@JessLeichtKKTV) December 9, 2015  — Jessica Leicht KKTV (@JessLeichtKKTV) December 9, 2015  Posted by Salon on Wednesday, December 9, 2015  Posted by Salon on Wednesday, December 9, 2015  CNN reports that the accused Planned Parenthood shooter made a total of 17 outbursts during Wednesday's court appointment.

http://www.inquisitr.com/2622046/paris-mosques-raid-police-raid-shut-down-three-mosques-in-paris-after-chilling-discoveries-inside/,"French authorities have announced the closure of three mosques in Paris after chilling discoveries were made inside each location. In a statement released by the Seine-and-Marne Department, French police revealed they have seized 330 war-grade weapons and 7.62mm ammunition for a Kalashnikov rifles, and Islamic State propaganda videos from multiple mosques that have been raided, according to the New York Times.    The disturbing find inside the mosques in Paris comes less than a week after the speculated terrorist attack that took place in San Bernardino, CA. Once again, two radicalized Muslims - identified as Syed Farook, 28 and his wife Tashfeen Malik, 27 - are responsible for the attacks. The devout Muslim couple unloaded rounds of ammunition, firing at innocent victims inside the Inland Regional Center. The horrific mass shooting left 14 victims dead, and another 21 wounded, according to the LA Times. Both attacks and the Paris mosques' raids have raised concerns about the relocation of Syrian refugees. For those who don't know, refugees from Syria have been relocated to both France and the United States but now government officials are concerned about the possibility of an increase in terrorist attacks.   One of the gunmen involved in the Paris shooting crossed the French border under the guise of a refugee. And now, the latest reports about Tashfeen Malik, the female shooter involved in the San Bernardino shooting, indicate that she may have been a radicalized Muslim prior to her engagement to Syed Farook. FBI agents also speculate that the marriage itself may have all been part of a terrorist plot in order for Malik to relocate to the United States. At this point, both terrorist attacks are still being investigated. Further details about the Paris mosques have yet to be released.

Syed Rizwan Farook, a suspect in the mass shooting that killed 14 people earlier this month, received a $28,500 loan last month from online lender Prosper Marketplace Inc., The Wall Street Journal and other outlets reported this week. Prosper is a consumer peer-to-peer lending platform, in which the company connects borrowers with individual peer lenders or institutions, a growing segment of online loans also popularized by LendingClub Corp. 
        LC,
        -1.21%
       Prosper’s loans are originated by partner WebBank. Asked for confirmation, Prosper said that by law, it cannot release personally identifiable information about loans. However, Prosper said all loans on its platform go through identity and screening standards “including US anti-terrorism and anti-money laundering laws.” The company also follows up to see that the loan goes to a verified U.S. bank account in the borrower’s name. As a platform, Prosper and LendingClub don’t have to abide by all the regulations that traditional banks face when issuing loans. Though peer-to-peer lenders face less regulatory scrutiny than traditional banks, analysts say this loan is unlikely to bring more federal checks to the sector. Unless the FBI reveals a red flag in Farook’s application that banks would have caught, Mitchell Weiss, executive-in-residence at Hartford University, said online lenders are unlikely to face greater regulation. “I think this [loan application] would have gone through a bank,” Weiss said. The short-term effect of the reported loan will come from investors, who may back away from financing a loan, Weiss said. “When something like this happens, the investors as individuals get skittish,” Weiss said. Eric Wasserstrom, an analyst at Guggenheim Partners, also said he believes neither a traditional bank nor an online lender would have flagged the application. But that may indicate a need for greater regulation of the overall consumer-lending space, instead of just a focus on peer-to-peer online loans. “I tend to think that this issue isn’t going to be limited to the online lending space,” Wasserstrom said. The U.S. Treasury Department started a study looking at online lenders in July,  according to The Wall Street Journal. In a September study, McKinsey said the non-banks are expected to grow, and potentially cost banks up to 60% of their profits. The study notes, however, that these non-banks could be hampered by greater regulation. Tesla stock ended at $909.68 Friday, a record close. The stock's incredible run continues.

http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2015/12/the_time_has_come_to_pass_meaningful_gun_control_e.html," Gallery: The gun control debate in editorial cartoons One of two things will happen in the near future. One: Media outlets will simply stop reporting that day's mass shootings, no matter how many bodies lay strewn on the campus, in the high school cafeteria or at the mall. It will no longer be news. We don't report that the sun came up this morning, or that the leaves turned red in October. Why bother with another shooting? Or two: The people will rise in anger, despair and disgust to tell the gun lobby, local legislators and Congress they've had enough. Enough of limbs severed and lives shattered. Enough. The big question: Which one of these will happen first? With the two sides of the gun-safety issue shouting at each other across a yawning chasm, it is easy - too easy - to succumb to despair. Despair that in the United States Congress, they can't even muster enough votes to keep weapons out of the hands of suspected terrorists on the no-fly list. Despair that in New Jersey, lawmakers failed to override Gov. Christie's veto of a bill that would have made it tougher for a people with a history of psychiatric commitments to have their records expunged so they can buy a gun. These are common sense issues even the most rabid gun-ownership proponent would agree on, if it were not for the ungodly power the National Rifle Association holds over our elected officials. The front pages of our nation's newspapers are filled with lawmakers expressing ""thoughts and prayers"" after each of the mass shooting. But thoughts and prayers are meaningless when they're not followed up with actions. At this point, even the most incremental baby steps would be welcome. So-called gun rights activists are quick to condemn those who speak out for controls immediately after a massacre, charging they are taking advantage of a tragedy to score political points. But what better time, when the nation is hurting, to call attention to how far behind its peers the United States ranks in keeping its citizens safe? What, finally, will it take for our state and federal lawmakers to develop a backbone and stand up to the NRA, with its insistence that every man, woman and child in this country needs unfettered access to enough weaponry to blow their neighbors to Kingdom Come? Albert Einstein once defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. If that's true, our country has definitely lost its collective mind.

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/127485309/0/phoenix/nation~Activists-hold-Newtown-vigil-near-US-Capitol/,"Several hundred gun control advocates and family members of gun violence victims held a vigil in a church a few blocks from the U.S. Capitol to kick off a weeklong commemoration of the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Joined by Senior Advisor to the President Valerie Jarrett, the vigil was part remembrance, part somber political rally. Connecticut Democratic Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy, and several other lawmakers were in attendance. The Dec. 14, 2012, shooting was the deadliest mass shooting at a high school or grade school in U.S. history. Adam Lanza, 20, killed 20 children and six faculty members before killing himself. Since then, the tragedy has been a focal point for gun control activists who say that Newtown and other high-profile U.S. mass shootings underscore the need for tougher gun laws. Jarrett told the group gathered Wednesday at St. Marks Episcopal Church that while Congress remains unwilling to pass new restrictions, President Obama will continue to push for gun control. The administration is looking to cities and states to implement new laws, she said, as well as seeking new efforts Obama can make through executive action. ""We must continue to stand together in the face of cynical political failure,"" she said. The vigil, sponsored by the Newtown Foundation and Faiths United to Prevent Gun Violence, is the first of hundreds of gatherings planned around the country leading up to the Monday anniversary. Maria Pike of Chicago said after her son Ricky was shot and killed at age 24, she became involved with the Newtown families group, because ""I had to do something."" She said she now serves as ""survivor engagement lead,"" reaching out to other gun violence victims to encourage them to become advocates. ""We try to raise awareness in December because this is the month, wherever you come from, December is when compassion reigns."""
http://theweek.com/articles/592723/donald-trump-nation-verge-nervous-breakdown,"AP Photo/Paul Vernon How will the liberal democracies of the West — and the liberal democracy of the United States in particular — respond to the stresses and strains of life in an interconnected world that's continually buffeted by unpredictable, and perhaps unpreventable, acts of spectacular violence? The truth is we have no idea. Our form of government was devised at a time when news of a looming military threat had to be carried on galloping horseback to the governing authorities. Politics for most people in the founding era meant local politics, with the federal government more of a distant rumor than a reality perceived directly. Events, even important ones, often remained local, too. Only the most dramatic would penetrate the nascent national consciousness — and then only days or weeks later, mixed with gossip and half-truths from an unimaginably faraway land inhabited by people who felt more like foreigners than fellow citizens of a single continent-wide nation. And yet even then — at a time before telegraphs and telephones, radios and TVs, computers and social media — observers noticed that Americans were prone to anxiety. As the country became far more interconnected during the mid-20th century, others detected a recurring ""paranoid style in American politics."" That's nothing compared to the post-9/11 world. In the age of the 24/7 news cycle — with mainstream media outlets elevating every bad event anywhere in the country and the world into a sign of crisis; with partisan cable TV stations, talk radio programs, and niche websites shamelessly driving up their ratings and traffic by provoking each other into a state of endless outrage; with social media platforms amplifying and rewarding with maximum exposure the most extreme, cutting, and often ignorant opinions; and with most Americans walking around with powerful networked computers in our pockets bringing us this bad news and polarized opinion in a ceaseless flood — all of it is enflaming our national predisposition to anxious panic in ways we've never seen. No wonder we increasingly seem like a nation on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Republican politicians and their ideological taskmasters in the right-wing media figured out before anyone else how to use the new telecommunications technologies to whip up their voters into a froth of ideological fury. GOP presidential candidates and House members have been playing the demagogue game for years, and it's reached an apotheosis of sorts with this year's race. Nearly all of the candidates do it on foreign policy and ObamaCare, Ted Cruz does it on everything, and Donald Trump does it on everything far better than anyone else. Witness his breathtaking fascist call on Monday for a ""complete shutdown"" of all Muslims entering the United States. Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life. [Trump] As The New York Times recently noted, Trump is a master of demagogic rhetoric, stoking and manipulating fear while issuing sweeping but always studiously vague promises about how he and he alone is smart and tough enough to keep the country safe and fix its mountain of problems. ""Something bad is happening,"" ""Something really dangerous is going on"": Trump uses such ominous, open-ended language to talk about a range of threats: Mexican immigrants, Muslim terrorists at home and abroad, and legions of stupid people from both parties whose incompetence has supposedly led the country and its economy to the verge of collapse. The Trump campaign is the culmination of three decades of Republicans bad-mouthing Washington. One almost wonders why it took so long for someone to come along and close the populist circle: If Washington really is so unredeemably bad, then the Republican establishment deserves just as much scorn as the Democrats — because everyone, in both parties, is a worthless fool. Since the rise of the Tea Party, the GOP power brokers have tried to ride the anti-establishment tiger, but Trump has finally succeeded where they failed. ""Vote for me,"" he says, ""and I'll fulfill your fantasies of throwing all the bums out and fixing things from top to bottom."" Not a single vote has been cast for Trump, of course. We don't know yet if his support in the polls will translate into primary victories, let alone into his nomination as the GOP candidate, let alone into him winning the presidency. Yet clearly, millions of Americans like what they're hearing from Trump — and, increasingly, from his Mini-Me, Ted Cruz. That's remarkable. But it's not just conservative America that seems on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Liberals are right there, too. The left has become more unhinged with each mass shooting, with their (understandable) outrage curdling into intemperate talk of repealing the 2nd Amendment, fantasies of widespread gun confiscation and prohibition, and insulting attacks on fellow citizens who are inclined to respond to tragic news by offering prayers. All of this is counter-productive, confirming the suspicions of tens of millions of gun owners that liberals can't be trusted to pursue moderate, reasonable gun control measures. Then there's the distinctively left-wing madness sweeping American college campuses, with young people at a growing list of elite universities demanding, among other things, that they be protected from having their (very delicate) feelings hurt. As far as many of them are concerned, free speech and the free exchange of ideas are luxuries we can no longer afford. To these illiberal demands, college administrators almost unfailingly respond with complete capitulation, showing that the defense of liberal norms and ideals is less important to them than sparing their institutions potentially embarrassing publicity (which, thanks to social media, can go viral and national in an instant). Finally, there's the distinctive contribution of our well-meaning but frequently ineffective liberal president to our national neuroses. At another historical moment, Obama's cool-cat persona might have fit right in. But his temperamental aloofness and tendency to undersell threats are almost comically ill-suited to this moment of turmoil and angst. Whereas the rest of the country stands continually on the edge of a panic attack, our president alone seems unwaveringly certain that we have nothing at all to worry about — even right up to and just after the latest traumatic event. We don't need, and shouldn't hope for, a president who will actively encourage and manipulate our worst fears. But in times of national anxiety, the country needs a leader who will acknowledge and validate those fears. Only then can he hope to moderate and dissipate them, and channel them in more publicly beneficial directions. Instead we're left with an image of presidential fecklessness — and the impression that no one is really in charge of an increasingly chaotic nation in an ever more anarchic world. (Obama's prime-time Oval Office address to the nation on Sunday night was a tentative but rather feeble step in the right direction. More, please.) We live in troubling times. Global order is being tested in new ways nearly every day, as is America's mythical vision of itself as a haven from the tumult and troubles of the outside world. Technology both contributes to the disorder and makes the pandemonium seem worse than it really is by shoving it down our throats all day, every day, while our leaders (and would-be leaders) act in ways that exacerbate our worries. Amidst all of that, a measure of anxiety is understandable. But we desperately need to get a grip — and some philosophical and historical perspective on the nation's problems and the nature of the threats it faces. Achieving a measure of equanimity in a time of trial is always difficult. Attaining it when reason and good sense are continually drowned out by ceaseless electronic chatter is more challenging still. Yet that is precisely what we need. The time has come for a intervention — and we have no choice but to administer it to ourselves. Copyright © Dennis Publishing Limited 2021. All rights reserved.The Week™ is a registered trade mark."
http://theweek.com/articles/592225/why-turn-mass-shootings-into-culture-war-fights,"Illustrated | Images Gary Waters/Ikon Images/Corbis After every mass shooting, the media and the public express themselves passionately about gun violence. But something else happens, too. A friend put it this way: Each mass shooting seems to produce a ""B-plot"" now. And lately, the B-plot is always a familiar culture war argument. Last week, while police were collecting more than a dozen pipe bombs from the home of the suspected San Bernardino killers, the media was revving its engines in a debate about whether messages of ""thoughts and prayers"" are an obscene and insulting gesture from politicians or a natural, human, and understandable sentiment. The mass shooting at Planned Parenthood sparked a discussion about whether the beliefs and rhetoric of peaceful pro-lifers are a cause of anti-abortion terrorism. Earlier this year, a mass murder in a historic black church in Charleston occasioned a debate that ended in the removal of the Confederate flag from the South Carolina statehouse. This is what despair over mass shootings looks like. In the A-plot about gun violence, there is the usual frustration. We know mass shootings are difficult to deter with policy. A waiting period may be long enough to outlast someone's suicidal ideation. But the type of killer who is willing to make a dozen pipe bombs is exactly the type most likely to find extra-legal access to guns. We may be able to make it more difficult to obtain weapons, and we should. But a nation with tighter gun laws is not a nation immune to mass shootings and terrorism. A nation that says it cannot possibly track or expel 11 million illegal immigrants has little chance of finding, tracking, and removing the most dangerous of over 300 million guns. The A-plot is straightforward, tired, and frustrating: We suffer mass shootings and terrorist attacks in large part because deadly firearms are ubiquitous, and we have little prospect of changing that. What's so fascinating and occasionally unnerving about the B-plot to our gun tragedies is the way they become a search for the far more diffuse and remote causes of violence. Namely, the cultural reasons that violence erupts, or the cultural reasons that we find ourselves unable to stop violence. Our elite culture has mostly rejected the idea that popular entertainment that glorifies violence is the problem. So now we search for something deeper. Can we really trust people with these religious convictions against what the state has deemed lawful? Does religion itself become an impediment to intelligent reform? Are people being radicalized by the deinstitutionalized and ungoverned free speech on the web? For now, the culture war spats that come out of these tragedies are mostly conducted within the elite media, using the tools of social stigma. People ask whether pro-lifers can use less-charged rhetoric. Or demand that the state of South Carolina take down a flag that is used to endorse racist violence. But if the frequency of ideologically motivated mass shootings picks up, whether founded in racism, anti-abortion zealotry, or Islamism, it's easy to anticipate the B-plot conversation will search for more comprehensive public policy responses. For understandable reasons, we are uniquely afraid of terroristic violence. Both because it is more indiscriminate than the kind of gun crime that normally afflicts us, and because it threatens our political order. In our despairing at the difficulty of controlling weapons, we may reach for monitoring speech and thought instead. The connection between hard-edged speech and violence is already being made more explicit at the highest levels of government. Attorney General Loretta Lynch promised that she would take legal action against anyone whose anti-Muslim rhetoric ""edges toward violence."" Speech may seem like a hard thing to regulate, but it won't be, really. An attempt to confiscate guns would be a dangerous mission, and demoralizing to the law enforcement agencies tasked with doing it. Policing thought and speech, or at least the illusion of policing it, will be much easier to accomplish. Abraham Lincoln jailed newspaper editors that he found to be publishing seditious material. In the present, the monitoring of speech would merely involve one federal desk worker calling another desk worker at a tech company. It would be about tracking IP addresses, and shutting down or undermining web forums, or the security of private chat clients. If anything important and dangerous is said, it's probably on an internet platform that can be monitored by government snoops. The web has made it possible for ersatz communities based around exotic or psychopathic beliefs to connect with each other easily. And these communities become more visible to us because their work is searchable. A pre-web age could not produce the men's rights movement, an English-language magazine for an Islamic State, or the neo-reactionary community, or make them so widely known. If, in our despair of stopping violence by other means, we create agencies to prevent radicalization they will find plenty of communities on the internet that look dangerous when you squint your eyes. What else would you call a distributed network of young men who connect with each other across international borders on chat rooms, share explosive and extreme rhetoric, and even plan campaigns of trolling behavior and online harassment? To some observers, this looks like a proto-type of terrorist cell formation. A century ago, it was expected that the great powers of the free world would impose censorship in times of war. Of course it could happen again. After the Paris attacks, I spoke to several European thinkers who all feared for the near term. Things they had grown to rely on — free movement through the European continent, and free expression — seemed to be suddenly in danger. France is contemplating a mass closure of unapproved mosques as a response to terror. Donald Trump seems eager to do the same here. The one lesson that modern ideologically motivated terrorism has taught me is this: When narrow security measures fail, we demand new, broad, and invasive ones. Frustrated at our inability to alter the facts in the United States created by the Second Amendment, our fear of violence almost certainly will turn toward creating laws and agencies that try to control the ideas that inspire it.

By BEN WHITE 12/09/2015 08:00 AM EST Presented by JOIN US NEXT WEEK! — Final Morning Money Breakfast of the year next Tuesday, December 15 will feature White House Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Jason Furman. We’ll talk about the economy in 2015, the Fed, the outlook for 2016, fiscal fights in Congress and whatever else comes to mind. Please join us! http://politi.co/1OgvRlY BUDGET TALKS STALL — POLITICO’s Jake Sherman, Lauren French and John Bresnahan: “Right now, there's no deal in sight to fund the federal government. House leaders are bracing for a long week, potential weekend session and more negotiations next week as Republicans and Democrats have failed to come to an agreement on how to fund federal agencies until October 2016. In all likelihood, the House will vote Friday on a short-term government funding measure to avoid a shutdown, giving Speaker Paul Ryan and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi more time to negotiate. “Still at issue are policy riders covering environmental issues, Western land concerns and how to address Syrian refugees seeking to come to the United States. One deal discussed included Democrats agreeing to lift the oil-export ban in exchange for Republicans dropping many of their environmental policy demands. But the two sides are far from any final agreement. Ryan's (R-Wis.) top aides say they will keep talking until they find a solution, which could mean enacting short-term funding bills to keep the lights on the agencies for as long as negotiations drag on.” DOW-DUPONT EYE MERGER — WSJ’s David Benoit, Dana Cimilluca, Dana Mattioli and Jacob Bunge: “Dow Chemical Co. and DuPont Co. are in advanced talks to merge, in what would be a combination of two of America’s oldest companies that together are worth nearly $120 billion. … The chemical giants, which each have a market capitalization of about $60 billion, could announce a merger in coming days … It would be followed by a three-way breakup of the combined company, they said, a common approach to mergers and acquisitions of late. Dow’s Chief Executive Andrew Liveris is expected to be executive chairman of the new company, with DuPont CEO Edward Breen keeping that title. “Terms of the deal couldn’t be learned, but some of the people said it would be billed as a merger of equals, meaning there wouldn’t be a big premium for either set of shareholders. A deal hasn’t yet been inked and the talks could fall apart … Even if the two sides manage to agree, there is no guarantee antitrust regulators would bless the union or that the breakup plan would address any such concerns. The merger would combine two top suppliers of industrial and agricultural chemicals and crop seeds.” http://on.wsj.com/1NUHzsn TRUMP DENOUNCED AROUND THE WORLD — WP’s Annie Gowen: “Donald Trump’s call for a ‘total and complete’ ban on Muslims entering the United States drew widespread condemnation around the world Tuesday, including from British and French leaders and the U.N. refu­gee agency.Citizens, politicians and refu­gee officials alike slammed the Republican presidential front-runner’s latest controversial statement, calling it hate speech and a disturbing sign of Islamophobia in a country rattled in recent weeks by large-scale terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif. “Dar al-Ifta, Egypt’s official religious body, dubbed Trump’s remarks ‘hate rhetoric,’ and a spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency expressed concern that they could jeopardize the ongoing refugee resettlement process. While it is rare for a British prime minister to comment on contenders in the U.S. presidential race, Prime Minister David Cameron joined British politicians from all parties in condemning Trump’s remarks. Cameron said through a spokeswoman that he ‘completely disagrees’ with Trump’s comments, which he regards as “divisive, unhelpful and quite simply wrong.’” http://wapo.st/21Nu4yL CEASERS FIGHTS FOR TIA CHANGE IN OMNIBUS — WSJ’s Matt Jarzesmky: “Caesars Entertainment Corp. is lobbying to roll back a Depression-era creditor-protection law that could complicate the casino giant’s financial restructuring … The Las Vegas company and its owner, Apollo Global ManagementLLC, have been working to support legislation that would amend the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 … Some lawmakers, including Democratic Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, have pushed to include the measure in a sweeping spending bill that Congress must pass by Friday to avoid a government shutdown … “An amendment to the law could gut lawsuits against Caesars brought by bondholders of the company’s bankrupt operating division. The bondholders have filed a lawsuit arguing that transactions that took the Caesars parent company off the hook to guarantee their debt violated [TIA] … The law protects creditors against transactions that impair their principal or interest payments. Lawmakers weighed including the provision in a $305 billion highway bill passed last week but left ultimately left it out” http://on.wsj.com/1SMQMRA SCHOLARS: NOT THE WAY TO CHANGE TIA — Per a letter from a group of legal scholars to members of Congress: “As corporate finance law experts who teach and write about the Trust Indenture Act, we have differing opinions about whether the Trust Indenture Act should be amended, and if so, how. … We agree, however, that any amendment of the Trust Indenture Act should take place only after legislative hearings and opportunity for public comment. “The proposed amendment has not been subjected to the customary vetting through public hearings and other mechanisms that are critical to improving the public confidence in Congress’ ability to govern. There have been no hearings on the matter, no opportunity to hear from a diverse group of experts or the public, and no attempt to establish a legislative record.

But Marco Rubio is moving up, too, according to a new CNN/WMUR New Hampshire primary poll out Tuesday. Trump is up 6 percentage points from the September survey, and has more than double the support of his nearest competitor, Rubio, who has 14 percent. That's a 5 point bump for the Florida senator. The poll was taken Nov. 30 to Dec. 7, the day Trump released his controversial proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the U.S. … “But there’s a catch: just 18 percent of those polled are committed to their choice. Twenty-six percent are leaning toward a candidate and 56 percent still need to decide. Trump also leads in another category — GOP candidate voters would ‘not vote for under any circumstance’ (26 percent.) Bush comes in second place with 11 percent, and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul follows with 7 percent.” http://politi.co/1YXZO1P WARREN BACKS CLINTON WALL STREET PLAN — NYT’s Amy Chozick: “Hillary Clinton, hearing criticism for her ties to the financial industry, received the critical support of Senator Elizabeth Warren on Monday for her proposal to expand the Dodd-Frank regulatory structure and urging of President Obama to veto any legislation that would weaken Wall Street regulation. ‘Secretary Clinton is right to fight back against Republicans trying to sneak Wall Street giveaways into the must-pass government funding bill,’ Ms. Warren, the liberal senator from Massachusetts, wrote on Facebook after Mrs. Clinton published an Op-Ed article in The New York Times with her proposals to regulate Wall Street. “In the Op-Ed, Mrs. Clinton specifically called for Republicans not to defund the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which Ms. Warren previously oversaw. ‘Whether it’s attacking the C.F.P.B., undermining new rules to rein in unscrupulous retirement advisers, or rolling back any part of the hard-fought progress we’ve made on financial reform,’ Ms. Warren wrote, ‘she and I agree.’ As high-profile Democratic elected officials line up to support Mrs. Clinton’s candidacy, Ms. Warren has remained neutral” http://nyti.ms/1jNFBMi CALIFORNIA KILLERS BORROWED ONLINE — Reuters: “A married couple who killed 14 people in a California shooting rampage the FBI is investigating as an act of terrorism borrowed about $28,000 from an online lender, a sum deposited into their bank account about two weeks before the attack … Disclosure of the unsecured loan the husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, took out from San Francisco-based Prosper, a peer-to-peer lending service, offered a new glimpse into the money trail under scrutiny by investigators of last week's mass shooting.”http://reut.rs/1IU6tki OIL CRASH CONTINUES — WSJ’s Nicole Friedman: “Brent crude dipped below $40 a barrel on Tuesday in a deepening oil-market selloff that has damped hopes for a recovery in early 2016. In a volatile trading session oil prices closed at nearly seven-year lows, extending losses that have rattled global stock markets and raised fresh questions about oil producers’ ability to weather a prolonged rout. Analysts and investors who initially thought prices would recover in the second half of 2015 now say they don’t expect any pickup until late 2016. “Many producers continue to pump barrels at a fast clip, defying predictions that low prices would lead to a significant slowdown in output. Wall Street banks are cutting their price forecasts and, in some cases, calling for lower average oil prices in 2016 than in 2015. … Rising inventories of crude oil and petroleum products world-wide are at the crux of the oil market’s weakness. In the U.S., stockpiles have risen for 10 straight weeks at a time when supplies usually shrink at the onset of winter” http://on.wsj.com/1YXgRkx PAIN SPREADS AMONG PRODUCERS — NYT’s Ian Austen and Clifford Krauss: “The pain among energy and mining producers is growing more acute as prices of global commodities continued their collapse … The newest victim is the London-based mining firm Anglo American. On Tuesday, the company announced a drastic restructuring, which includes expanding job cuts, suspending its dividend, reducing its business unit and cutting its assets. Anglo American is far from alone, as scores of oil, natural gas, and mining companies are feeling the pain from low prices. “A number of commodity-related businesses have either declared bankruptcy or fallen behind in their debt payments. Even more frequent have been layoffs — more than 250,000 workers in the oil and gas industry worldwide, with more than a third coming in the United States. The causes for the onslaught are many, but China looms large … Between 2000 and last year, energy companies invested hundreds of billions of dollars to expand their production capacity to satisfy China, the world’s most populous nation, in a period of rapid economic expansion. Much of the corporate growth was fueled by debt, which was unsustainable as domestic and Chinese demand waned. … At least seven American coal companies have declared bankruptcy this year.” http://nyti.ms/1HTCsGp YAHOO DUMPS ALIBABA SPIN-OFF PLAN — FT’s Hannah Kuchler in San Francisco and James Fontanella-Khan in New York: “Yahoo has abandoned plans to spin-off its $32bn stake in Chinese e-commerce group Alibaba under pressure from investors worried about a potentially huge tax bill and is looking at selling or spinning off its core business instead. … Shares in Yahoo rose more than 2 per cent in after-hours trading in New York after people familiar with the matter said the board had walked away from the spin-off which had been announced in February and was due to take place at the end of this year … . “The Silicon Valley company will now consider spinning off its core business together with its stake in Yahoo Japan, a move that poses a much lower tax risk, those briefed on the situation said. Yahoo did not respond to requests for comment. CNBC first reported the news. The stunning reversal by chief executive Marissa Mayer comes months after US authorities refused to give any guidance or reassurance that the spin-off of Yahoo’s 15 per cent stake in Alibaba would be tax-free, as the internet company had originally said in February. Several legal experts told the Financial Times in February that Yahoo’s spin-off risked incurring a punitive tax bill. At the time Yahoo advisers were adamant that no such risk existed under existing US tax laws” http://on.ft.com/1U0nu2N GOP ADDS DEBATE — POLITICO’s Hadas Gold: “The RNC has added a presidential primary debate to its schedule for Jan. 14, 2016, hosted by the Fox Business Network. The debate will take place at the North Charleston Coliseum and Performing Arts Center in North Charleston, South Carolina, two days after the State of the Union address. The debate is in place of one that had been tentatively scheduled to take place in Lynchburg, Va., on Jan. 16. “That debate was expected to be hosted by conservative media outlets at Liberty University, though no hosting network had been determined. … It will be the second debate hosted by Fox Business Network. The network’s larger sister network Fox News is also holding a GOP debate in January in Iowa, just days before the Iowa caucuses.” http://politi.co/1TZUiZH MORGAN STANLEY SLASHES JOBS — WSJ’s Justin Baer: “Morgan Stanley will eliminate 1,200 jobs, including 470 fixed-income and commodities traders and salespeople, as Wall Street’s outlook for its debt-markets businesses dims. The cuts, which comprise about 2 percent of Morgan Stanley’s total workforce, will also target hundreds of back-office employees who support the New York firm’s fixed-income division … The Wall Street firm will take a $150 million charge in the fourth quarter to cover severance expenses … “A vast majority of the cuts will occur in London and New York, with fewer than 100 positions eliminated at the firm’s Asia offices. ‘This will result in businesses that are critically and credibly sized for the current market, while maintaining the ability to deliver for our clients across products and geographies,’ Morgan Stanley executives Colm Kelleher, president of Morgan Stanley’s investment-banking and securities businesses, and Edward Pick, who heads trading, wrote Tuesday in a memorandum to employees” http://on.wsj.com/1TzJ9Oz ** A message from the American Bankers Association: What would regulatory relief mean for your hometown?

http://www.ibtimes.com/mass-shootings-rise-new-technology-could-save-lives-gun-violence-victims-2219226,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved new technology that could help save the lives of gunshot victims. First responders will now be able to administer a sponge-injecting device that works to stop bleeding from life-threatening bullet wounds. Previously, the device was approved for use only on battlefields. The device, known as the XSTAT 30, looks like a syringe and can be injected into the wound. Once the victim reaches a hospital, the device is removed by health professionals. ""Early control of severe bleeding may prevent shock and may be life-saving,"" the FDA said in a statement. Inside the syringe are small sponges that are soaked in cellulose coated with a blood-sopping absorbent, MedGadget reported. The sponges swell to seal the cavity. The device was created by RevMedx, a company in Wilsonville, Oregon. “When a product is developed for use in the battlefield, it is generally intended to work in a worst-case scenario where advanced care might not be immediately available,” William Maisel, director of the Office of Device Evaluation in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a statement. “It is exciting to see this technology transition to help civilian first responders control some severe, life-threatening bleeding while on the trauma scene.”  FDA approves Xstat device that plugs gunshot wounds and stops bleeding instantly. https://t.co/uvQftAbcZO #science pic.twitter.com/GOy1uGWss6   The device was cleared for use on both adults and children when emergency care is not readily available. Hemorrhaging accounts for 30 to 40 percent of civilian deaths after a traumatic injury, according to the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research. ""The dressing can be used for up to four hours, which could allow time for the patient to receive surgical care,"" according to the FDA. The news of the potentially life-saving device came one week after a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, in which 14 people were killed."

There was standing room only at the St Mark’s Episcopal church on Capitol Hill, Washington, for the biggest of hundreds of vigils planned across the US this week, spurred by recent deadly shootings from Colorado to California.  On a night of tears and solemn determination there was testimony from survivors and families who have lost loved ones to gun violence, as well as prayers, music and speeches from politicians, while the names and faces of victims were projected on to a big screen throughout. Although president Barack Obama has been repeatedly frustrated in his attempts to impose tighter restrictions on access to guns, campaigners suggested there was now a groundswell of public activism comparable to the Black Lives Matter movement or the ultimately successful push for marriage equality. David Stowe, vice-chair of the Newtown Action Alliance and Newtown Foundation, founded after the shooting of 20 young children and six of their adult carers at Sandy Hook elementary school in 2012, said there had been a shift in mood: “I felt like Sandy Hook ignited a lot of people but it also felt like it wasn’t really going anywhere. The last few months, it feels different on the ground – people are acting different. “People that before weren’t paying attention or just didn’t seem to care are now speaking up. I think it always takes time: legislators are the last ones to react and the last ones to catch up, but there’s definitely something different going on. It’s horrific that it takes things like San Bernardino and Sandy Hook and Colorado to make it happen, but it’s going to happen.” The Newtown Foundation said more than 350 faith and gun violence prevention organisations in 39 states would hold events commemorating next week’s third anniversary of the Sandy Hook massacre. Since that atrocity, it estimates, more than 90,000 Americans have been shot and killed by guns; more than 210,000 have been shot and injured; and there have been more than 1,000 mass shooting incidents where four or more people have been shot at one time. Congressional leaders, and more than 60 family members of victims and survivors of gun violence from 18 states, plan to demand expanded background checks on potential firearms buyers at a media conference on Thursday. Meanwhile, the campaign group Everytown for Gun Safety has released a video featuring survivors of gun violence, Obama himself and artists including Julianne Moore, Michael J Fox, Amy Schumer, Spike Lee, Jennifer Aniston and Sofia Vergara. The group said nearly 100 cities across the country would host “Orange Walks” this weekend to demand an end to the scourge; orange was chosen because it is the colour that hunters wear in the woods to protect themselves. Half a dozen major anti-gun violence organisations came together on one platform at Wednesday’s vigil, evidence that a once disparate effort is speaking with one voice. Stowe added: “There’s a lot of things that have been going on that people don’t necessarily see. There are literally hundreds of different gun violence prevention organisations around the country and, where they were not united or coalesced before, now there are weekly strategy meetings and everybody talks to each other, works together and collaborates together. “It’s definitely changing. Strategically it’s along the lines of marriage equality where it just reaches a critical mass, and then once you hit the tipping point, I think there’s no stopping it. I think we’re getting close to that but this is the only issue that has a constitutional amendment that you have to deal with, so it’s a little more challenging, but it will happen.” The two previous vigils have been held at the National Cathedral but this year’s was moved to the 19th-century redbrick church on Capitol Hill “to make it harder for the legislators to ignore”, Stowe said. Among those taking part was Mathew Soto, 18, whose sister Vicki, a 27-year-old teacher, was killed at Sandy Hook. Soto said “a very determined group of people” was “definitely heading in a similar direction” to successful movements such as that for marriage equality. “I think it’s an enormous grassroots effort and sadly our community of families and victims and survivors grows every day,” he added. “No one wants to be part of this club but we make the best of what we have and we try to fight for the change that others are too scared to fight for, and we try to make sure no one else has to go through what we had to go through.” During the event several people affected by gun violence stood at the altar holding photos of late family members. One of the most powerful testimonies came from Carolyn Tuft, who was critically injured in a 2007 shopping mall shooting in Salt Lake City in which her daughter Kirsten Hinckley, 15, was killed. “I saw a bright flash of light and heard a loud bang, and then I felt shards of glass stuck in me from a window,” Tuft told the gathering. “Kirsten ran and lay on the floor. I remember the last thing she ever said to me was, ‘Get down mom!’ I felt someone standing over my right shoulder and I turned to look and I saw an 18-year-old boy armed with a shotgun. He pointed the gun at me and shot me point blank.” Tuft lost part of an arm and lung and lay on the floor, bleeding. “All I was thinking of was my daughter, shot in the back. I pulled myself close to her and felt the shooter push the gun into my lower back and shoot me again. He put the gun on her head and shot her again. As I watched, I reached out to tell her I loved her. She was already gone.” Politicians at the event promised that, despite opposition in Congress and from the powerful gun lobby, efforts to ban assault weapons and introduce universal background checks on would-be buyers, who might include terrorist suspects and people with mental health issues, would continue. Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to Obama, told how her grandfather had been killed when his own hunting gun was turned against him by burglars, and said she recently held a White House meeting with gun owners who want change and feel the National Rifle Association (NRA) no longer represents them. Senator Richard Blumenthal from Connecticut, where the Sandy Hook shooting happened, said: “Tragically, reprehensibly, unacceptably, this nation has done nothing in Congress. And Congress has become complicit in the evil that we have seen all too often, all too frequently, all too tragically.” He added, to thunderous applause: “We are here because we refuse to accept inaction. We have all said to each other we will not give up. We will not surrender. We will not go away. We will not abandon this fight.” Representative Elizabeth Esty added: “We are elected to protect Americans, not to protect the NRA or the gun lobby.” Elsewhere on Wednesday a vigil was held at St Mark’s Presbyterian church in Tucson, Arizona. Tucson was the site of a mass shooting nearly five years ago, when a gunman opened fire outside a supermarket and gravely wounded former Representative Gabrielle Giffords. Twelve others were injured and six were killed, including a nine-year-old girl. About 120 miles (190km) north, in downtown Phoenix, another vigil is planned for Sunday. Organised by Arizonans for Gun Safety, the vigil will be held in front of a statue made out of melted weapons to honor the victims of gun violence. Geraldine Hills, the founder of Arizonans for Gun Safety, said: “Our message will be yes, we are here to pray for all of those affected by gun violence, but we’re also here to say that prayers are not enough. We demand more from our leadership than just platitudes. People are dying every day, so we need to take action.” Hills, a lifelong Republican, founded Arizonans for Gun Safety after her younger brother, Adam Hills, was shot and killed by a mentally unstable man in October 1994. “Why was somebody with that kind of mental health still able to not only have access to guns, but be a dealer?” she said. “I’ve never gotten a straight answer for that in 20 years.” In Colorado Springs, where Robert Lewis Dear is accused of killing three people at a Planned Parenthood clinic in November, the First Congregational Church will hold a vigil on Monday. Spokeswoman Emily Bond said: “On this anniversary weekend of the Sandy Hook elementary school murders, perpetrated by a young man whose family was entranced by the idolatry of guns, we will gather with others to provide a witness for a sane and theologically sound set of gun policies and attitudes.”"

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/toan-lam/sharing-positive-news-mor_b_8711192.html,"Founder, Go Inspire Go My good friend Suzanne Lettrick once told me that when more than one person is telling you something, that's the universe whispering in your ear. If that is true, something is yelling at me big time. In the past weeks, we've heard of the horrifying, heartbreaking, evil news of violence in Paris, Lebanon and Mali. It seems nearly every week the news is smattered with yet another shooting. No matter what it looks like -- an isolated incident, terrorism, (fill in the blank) -- it is an attack on humanity at large. I was sitting peacefully on a dock along the Caloosahatchee River in Florida, watching the sunset while on vacation with Barbara Ocampo, my good friend and Go Inspire Go videographer, when we heard about the shooting in her hometown of Paris. I had been thinking about how peaceful the water looked against the backdrop of the peachy sky. The white cloud wisps seemed almost like a painting changing before our eyes, the sun's rays sparkling like diamonds on the water. Barbara's phone started buzzing wildly. Barbara told me, ""Sorry for looking down at my phone, I got a text from my brother in Paris."" ""There was a mass shooting in Paris and people are being held hostage at a concert hall,"" she explained with horror in her wide eyes. We watched the terror unfold through social media and news outlets online. She was checking Facebook and text messages to see if her loved ones were OK. Thankfully, her family was safe. A quick check showed that my friends were OK, too. I felt helpless, but learned that I could do something to change that feeling and to change the life or lives of others around me. And so can you (keep reading for the challenge). Before bed, I went to check in on her. Her eyes were red from crying. My heart hurt and mind went wild, thinking about the horror the concertgoers and other victims in Paris endured -- each one with a story, family, friends, careers -- their lives abruptly ended as they were going about their everyday routines. Then, more bad news about the violence that unfolded about Lebanon. As I said good night, Barbara said, ""Toan, the world needs you!"" I chuckled. She didn't. Her voice was as serious as a heart attack. I knew she wasn't kidding. Barbara, a professional videographer and documentarian, has volunteered her time and talents for several years, producing, shooting and editing videos for GIG. She told me that she's been volunteering for me because she believes in me and has seen the changes in people I connect to and share my stories with. For the past six years, Barbara and more than 150 volunteers have helped me spread stories of everyday heroes and good deeds via my nonprofit, Go Inspire Go (GIG). I honestly didn't realize I had that big of a power to inspire people to do better and be better for themselves and others. I got the chills. I left the world of TV news because people told me they wanted to see more positive stories. I paid attention and with story after story, we've inspired people on big and small scales. Barbara, a professional videographer and documentarian, has volunteered her time and talents for several years, producing, shooting and editing videos for GIG. She reminded me that the world needs more stories of inspiration, heroism and hope -- the threads woven into all of our Go Inspire Go stories. With the mayhem that is breaking loose this week, we need to see more positive stories. According to a University of British Columbia study, 'Good news begets better people'  By the age of 18, a young adult will have seen 16,000 simulated murders and 200,000 acts of violence. (American Psychiatric Association) One of my favorite quotes from Mr. Fred Rogers of Mister Roger's Neighborhood: ""As a little boy, anytime there was a catastrophe, my mother would tell me, look for the helpers. If you look for the helpers you'll know that there's hope."" As an intern at local TV stations in San Francisco, I would want to stick around and talk to the victims and look for the helpers. I would push for some sort of way we could relay information to the viewers on how they could help. This kept me going. Here are two stories to get you going: Barbara and I recently produced this soul-to-soul chat with Dr. Michael Pritchard, an actor, comedian and humanitarian who has dedicated his life to using comedy to inspire laughter, love and kindness to audiences young and old. His whisper to me: ""You are the teacher-preacher-professor for the next generation. You're the Asian male Oprah,"" he constantly says. As much as I chuckle over this comparison to Ms. Winfrey, about a dozen people have told me this in the last couple of years. Check out the video we produced.... Teaser: During the chat, we believe his best friend, the late actor Robin Williams, whispered something by way of a real-life ""tweet, tweet, tweet"": On the day of the Paris shooting, I got a private message from yet another friend, Oli Cohen. Oli is also a talented photographer, videographer and sound recordist who criss-crosses the world for his work. He sent me this direct message: ""I just wrote this on a FB discussion and thought of you: 'Over half a million people die every year because of malaria. This is so crazy considering that it's a preventable disease. Malaria doesn't make great news or social media stories though. Even worse, in the world over three million people die of hunger ever year. Again this is completely unnecessary. It's a shocking statistic but it doesn't make a shocking news story. It's so easy to feel detached from it too. On a positive note, the numbers dying from malaria are reducing and with some luck it will be eradicated in our lifetime. Similarly, extreme poverty has significantly reduced in the world. Fantastic work is being done and there are many positive stories out there but then they don't make great news or social media stories either. Just saying.' "" Oli and I were brought together by another magical person, a dear friend and PR volunteer Fiona Pattison. I happened to be attending a wedding in Durham, England, and Fiona knew that she, Oli and I were connected on a higher level. It was also around the time of the 2011 London riots. My intention was met with a miracle. Against all odds, injured foot, no equipment and not even a cell phone, at Fiona's behest she convinced me and Oli to work with together and produce this video that tells the story of the positive things that came out of this senseless rioting. This is the video that inspired many of our British brothers and sisters to do good in the wake of the madness and looting that occurred: I learned early on that we cannot control what happens to us, we can only control how we respond. That could mean changing your perspective, praying for peace and/or taking action to do what is in our power to serve our brothers and sisters in the community and around the world. When I was a little boy, 5-years-old to be precise, I remember being super sad during recess. My kindergarten teacher, Mrs. Persinski, noticed that I wasn't my perky, playful, positive self and knew something was majorly wrong with me. ""How are you doing Toan?"" she asked in a motherly tone. ""I'm sad because I saw on the news that another person was shot and killed in the apartments behind my house,"" I explained. She was shocked, but had the best response that made me think deeply. ""Toan, you know that we have choices, right? You can choose to do good or choose to do bad. If you do good, good things happen. If you do bad, bad things happen. You can get in trouble and go to jail."" This was one of the first profound life lessons I learned. The law of cause-and-effect. I vowed to always try to do good things for me and for other people. I wondered why anyone would intentionally hurt or even want to kill anybody. I was sad for the victims as much as I was sad for the perpetrators. I wondered what caused the so-called ""bad people"" on the news to do bad things. Someone must've done something bad to them. I tried to make sense of it all. The truth is there are more good stories out there than bad stories. We just need a big ole platform to broadcast this. That's why I created Go Inspire Go -- so you can go to a place to be inspired and go do something and create change. I believe the more good you see, the more good we will do. What you pay attention to, more of it pops up into your reality. My challenge to you... Please send us: Inspiring stories or quotes or kind acts. We may share them on our platform, social media channels or blog about them. Help us take the whispers of people saying they want more good news and turn them into happy screams. Let's get as many people sharing more good news as possible. Please tweet, Facebook, Instagram us. ­Make sure to use @goinspirego and #moregoodnews Then pass the baton to a friend and let them know it's their turn to share more good news. Tag them and ask them to share and then tag another friend. As I filter through the responses, I will share a blog and multiply their messages. Let's create a good news movement! The truth is, you don't have to feel helpless. You can help. You don't have to be rich and famous. You don't have to be Oprah. Be you and share if you care. Together, we don't need to feel helpless. We have the power to uplift and shift those around us. Peace be with you. Onward, Toan This post originally appeared on Go Inspire Go. Founder, Go Inspire Go"

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/ci6BrT6XGGw/,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said Thursday that he has postponed his trip to Israel to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, just a day after reports of the meeting surfaced. Trump was scheduled to meet with Netanyahu on Dec. 28 during a trip to Israel, in the tradition of many presidential hopefuls. The Israeli Prime Minister has said he would speak with any presidential candidates who visit Israel. But Netanyahu had already begun to distance himself from Trump’s recent inflammatory comments about barring Muslims from entering the U.S., disagreeing with the remarks publicly and stating that Israel “respects all religions,” the AP reports. In this Thursday morning Tweet, Trump did not give a reason for postponing the meeting. “Overall, I think the prime minister would be happy if this visit would be canceled,” Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli consul-general, had told the AP on Wednesday. Trump has caused turmoil among Republicans over his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the U.S. after the mass shooting by a Muslim couple that killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif. The businessman has stayed ahead in polling, and annoyed many American Jews last week after speaking to a gathering of Jewish donors. He was booed after refusing to endorse Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel. He then went onto make remarks that promoted Jewish stereotypes. “I know why you’re not going to support me: you’re not going to support me because I don’t want your money,” Trump said. “You want to control your own politician.” He also said, “I’m a negotiator, like you folks.” Write to Julia Zorthian at julia.zorthian@time.com."

Gun rights activists in Texas say their demonstration will illustrate their point of view. Loading... December 10, 2015 Two gun rights groups in Texas have planned a mock mass shooting event on Saturday in order to raise awareness about their view of the relationship between gun rights and mass shooting casualties. They believe that by increasing open carry rights, mass shootings can be reduced or even prevented. Gun control advocates have been vocal about their desire to enact new restrictions on ownership of certain kinds of guns in the wake of two mass shootings in Colorado Springs, Colo., and San Bernardino, Calif., in less than a week. The groups hosting the mock shooting event say that it will demonstrate how the intervention of responsible gun owners can reduce the number of lives lost in a mass shooting scenario. The two groups, Come and Take it Texas and Dontcomply.com, had originally planned to hold their event at the University of Texas but later moved the event off campus after meeting with university officials. A Facebook announcement of the decision said that UT “will be the backdrop to this event."" The university said in a statement that the Austin campus does not permit outside groups staging demonstrations, and that the groups could be arrested for trespassing. ""When outside individuals come on campus and violate our rules regarding use of our grounds and facilities, they are asked to leave. If they do not, it becomes a criminal trespass matter,"" university spokesman J.B. Bird told The Associated Press. The planned demonstration, “Life And Liberty Event To End Gun Free Zones,” coincides with final exams, and several students wrote on the event’s Facebook page also requesting that the event be moved off-campus. The organizing groups say that the purpose of the protest is to “stand up, take a walk, and put pressure on politicians to ban Gun Free Zones.” They believe that restrictions on carrying guns in public places contributes to mass shootings. Current laws regarding carrying weapons on university campuses are already scheduled to change in Texas. This past June, Gov. Greg Abbott signed the so-called “campus carry” bill into law, which would allow license holders to carry concealed handguns on public university campuses in the state, beginning in August 2016. Although the bill states that public universities would have some authority to regulate the carrying and storage of handguns, it has been met with considerable resistance by both students and faculty. Several academic departments and schools on the Austin campus have banded together to form “Gun Free UT,” a university-wide movement hoping to ensure that the campus carry bill is repealed.

The presence of guns, or even their potential presence, would create an atmosphere of fear and intimidation that would impede our ability to teach,” faculty members of the UT math department said in a recent statement.

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in.

              since According to the report, Cruz raised doubts about Trump at a private Manhattan fundraiser on Wednesday. ""Both of them I like and respect,"" Cruz reportedly said of Trump and Ben Carson, another Republican presidential candidate. ""I don't believe either one of them is going to be our president,"" he added. The Times' Maggie Haberman and Matt Flegenheimer, citing attendees, wrote that Cruz then brought up last week's mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, and last month's terror attack in Paris, France. ""You look at Paris, you look at San Bernardino, it's given a seriousness to this race, that people are looking for: Who is prepared to be a commander in chief? Who understands the threats we face?"" Cruz was quoted asking. ""Who am I comfortable having their finger on the button? Now that's a question of strength, but it's also a question of judgment. And I think that is a question that is a challenging question for both of them."" Cruz's campaign subsequently released a statement calling The Times' story ""misleading."" In the statement, Cruz did not dispute the accuracy of the report, but he said he was making a broader point about judgment. ""In the course of a presidential election, the voters are going to make a decision about every candidate. And ultimately the decision is, who has the right judgment and the right experience to serve as commander-in-chief?"" Cruz asked. ""Every one of us who is running is being assessed by the voters under that metric, and that is exactly why we have a democratic election to make that determination."" The Times responded by providing audio of Cruz's comments at the closed-door meeting. Cruz was also asked about his reported comments after a foreign-policy speech he gave at The Heritage Foundation on Thursday, and he said he would not comment on something he ""may or may not have said at a private fundraiser."" He said it would be up to the voters to decide who they want as a leader. ""Ultimately, the decision is who has the right ... experience and judgment to serve as commander-in-chief,"" Cruz said. ""That is exactly why we have a democratic election to make that determination."" The Times' report is notable as Cruz has been one of the few Republican presidential contenders to consistently refuse to criticize Trump, the party's front-runner who has repeatedly ignited national firestorms with his provocative statements and policy proposals. In turn, Cruz has been the only notable Republican candidate whom Trump has refused to insult as his rallies. However, Trump recently started predicting that Cruz, who has started to surge in the polls, would eventually attack him. Most recently, Trump drew intense backlash this week from both Republicans and Democrats with his proposal to temporarily bar almost all Muslims from entering the US, including both immigrants and tourists. Some of Trump's rivals have used terms like ""ridiculous"" and ""unhinged"" to describe the idea, but Cruz has only publicly said that he disagrees with the plan. Reached for comment, Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler simply told The Times: ""Judgment is a question for all candidates for president of the United States. That is the point Cruz was making.""

https://newrepublic.com/article/125498/its-time-ban-guns-yes-them,"Ban guns. All guns.
Get rid of guns in homes, and on the streets, and, as much as possible, on
police. Not just because of San Bernardino, or whichever mass shooting may pop
up next, but also not not because of
those. Don’t sort the population into those who might do something evil or
foolish or self-destructive with a gun and those who surely will not. As if
this could be known—as if it could be assessed without massively violating civil liberties and stigmatizing the mentally ill. Ban guns! Not just gun violence. Not just
certain guns. Not just already-technically-illegal guns. All of them. I used to refer to my position on this issue
as being in favor of gun control. Which is true, except that “gun control” at
its most radical still tends to refer to bans on certain weapons and closing loopholes. The recent New York Times front-page editorial,
as much as it infuriated some, was
still too tentative. “Certain
kinds of weapons, like the slightly modified combat rifles used in California,
and certain kinds of ammunition, must be outlawed for civilian ownership,” the
paper argued, making the case for “reasonable regulation,”
nothing more. Even the rare
ban-guns arguments involve prefacing and hedging and disclaimers. “We shouldn’t ‘take them away’ from people who
currently own them, necessarily,” writes
Hollis Phelps in Salon. Oh, but we
should. I say this not to win some
sort of ideological purity contest, but because banning guns urgently needs to become a rhetorical and conceptual
possibility. The national conversation needs to shift from
one extreme—an acceptance, ranging from complacent to enthusiastic, of an individual
right to own guns—to another, which requires people who are not politicians to
speak their minds. And this will only happen if the Americans who are quietly
convinced that guns are terrible speak out. Their wariness, as far
as I can tell, comes from two issues: a readiness to accept the Second
Amendment as a refutation, and a reluctance to impose “elite” culture on parts
of the country where guns are popular. (There are other reasons as well, not
least a fear of getting shot.) And there’s the extent to which it’s just so ingrained that banning guns is
impossible, legislatively and pragmatically, which dramatically weakens the anti-gun
position. The first issue
shouldn’t be so complicated. It doesn’t take specialized expertise in
constitutional law to understand that current U.S. gun law gets its parameters
from Supreme Court interpretations of the Second Amendment. But it’s right there in the First
Amendment that we don’t have to simply nod along with what follows. That the
Second Amendment has been liberally interpreted doesn’t prevent any of us from
saying it’s been misinterpreted, or that it should be repealed. When you find yourself
assuming that everyone who has a more nuanced (or just pro-gun) argument is
simply better read on the topic, remember that opponents of abortion aren’t
wondering whether they should have a more nuanced view of  abortion because of Roe v. Wade. They’re not keeping their opinions to themselves until
they’ve got a term paper’s worth of material proving that they’ve studied the
relevant case law. Then there is the
privilege argument. If you grew up somewhere in America where gun culture
wasn’t a thing (as is my situation; I’m an American living in Canada), or even
just in a family that would have never considered gun ownership, you’ll probably
be accused of looking down your nose at gun culture. As if gun ownership were
simply a cultural tradition to be respected, and not, you know, about owning guns. Guns… I mean, must it
really be spelled out what’s different? It’s absurd to reduce an anti-gun
position to a snooty aesthetic preference. There’s also a more progressive version of this argument, and a more contrarian
one, which involves suggesting that an anti-gun position is racist, because
crackdowns on guns are criminal-justice interventions. Progressives who might
have been able to brush off accusations of anti-rural-white classism may have a
tougher time confronting arguments about the disparate impact gun control
policies can have on marginalized communities. These, however, are
criticisms of certain tentative, insufficient gun control measures—the ones
that would leave small-town white families with legally-acquired guns well
enough alone, allowing them to shoot themselves or one another and to let their
guns enter the general population. Ban Guns, meanwhile,
is not discriminatory in this way. It’s not about dividing society into “good”
and “bad” gun owners. It’s about placing gun ownership itself in the “bad” category. It’s worth adding that the anti-gun
position is ultimately about police not carrying guns,
either. That could never happen, right? Well, certainly not if we keep on
insisting on its impossibility. Ask yourself this: Is
the pro-gun side concerned with how it comes
across? More to the point: Does the fact that someone opposes gun control
demonstrate that they’re culturally sensitive to the concerns of small-town
whites, as well as deeply committed to fighting police brutality against blacks
nationwide? I’m going to go with no and
no on these. (The NRA exists!) On the pro-gun-control
side of things, there’s far too much timidity. What’s needed to stop all gun
violence is a vocal ban guns contingent. Getting bogged down
in discussions of what’s feasible keeps what needs to happen—no more guns—from entering the realm of
possibility. Public opinion needs to shift. The no-guns stance needs to be an
identifiable place on the spectrum, embraced unapologetically, if it’s to be
reckoned with. Phoebe Maltz Bovy lives in Toronto, and is the author of The Perils of “Privilege.”"
http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2015/12/10/Planned-fake-mass-shooting-on-University-of-Texas-campus-moved/5961449761566/,"AUSTIN, Texas, Dec. 10 (UPI) -- A fake mass shooting demonstration by a gun rights group planned to take place at the University of Texas at Austin on Saturday has been moved off-campus.
The Come And Take It Texas group, also known as DontComply.com, decided to move the event to a location near the campus after the university warned demonstrators could face criminal trespassing charges. Event planners said they want participants to act out a mass shooting on campus with cardboard guns, fake blood and fake sounds of gunshots in an attempt to protest gun-free zones.

Short said the university's warning will only change the group's plans slightly.

Handguns must also be carried in a tight-grip holster that completely covers the trigger and trigger guard area. Semiautomatic handguns must be carried without a chambered round of ammunition.
The university also said fewer than 1 percent of students have gun licenses and 1 in every 500 students are older than 21. For the past 20 years, Texas law allowed people to carry concealed weapons on campus but not in buildings.

AUSTIN, Texas, Dec. 10 (UPI) -- A fake mass shooting demonstration by a gun rights group planned to take place at the University of Texas at Austin on Saturday has been moved off-campus. The Come And Take It Texas group, also known as DontComply.com, decided to move the event to a location near the campus after the university warned demonstrators could face criminal trespassing charges. Event planners said they want participants to act out a mass shooting on campus with cardboard guns, fake blood and fake sounds of gunshots in an attempt to protest gun-free zones.

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/127608209/0/phoenix/nation~Mock-mass-shooting-set-for-University-of-Texas/,"Plans for a mock mass shooting and a march of gun rights supporters openly packing heat are heating up finals week at the University of Texas-Austin. Come And Take It Texas, which claims 20,000 members, says on its Facebook page that the Life and Liberty Walk to End Gun-Free Zones is an effort to combat President Obama's ""gun confiscation agenda."" They are calling for an ""open carry walk with our rifles and legal black powder pistols."" ""Now is the time to stand up, take a walk, speak out against the lies and put an end to the gun-free killing zones,"" the group says in a Facebook post. Murdoch Pizgatti, founder of the gun rights group, told USA TODAY that gun rights supporters will march about eight blocks down a street adjacent to the university, then ""put our guns away."" The mock mass shooting will feature cardboard cutout guns and sound effects that can't be confused with actual gunfire, he said. ""We are not shouting 'fire!' in a theater,"" Pizgatti said. ""We are not going to start a riot."" The march and mock massacre initially were scheduled to take place on campus. Pizgatti said events were moved ""about 20 feet"" off campus after the school raised trespassing and other concerns. Some foes of the events are planning a ""mass farting"" protest nearby, even promising to provide ""fart blaster"" noisemakers. He said the mock shooting is designed to show how the outcome of a shooting rampage can be altered if people are armed. A college campus — Virginia Tech in Blacksburg — was the scene of one of the nation's bloodiest massacres in 2007 when a student fatally shot 32 people before committing suicide. The terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino have prompted calls for tighter controls on guns. Pizgatti, like most gun rights activists, rejects those proposals. ""Our focus is on gun-free zones,"" he said. ""They are blue-light specials for people who wish to do evil. Paris was a gun-free zone and those people were trapped (in the Bataclan Theater) for hours and just had to stand there waiting to be slaughtered."" Pizgatti and other gun rights supporters have been making gains in Texas. In January, the state becomes the 45 to allow modern handguns to be carried in plain view. And a law effective in August 2016  allows concealed guns to be carried in classroom, dorms and other buildings on the campuses of public universities, although it provides administrators with authority to create limited gun-free areas. The so-called ""campus carry"" law led to protests on campus. The advocacy group Gun Free UT is holding a walk Sunday to mark the third anniversary of a shooting spree that killed 26 students and staff at Sand Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. History professor Joan Neuberger, who helps lead Gun Free UT, told the Austin Statesman-American that the pro-gun rally is ill-timed and offensive. Holding the events during finals weeks, she told the newspaper, ""shows real disrespect for the feelings of students, faculty and staff who don’t want to have guns around them in the first place, but will be forced to put up with guns in public places in 2016."""
http://www.ibtimes.com/obama-gun-control-plan-2015-white-house-ready-pass-weapons-restrictions-without-2220473,"President Barack Obama is taking steps to expand background checks on gun sales — without congressional approval, the Associated Press reported Thursday. Obama's advisers are completing the proposal that could close the so-called “gun show loophole” that allows people to purchase guns at shows and online without a background check. Obama has frequently called for tougher gun laws, including after a recent terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, that left 14 people dead. The guns used in the mass shooting were purchased legally, and it's unlikely the proposal being considered by the White House would have prevented the shooters from acquiring weapons. Obama could also use his executive authority to create a set number of guns sold or limit the amount of money that a person can pull in from gun sales. In the past, Obama has called on Congress to ban semi-automatic rifles deemed “assault rifles” and prohibit people on the “no-fly” federal terror watch list from getting guns. ""This is not normal; this is something that we can change, and we’re going to change it,"" he said after a white gunman murdered nine black people attending evening prayer services at a South Carolina church over the summer. More recently, after an October shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon left nine dead and several others injured, Obama appeared visibly angry over the nation's gun laws. “Our thoughts and prayers are not enough. It’s not enough,” Obama said hours after the shooting. “It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel. And it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America — next week or a couple of months from now.” Obama's executive actions on guns could be overturned by the next president, and Republican candidates have already vowed to do just that if elected. “We’re going to be un-signing a lot of executive orders,” Republican front-runner Donald Trump has said."

Uncovering and explaining how our digital world is changing — and changing us. A group representing developers from top tech companies including Facebook and Google warned Congress Thursday that any move to weaken encryption on consumer devices would “expose our most personal and sensitive data.” The Application Developers Alliance issued a statement saying that any solution that includes a backdoor, even if it’s intended for use by trusted government entities, will only weaken security and leave users vulnerable to hackers and other bad actors seeking access to private information. “End-to-end encryption is good for the American people and should be supported by law enforcement authorities worldwide,” the group said in a statement. “The goal of making it more difficult for bad actors to conspire over the Internet is laudable. However, Congress must carefully consider the consequences of weakening security, which will erode the public’s trust in our digital ecosystem and could expose our most personal and sensitive data.” The statement comes in response to renewed calls this week for Silicon Valley companies to decode encrypted communications for law enforcement, following last week’s mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. The couple who launched the attack had devices with some form of encryption, ABC reported, citing senior U.S. officials. In testimony Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary committee, FBI Director James B. Comey said investigators were unable to read more than 109 text messages exchanged by the attackers in a shooting last May in Garland, Texas, because the exchange with a known terrorist was encrypted.

White House adviser Valerie Jarrett says the president has asked his team to complete a proposal and submit it for his review “in short order.” She says the recommendations will include measures to expand background checks. Jarrett spoke Wednesday night at a vigil for the victims of the Newtown shooting, according to a summary provided by the White House. After the mass shooting in Roseburg, Oregon, Obama said his team was looking for ways to tighten gun laws without a vote in Congress. White House officials have said they’re exploring closing the so-called “gun show loophole” that allows people to buy weapons at gun shows and online without a background check. It’s almost certain that Jarrett is referring to the same plan that Obama has been flirting with for a while: To redefine “gun dealer” so that the ATF can go after a handful of people who sell multiple firearms privately. Frankly, that plan is a big nothing. As I explained a month or so ago: Even if we presume that the plan is both legal and workable — and, given how tightly both USC18§921 and USC18§922 are written, I am as skeptical as the president was a few hours ago — the benefits would be microscopic. Were Obama to change the regulations, the Post confirms, he would ensnare only “those dealers who sell at least 50 guns annually” — a tiny fraction of those who sell firearms on the private market. He would not be “closing the gun-show loophole”; he would not be “extending background checks to private sales”; and he would not be elongating the three-day period during which the government is able to search for disqualifying information. Nor, for that matter, would he be banning a single “assault” weapon, limiting even one magazine, or confiscating even a part of a gun. He’d be posturing, and uncomfortably at that. Moreover, the clock is not in Obama’s favor here. The Administrative Procedure Act requires that the new “rule” be presented for notice and comment before becoming active. That means that, if Obama follows the law, he probably won’t get this done by the time he leaves office. And if he doesn’t follow the law? Well, then he risks being slapped down by a federal court. As for the proposal itself, a serious statutory challenge is all but inevitable. Unless Obama has something else up his sleeve I wouldn’t worry too much about this. He’s playing to the cameras and to the ignorant. Get our conservative analysis delivered right to you. No charge. © 2021 National Review Newsletters © 2021 National Review"

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)  COVINA  — On the morning of Dec. 2, Yvette Velasco got dressed up and flat-ironed her hair. It was an important day: The 27-year-old was going to receive the gold badge officially recognizing her as a San Bernardino County Department of Public Health inspector at a holiday work event. 
The world now knows what happened: Co-worker Syed Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik stormed into the gathering, opening fire on his colleagues. Velasco and 13 others were killed in what the FBI is investigating as an act of terrorism. 
On Thursday — one week and a day after the massacre — Velasco will be remembered in an outdoor funeral, at a spot on a hill chosen by her three older sisters and parents in remembrance of her love of nature. The ceremony will mark the start of a grim procession expected to take place throughout Southern California over the next week: About a dozen memorials, funerals and burials for those killed in the attack. 
“She was more than our sister,” Velasco’s sister Erica Porteous, 37, said, choking up. “She was our soul mate.”  


For the tight-knit Velasco family, the last week has felt like “a living nightmare,” Porteous said. Velasco was the baby in the family, the one her sisters all remember excitedly bringing home from the hospital and watching grow up. None of them knew she was expecting to be at the Inland Regional Center that morning. She didn’t like to call attention to herself, and only mentioned a badge ceremony casually to her mother, her sisters said. 
The only hint they had she was at a work gathering came from a Snapchat she sent her sister Adriana Velasco, 38. The message had a photo of her hand wrapped around a Starbucks cup and a few words mentioning a holiday party. 
“Lucky,” Adriana Velasco replied. 
Less than an hour later, Yvette Velasco’s relatives started hearing reports of a shooting in San Bernardino. Genevieve Tovar, 32, sent her sisters and parents a message telling them to be careful. The shooters were still on the loose. Porteous turned on the television and realized the building under siege was often used for county meetings. She sent a text message to a friend, asking if she knew which department was gathering there that day. 
The reply sparked concern: Environmental health.  


Velasco had just recently passed the exam to become a state registered environmental health specialist. She’d spent the last five years working her way up at the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health, starting off in vector control, collecting mosquitoes hovering near backyard pools and dirty puddles for disease testing, and eventually becoming an environmental health specialist, a job that sent her around the county inspecting restaurants. 
It was a job she was passionate about: Even at home, she’d chide her sisters when they left out food for too long. 
When the family learned it was Velasco’s department meeting at the Inland Regional Center and that she’d sent a Snapchat from a holiday party that morning, they began to panic. Her father and a brother-in-law went to every hospital receiving shooting victims. Her sisters called every hospital in the region. The next morning, Velasco’s father, a retired California Highway Patrol lieutenant, called his daughters upstairs and told them to pray. 
“We ask God to give us the strength to face whatever is in store for us,” he said. 
The week that has followed has brought days of shock and a list of somber preparations they didn’t ever imagine taking for a little sister: Making funeral arrangements and picking photos of a smiling Velasco at birthdays and weddings for a reception slideshow. 
“Sometimes I don’t even feel like getting up,” Porteous said. “I still can’t fully accept it.” 
More details have come to light about who killed Velasco and her co-workers. FBI Director James Comey said Wednesday Farook and Malik had embraced radical Islamic ideology for at least two years. What exactly motivated them and why they chose to open fire on a work event remains under investigation. 
Velasco’s sisters feel certain they know what she would want in the attack’s aftermath.

December 10, 2015 Two gun rights groups in Texas have planned a mock mass shooting event on Saturday in order to raise awareness about their view of the relationship between gun rights and mass shooting casualties. They believe that by increasing open carry rights, mass shootings can be reduced or even prevented. Gun control advocates have been vocal about their desire to enact new restrictions on ownership of certain kinds of guns in the wake of two mass shootings in Colorado Springs, Colo., and San Bernardino, Calif., in less than a week. The groups hosting the mock shooting event say that it will demonstrate how the intervention of responsible gun owners can reduce the number of lives lost in a mass shooting scenario. The two groups, Come and Take it Texas and Dontcomply.com, had originally planned to hold their event at the University of Texas but later moved the event off campus after meeting with university officials. A Facebook announcement of the decision said that UT “will be the backdrop to this event."" The university said in a statement that the Austin campus does not permit outside groups staging demonstrations, and that the groups could be arrested for trespassing. ""When outside individuals come on campus and violate our rules regarding use of our grounds and facilities, they are asked to leave. If they do not, it becomes a criminal trespass matter,"" university spokesman J.B. Bird told The Associated Press. The planned demonstration, “Life And Liberty Event To End Gun Free Zones,” coincides with final exams, and several students wrote on the event’s Facebook page also requesting that the event be moved off-campus. The organizing groups say that the purpose of the protest is to “stand up, take a walk, and put pressure on politicians to ban Gun Free Zones.” They believe that restrictions on carrying guns in public places contributes to mass shootings. Current laws regarding carrying weapons on university campuses are already scheduled to change in Texas. This past June, Gov. Greg Abbott signed the so-called “campus carry” bill into law, which would allow license holders to carry concealed handguns on public university campuses in the state, beginning in August 2016. Although the bill states that public universities would have some authority to regulate the carrying and storage of handguns, it has been met with considerable resistance by both students and faculty. Several academic departments and schools on the Austin campus have banded together to form “Gun Free UT,” a university-wide movement hoping to ensure that the campus carry bill is repealed.

The presence of guns, or even their potential presence, would create an atmosphere of fear and intimidation that would impede our ability to teach,” faculty members of the UT math department said in a recent statement.

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s hard for the world to figure out. We’re run by a church, but we’re not only for church members and we’re not about converting people. We’re known as being fair even as the world becomes as polarized as at any time since the newspaper’s founding in 1908. We have a mission beyond circulation, we want to bridge divides.

Carlos Villanueva, 27, was eventually arrested while attempting to flee from authorities. Law enforcement had surrounded the home he had re-entered after firing the shots that initially worried locals. Others exiting the house refused to co-operate with investigators on the scene. He was taken in on ""suspicion of discharging a firearm in a negligent manner, assault with a deadly weapon/firearm and criminal threats."" As of now, there's no evidence he planned any sort of violent action; and thus, ""Garden Grove shooting"" appears to have been more of a scare than anything else.  — KTLA (@KTLA) December 10, 2015  — KTLA (@KTLA) December 10, 2015  #BreakingNews https://t.co/ON38KonLuP Several Garden Grove, Calif., schools on modified lockdown after shots fire… https://t.co/5n4hUsewLy — anti-inertia (@antiinertia) December 10, 2015  #BreakingNews https://t.co/ON38KonLuP Several Garden Grove, Calif., schools on modified lockdown after shots fire… https://t.co/5n4hUsewLy — anti-inertia (@antiinertia) December 10, 2015  Ernest O.

http://www.twincities.com/localnews/ci_29231452/average-twin-cities-guy-maybe-but-hes-taking?source=rss,"GET BREAKING NEWS IN YOUR BROWSER. CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: Mohamed Ahmed wants you to think he’s perfectly ordinary.
In a lot of ways, he is. He’s a married, middle-aged man with four kids. He dropped out of college. He spends his days managing a gas station in Minneapolis and his nights hounding his kids about homework. He loves the Mall of America and “The Simpsons.”
But then there is the glaring example of how he’s not. The Somali-American Minneapolis resident is trying to stand up to the Islamic State group, often from a cigar shop in St. Paul, armed with only a computer and his ideas.
The shop is where Ahmed, 40, does most of his brainstorming for Average Mohamed, the online campaign he launched four years ago to combat the recruitment efforts of Islamic extremists with bite-size “counternarrative” cartoons he creates and posts on his website and on YouTube.  


His work has been covered by news organizations across the country, including USA Today, the New York Times and Huffington Post. 
While the amount of time and money he’s invested in the project point to at least a few degrees of separation from average, Ahmed says he chose the name Average Mohamed to help others in the local Somali community and Muslims worldwide realize they don’t need special credentials to get involved in the fight against ISIS. 
“We are living in a First World nation, a great nation, and it upsets me that (a few) people are willing to leave this and pick up a gun and go kill other people,” Ahmed said recently from a coffeeshop in Minneapolis. “It’s imperative we Muslims do something beyond just condemning. … We need to take action. … I want people to see what (I’m doing) and say, ‘Look, he is the guy who serves coffee at the gas station … ordinary as dirt … and he is doing this. … So what can I do?’ ” 
For his part, the polished public speaker has homed in on the spread of ideas, using his cartoons to try to reach 8- to 16-year-old Muslim boys and girls in the United States with his anti-extremism message. The hope is to get to them before the tiny number vulnerable to radicalization encounter the Islamic State’s propaganda instead.
Some 70 people have been arrested in the U.S. since March 2014 on charges related to aiding the Islamic State group — 56 this year — including six young Somali-American men from Minnesota charged in April.  


Authorities say the couple responsible for the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., had been radicalized. The Paris terrorist attacks last month were carried out by individuals working on behalf of ISIS.
Both tragedies reinforce the importance of Ahmed’s mission, he said. 
“It takes an idea to defeat an idea. You can’t bomb it out. You can’t shoot it out,” he said of his work. “My goal is to indoctrinate the youth before the (radicalization) process starts, to give them three or four issues they can stand on when the recruiter comes.”
Asked about GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump’s recent suggestion that America temporarily bar Muslims from entering the U.S., Ahmed, a Republican, said Trump’s statements do not reflect the country he’s called home for close to two decades. 
“A leader serves all people irrespective of their religion, sexual orientation or color. Our constitution is designed to empower … individual Americans with freedoms that are inalienable. That is why America is the greatest country in the world. Lumping all of Islam with extremism is a disservice to intellect, humanity and American freedoms. We are proud Americans; we love our country. But what (Trump is) proposing is second-class rights for American Muslims.”
UNUSUAL MEANS TO AN IMPORTANT END
It’s not lost on Ahmed that cartoons seem like an unusual medium to use against a terrorist organization known for brutal violence. 
But he said cartoons pack a punch. They have broad appeal, are cheap to produce — about $1,000 a pop — and allow him to tackle a lot of material quickly. Most videos are less than two minutes. 
With titles such as “The Bullet or the Ballot” and “A Muslim in the West,” his roughly 20 cartoons attempt to expose ways extremists twist teachings of the Quran to serve their own agenda, while simultaneously reinforcing the core tenets of Islam, a religion of peace, Ahmed said. 
One cartoon tackles identity and shows Average Mohamed — the central figure in each video — talking with a kid who says he feels “mixed up sometimes” about whether he should identify with the part of himself that is black, African, Muslim, American or Somali. 
Average Mohamed, to whom Ahmed lends his own voice, tells him he does not have to choose.
“Don’t let the extremists confuse you,” he says in the cartoon. “They say a Muslim has to reject all identities except the one they try to define for you. But they do not know you, and that is not Islam. Islam is many things, all colors, all races, all nationalities. Islam accepts them all and tells us to live in harmony and peace.”
“We try and lay it out for the youth in a way nobody else is,” Ahmed explained. “We say, ‘This is what suicide bombers believe, and here is why that’s bad; this is what we believe.’ ”
After researching content for each video, he has the concepts vetted by a local imam. Then he sends his storyboards to a cartoonist in Southeast Asia who does the animation. 
Aside from a small grant from a London organization last year and some private donations, Ahmed has so far largely funded the project on his own. He estimates he’s spent tens of thousands on the venture, a figure that troubles his wife, who is also concerned about threats commenters occasionally make online about his work.
He doesn’t see himself getting scared away from it, though. 
A proud citizen of the United States with a deep respect for its freedoms, he says he is compelled to do it as an American and as a Muslim. 
“I am duty-bound,” he said.
GROWING POPULARITY
His cartoons are reaching a growing audience, Ahmed said, noting that Google Analytics indicate his last five garnered more than 100,000 views combined. 
He speculates part of his success is due to his insider status as a Muslim. 
“We are talking to Muslims; we are not talking at Muslims,” Ahmed said. “When someone comes from outside the religion and says believe in this, don’t believe in that … there is a moralistic high-horse attitude that is harming the effort.” 
His campaign took a step forward last year when he formed a nonprofit and a board of directors. He has since started visiting area schools with his message. 
Erroll Southers, director of homegrown violent extremism studies at the University of Southern California and a former FBI agent, sits on Ahmed’s Average Mohamed board, as does former Ramsey County Sheriff Bob Fletcher and four others. 
Southers said his colleague’s work is unique in that it targets young kids with a medium as relatable as “SpongeBob” and is available online, a key element considering the presence of extremists on social media. 
“It’s sort of like teaching elementary children about fire safety and wearing seat belts. … To me, the idea behind this is no different,” Southers said. “It’s about prevention, and we hope they will never need it, but if they do, we have given them something to think about.”
Though the effectiveness of his work is difficult to measure, the “celebrity-like” status Ahmed has among some local kids is a good sign, Southers said. 
Peg Mahon, a teacher at Roosevelt High School in Minneapolis, said you could have heard “a pin drop” when he spoke to her class last year. 
When he returned a second time, she said, students lined up for his autograph. 
“He is so dynamic and very well-educated and passionate … the kids were just awestruck,” Mahon said. 
OTHER EFFORTS
Ahmed is one of several individuals and organizations working directly or indirectly to combat violent extremism and create opportunities for Somali youth in the Twin Cities.
Home to the largest Somali population in the U.S., Minnesota has been a focus of recruitment efforts by overseas terrorist organizations such as ISIS since al-Shabaab — a Somali-based terrorist group — first targeted the area in 2006, according to the Minnesota U.S. attorney’s office. 
After the Twin Cities was named one of three pilot areas by the federal government that would receive funding to build programming aimed at combating radicalization, an increasing number of efforts to combat extremism have popped up in the Twin Cities. 
Some are after-school programs for Somali youth, while others offer educational support, job training and other services to ensure young people are successful and thus less vulnerable to recruitment tactics. 
Ben Petok, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office — a partner on some of the efforts — said it’s important to keep the threat in perspective.
“This is a thriving and peaceful community, of which only a very few members have engaged in criminal activity related to terrorism,” he said. 
He added that any attempt at thwarting radicalization is always welcome.
“It is commendable that people like the Average Mohamed and others … are investing their own time and resources to offer positive narratives designed to counter ISIS recruiting efforts,” Petok said.
Mohamud Noor, director of the Confederation of Somali Community in Minnesota, said the reach of Average Mohamed is limited and is only one piece of a complicated puzzle. 
“He is offering something of value, but the process of addressing recruitment requires a comprehensive approach,” Noor said. “It’s all hands on deck.”
WHAT’S NEXT
Despite the seriousness of his mission, Ahmed can’t stop grinning as he talks about the future of his work.
If he can keep cobbling together funding, which isn’t easy, the self-proclaimed optimist who arrived in Minnesota 14 years ago says he has plans to work with local kids on cartoons, develop a curriculum for classrooms and build an app.
Being around his children keeps him motivated, he said. 
“We live in a hand-me-down-society … and I have to do my part in that,” he said. “I am so hopeful that they will live in a better world because I am willing to work on it.”

http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/10/obama-background-checks-guns-executive-action-gun-show-loophole,"White House says it is also exploring so-called gun show loophole as House Democrats push to have federal ban on gun violence research funding lifted Last modified on Wed 26 Feb 2020 18.02 GMT Barack Obama has ordered officials to draw up an urgent new plan to strengthen background checks on gun buyers without the approval of Congress. The president has asked his advisers to complete a proposal and submit it for his review, White House adviser Valerie Jarrett said.  “The president has directed his team in short order to finalise a set of recommendations on what more the administration can do on its own to save lives from gun violence, and those recommendations will include making sure we do everything we can to keep guns out of the wrong hands, including those expanded background checks,” Jarrett told a national gun violence vigil in Washington. After the mass shooting in Roseburg, Oregon in October, Obama indicated he was looking for ways to boost gun laws without a vote in Congress. On Thursday, the White House spokesman, Josh Earnest, said the review that Jarrett referred to had been under way for “the past couple of months” but claimed there was now increased appetite for fresh reform attempts among the US public in the recent weeks. “These are essentially recommendations that the president has asked for from his staff based on their review of available executive authority,” Earnest told reporters on Thursday. “The working assumption of this ongoing review is that Congress hasn’t acted and that’s been the source of immense frustration on the part of the president,” he added. “So given the congressional inaction, the question that’s been raised is what more can the Obama administration do, and that’s the substance of this review.” White House officials have said they are exploring closing the so-called gun show loophole that allows people to buy weapons at gun shows and online without a background check. Earnest also revealed that the vice-president, Joe Biden, had been in conversation with state and local politicians across the US to encourage them to take more unilateral steps to curb gun sales too. “We have been actively engaged with leaders across the country about steps they can take to protect their communities from gun violence,” he said. Jarrett told Wednesday night’s vigil: “Americans are mobilising. Two weeks ago I met at the White House with a group of gun owners who believe in the need for change. Many were former NRA [National Rifle Association] members who made clear to me that the NRA no longer represents them, and they assured me that many more gun owners were feeling the same.” Separately on Thursday, Connecticut’s governor, Dan Malloy, announced that he would sign an executive order to bar people on the government’s terrorism watch lists from buying guns in the state. The move came ahead of next week’s third anniversary of the shooting of 20 young children and six of their adult carers at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. Meanwhile, House Democrats have launched a fresh effort to take on the powerful gun lobby, demanding an end to a 17-year ban on government-funded research into violence involving firearms. Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, announced the initiative on Thursday at an emotional press conference at Capitol Hill in Washington. Pelosi complained that America’s gun control debate has been skewed for years because of a lack of public data. She said Democrats will insist that the research ban, the work of former Republican congressman Jay Dickey, be removed from law as part of the $1.1tn omnibus bill that Congress needs to pass by next week to avoid a government shutdown. Dickey himself has since admitted that he was wrong about the measure, Pelosi said. “We must insist that we cannot have a bill leave the station that still has that ban on research in it,” she added to applause. “Our priority is to remove the ban on research on gun violence. Let’s do it today.” Pelosi declined to comment directly on whether the measure would be a dealbreaker for the crucial budget. “This is something that has universal acceptance, so let us take it one step at a time,” she replied. “The bill has so many problems, they should welcome this as a gift … It would be the easiest thing in the world for them to take that piece of legislation out of the bill, and then we could find out. Why would we not want data, why would we not want information, so we can make a judgment about how we move forward? “This bill today would say to the NRA you no longer have a stranglehold on information, on data, on research, on how we can make the change that is necessary. Once we have the data, we are better prepared to act upon it.” Three years after Sandy Hook, Democrats have got nowhere with proposed measures to strengthen background checks on gun buyers, stop people on the FBI’s no-fly list from purchasing firearms or create a select committee on the issue, while the same period has seen an estimated 90,000 gun deaths and more than 1,000 mass shootings. The Dickey amendment, they believe, provides a more tangible and achievable target. Speaking at Thursday’s press conference, Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said: “Drawing this line and saying this measure and its removal is a priority is profoundly significant. The gun lobby has a stranglehold … and one of their arguments is, ‘You don’t have the facts, you don’t have data.’ The reason there’s no data is this prohibition against the United States of America collecting facts and research. “In a public health crisis, the most important treasure is facts, knowledge, evidence. We face a public health crisis. If the Center for Disease Control were prohibited from collecting information about Ebola, think of the outcry. That’s in effect what we are doing here. We are prohibiting the United States from getting information about a lethal threat to the people of America.” Blumenthal added: “Thirty thousand people falling sick as a result of a public epidemic, dying as a result, is a public health crisis. We have in this nation, truly, an epidemic of gun deaths and gun disease that is taking lives – 90 of them – every day, and should be treated as a public health crisis.” The politicians were joined by dozens of survivors and victims’ family members holding photos of men, women and children slain by guns. One mother broke down at the podium and could then be heard sobbing in a corridor. Pelosi, clearly moved, placed a comforting hand on her arm. Along with still raw grief, families and politicians expressed rising anger at Congress’s failure to pass any legislation three years after Sandy Hook. Christian Heyne, 29, whose mother was made to beg for her life before being killed by a gunman a decade ago, held a up a picture of her said: “This is what gun violence looks like. This is my mother and this is a picture that I gave to her on one of the last trips we took together. Gun violence looks like my wedding day when as I’m watching my wife walk down the aisle, and as it’s one of the most emotional days of my life, I know that my mom will never know who she is, she’ll never know my wife. “Gun violence to me is knowing that when I have children, they will never know their grandmother. Gun violence is just knowing that when I want to hop on the phone and give her a call to tell her how my day want, I’ll never have that opportunity again. That’s what gun violence looks like and that’s what the cost of inaction is.” Charged with emotion, Senator Chris Murphy, also from Connecticut, said thoughts and prayers are not meaningless, “but my religion involves partnering faith with action. What I believe is that it isn’t enough any longer to just say we care; you have to do something to show you care. And while we have disagreements about whether the right response is a ban on military-style assault weapons or more protections to make sure criminals don’t get guns or a fix to our broken mental health system, the one option that we cannot take is to do absolutely nothing, and that’s what we’ve done. “In the wake of the slaughter of 20 little first-graders in Newtown, Connecticut, and the slaughter of 80 more every single day, Congress has done absolutely nothing. And that’s maybe what’s most offensive to me. Behind me are dozens of grieving families, and by this time tomorrow there will be 80 other families who could join them in this room, and 80 more the day after. How cold-hearted is this place to look these families in the eye and do absolutely nothing?” He added: “It’s time for us to figure out what message we can send that we’re serious about this and to end a silence that has made Congress complicit in these ongoing murders.”"
http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-church-gun-violence-vigils-met-20151210-story.html,"Laddi Singh said she had never stepped inside a church until this week. But Singh felt she had to act when, following the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., she heard friends at her Sikh temple talking about whether they should hire extra security to protect themselves. So late Wednesday, she sat in a church pew for the first time, holding aloft a candle in solidarity with about 50 others in a Palatine house of worship — a gesture signaling she would commit to help end gun violence. There were about a dozen events in Illinois and hundreds nationwide in conjunction with the National Vigil for All Victims of Gun Violence on Wednesday in Washington, D.C., and organized by the Newtown Foundation. There are vigils nationwide through Dec. 14, the third anniversary of the mass shooting that killed 26 children and staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. Singh, along with several others in the audience inside Deer Park Seventh-Day Adventist Church, wiped tears while listening to three Illinois mothers describe how they lost their children to gun violence — one at a restaurant on Chicago's Northwest Side in 1993, one at a South Side intersection in 2012 and another at the mass shooting at Northern Illinois University in 2008. As the mothers spoke, a screen above them flashed the faces, many now familiar, of those who've lost their lives to gun violence: the teens and teacher massacred at Columbine High School, the first-graders shot at Sandy Hook, the 14 people killed last week in San Bernardino, the 12 who died in a Colorado movie theater, the five students slain at NIU, the nine gunned down at Emanuel AME Church in South Carolina, the six killed at a Wisconsin Sikh temple, and individual deaths — Trayvon Martin, Rekia Boyd, Laquan McDonald and Tyshawn Lee. ""You're seeing all these young kids dying because we don't have any control over guns,"" said Singh, 42, of Palatine. ""We have to do something."" She said she's close with the families of those slain in 2012 at the Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wis., and fears that her husband and son, who are Sikh and wear turbans, will be targets for harassment. At the vigil in Palatine, two miles north of the former site of Brown's Chicken & Pasta, where six people were shot and one stabbed to death in 1993, the Rev. Larry Bullock called on churches to not stand silent about gun violence. He's the founder and senior pastor of Living Faith Cathedral Worship Center Church, which also has worship services at the Palatine vigil site. ""Silence is not an option for us. We must speak out,"" he said. ""… If the church doesn't stand for something, then what good are we? What are we worth? What's it all about? The churches must take the moral leadership."" Myra Onesimus, an elder at Living Faith, which organized the Palatine vigil with Northwest Suburbs Organizing for Action, said the regularity of gun violence should prompt people to action. ""I think with the culmination of the events of this year ... it simply has gotten to a point where we're all feeling overwhelmed,"" she said. ""Even if it doesn't touch our families personally, if you have a heart, and you see it on the news, it touches you."" Alice Thomas-Norris, whose daughter, Rolanda LaKesia Marshall, died at 14 when she was struck by a bullet in a drive-by shooting at a Beefee restaurant in Chicago, recalled seeing bullet casings scattered across the floor of the crime scene. Her voice wavered with emotion as she spoke about the void left by the slaying of her child. All three mothers spoke of how losing their children to gun violence drew them into activism. Mary Kay Mace, whose daughter, Ryanne Mace, 19, of Carpentersville, was killed in the NIU shootings, has been advocating for ""stronger, smarter gun laws."" Mary Long, whose son Eric Williams died at 25 in a South Side shooting, started Sacred Ground Ministries to connect urban and suburban communities to provide mentorship to youths in schools near the crime scene. Thomas-Norris has spent the past two decades, in part through an organization called Purpose Over Pain, reaching out to other parents whose children have been killed by gun violence. ""I wanted to know, 'How could I live again?' ... Because I didn't want to live,"" Thomas-Norris, of Oak Park, said of the months after her daughter's slaying, which remains unsolved. ""I thought of ways I could kill myself, and God kept telling me, 'No, you can't do that.' … He gave me this ministry to reach out to other parents because I wanted to reach out to other parents and tell them that they could live.""

Every Monday Connecticut is moving to keep people on government watch lists from obtaining gun permits, a move President Obama has urged Congress to take at the federal level. However, the idea has drawn criticism from both sides of the gun debate. December 10, 2015 A week after the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., the gun-control debate has reopened, this time with renewed focus placed on the availability of guns to people currently being monitored by the United States government for possible terrorist connections. In a national address following the tragedy, President Obama said, “Congress should act to make sure no one on a no-fly list is able to buy a gun. What could possibly be the argument for allowing a terrorist suspect to buy a semi-automatic weapon? This is a matter of national security.” However, to critics, including some self-described liberals, the question of restricting the Second Amendment rights of individuals included on watch lists is not so black and white. One concern is the potential to introduce wrongful surveillances practices into a functioning democracy. Another is the fact that there is no way to prevent someone who is not a terrorist from inadvertently ending up on the list, as happened to former Sen. Edward Kennedy (D) of Massachusetts in 2004. Restrictions on gun purchases for people on the no-fly list would also not have stopped the perpetrators of the San Bernardino attacks; neither were on the federal terrorism watch list. Congress voted down one measure to prohibit individuals on no-fly lists from obtaining gun permits, part of a broader measure that would have also instituted other restrictions on gun purchases, including wider background checks. This has prompted officials in Connecticut to take steps to restrict the ability of individuals on the no-fly list to purchase guns, ahead of what they perceive as Congress’s inaction. Democratic Governor Dannel P. Malloy (D) said in an address Thursday that he would seek to limit the ability of people on watch lists to purchase guns. He said that he would work with federal law enforcement to determine which lists will be crosschecked during background checks for gun permits. ""If you cannot fly due to being on a watch list, you shouldn't be able to purchase a firearm,"" Gov. Malloy said. ""Since Congress so far as failed to act, we will."" Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. A spokesman said that the governor planned to issue an executive order on the issue, and is working directly with the White House to gain access to the no-fly lists. Connecticut already has some of the strictest gun laws in the US. Following the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in which 20 young children and 6 adults were killed, the state passed broad gun-control laws that limited the sale of high-capacity gun magazines and required background checks for private gun sales, among other requirements.

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in.

http://www.inquisitr.com/2623112/guns-in-dorms-a-disturbing-new-trend/,"The possession of guns in dorms and on campus is prohibited at most universities, even with a concealed carry permit. That trend may be changing, as Liberty University takes another step toward allowing students the freedom to defend themselves by keeping guns in their rooms. The Christian University, based in Lynchburg, Virginia, has allowed visitors and students to carry guns on campus since 2011, but the weapons were not allowed in the dorms. President Jerry Falwell Jr. announced to a crowd of students at the Friday night convocation that the University would be amending its rules. This comes partially in response to the recent mass shooting in San Bernardino County, California, in which 14 people were killed. Since then, many students had requested that the campus ""gun-free"" zone be repealed. Falwell urged the students to arm themselves to help deter such attacks.  According to Falwell, most of the students who are old enough to obtain a permit do not live on campus, so the impact would be limited. Yet, not all college campuses will be quick to allow guns in their dorms. Texas law requires public universities to allow concealed carry holders to bring their guns onto campus beginning August 1, 2016. This date is the 50th anniversary of the 1966 shooting at UT Austin, when Charles Whitman climbed up the campus clock tower and then proceeded to kill 16 people. In response to the new gun law, the University of Texas put together a 19-member committee, called the Campus Carry Policy Working Group, to evaluate and propose rules regarding the availability of firearms on campus. This task force, consisting of staff, students, and faculty, just released its recommendations on how to interpret and follow the new gun law. The Star-Telegram reported on the new publication.  Although the right of the people to keep and bear arms has been protected by the Second Amendment since December 15, 1791, it is still quite a divisive subject. Allowing our college students and those that work with them to carry weapons on a campus is disturbing to many, hopeful to others. It comes down to whether you feel we are safer as a society if everyone is armed, or only the authorities. Do you think colleges and universities should allow guns in dorms and on campuses throughout our country? [Photo by Bill Pugliano/Getty Images]"

              since Disclosures of her overtures to extremists abroad surfaced as the investigation of the Dec. 2 shooting rampage in San Bernardino, about 60 miles (100 km) east of Los Angeles, took a new turn with divers searching a small lake near the scene of the massacre. The number of organizations that Malik, 29, tried to contact and how she sought to reach them were unclear, but the groups almost certainly included al Qaeda’s Syria-based official affiliate, the Nusrah Front, the government sources said. FBI Director James Comey has said Malik and Farook declared at about the time of their attack that they were acting on behalf of Islamic State, which in turn has embraced the couple as among its followers. But U.S. government sources have said there was no evidence that the Islamic State even knew of the couple before the killings. Militant groups sought out by Malik likely ignored her approaches because they have become extremely wary of responding to outsiders they do not know or who have not been introduced to them, sources said. The husband and wife were killed in a shootout with police hours after they opened fire with assault rifles at a holiday gathering of Farook's co-workers at the Inland Regional Center social services agency in San Bernardino. Fourteen people were killed, and the number of wounded was raised to 22 on Thursday from 21 after a woman injured in the assault came forward, officials said. The FBI said it is treating the shooting attack as an act of terrorism. If the massacre proves to have been the work of killers inspired by Islamic militants, it would mark the deadliest such attack on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2011. On Thursday a team of divers from the FBI and San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department began searching the waters of Seccombe Lake Park, about 2-1/2 miles (4 km) north of the Inland Regional Center, seeking additional clues in the mass shooting. The search of the lake, which could last for days, stemmed from an unspecified lead ""indicating that the subjects came into this area"" on the day of the attack, said David Bowdich, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office. ""We put a dive team into the lake as a logical part of that lead."" Bowdich said he would not discuss the “specific evidence we’re looking for,” but said it was essentially “anything that had to do with this particular crime.” He added: ""We may come up with nothing."" CNN reported they sought a computer hard drive that belonged to the couple. The attack by Farook, the U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, a Pakistani native he married in Saudi Arabia last year, has heightened security concerns in the United States and become an issue in the U.S. presidential campaign. Comey, along with U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and John Mulligan, deputy director of the National Counterterrorism Center, briefed members of both houses of Congress on Thursday about the investigation in closed, classified sessions. ""The current impression is that these two people were acting alone,"" U.S. Senator Angus King of Maine told CNN after the briefing. But he added that he was troubled by the fact that the couple had tried to cover their tracks by destroying their cellphones and other electronic equipment.

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/127690735/0/phoenix/local~FBI-Phoenix-gunman-texted-overseas-terrorist-times-before-May-attack-in-Texas/,"FBI Director James Comey revealed for the first time that one of the two Phoenix gunmen killed  in May outside a Prophet  Mohammed cartoon contest in Garland, Texas, while trying to commit a terrorist attack had sent 109 messages that same morning to an overseas terrorist. The FBI still hasn't been able to determine what the encrypted messages said, Comey disclosed while testifying Thursday at a Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing in Washington, D.C. Comey was trying to illustrate ongoing concerns that law-enforcement officials investigating counterterrorism and criminal cases are unable to unlock encrypted messages sent on smartphones, rendering court orders to obtain that information ineffective. He called on tech companies to develop a ""business model"" that allows law-enforcement officials to access de-encrypted messages when legally authorized while still protecting privacy concerns. AZCENTRAL How a terror hunt led to 5 Phoenix men ""We have no idea what he said, because those messages were encrypted. And to this day I can’t tell you what he said with that terrorist 109 times the morning of that attack. That is a big problem. We have to grapple with it,"" Comey told senators. U.S. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., who sits on the Judiciary Committee, said the FBI has been raising concerns about the inability to access encrypted messages but this was the first time Comey offered a specific example. He said he shares Comey's concerns. While still being sensitive to privacy concerns, Flake said, ""we obviously would like to know who these people are talking to when it's a serious investigation that has gone far beyond just probable cause. You want to know because you want to head off future attacks and prosecute those that you are dealing with."" Comey's disclosure came during a hearing that primarily focused on last week's mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.Comey disclosed that the couple who carried out the California attack were radicalized at least two years ago. Comey said he wouldn't comment on whether encrypted texts were used to plan that attack or the one last month in Paris. He also didn't provide any information on the overseas recipient of the Garland texts. AZCENTRAL Elton Simpson's slow, isolated descent into ISIS, jihad In May,  armed with assault-style rifles, Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi wounded a security officer outside a ""draw the prophet"" cartoon contest intended to lampoon the Prophet  Mohammed.  Police returned fire and shot and killed the two men, who shared a Phoenix apartment. Simpson, 30, and Soofi, 34, were attempting to carry out an attack modeled after January's Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris, law-enforcement officials have said. Both men had once attended the Islamic Community Center of Phoenix near Interstate 17.

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/127694863/0/usatodaycomnation-topstories~Heightened-terror-concerns-lead-to-spate-of-false-alarms/,"MARLBORO, N.J. — The bus was on its way to its local stop Monday morning when riders felt something was wrong. A young man sat on the bus holding a clock. He seemed nervous, especially when he dropped it, riders told police. Someone called New Jersey Transit, who called in Marlboro police to investigate. A bomb squad and K-9 unit rolled in as officers shut down both sides of Route 9, where the bus sat on the shoulder. The man didn't have a bomb, Marlboro Capt. Fred Reck said. The clock was just a clock. Yet the false alarm comes amid a heightened alert against terrorist attacks after the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., and the attacks in Paris. ""Given the state of things, they ended up contacting NJ Transit,"" Reck said. USA TODAY Feds investigate Calif. shooters' other potential plots Public tension about a terror attack is palpable, a new poll found. The Rutgers-Eagleton poll found eight in 10 respondents fear another terrorist attack is imminent in the United States. Seven in 10 worry it will happen in or near New Jersey. In some cases, that heightened fear has translated into higher rates of reporting suspicious packages or activity. NJ Transit has seen an uptick in the number of tips in the last couple of weeks since the recent attacks, according to spokeswoman Lisa Torbic. New Jersey State Police did not have numbers about suspicious activity tips immediately available, but the agency reaffirmed in a statement the importance of reporting suspicious activity even if just to err on the side of caution. ""Without a doubt, this was a good call,"" the department stated in a Facebook post about the Marlboro bus incident. ""News agencies reported that a neighbor of (Syed Rizwan) Farook failed to report suspicious activity before she noticed the attack in San Bernardino."" The department added: If you see something, say something ""and let the law enforcement professionals determine if the person or the item poses a real threat."" One of the difficulties with detecting a threat is that there aren't always clear-cut warning signs to show someone's at risk of executing a terror plot of a mass shooting. The alleged shooters in San Bernardino were a couple who appeared to live a double life as police say they were collecting guns, ammunition and bombs in preparation for the mass killing — shocking even friends and family members. While the FBI believes the San Bernardino shooting was a terror attack, the causes of other mass shootings can be even harder to detect. The majority of mass shootings involve white males whose ages and circumstances widely vary, according to data collected by Mother Jones magazine over the last three decades. Some of the perpetrators had histories of mental illness, but that alone does not offer a cause. Of the 73 mass shootings in the last three decades, none of them occurred in New Jersey. In fact, New Jersey is one of 12 states that haven't experienced a mass shooting under Mother Jones' definition since the 1980s. Still, the public is experiencing a wave of fear in the aftermath of the San Bernardino shooting and the Paris attacks, according to Robert Murrett, deputy director of the Institute of National Security and Counterterrorism at Syracuse University in New York. ""We've been going up and down (in sensitivity) since the 9/11 attacks, though it's not as sensitive as it was in the fall of 2001,"" Murrett said. For those who see anything suspicious, Murrett says the best defense is to follow the ""see something, say something"" mantra report any unusual activity, but to use common sense. ""It's important that we don't underreact or overreact to any incident,"" Murrett said. ""A certain amount of common sense is called for, and I think on the whole we've been pretty good (in the national response)."""

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/127755833/0/usatoday-newstopstories~FBI-Gunman-in-Mohammed-cartoon-attack-texted-terrorist-times/,"PHOENIX — FBI Director James Comey revealed for the first time that one of the two Phoenix gunmen killed in May outside a Prophet Mohammed cartoon contest in Garland, Texas, while trying to commit a terrorist attack had sent 109 messages that same morning to an overseas terrorist. The FBI still hasn't been able to determine what the encrypted messages said, Comey disclosed while testifying Thursday at a Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing in Washington, D.C. Comey was trying to illustrate ongoing concerns that law-enforcement officials investigating counterterrorism and criminal cases are unable to unlock encrypted messages sent on smartphones, rendering court orders to obtain that information ineffective. USA TODAY FBI director says Islamic State influence growing in U.S. He called on tech companies to develop a ""business model"" that allows law-enforcement officials to access de-encrypted messages when legally authorized while still protecting privacy concerns. ""We have no idea what he said, because those messages were encrypted. And to this day I can’t tell you what he said with that terrorist 109 times the morning of that attack. That is a big problem. We have to grapple with it,"" Comey told senators. U.S. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., who sits on the Judiciary Committee, said the FBI has been raising concerns about the inability to access encrypted messages but this was the first time Comey offered a specific example. He said he shares Comey's concerns. While still being sensitive to privacy concerns, Flake said, ""we obviously would like to know who these people are talking to when it's a serious investigation that has gone far beyond just probable cause. You want to know because you want to head off future attacks and prosecute those that you are dealing with."" USA TODAY Feds: Phoenix suspect may have considered Super Bowl attack Comey's disclosure came during a hearing that primarily focused on last week's mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. Comey disclosed that the couple who carried out the California attack were radicalized at least two years ago. Comey said he wouldn't comment on whether encrypted texts were used to plan that attack or the one last month in Paris. He also didn't provide any information on the overseas recipient of the Garland texts. In May, armed with assault-style rifles, Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi wounded a security officer outside a ""draw the prophet"" cartoon contest intended to lampoon the Prophet Mohammed. Police returned fire and shot and killed the two men, who shared a Phoenix apartment. Simpson, 30, and Soofi, 34, were attempting to carry out an attack modeled after January's Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris, law-enforcement officials have said. Comey had previously said that hours before the attempted attack in Garland, FBI agents sent a bulletin to local authorities indicating that Simpson may have been interested in traveling to Garland from Phoenix to attend the cartoon conference. At the time, Comey said, agents did not have specific information that Simpson had targeted the meeting. Both men had once attended the Islamic Community Center of Phoenix. The mosque's president, Usama Shami, who has previously condemned the two men's actions, said Thursday he is not surprised one of them had sent messages to an overseas terrorist. ""I am sure there were communications between them and somebody else. Probably that is how they got radicalized,"" said Shami.

Take the BuzzFeed News quiz, made from stories featured in the BuzzFeed News app (now on both Android and iOS!) and the BuzzFeed News newsletter this week. By
      
        BuzzFeed News Posted on December 11, 2015, at 6:58 a.m. ET Which country is considering an online petition to ban Donald Trump after the Republican presidential candidate called for shutting down Muslim immigration to the U.S.? It's the United Kingdom. An online petition to ban Trump from the U.K. has received more than 100,000 signatures, which means parliament will have to consider the motion for debate. The second season of Serial is here. Who is it about? It's Bowe Bergdahl. Bergdahl disappeared under mysterious circumstances from his Afghanistan base in 2009 and was subsequently captured by the Taliban. You will be able to hear Bergdahl recounting his experience of leaving the army base. This week, the U.S. Department of Justice launched a civil rights probe into which city’s police department over its use of force? It's Chicago. Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced a broad Department of Justice civil rights investigation into the Chicago police department, following protests over the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald and the release of police video showing his death. The Recording Academy announced the 58th annual Grammy nominations on Monday. Which artist was NOT nominated for Album of the Year? It's Ed Sheeran. However, Ed Sheeran's “Thinking Out Loud"" was nominated for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. So he's OK. FBI Director James Comey testified before Congress on Wednesday about the investigation into last week's mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. What did he reveal? The shooters had been radicalized before they started dating each other. “Our investigation to date shows that [shooters Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik] were radicalized before they started courting or dating each other online,” Comey said. “As early as the end of 2013 [they] were talking to each other about jihad and martyrdom before they became engaged and married and were living in the U.S.” Venezuela's opposition party won a parliamentary majority on Sunday, ousting the ruling United Socialist Party after how many years? It’s 16 years. It was the first time since former President Hugo Chavez took office in 1999 that the opposition had been expected to trump chavismo, the socialist movement the deceased president founded. Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy said that he was planning to sign an executive order preventing who from purchasing guns in the state? It's people on federal watch lists. The effort to ban those on watch lists from buying guns, which has been supported by President Obama and most congressional Democrats, has arisen in the wake of the Paris and San Bernardino terror attacks. NASA released a new video of a dwarf planet on Thursday. What is the hunk of space rock's name? It's Ceres. Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt and is the closest dwarf planet to Earth. This 1960s kids toy has become a surprise hit this holiday season. What is it called? It's Pie Face. As of Wednesday, Pie Face was out of stock at ToysRus.com but available from third-party sellers on Amazon, where it’s No. 1 in the board games category, and No. 3 for all toys and games after Cards Against Humanity and Exploding Kittens.

              since ""One of the first things I'd do in terms of executive orders, if I win, will be to sign a strong, strong statement that will go out to the country, out to the world, that anybody killing a policeman, a policewoman, a police officer, anybody killing a police officer: Death penalty is going to happen, okay?"" Trump told members of the New England Police Benevolent Association in a hotel ballroom on Thursday evening. Applause broke out, drowning out the Republican frontrunner. The idea came from the New England Police Benevolent Association, a police union with members from New Hampshire and Massachusetts that met with the Republican frontrunner on Thursday evening and then endorsed him. During a private meeting with union leaders, Trump answered questions and agreed to push for the death penalty and to find more funding for training, according to several people at the meeting. Trump provided no details of how such an executive order would work or its legality, especially with a growing number of states discontinuing use of the death penalty and with the federal government's limited jurisdiction. His campaign manager and spokeswoman did not respond to a request for such details. As Republican candidates have delicately tried to stake a position in the roiling debate over alleged brutality between police officers and minorities, Trump has firmly planted himself on the side of police. This police union is the same one that in September urged police officers to boycott a Labor Day breakfast attended by President Obama and union leaders in Boston. At the time, the union head accused Obama of not being supportive enough of police officers. ""The police and the law enforcement in this country -- I will never ever let them down, just remember that,"" Trump said on Thursday. ""They've had a hard time. These forces throughout the country have had a hard time: A lot of people killed, a lot of people killed really violently."" It was a message that resonated with many officers, including Sgt. Deborah Batista of Middleborough, Mass., who is vice president of the union. ""He seems to be a supporter of law enforcement which is something that we have not seen from the current administration,"" said Batista, 53. ""We are not popular of late, law enforcement."" During comments that lasted fewer than 10 minutes, Trump said police have the most difficult job and should be given ""the finest equipment and the finest training."" He also warned against political correctness, saying that it is getting in the way of protecting the country. He pointed to the recent mass shooting in San Bernardino as an example of several people failing to notify the police of suspicious behavior. ""They saw bombs sitting on the floor. They had one guy who bought the guns. They had another person that said, 'Oh, I didn't want to report them because I didn't want to go racial profiling,'"" Trump said. ""Oh, okay -- sees pipe bombs sitting all over the place, didn't want to racially profile. I mean, how stupid do they think we are?"" They filled both sides of the street near the hotel, anchored around a long lit-up sign that stated ""Love > hate."" There was also a banner that read: ""Shame on the police union!!!"" And a sign that said: ""NH police endorse racism."" ""The things he has been spewing out... It's time to just stand up,"" said Joan Jacobs, 71, a former federal employee who retired to Portsmouth and held a sign that said: ""We welcome refugees."" ""We're standing up to hate,"" said her husband, Larry Drake, 64, whose sign read: ""No scapegoating Muslims."" ""And fear,"" Jacobs added. ""That's the way authoritarian leaders get their power, by scapegoating."" Inside the hotel, a small group of union members got into a heated argument in the lobby after the event as a few reporters worked nearby. Part of the reason Trump was endorsed was because he was the only presidential candidate who agreed to meet with them, and at least one union member passionately suggested that wasn't enough. Several other officers declined to comment on the endorsement. Jerry Flynn, the union's executive director, briefly answered questions from reporters, a few of whom asked about Trump's controversial stances. One reporter asked if making the endorsement this week would reflect badly on law enforcement. ""How much more can law enforcement be reflected badly on?"" Flynn said. ""Every time we open up the news, people are taking potshots at us -- whether it's literally or figuratively. So, Donald Trump is a breath of fresh air, as far as I'm concerned."" As Flynn tried to cut off the questions, clearly irritated, another reporter asked him about the protesters outside with the sign declaring ""shame on the police."" ""Those are the same people who stood out in the middle of 93, laying down on the sidewalk, saying, 'Black lives matter,'"" Flynn said, referencing a group of activists who blocked traffic on Interstate 93 into Boston in January, snarling rush hour traffic. ""Well, you know what? Police lives -- all lives matter, as far as we're concerned. And I'm telling you right now that we endorsed a candidate who best serves our membership."" For you For you"
http://www.chron.com/local/education/campus-chronicles/article/Gun-guys-dildo-aficionados-and-LARPing-Redditors-6691682.php,"Banned AUSTIN - What do men toting cardboard guns, dildo wielding protesters and LARPing redditors have in common? They'll all convene just off the University of Texas at Austin's campus Saturday in what could be one of the most bizarre gatherings in this town already known for keeping it weird. Earlier this week, an open carry group called Come and Take It Texas announced it was going to hold a mock mass shooting at UT, a ""theatrical performance"" and demonstration against gun-free zones. The backlash was swift and comical. By Thursday, Reddit had come alive with users brainstorming how to counter-protest the event. More than 100 people commented on a thread encouraging people ""into Larping or Role Play"" or ""dressing up in cosplay"" to convene on the drag in opposition to the mock mass shooting. (For those non-nerds reading this story, LARP stands for ""live action role play."" Get a primer here. Cosplay is essentially what it sounds like, ""costume play."" To understand it, you have to see it.) RELATED: UT panel: Ban guns in dorms and offices, but not classrooms Later that same day, two UT alumni invited more than 2,500 people to join in a ""mass farting"" in the same spot. ""Let's respond to their fear with something funny: a mass farting (and dildo waving),"" event organizers Tim Sookram and Andrew Dobbs posted online. They even joined in on the Reddit conversation, posting in the thread, ""I think this is totally compatible with LARPing and cosplay. We want a carnival atmosphere."" At this rate, the counter-protesters could outnumber those planning to take part in the mock mass shooting. Nearly 100 more people have pledged to attend the fart-in compared with the shoot-in as of Friday morning. RELATED: Open carry demonstrators plan 'mock shooting' during UT finals week On the serious side of things, the UT community is girding for the clash of these groups. UT officials already told the group they had to move their event off campus, where they first planned to hold it, and UT Dean of Students Soncia Reagans-Lilly on Thursday met with ""the event organizer to help him understand campus boundaries, so he will have the information needed to remain off campus."" The organizers have said no real guns will be used in their mock mass shooting, but some members have indicated they plan to openly carry their rifles - which is legal in Texas - to the event in support of the group. The Austin Police Department said it is aware of the event and has been in touch with UT and Come and Take It Texas."

http://hotair.com/archives/2015/12/11/backfire-cbsnyt-poll-shows-majority-opposes-assault-weapons-ban-for-first-time-ever/,"Attempts by Democrats to demagogue the recent terror attack in San Bernardino to push a new ban on “assault weapons” has failed to convince Americans. In fact, it might have backfired altogether. For the first time in 20 years of polling the question, the CBS/New York Times poll finds a majority opposed to an “assault weapons” ban 44/50, even as gun control in other contexts polls more consistently with previous findings (via Twitchy and Patrick Egan):  The NYT report saves this nugget for the second-to-last paragraph in its lengthy analysis of the survey: What has shifted notably are attitudes on gun control. Only 44 percent of Americans favor a ban on assault weapons, 19 percentage points lower than after the mass shooting in Tucson in 2011. And while 51 percent favor stricter gun control in general, that is down from 58 percent in October. Yes, those attitudes on bans of vaguely defined weapons have “shifted notably,” and noticeably in the opposite direction of what the lecturing elites in government and the media intended. I wonder what that means. One thing it means is that Americans trust Republicans more than Democrats on gun laws, albeit narrowly at 41/37 — not bad for a D+5 sample (24/29/40). However, it’s not apparent that there has been a big shift on other gun issues from this poll. On whether existing gun laws should be more strict, a majority of 51% still says yes. more or less within the range of the last couple of years, and significantly higher than the 39% in 2012. On whether those laws would “help prevent gun violence,” it’s a virtual split at 50/48, while two months ago it got a 59/40. Mental-health screening and treatment as a solution to gun violence is still very popular, with 77% of respondents saying it would help some or a lot, and only 19% saying it wouldn’t have much or any impact. The big shift is that Americans have finally begun to tire of the “we need to ban scary looking weapons that don’t differ much from other weapons” demagoguery that Democrats have been pushing for the last few years. One might have thought that the 2014 elections would have provided some clue, but perhaps a poll in the New York Times will have a little more impact. We might wonder about the impact on The New Republic, too. They chose yesterday to run Phoebe Maltz Bovy’s emoting on the need to ban all the guns: Ban guns. All guns. Get rid of guns in homes, and on the streets, and, as much as possible, on police. Not just because of San Bernardino, or whichever mass shooting may pop up next, but also not not because of those. Don’t sort the population into those who might do something evil or foolish or self-destructive with a gun and those who surely will not. As if this could be known—as if it could be assessed without massively violating civil liberties and stigmatizing the mentally ill. Ban guns! Not just gun violence. Not just certain guns. Not just already-technically-illegal guns. All of them.  … It doesn’t take specialized expertise in constitutional law to understand that current U.S. gun law gets its parameters from Supreme Court interpretations of the Second Amendment. But it’s right there in the First Amendment that we don’t have to simply nod along with what follows. That the Second Amendment has been liberally interpreted doesn’t prevent any of us from saying it’s been misinterpreted, or that it should be repealed. When you find yourself assuming that everyone who has a more nuanced (or just pro-gun) argument is simply better read on the topic, remember that opponents of abortion aren’t wondering whether they should have a more nuanced view of  abortion because of Roe v. Wade. They’re not keeping their opinions to themselves until they’ve got a term paper’s worth of material proving that they’ve studied the relevant case law. Um … did anyone ever explain to Bovy the difference between a Supreme Court ruling and explicit constitutional text? There isn’t any language in the Constitution about abortion; there is an explicit right to bear arms. It’s right there in the Second Amendment. The Supreme Court could reverse Roe, but they can’t change the text of the Constitution. Furthermore, no one is suggesting that Bovy be prevented from making dumb arguments, but most people should know better than to take those seriously — at least those outside of the editorial offices of TNR. On one point, Bovy is correct: the Second Amendment can be repealed, and she can argue for that. But it’s not a process that involves the Supreme Court, or any court at all. It takes 38 states and two-thirds of both chambers of Congress to amend the Constitution, or a constitutional convention. When Bovy has a path to that kind of action open, plus any rational idea about how 60 million households would get stripped of their firearms without starting a war, then she can be sure to let us all in on the plan. This suggests that she’s not even within sight of rationality, though: What’s needed to stop all gun violence is a vocal ban guns contingent. Getting bogged down in discussions of what’s feasible is keeps what needs to happen—no more guns—from entering the realm of possibility. The logical fallacy here is amazing to behold in a once-significant publication like TNR. Seizing every gun from every home and repealing the Second Amendment isn’t impossible because no one’s talking about it. No one talks about it because it’s impossible — practically, politically, and morally. Just the size of the police state required to execute such a plan boggles the rational mind, an encumbrance from which Bovy clearly does not suffer. Thankfully, Americans have started to become a lot more rational about self-defense as gun-grabbers have become a lot more transparent about their true desires.

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/127811307/0/phoenix/opinions~Giffords-Active-shooter-terrorism-is-a-growing-threat/,"You met with the president a week ago Friday. Are there important moments of that conversation you could share? Our conversation with the president focused on what we can do to address the gun violence crisis that makes our nation stand out in the worst of ways. We spoke specifically about the steps that our country can and should take to close some of the loopholes that let felons and domestic abusers buy a gun without a background check and with no questions asked. The San Bernardino shooting looms largest on our minds right now. What are the takeaways from this act of terror? The San Bernardino tragedy, the one before that in Colorado Springs, and all the gun tragedies in communities across our country that don’t make the headlines all show the depth of our country’s gun violence problem. We grieve for the victims, their loved ones, and hope for strength for the survivors. And we hope that our leaders in Washington understand that this level of people being murdered with guns is just not normal. USA TODAY Obama mourns passing of Saudi king Does San Bernardino add a new dimension to the gun issue now that we know that terrorists are legally acquiring guns in our country to kill Americans? Active shooter terrorism is a growing threat. And right now, suspected terrorists can pass a background check and legally buy a gun. That doesn’t make any sense. The idea to close this ‘terror gap’ - a plan that originated with the administration of President George W. Bush - makes a lot of sense. What are the most politically feasible steps we could take now to reduce gun violence? We should look for where there’s common ground and bipartisan solutions. Common-sense ideas like background checks for all gun sales are supported by nearly 90 percent of Americans and by the vast majority of gun owners like us. There are bipartisan bills in Congress. And these kinds of common-sense laws work: states that have already closed the background check loopholes have seen big drops in the number of people, including women and law-enforcement officers, who are murdered with guns. AZCENTRAL Former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords launches new gun control initiative How do you even begin to make a dent in gun violence when there are roughly 300 million-plus guns in America? You start by recognizing that “guns don’t kill people, people kill people,” and take some basic steps so that dangerous people no longer have the option of buying a gun without a background check. Do you believe presidential candidates will have the courage to confront gun violence in a serious way in the 2016 election? We’ve been encouraged that some candidates for president have already embraced commonsense solutions. We hope that every candidate has the courage to lay out a serious plan to tackle our nation’s gun violence problem. They should all answer some pretty basic questions: Would they close - or protect - the loopholes that let felons and domestic abusers buy guns without a background check? What about the loophole that lets suspected terrorists legally buy guns? USA TODAY NCAA president 'very pleased' with revisions to Indiana religious freedom law What gives you hope that the problem of gun violence can ever be solved? Gun violence is a big and really complex problem. There is no single solution and addressing it will take some time. But with some common sense, we can make our communities safer and do a lot better. Leaders in states around the country are acting. And we think it’s just a matter of time before our leaders in Washington catch up."

http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/iqhJHSnk4kA/,"On Thursday, Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy announced plans to issue an executive order barring anyone listed on federal terrorist watch lists from purchasing a gun in the state. But while the idea of “no fly, no gun” has found growing support following the mass shooting in San Bernardino last week, including that of President Obama, experts say such a policy may be unconstitutional. The problem lies with the terrorist watch lists themselves, which are both secret and routinely updated without the typical due process given to those who are accused of breaking the law, such as court proceedings. Without a trial, the government can add anyone to watch lists who it believes may be a threat to national security—and exactly how the government defines such a threat isn’t even public knowledge. “The government doesn’t release its criteria,” says Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Liberty & National Security Program at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice. “It’s really a black box.” Such an ad-hoc approach to these lists raises fewer concerns when they are merely used to keep track of potential suspects, but becomes more legally problematic when their many members are denied certain rights or privileges. The no-fly list, which includes individuals deemed too dangerous to board a plane, is just one of several lists reportedly used by the government, but is often the one that gets the most attention. The Wall Street Journal has reported that there are 16,000 names on the list, with the larger Terrorist Screening Database including 420,000 names. In 2014, a federal court found the no-fly list unconstitutional because it denied those listed due process in challenging their inclusion. Since then, the U.S. government has said it’s providing more information to those who are on the list, potentially allowing persons banned from air travel to appeal and get their names removed. The ACLU, however, is still challenging the list in court, arguing that the government isn’t handing over enough information about how it populates those names. The civil liberties organization is also against barring those included from being denied guns for similar reasons. “We are opposed to the use of terror watch lists, as presently constituted, to screen gun purchases,” said ACLU National Security Project Director Hina Shamsi. “We believe the lists are deeply flawed.” Several constitutional law scholars say it’s these same due process concerns that make it unlikely a ban on gun purchases for those on the no-fly list would be legally permissible. “We generally don’t take away rights based on suspicion,” says UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh. “The government has to have some proof. If all the government can say is we suspect you of supporting terrorism, that’s not enough.” Goitein agrees the policy raises serious constitutional concerns, noting that individuals can make the list for a number of reasons that aren’t always made clear. “It’s not just a question of due process and having the right to clear your name,” Goitein says. “The person also needs to be shown to be a proven threat of violence. And I think that bar is a low one.” Saul Cornell, a Fordham University history professor who specializes in the Second Amendment, says it’s possible that other states will consider barring individuals on the no-fly list from purchasing guns despite these issues. But Second Amendment restrictions are routinely challenged in court, and Connecticut’s potential executive action will almost certainly see lawsuits from gun advocates. “If you sneeze you get litigation in this area,” Cornell says. “It’s a no-brainer it’ll be challenged. Whether it survives is going to be very interesting.” Contact us at letters@time.com."

          / CBS News Hillary Clinton called for the removal of the Confederate flag from the grounds of the Citadel, a public military university in Charleston, South Carolina, in a tweet. Symbols of hate create more hate. It's time for the Confederate flag to come down at The Citadel. -H

S.C. military college @Citadel1842 investigates photos of cadets wearing white hoods https://t.co/MMqsp7NenH pic.twitter.com/vZ00r4p5tY Bernie Sanders called the photos ""repugnant"" in his tweet and also called for the flag's removal. The photos from The Citadel are repugnant. Period. No excuses. The Confederate flag on campus must come down. 
https://t.co/CnBkf1Kjtp Martin O'Malley's South Carolina campaign also called on the Citadel to take the flag down. The Citadel, which is publicly funded, displays a Confederate Naval Jack flag -- which is a variant of the Confederate battle flag -- in its chapel, and some had already called for its removal earlier this year. After the mass shooting of nine people at a black church in North Charleston, photos emerged of the alleged shooter, Dylann Roof, which showed him holding the Confederate flag. Soon after the shooting, the school's Board of Visitors voted 9-3 to remove the flag, but it still hangs in the chapel under the state's Heritage Act. That act decrees that any monuments or markers ""in honor of the Confederacy or the civil rights movement located on any municipal, county or state property shall not be removed, changed or renamed"" without a two-thirds vote of the legislature. Although South Carolina legislators voted in July to remove the Confederate battle flag from the state Capitol grounds, according to the Post and Courier, legislators ""have refused to take action on other controversial symbols.""

http://www.sfgate.com/nation/article/San-Bernardino-shooter-sought-guns-from-friend-to-6692501.php,"One of the attackers who killed 14 people in San Bernardino last week obtained the assault rifles used in the massacre from a friend to avoid arousing suspicion by purchasing them himself, a law enforcement official said Friday. Even as the FBI continued exploring the husband-and-wife killers and whether they had any other possible targets in mind, the investigation has expanded as the FBI questions a growing network of people with ties to the couple. Authorities have focused on Enrique Marquez, who was a neighbor and friend of Syed Farook, one of the two attackers. Marquez provided the rifles used by Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, in the assault last week. Marquez has been interviewed multiple times during the investigation, and a senior law enforcement official said Friday that he has “come clean” with authorities by cooperating fully. Marquez said Farook sought the weapons from him in an effort to cover his tracks, since Farook thought buying the guns could draw attention, according to the law enforcement official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. However, it is still not known if Marquez gave or sold the guns to Farook. Investigators have described the probe into last week’s bloodshed — which saw 14 people killed and another 22 injured — as massive and painstaking, involving hundreds of interviews and stretching into at least two other countries. The FBI and the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department also sent divers to Lake Seccombe in the city. Investigators have said the killers tried to cover their tracks by destroying e-mails, cellphones and other items at their home in Redlands. They were tipped that the small lake might hold a computer hard drive, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told the Associated Press. The FBI is still looking at the electronics that belonged to the couple to determine if there was another target they intended to attack. The Associated Press contributed to this report."
http://www.tampabay.com/news/perspective/what-are-we-so-afraid-of/2257468,"We Americans are living through a dread-inducing age — of school shootings and suicide bombers, of racist terror and mass murder, of enemies who broadcast terrifying pronouncements against us. We are not used to living with such bewildering uncertainty. Civilians are not collateral damage in this seemingly endless war. No, they are the preferred target. We feel vulnerable in many different places where we used to feel safe — in cafes or at concerts, at sporting events, at home or at work. The killers are not just those coming in from abroad, but they are already here, some even born here, seemingly ready to strike at any moment. The FBI is still investigating the latest attack, a radicalized couple's terrorist rampage in San Bernardino, Calif. Coming five days after a mass shooting in Colorado, the massacre only reinforces this feeling of vulnerability. What really concerns us is not so much what to call the crime, but whether the ideology of the killers is shared by others, suggesting there may be more such attacks to come — and how we will respond going forward. As I have written elsewhere, the experimental psychologists Tom Pyszczynski, Sheldon Solomon and Jeff Greenberg are known for having developed what's called terror management theory, which suggests that much of human behavior is motivated by an unconscious terror of death. What saves us from this terror is culture. Cultures provide ways to view the world that ""solve"" the existential crisis engendered by the awareness of death. The theory says that when people are reminded of their mortality — especially if the reminder doesn't register consciously, as happens after a brutal act of terror — they will more readily enforce their cultural worldviews. If our cultural worldview is xenophobic, nationalistic or moralistic, we are prone to become more so. Hundreds of experiments, all over the world, have confirmed these findings. If we believe guns will protect us from harm, a terrorist strike will further strengthen our views. If we blame Muslims or white supremacists or the government for whatever is wrong in our world, we will become more fearful and more certain about who is to blame. For example, psychological experiments found that being reminded both of one's own mortality and the attacks of Sept. 11 increased support for military interventions in the Middle East among people who identified as politically conservative. It had no effect on people who identified as liberal. An attack can reinforce our certainty in our beliefs even — especially — before anything is certain about what happened in the attack itself. We know the San Bernardino attacks were carried out by a husband and wife, that the male shooter knew some of the 14 victims, and that couple had acquired a large arsenal of weaponry. Authorities revealed that the female shooter had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, or ISIS, in a Facebook posting. They also said that the man had been in contact, years before, with individuals who were believed to have terrorist ties. Both the assailants had been radicalized for a long time, even before ISIS rose to prominence, talking of an attack while they were still dating, says the FBI director, adding that ""as early as the end of 2013 (they) were talking to each other about jihad and martyrdom before they became engaged and married and were living in the U.S."" They practiced their aim at a target range just days before their murder rampage. But we still don't know their precise motives: why these two people chose to brutally attack an office holiday gathering — or what else they planned to do. Lone actors or a pair of actors often combine religious or political grievances with their own personal vendettas to form a way of viewing the world. In such pairs, we often see one person leading another. As I noted in my book Terror in the Name of God, for example, John Allen Muhammad, who, together with a 17-year-old protégé, carried out a series of sniper shootings in suburban Washington, D.C., in the fall of 2002, appears to have been motivated by a mixture of the personal and political. He reportedly told a friend that he endorsed the Sept. 11 attacks, and he expressed admiration for the small group that had managed to cause more damage to the United States than an army could have done. But he also appeared principally to have been driven by anger at his ex-wife. Another example is Mir Aimal Kansi, who shot five CIA employees in 1993, two of whom died. When I interviewed him in 1999, three years before he was executed by lethal injection, he mentioned a wide variety of motivations — some of them political and some personal. He was described by friends and family as brooding and a loner. A number of studies by terrorism scholars have shown that lone actors are significantly more likely to suffer documented mental illness than are terrorists who are part of groups. Lone actors are especially difficult for law enforcement authorities to stop because they generally do not communicate directly with a group. There is a limit, though, to the damage a lone actor can cause. An individual or small group can terrorize a city, as recent events made clear. But they are unlikely to be able to carry out a Sept. 11-type attack, which required coordination among a large number of operatives. As technology continues to improve and spread, virtual networks and even lone-wolf avengers could become a major threat. After the Sept. 11 attacks we as a nation asked, how did we let this happen. With attacks on Paris and now San Bernardino, the question has morphed: It's not how did this happen, but how often it will. The answers may be grim. Terrorism analysts have long observed imitative or ""copycat"" crimes, as well as hoaxes. There are many reasons to believe that violence — even terrorist violence — is at least partly contagious. Just as ordinary suicide often appears in clusters, and is understood to be spread by social contagion, the same may be true of suicide-murder and other forms of mass violence. People often wonder, how afraid should we be? My answer is that it depends on who you are, where you live, and what you do. But even with a rise in the number of mass-casualty attacks, the likelihood that any given individual will be caught in such an attack is vanishingly small. Statistically speaking, you are far more likely to die in a car accident than in a terrorist attack, especially if you don't wear a seat belt. In many years of studying this subject, I have come to understand that a mass shooting or terrorist attack evokes a powerful sense of dread. It is a form of psychological warfare whose goal is to bolster the morale of its supporters and demoralize and frighten its target audience — the victims and their communities. Terrorists aim to make us feel afraid, and to overreact in fear. The good news is that when people are reminded of what they value most, such as the divine, before being reminded of their inevitable death, the negative impact is reduced. And when people are reminded of values such as tolerance or their commitment to individual rights, their awareness of mortality increases these commitments. If we are to prevail in the war on terrorism, we need to remember that the freedoms we aspire to come with great responsibilities. And these responsibilities involve not just fighting terrorists, but also managing our own terror.

Loading... December 11, 2015 Avoiding the high drama of recent year-end budget fights, President Obama signed legislation Friday keeping government agencies open into next week, giving White House and congressional bargainers more time to complete sweeping deals on taxes and federal spending. Facing a midnight deadline, Obama signed the measure keeping government afloat through Wednesday just hours after the House used a voice vote to send it to him. The Senate approved the bill a day earlier, its easy sojourn through Congress underscoring that neither party saw reason to risk a government shutdown battle. Talks were likely to stretch at least into the weekend over the environment, Syrian refugees, guns and dozens of other disputes sprinkled across two major bills. One would provide $1.1 trillion to finance government for 2016; the other would renew around 50 expiring tax cuts for businesses and individuals that, with additions, could swell to a 10-year price tag of $700 billion or more. Disagreements remained but show-stopping, partisan quarrels were already resolved, lowering the decibel level of this year's budget endgame. The overall $1.1 trillion spending total was previously cemented in place, leaving only spending details to finalize, and Republicans decided to avoid shutdown brinkmanship with Obama by omitting provisions dismantling his 2010 health care law and halting Planned Parenthood's money. GOP lawmakers also attributed the lessened intensity to new Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who replaced the ousted John Boehner, R-Ohio, this fall. They said they needed to finish this year's work and focus on passing election-year bills in 2016 highlighting GOP priorities on taxes and health care. ""There's a honeymoon period in here,"" conservative Rep. Ted Yoho, R-Fla., said of Ryan's recent ascension to the top House job. ""And I think Paul's articulated very well where we want to go."" Leaders were hoping Congress would adjourn for the year next week after approving the two measures. Republicans wanted to insert language into the bills ending the four-decade ban on U.S. oil exports and curbing Syrian refugees from entering the U.S., a response to last month's deadly attacks in Paris. They also wanted to roll back legal curbs on the financial industry, prevent Obama from easing ties with Cuba and block his efforts to fight air and water pollution. Yet though Republicans dominate Congress, the aversion of many GOP lawmakers to spending bills meant Democratic votes would be needed to pass the sweeping $1.1 trillion package. Seeking to use leverage, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was threatening to withhold Democratic support unless Republicans agreed to annual inflation increases to a tax credit for children. ""Lifting the ban on oil (exports) and all of the money that means for the oil industry"" without boosting the children's tax credit is ""too big, it's unfair and it does not have the support of House Democrats,"" Pelosi told reporters. Pelosi was also seeking more money for renewable energy and an end to curbs on federal research into gun violence, an issue given life by last week's mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. No. 2 House Democratic leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland indicated on C-SPAN's ""Newsmakers"" that Democrats could be open to bargaining on oil exports and gun violence research. But he expressed opposition to an effort by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to lift campaign spending limits by party committees for candidates for federal office, saying, ""I don't want to say we can live with it."" It was unclear if lawmakers would pull off a major tax bill with permanent extensions benefiting both sides or opt for a two-year extension of existing tax breaks. Republicans wanted business tax reductions for research and development and for equipment purchases to be made permanent. For their part, Democrats were seeking permanence for Obama-passed increases in tax credits for low-earning households, families with children and college students. In another fight, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and other California Republicans blamed Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., for blocking a provision aimed at bringing more water to the state's farm belt amid a severe drought. At a news conference, the Republicans said Feinstein abandoned a deal in which GOP lawmakers had conceded to Democratic demands, including protection of endangered species. Feinstein said the language likely would have violated environmental law. ""I expect that by early next week we'll have a bill that the state and federal government can sign off on,"" Feinstein said in a statement.

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives.

http://theweek.com/articles/593606/danger-certainty,"Justin Sullivan/Getty Images ""When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?"" Though this quote is often attributed to John Maynard Keynes, its provenance is uncertain. There's no question, however, about its instructive value. The world is confoundingly complex, and will make a fool of anyone who ignores contrary new information. But with our country so politically polarized, the process of adjusting to new facts — so essential to sound public policy — rarely occurs. The mass shooting in San Bernardino last week should have served as a challenge to all prevailing assumptions about ISIS, domestic terrorism, and gun-control laws. Yet partisans and presidential candidates immediately seized on the shootings as proof of what they already knew: We need to ban assault rifles. No, we need to ban all Muslim immigrants. We should send 20,000 or more ground troops to wipe out ISIS as soon as possible. No, a U.S. ground force in Syria is exactly what ISIS wants. And so on. Every news event now triggers a ritualized dance of the same, hardened opinions. In the outrage machine of partisan TV networks, talk radio, Twitter, and blogs, any reconsideration of past views and policies is greeted with derisive jeering, as if it were proof of weakness and failure instead of sanity. So everyone remains dug into their ideological bunkers. For a change, wouldn't it be encouraging to hear a gun-rights advocate say: I'm all for the Second Amendment, but to reduce the death toll of mass shootings, let's ban magazines of more than 10 rounds and institute strong, universal background checks? Wouldn't it be reassuring to hear President Obama say: I can now see that a long war of attrition against ISIS isn't sufficient — we need an accelerated new strategy? Alas, it won't happen. There's a word for the kind of smug certainty that sneers at all evidence: Trumpism. There's a little of The Donald in all of us. Copyright © Dennis Publishing Limited 2021.

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/127861005/0/phoenix/nation~Gun-buyer-in-rampage-was-goody-two-shoes/,"The man believed to have purchased guns used to kill 14 people in San Bernardino Dec. 2 was described as an unlikely character in a terror plot who loved to read comic books, according to the owner of a California bar who employed him. Jerry Morgan, owner of Morgan's Tavern in Riverside, Calif., told USA TODAY on Friday that Enrique Marquez, 25, was an ""emotionally immature"" man who liked to read comic books, but was not terrorist material. Marquez, who The New York Times said purchased two assault rifles for the husband and wife shooters in San Bernardino, worked for Morgan for the last three years. He checked IDs at the door and asked people to leave if they appeared too intoxicated, Morgan said. ""He was a goody goody two shoes type kid,"" said Morgan, 58, who lives in Riverside. ""If anybody was talking about sleeper cells, if I had any suspicion he was a weirdo, I would have fired him. Marquez, according to the Times, talked with other bar patrons about sleeper terrorist cells but also of something that was going ""to be big."" “He would say stuff like, ‘There’s so much going on. There’s so many sleeper cells, people just waiting. When it happens, it’s going to be big – watch,’ “ frequent Morgan’s patron Nick Rodriguez told the news organization. “We took it as a joke. When you look at the kid and talk to him, no one would take him seriously about that.” But Morgan said this did not fit what he knew of Marquez, whose worst crime when he worked at the bar was throwing up once all over the stock room. ""He fit my purposes,"" Morgan said. ""He was a non-confrontational person."" Marquez, who authorities say was a friend of the husband and wife who were the alleged shooters in the rampage that left 14 dead, knew husband Syed Farook from childhood, according to the Times. They grew up tinkering with cars together. Marquez married the sister of Farook’s sister-in-law, though he told companions it was a sham marriage that he went through for immigration purposes, the Times reported. The wife was Russian-born. Marquez is still being questioned by authorities and has waived his right to remain silent. It is unclear what, if anything, he will be charged with in connection to the case. USA TODAY Feds investigate Calif. shooters' other potential plots Marquez told investigators he bought the assault rifles because Farook did not believe he could pass a background check, the Times reported. Marquez also told authorities he and Farook planned another terrorist attack that was to take place in 2012 but they were scared off from carrying it out after the arrests of suspected terrorists in Riverside, Calif., that same year, the Times reported. Shortly after the shooting in San Bernardino, Marquez posted on his Facebook page: “I’m. Very sorry sguys (sic). It was a pleasure,” the Times reported."

http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/12/san-bernardino-shooting-victim-funerals,"First published on Sat 12 Dec 2015 15.21 GMT Those close to Shannon Johnson knew him to be fearless – whether he was moving across the country to pursue love, rescuing stray animals in the path of a wildfire or trying to shield a co-worker from gunfire during the last moments of his life.  The 45-year-old health inspector from Los Angeles received a hero’s funeral on Saturday in his home state of Georgia, 10 days after he died in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. A colleague wounded in the attack, Denise Peraza, said later that Johnson wrapped an arm tightly around her as bullets went flying and assured her: “I got you.” Those would be his last words. Inside Calvary Baptist church in the rural city of Jesup, where Johnson was born, about 2,300 miles from the auditorium in which he and 13 others died, a congressman gave his family a folded US flag while praising him as “an American hero”. “Shannon’s fearless. He’s always been that way,” Rob Johnson, Shannon Johnson’s older brother, told reporters before the service. “I’m sure that when he saw the young lady, he thought of his sister or his girlfriend or his former wife. That’s just the kind of guy he was. He’s a man of action.” Funerals were also held on Saturday in southern California for two other victims – Tin Nguyen, 31, and Isaac Amanios, 60. Nguyen was remembered in a service conducted in Vietnamese at St Barbara’s Catholic church in Santa Ana, not far from Orange County’s Little Saigon area. Born in Vietnam, Nguyen was eight when her family left that country for the US. Her fiance carried a large portrait of Nguyen into the church as members of the standing-room-only crowd reached out to touch it. The couple had planned to marry in 2017. The day before Nguyen was killed, she celebrated her fiance’s 32nd birthday. Nguyen’s mother and grandmother, both weeping, followed the casket down the aisle to the altar. A cousin took a moment in English to thank first responders, local politicians and Nguyen’s co-workers at the San Bernardino County health department, where Nguyen was hired as an inspector after attending California State University, Fullerton. In the days after the shooting, businesses that she inspected posted online tributes, remembering Nguyen’s big heart and laughter. At Johnson’s memorial service, about 200 people filed into the church where roses, lilies and carnations sent by mourners decorated the pulpit amid strands of white lights and potted poinsettias set out for the Christmas season. The Rev Ed Bacon, a family relative, noted Johnson’s selfless final act echoed that of his father, who died while saving another man during an industrial accident at a Kentucky paper mill in 1978. Johnson was just eight years old, and his father’s death affected him deeply. As a boy, Bacon said, Johnson would sometimes slip away from home and spend the night at his dad’s grave. “He learned from his father’s death that no one has greater love than this – to give your life for your friends,” Bacon said. Johnson was sitting next to Peraza at a holiday luncheon for San Bernardino County environmental health employees on 2 December, when a pair of attackers with assault rifles began spraying bullets. Peraza said she and Johnson sought cover beneath a table when he tried to shield her. Johnson was among 14 people killed in the attack. Peraza was shot in the back but survived. “I believe I am still here today because of this amazing man,” Peraza said in a statement soon after the killings. Johnson grew up in the Macon area, where he played baseball and football in high school, Bacon said, and drove a Honda hatchback with a stereo so loud that people could hear him coming from blocks away. When he was a young adult, his love of nature – and loud music – led Johnson to live in an isolated cabin in the Georgia woods. Then he fell in love and followed the woman to California, Johnson’s brother recalled, with no job and nowhere to live. Johnson settled in Los Angeles. When wildfires raged in southern California years ago, his brother said, Johnson rounded up stray pets in his pickup truck and took them to a church for shelter. Then he helped first responders dig a trench to protect the church. Though he lived far away, Johnson kept his family as close to him as possible. The walls of his Koreatown apartment were lined with framed photos, Bacon said. He also had tattoos for his mother, father and two ex-wives, who shared space on Johnson’s body with portraits of the Virgin Mary and Gone With the Wind actress Vivien Leigh. Johnson’s brother said that as relatives gathered in Georgia to say goodbye, their grandmother, Willie Dell Johnson, helped put the tragedy of his death into perspective. “It’s just kind of what our family does,” she said. “We save people.”"
http://hotair.com/archives/2015/12/12/video-farook-pal-built-pipe-bombs-with-him-talked-about-sleeper-cells-at-work/,"How do you spend quality time with your best buddies? Back in the day, I’d have a couple of beers, play air hockey, or just shoot the breeze out in the garage while we worked on our cars. Enrique Marquez had other ways of passing the day in garages with San Bernardino terrorist Syed Farook — by building pipe bombs. But relax, Marquez apparently told the FBI. It was just a hobby: Enrique Marquez, a former neighbor of Farook, told investigators he and his friend previously built pipe bombs, law enforcement officials said. Marquez said he had nothing to do with devices found at the home of Farook and Malik, or the ones that apparently failed to go off at the site of the shooting, the officials said. Marquez, who has spent several days being voluntarily interviewed by the FBI, portrayed the two men as hobbyists experimenting with building the devices, the officials told CNN. He also boasted, one official said, that if he had made the bombs they would have gone off. Er … hobbyists? Yes, I’m sure the FBI will buy that explanation. Lots of hobbyists like to build pipe bombs just to see if they can, especially hobbyists that have already had one aborted attempt at a terrorist attack. Methinks that Marquez should have paid more attention to the Miranda warning at the beginning of his interview, because it sounds like he’s talking himself into a life sentence. Talking too much seems to be Marquez’ other hobby, however. The New York Times reported yesterday that Marquez liked to wax prophetic while bartending, and repeatedly offered his perspective on Islamist terrorism in the US: The regulars did not take it seriously when Enrique Marquez mused about terrorism at Morgan’s Tavern, a dank dive bar where Mr. Marquez hauled ice, cleaned bathrooms and checked IDs at the door. After a few drinks, he would just start talking — about his money woes, trying to lose weight, wanting to join the Navy. News reports about terrorism were just fodder for more bar talk. “He would say stuff like: ‘There’s so much going on. There’s so many sleeper cells, so many people just waiting. When it happens, it’s going to be big. Watch,’ ” said Nick Rodriguez, a frequent patron who had known Mr. Marquez on and off for the past two years. “We took it as a joke. When you look at the kid and talk to him, no one would take him seriously about that.” And then there’s this revelation: Last year, Mr. Marquez married the Russian sister of Raheel Farook’s wife. He later told a friend and people at Morgan’s Tavern that it was a sham marriage for immigration purposes. Bar patrons said he told them he had been paid $5,000 or $10,000 to marry Ms. Gigliotti’s sister, Mariya Chernykh. … Mr. Marquez announced the marital arrangement one day when he came into the bar — which the F.B.I. visited earlier this week — and offered to buy everyone drinks, Mr. Rodriguez, the bar patron, said. It was unusual behavior for Mr. Marquez, who was perpetually short on money; sometimes, he could not afford gas for his car, or he asked people to buy him drinks. He told Mr. Rodriguez that he had posted photographs of himself and his wife at her apartment for the sake of appearances, but that Ms. Chernykh did not live with him and would not so much as kiss him. Viviana Ramirez, 23, a friend, said he did not seem happy with the arrangement. One night, she said, he rode his bike to her house, began drinking and told her that he was married, but that it was an open relationship. “He needed more attention than what she was giving him,” Ms. Ramirez said. Frankly, it sounds as though Marquez might be the patsiest patsy ever, at least from these descriptions of what Marquez is admitting. First he helps Farook build pipe bombs as a “hobbyist,” then agrees to a sham green-card marriage, and then buys the rifles used in a terrorist attack. Can anyone possibly be this stupid, and therefore unwitting of what’s going on? Come on, man. Perhaps he’s hoping that his utter cluelessness (or putting on an act of it) might give him some sort of distance from the events that took place in San Bernardino, but with Farook and Tashfeen Malik both dead, the Department of Justice isn’t going to go easy on their enablers. Right now, that’s what Marquez appears to be. Meanwhile, CBS News reports that Farook and Malik may have dumped a hard drive in a nearby lake. Divers started digging into the silt yesterday morning, but so far they have come up empty:  Meanwhile, an FBI dive team searched a small, urban lake about 3 miles north of the shooting site. CBS News has learned that the divers are looking for a computer hard drive that may have been dumped in the lake as well any other items Farook and Malik may have thrown in it. On Friday, a diver was seen handing an item to investigators. According to a report from ABC Digital, the FBI found a few items of interest, but aren’t saying what they are: FBI agents recovered a number of items from a lake in San Bernardino where investigators have spent days searching for clues to last week’s mass shooting. The FBI would not say what items were found or if they related to the terror investigation. Authorities say Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik may have gone to Seccombe Lake Park — 2.5 miles from the site of the shooting — after the Dec. 2 massacre and before the police shootout that left them dead. We’ll see soon enough whether this tip pans out. Meanwhile, Marquez is still talking enough to keep the DoJ from filing charges just yet, but don’t expect that to last long.

http://www.ibtimes.com/islamic-state-group-malaysia-isis-has-least-50000-supporters-country-officials-say-2223088,"Malaysia’s transport minister said Saturday 50,000 people in the country of 30 million support the Islamic State group. Liow Tiong said the figure is based on police intelligence estimates, Al Jazeera reported. Meanwhile, about 100 Malaysians have already gone to fight on behalf of armed terrorist organizations, such as the militant group formerly known as either ISIL or ISIS. ""If only 1 percent of these sympathizers turn radical and if they attack any part of Malaysia, we will be in trouble,"" Liow said at a conference in the country's capital Kuala Lumpur. About two dozen supporters of the Islamic State group have been charged in courts in Malaysia. Nations around the world have been on high alert since the terrorist attacks in and around Paris last month and the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, this month. The militant group claimed responsibility in the former case, and at least one of the shooting suspects pledged allegiance to the group in the latter case. The Islamic State group has indicated it wants to expand its operations in Southeast Asia, and Malaysia's authorities have suggested an attack in the country linked to the extremist group is only a matter of time, the Malaysian Insider reported. The militant group has used the perceived damage U.S. foreign policy has caused in Syria and Iraq to radicalize Muslims in Malaysia. Rela on the hunt for members with Isis links https://t.co/r6g019Y0ji pic.twitter.com/w4XbZQLUix Because of reports of imminent terrorist threats, Malaysian soldiers were deployed last month before the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit, which was attended by U.S. President Barack Obama. The move came days after a leaked memo said Islamic State group militants had met with representatives of insurgent groups based in the Philippines. The memo detailed how 10 suicide bombers were to have been placed throughout Kuala Lumpur. The attacks were not carried out, but the would-be suicide bombers reportedly underwent military training in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan."

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/127963189/0/phoenix/nation~Person-detained-in-suspected-arson-at-California-mosque/,"PALM SPRINGS, Calif. — A 23-year-old man was arrested in Palm Desert in connection with a suspected arson-hate crime that occurred at a mosque in Coachella. According to jail records, Carl James Dial was arrested shortly before 9 p.m. Friday by Riverside County sheriff's investigators. He is being detained Saturday at the Riverside County Jail in Indio on suspicion of committing multiple felony offenses, including commission of a hate crime, two counts of arson, one count of maliciously setting a fire, and a count of second-degree burglary. As of 1 p.m. Saturday, Dial remained jailed and was being held in lieu of $150,000 bail. He is scheduled to appear in court Wednesday, according to jail records. CINCINNATI.COM Frisch�s $175M takeover done The fire occurred a little more than a week after a mass shooting that killed 14 people and injured another 22 in San Bernardino. It is one of many similar incidents that officials say have been occurring at mosques around the country in response to the San Bernardino shootings, which authorities have said were committed by radicalized followers of an Islamic State group. Federal authorities began investigating the possible arson Friday just hours after Cal Fire personnel extinguished the blaze, which was contained to the lobby of the 1,800-square-foot Masjid Ibrahim Mosque. People were praying inside at the time of the fire, but everyone was evacuated from the building and no injuries were reported. People described hearing a “loud boom” and seeing flames, said Reymundo Nour, the mosque’s acting imam, who was not on the site at the time. He said the mosque had been “firebombed.” In a news release issued late Friday, the Sheriff’s Department stated that investigators “believed this was an intentional act potentially resulting in a hate crime, and utilized all available resources in an attempt to identify and locate the suspect. “A person of interest was quickly identified and was subsequently located and detained pending further investigation,” the release stated. A spokesman for the sheriff's department could not be immediately reached for comment Saturday regarding Dial's arrest. Federal investigators with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, assisted by the FBI, arrived at the mosque Friday night and were set to take over the investigation, authorities said. It was unclear Saturday if federal charges would be leveled against Dial. This was not the first time the mosque in Coachella was damaged as the result of a criminal act. On Nov. 4, 2014, during early morning prayers, someone fired five shots at the mosque. No one was injured in that incident, which was investigated as a hate crime. Despite a $12,000 reward for information leading to an arrest in the shooting, the case remains unsolved. Coachella city officials condemned the apparent arson. ""We see this as a cowardly act of vandalism that we do not tolerate in our community,"" Coachella Mayor Steven Hernandez said in statement released Friday evening. ""Freedom of religion is one of our core values in this country, so any time we witness violence or vandalism directed at a religious institution, it flies in the face of everything we stand for and believe in as Americans.” More than 20 community members gathered behind the crime scene tape outside of the burned mosque in Coachella in the minutes after Friday's fire was first reported. Many who attend the mosque came to show their support for their community and fight back against what they believe is a religiously-motivated act. ""This is just another form of a terrorist attack on Muslims,” Muhammad Bwaneh, who prays at the mosque regularly. “Whoever did this is considered a terrorist for attacking a place of peace where people come to do their prayers."" An anti-Muslim backlash has occurred in several incidents nationwide since the San Bernardino mass shooting and the Nov. 13 Paris attacks. A severed pig's head was left outside a mosque in Philadelphia. An Islamic center in Florida was defaced. A Sikh temple in Orange County was vandalized by someone who mistook it for a mosque and left graffiti that included a profane reference to ISIS. Contributing: The Associated Press"
http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/12/muslims-fear-prejudice-in-wake-of-anti-islamic-sentiment,"Advocates concerned about discrimination in wake of mosque fire in California and Georgia teacher asking girl if she had a bomb – and other incidents across US Last modified on Fri 14 Jul 2017 21.22 BST The recent mass shooting in San Bernadino, California and terror attacks in Paris have helped spark “an unprecedented and dramatic increase” in violent and hostile incidents against Muslims in America, advocates say. Such incidents have also, however, prompted spontaneous displays of community support.  In an febrile atmosphere stoked in particular by comments from Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, incidents ranging from arson to assault have been recorded across the US. Children have faced bullying and sectarian insults in schools. In California on Saturday, the FBI was investigating a fire at a mosque in Riverside County that authorities said was set deliberately. Fire broke out at the entrance to the Islamic Center of Palm Springs on Friday afternoon, while a small number of members were engaged in prayer. No one was injured but local US congressman Paul Ruiz said an incendiary device may have caused the fire and urged the incident be investigated as a hate crime. On Saturday, it was reported that a suspect had been arrested and charged. Reymundo Nour, the mosque’s acting imam, said people described hearing a “loud boom” and seeing flames. The mosque, in Coachella, is in the same part of California as San Bernardino, where a couple believed by law enforcement to have become radicalised by Islamic fundamentalism carried out a shooting at an office earlier this month. Fourteen people died and 21 were wounded. The man and woman who carried out the shooting were killed by police. Elsewhere, in Georgia on Friday it was reported that a 13-year-old schoolgirl who was wearing a hijab was asked by her middle school teacher whether she had a bomb in her backpack. The girl, who has not been named, said the question “was very disrespectful”, according to a local report. Abdirizak Aden, the girl’s father, said his daughter was singled out. “We are Muslims, we live in America, I didn’t teach my children to hate people,” he said. A spokeswoman for Gwinnett county public schools, on the outskirts of Atlanta, confirmed the incident and said the remark was inappropriate, but said the unnamed teacher had no “ill intent”. Theprincipal has apologised to the family. On Saturday a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair), told the Guardian the Gwinnett incident was just one of a growing number it believes are indicative of rising prejudice against Muslims in America. Cair says such sentiments are being fueled by inflammatory remarks by politicians, made in light of recent attacks. On Monday, at a rally in South Carolina, Trump called for all Muslims to be barred from entering the US. “This is clearly symptomatic of the rising anti-Muslim sentiment in our society,” said Ibrahim Hooper, national communications director for Cair. “When we get this kind of casual stereotyping and bigoted comments towards American Muslims, in particular young people, it’s very damaging.” Hooper said the group was still compiling statistics but had detected a distinct increase in attacks. He numbered such recent incidents in “the dozens”. “We are seeing an unprecedented and dramatic increase in anti-Muslim displays and hate crimes, and a level of hysteria in our society,” Hooper said. “It’s meant to intimidate. It began with the Paris attacks, continued through San Bernardino and now with Donald Trump almost giving permission to bigots to take out their feelings on American Muslims it is reaching a high level.” The Cair head office in Washington and a regional office in Santa Clara, in the Bay Area of California, were both evacuated on Friday after suspicious packages containing white powder were delivered. The substances turned out to be harmless. Among other incidents in recent days, a mosque was reported vandalized in Phoenix, Arizona, though no motive was immediately established. In Pflugerville, near Austin, Texas, a copy of the Qur’an, torn and smeared with faeces, was placed at an entrance to a mosque. According to local reports in Florida, two Muslim women in the Tampa Bay area were attacked after leaving prayer meetings – one was shot at and the other almost driven off the road and her car pelted with stones. After the incident in Pflugerville, it was reported that neighbours who were not Muslims made donations, left flowers and cards and spoke against the unpleasant gesture. One boy was reported to have donated the money from his piggybank. In Irving, Texas, where the authorities recently attracted notoriety for arresting a 14-year-old schoolboy, Ahmed Mohamed, on suspicion of making a bomb that turned out to be a clock, an armed anti-Muslim and anti-gun control group was expected to organize a demonstration on Saturday. Members of the group have previously protested outside the Islamic Center in Irving. While few in number, they make an impact because they wear camouflage gear and carry firearms as well as placards. The little-known group calls itself the Three Percenters – a reference to untrained civilians who took up arms in the Revolutionary War – and claims to be a grass-roots “patriotic” movement organised through social media. Also in the last few days, in New York a man was charged with criminal mischief and attempted assault as hate crimes, in relation to a violent incident involving Muslim members of staff at a pizza shop in the city. In California, a man was arrested and accused of spraying anti-Islamic State graffiti outside a Sikh temple in Buena Vista Park. In Omaha, Nebraska, several atheist and humanist groups planned to visit the local Islamic Center on Saturday to express their support. The building has been vandalized three times since the summer, most recently after the attacks in Paris. Cards expressing support, which came flooding in after a recent incident of vandalism, are prominently on display at the Center, according to a local report. In his weekly address on Saturday, President Obama called for unity and an end to prejudice and discrimination in America."

http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-mock-mass-shooting-texas-20151212-story.html,"AUSTIN, TEXAS — Guns on one side of the street, counter-protesters making bathroom noises on the other. About a dozen gun rights activists staged an open carry march and mock mass shooting Saturday near the University of Texas, only to be outnumbered by counter-demonstrators who waved sex toys and tried to drown them out with chants. Man arrested on hate crime and arson charges in fire at Coachella Valley mosque The groups Come and Take It Texas and Don'tcomply.com initially wanted to hold their event on campus, but were told by school officials they would be charged with criminal trespassing. The group instead held their march, with several members openly carrying real assault-style rifles, in an area of shops and restaurants next to campus known as ""The Drag."" The groups then slipped away from most media and onlookers and regrouped across the street from a campus chapel to ""shoot"" six people with cardboard guns. Victims were outlined with chalk to show where they fell. After publicizing their event for nearly a week, organizers said they purposely avoided the crowds and media gathered to cover the event to prove that a shooter can strike anywhere and anytime. ""This is what happens. In real (shooting) events like this, you don't know when they're going to happen, you don't know where they're going to happen ... we purposely did it that way,"" said Jason Orsek, vice president of both gun groups. The march and mock shooting event were met with mocking from Texas students and staff. ""Mock shootings mock victims,"" one group chanted while others waived sex toys and sounded off with the noise makers. The Austin campus is home to one of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history: sniper Charles Whitman killed 16 people in 1966, shooting dozens of victims from a perch atop the central clock tower. The event Saturday also occurred two days before the three-year anniversary of the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in Connecticut that killed 26 people, many of whom were children. Armed 'Three Percenters' turn protests toward Muslim Americans ""It's tasteless,"" said Robert Oxford, a Texas graduate student, instructor and member of the group Gun-Free UT said of the mock event. The Texas legislature this year voted to allow concealed handguns on college campuses although public universities can carve out gun-free zones. Plans under consideration for the Austin campus would prohibit firearms in dorms but allow them in classrooms.

http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/127996101/0/phoenix/local~In-Mesa-Mitt-Romney-douses-talk-of-conventionfloor-comeback/,"Mitt Romney on Saturday did his best to squelch talk of a secret plan to again nominate him for president at next year's Republican National Convention in Cleveland. ""Please let me know who's doing that and I'll have a word with them. I'm not running,"" Romney, a former Massachusetts governor and the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, said after officially endorsing U.S. Sen. John McCain's re-election at a rally at Dobson High School in Mesa. ""There are a number of people who I support, who I think would be terrific presidents, whether it's Jeb Bush or Chris Christie or Marco Rubio or Lindsey Graham or Carly Fiorina. The list goes on and on. ... We're going to see how the process works out and I expect that we're going to be very happy."" Romney early on took his name out of contention for the 2016 race, but BuzzFeed News reported Thursday on a ""secret plan"" by ""wealthy donors and die-hard loyalists"" to nominate him from the convention floor. Other national reports have suggested that Republican establishment figures are so rattled by the success of GOP front-runner Donald Trump's outsider campaign that they are already bracing for a potentially nasty brokered convention. ""I'm heading the 'Draft Romney' campaign,"" quipped McCain, an Arizona Republican and the 2008 GOP White House nominee. McCain and Romney share the distinction of being the two Republicans who lost to President Barack Obama: McCain in 2008, and Romney in 2012. As he did during a 2010 appearance at Mesa High School, Romney asked Arizona voters to send McCain back to the U.S. Senate for another six-year term. McCain is ""a great senator for Arizona,"" but also ""a critical senator for America,"" he said. ""What America needs is more of John McCain conservatism -- that's what makes America great,"" Romney told the crowd of about 1,000 people. ""This is a man who will do everything in his power to keep America safe. ""... He is a lion in the Senate. He roars and people listen."" McCain has been criticized as too liberal by some elements of the Arizona Republican Party, which formally censured him in 2014. This election cycle, McCain is facing Kelli Ward, a Republican state senator from Lake Havasu City, and three other GOP rivals -- Alex Meluskey of Scottsdale, David Pizer of Mayer and Clair Van Steenwyk of Sun City West -- in Arizona's 2016 GOP Senate primary. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, D-Ariz., is the leading candidate for the Democratic Senate nomination. During the 30-minute rally, Romney and McCain both took quite a bit of time during the rally inside the Dobson High gym hammering Obama over foreign-policy and national-security issues. ""By the way, is there anybody in this room that thinks that this country wouldn't be one heck of a lot more secure with President Romney?"" McCain, the Senate Armed Service Committee chairman, asked from the stage. Later, after saying the dangerous world situation demands that the United States elect a Republican president in 2016, McCain mischievously teased: ""Maybe we can say, run, Mitt, run?"" Both McCain and Romney have been on the receiving end this year of potshots from Trump, the celebrity billionaire who has topped national GOP polls for months. And the two have criticized Trump, too. Trump and McCain engaged in a high-profile feud in which Trump stoked controversy by ridiculing the former prisoner-of-war McCain's status as a war hero. He also has repeatedly slammed Romney for blowing the 2012 election against Obama. During the rally, McCain said that Obama's planned influx of up to 10,000 refugees from Syria, which is in the midst of a brutal civil war, should be put on pause to make sure Islamic State terrorists are not infiltrating their ranks. After the event, McCain told reporters that the American public needs to have confidence that the U.S. anti-terror screening system works, especially after the Dec. 2 terrorist mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. But he rejected Trump's call for a temporary ban on all Muslims coming into the country. ""We seem to be worrying about what Mr. Trump says about immigration, when this president has been an abject failure and San Bernardino was just the biggest attack on the United States of America since 9/11,"" McCain said. ""We've got to get our priorities straight."" Romney said he has confidence in his party's presidential-nomination process. ""In the months ahead, you're going to find that the American people do what they typically do, which is vote for people who call on the best of the American people,"" Romney said. ""We look for our leaders to call us to be greater than we otherwise might be, and that's what we're going to find in our nominee."" Romney and McCain were joined on the Dobson High School stage Saturday by Cindy McCain, the senator's wife, and junior U.S. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., and his wife, Cheryl. Saturday's McCain-Romney rally was the third big political event on the Dobson campus in recent years. In February 2009, Obama spoke at the school, delivering a speech on the housing-mortgage crisis. In March 2010, McCain appeared there at a re-election rally with former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. AZCENTRAL Jeff Flake, John McCain rebuke Trump on Muslim ban; Joe Arpaio sidesteps"

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/us/kricket-nimmons-transgender-surgery.html?partner=rssnyt&emc=rss," After a rocky life in the South, a Brooklyn resident became one of the first New Yorkers to undergo gender reassignment surgery paid for by Medicaid. Kricket Nimmons on her way to Philadelphia to see a specialist in gender reassignment surgery.Credit...Todd Heisler/The New York Times Supported by By Deborah Sontag Perched on a gurney at dawn, Kricket Jerná Nimmons, 40, kicked her feet giddily, like a girl on the edge of a pool, preparing to take a plunge. She wore a hospital gown and purple socks with paw prints. Her face was clean-scrubbed — “no lash, no makeup, just me” — and she looked at peace. “So, this is it,” she said, exhaling theatrically, which is her way. A Brooklynite by way of South Carolina and Georgia, Ms. Nimmons was ticking down the minutes, as she had ticked down the months, until she would be wheeled into an operating room for gender reassignment surgery. It was a moment she had long dreamed about but considered out of reach, a shimmer at the edge of her field of vision. Now, though, societal attitudes toward “transgenderalism,” as Ms. Nimmons calls it, were shifting so rapidly that many health plans were overturning their long-held exclusions of transition-related care. Even public insurers were approving surgical procedures that, until recently, were accessible only to those who could pay out of pocket, despite medical consensus about their safety and efficacy. Seizing the opportunity, Ms. Nimmons was about to become one of the first low-income New Yorkers to undergo a genital reconstruction paid for by Medicaid. In a few hours, if all went well, her body would be aligned with her identity for the first time, and she would no longer be “a chick with a wiener,” in her words, but “a woman in mind, body and soul, before the Lord and before the law.” Peering under the sheet that draped her that early October morning at a hospital outside Philadelphia, Ms. Nimmons bade farewell to what she called “my friend” — that “extra part” for which she was pronounced male at birth. Tattooed on her right forearm was her birth name, “Jerome,” complete with quotation marks. “When I lay down and when I wake up, I’ll be a whole new creature, a whole new being,” Ms. Nimmons declared. “Out with the old, in with the new.” Over the course of this year, Ms. Nimmons has often said she never expected to make it to 40, much less to “complete” the long, lonely journey from Jerome through Meeka (her interim name) and Magnolia Thunderpussy (her drag name) to Kricket. As a black transgender woman from the rural South, she had traversed a rocky path. She endured sexual abuse as a child, an H.I.V.-positive diagnosis and eviction from her family’s home as a teenager. She made her living by hustling, went to prison for fraud and theft, and suffered sexual assault by guards. She survived botched black-market medical procedures, suicide attempts and AIDS-related illnesses. And her experience echoed a harsh reality. The rates of extreme poverty, homelessness, H.I.V. infection, attempted suicide, assault and incarceration, which are high for transgender people as a whole, are extraordinarily high for black transgender women. “You’re talking about some of the most disempowered people in our society,” said Randi Ettner, a clinical psychologist in Evanston, Ill., and a board member of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health. “Some of these women have experienced constant, chronic trauma — trauma upon trauma. Yet what I also see in them is the most astounding resilience.” Many of Ms. Nimmons’s acquaintances have not beaten the odds. They have died in their 20s and 30s of illness, violence and suicide. So steeled was she to join them, in fact, that she had a running joke with friends that they had better get to her body before her mother did so she would not end up buried in a three-piece suit with a bow tie. Last year, after getting out of prison in Georgia, she was broken, physically and mentally, she said. She was jobless, all but homeless and in poor health; her T-cell count, a measure of her immune system’s strength, had fallen to a dangerously low level. She did not know how to save herself from becoming “extinct,” as she put it. Then her closest friend, a native New Yorker named Kahmel Gilliard, whom she had once taken under wing in South Carolina, offered a lifeline: “Come on up here to Brooklyn, baby,” he said. “This is a place that will help you take care of yourself, and you won’t have to do anything illegal to survive.” So last fall, Ms. Nimmons boarded a discount bus to New York City to start over in a place of greater tolerance and robust, high-quality services for people living with H.I.V. She had no idea that her effort to reboot her life would dovetail with the state’s effort to offer greater protection and care to transgender New Yorkers, as well as with a year of increasing visibility for transgender Americans. After a 13-hour bus ride, Ms. Nimmons disembarked in the bustle of Chinatown. She had $200 in her pocket and butterflies in her stomach. “I just looked up and I said, ‘Lord, whatever you have planned for me, let it be,’ ” she said. “And then I hailed a cab.” Five months later, Ms. Nimmons contacted a reporter at The New York Times. The Times had just published an article about a transgender inmate suing Georgia corrections officials, and Ms. Nimmons had crossed paths with the woman, Ashley Diamond, in a male prison. “Wow, wow, wow,” she said by way of greeting, her voice echoing through a speakerphone. “I just want to say I’m shocked that the world cares about the mistreatment of transgender women while incarcerated. Our story usually goes unnoticed and untold. People like me and Ashley — we live the reality, not the reality show.” A metronomic clicking followed, puzzling at the time. Later, over the eight months that The Times tracked her odyssey, it would become clear. Ms. Nimmons likes to punctuate her pronouncements by strumming her long, lacquered fingernails. It was spring, and Ms. Nimmons was feeling reborn. She introduced herself as a makeup artist and motivational speaker who was returning to school to become an undertaker. This description was more aspirational than true; she was getting a bit ahead of herself. But Ms. Nimmons had settled into New York with remarkable alacrity. Within weeks of arriving, she secured a spacious one-bedroom apartment on an eastern Brooklyn boulevard through the city’s H.I.V./AIDS Services Administration, and obtained food stamps. Those two things were crucial: “Once you’re not having to concentrate on whether you have a roof over your head or where your next meal is going to come from, it makes it easier to live healthy,” she said. In short order, she became a client of Amida Care, a Medicaid health plan that caters to people with H.I.V. and other chronic conditions. She started getting regular checkups and counseling at the Housing Works Community Healthcare center in East New York. Adhering faithfully to a new antiretroviral medication regimen, she saw her viral load drop and grew steadily stronger. Before long, she was able to contemplate the idea of a future, which meant becoming Kricket, legally and anatomically. For most of her adult life, Ms. Nimmons had lived first part time, then full time, as a woman, aided by hormone therapy, buttocks augmentation and double-D breast implants. But officially, she was still male, and, like most transgender people, she faced routine problems because of the incongruity between her gender presentation and her identity documents. “I’ve always been passable,” Ms. Nimmons said. “But then you hand over your license to a police officer, and you get the double take. Or worse.” In a sign of the times, transgender name-change clinics have become “a new trend in pro bono,” according to a news release from the American Bar Association. The Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund, which has helped about 1,500 transgender people change their names, connected Ms. Nimmons with what she called “a fancy Park Avenue lawyer.” Ms. Nimmons chose Kricket mostly because it was her childhood nickname. She thought her mother, who had resisted calling her Meeka, would be more likely to use it, and her mother’s acceptance was pivotal to her. Also, Cricket, with a C, was a character she admired on “The Young and the Restless,” a blond model turned Legal Aid lawyer. “She was a force to be reckoned with, and she was beautiful,” she said. Preparing to go before a judge meant preparing to disclose her criminal history and declare it past. Over the spring, she became increasingly confident she could surface from a life underground. Until her last arrest in 2011, she had provided for herself by hustling, she said. Some hustles were legal, like her makeup jobs, and some were not, like forging checks and committing credit card fraud. “It was a life of crime,” Ms. Nimmons said. “Even though my harm was never physical to anybody else, I’m ashamed of what I did. But I did it to survive. It’s hard to live regular as a transgender woman, and transitioning is expensive.” Many in her world down South lived off the grid. It was what she called “the lifestyle” — a subculture of black gay and transgender people who embraced a glammed-up outlaw existence because society treated them as too transgressive to participate in the mainstream. They belonged to “gay families” — she had nine “gay kids,” she said — as well as to houses named after fashion designers. Hers was the House of Chanel in Atlanta, and she performed in drag pageants, dancing to Donna Summer’s hits. “Did you ever see the movie ‘Paris Is Burning’?” she asked, referring to the 1990 documentary about such houses in New York. “That was the lifestyle.” Shamari-René Cherry, her “little sister” and the founding mother of her house in Atlanta, said, “All the pretty girls were Chanel. “It was like a secret society,” she continued. “It was also a facade. In the light of day, you’re disowned by your real family, and you’re making illegal money. But at night, you’re a celebrity equivalent to Diana Ross or Whitney Houston.” Everybody looked after everybody else, pooling resources, which created bonds but also health risks. Those who were starting to transition shared hormones bought on the black market and gave one another injections. They also sought out illicit liquid silicone to enhance their hips, buttocks and sometimes breasts; on one occasion, Ms. Nimmons said, she almost died after an underground technician “stuck me wrong,” causing a pulmonary embolism. Opting “out of the game” in her move to New York, Ms. Nimmons was determined to get by on a monthly disability check of $722 — a third of which went toward her mostly city-paid rent — and a little extra cash from the occasional “face,” as she referred to her makeup jobs. She led a quiet, boring life, she said. With Mr. Gilliard as her frequent companion, she spent a lot of time in her bare-walled apartment, watching television talk shows, reality shows and nighttime soap operas. And, in a way that stirred her ambitions, she began to see her own experiences refracted through the prism of TV, with its new spotlight on transgender issues, characters and personalities. “Everybody’s getting on this transgender train now,” she said. It irked Ms. Nimmons that Caitlyn Jenner, who won an Olympic gold medal as Bruce, was getting so much attention for a transition in its infancy. In preacherly paragraphs, she vented about this, sometimes directly to Ms. Jenner’s image on the screen. “One thing you have on your side, Miss Caitlyn, is endless resources,” she said one day. “Most of us don’t. Most of us can’t transition physically in the snap of a finger. It takes years. It’s good you have accepted your truth. But what about all those transgender women who got killed, thrown off bridges, their throats slashed? What about the women who prostituted themselves, who got sick, who died? You don’t represent those girls.” Ms. Nimmons, though, does. And the associate medical director at her Housing Works health center bolstered her confidence to see herself that way. “You will definitely be a shining example for all the other ladies who are going through the same process,” Natacha Baron, a family nurse practitioner, told her at one appointment. “Yes, ma’am,” Ms. Nimmons responded. “Because after a point, you get to a point of saying that you’re not doing this for you anymore. It’s beyond you. Because there are a lot of trans individuals today that’s lost.” In late March, emboldened by the idea that her story might be part of a larger narrative, Ms. Nimmons reached out to her idol, Laverne Cox, the glamorous transgender actress and advocate. “Miss Cox,” she wrote in a private message on Facebook. “Just wanted to let you know because of you I decided to testify against the officer that raped me while I was incarcerated.” Ms. Nimmons had just returned from Atlanta, where she attended a federal court hearing to decide a lawsuit she had brought against the former officer, Duone Clark, who had sexually abused her in the Gwinnett County Detention Center. It was not the first time she had been abused by a guard. But it was the first time she reported such abuse and there were consequences — significant consequences that make hers “a rare and important case,” said Chase Strangio, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union. Transgender women in male institutions are known to be at far greater risk of sexual assault than other inmates. Federal rules now require that placement decisions for them be made case by case and not solely on the basis of genitalia. Isolating transgender inmates in “protective custody” is strongly discouraged. But, in the years before these rules were in place, Ms. Nimmons was assigned to male jails and prisons as a result of “my downstairs anatomy,” she said. Typically, she would be placed in a single cell, sometimes even locked down for 23 hours a day, supposedly for her own protection from other inmates. Nobody was protecting her from the guards, though. In late 2011, she let herself believe that Mr. Clark was her boyfriend and protector in the Gwinnett jailhouse. As if addressing him directly, she said in an interview, “I allowed you to fool me that you like me, you care for me, I was special.” She eventually learned she was not the only transgender detainee who was an object of his attentions. “I felt used like a fetish,” she said. “I felt dirty. I felt nasty. I felt belittled.” She confided in a new officer. And then, to her astonishment, Mr. Clark was not only dismissed but arrested. That almost never happens when transgender inmates complain of abuse. But Ms. Nimmons, as her lawyer, Jeffrey R. Sliz, said, was smart: “She pulled a Monica Lewinsky.” That is, she saved a pair of boxer shorts containing the officer’s semen, squirreling them away in her trash bin, because she knew she would not be believed without hard evidence. There were also, it turned out, videotapes showing Mr. Clark entering her cell and demanding and getting oral sex. Mr. Clark was ultimately sentenced to 10 years, three of them in prison, for sexual assault and dereliction of duty. His boss, the sheriff, denounced him as a “cockroach” in the local news media. At the hearing, Mr. Sliz, who was seeking a default judgment after Mr. Clark failed to respond to the lawsuit, was struck by Ms. Nimmons’s poise. “I was never as surprised, quite frankly, as to how — I don’t know if the word would be ‘elegant’ — how confident she was when she talked with the judge about how this sexual assault had affected her,” he said. Labeling Mr. Clark’s actions “reprehensible,” Judge William S. Duffey Jr. of United States District Court awarded Ms. Nimmons $200,000. Mr. Strangio of the A.C.L.U. said he was unaware of any other case in which a transgender person secured both a conviction and a high civil damage award against a guard. It was something of a symbolic victory, given that Mr. Clark is in prison and Mr. Sliz will have to negotiate a payment schedule with him on his release, knowing well that, as the judge said, “regrettably, there are probably not many resources there.” But Ms. Nimmons was not used to winning at all. So it made her feel empowered, as she told Ms. Cox in that Facebook message. “Because of you I was able to find closure and speak for all my transgender sisters that have lost their voice to violence,” she wrote. And then, to her delight, Ms. Cox responded: “I am so happy I have inspired you. We are a strong people. We are a resilient people. Sending lots and lots of love today. Stay in the love, Laverne.” Wearing a gray tank top that showed off her ample cleavage and form-fitting leggings tucked into gold-lamé sneakers, Ms. Nimmons stood at a fast-food counter in New York’s Pennsylvania Station one morning in late June. “Do I look fat?” she asked. “I think I’m going to go on that water, lemon and cayenne pepper diet. The Beyoncé diet.” She ordered a taco. “Today’s a big day,” she said. It was the day that Ms. Nimmons was heading to Philadelphia’s Main Line suburbs for her first appointment with the plastic surgeon who would perform her vaginoplasty. It also happened to be the day that same-sex marriage was legalized, and that President Obama was traveling to her home state for the funeral of the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, who had been killed in a mass shooting in a Charleston church. Ms. Nimmons conflated the personal and the political: “History is being made,” she said. “People said this day would never come for somebody like me, an African-American transgender woman without a lot of resources. It’s just like with the Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage. People said it would never happen. It’s just like with Obama. People said there’d never be a black president.” “So I guess people don’t really know,” she added. Throughout the train ride, she was reflective, gazing out at New Jersey. She stroked a tattoo on her right arm, a roughhewn image of hands clasped in prayer. She had had it inked in prison, to cover up the scars of a suicide attempt. “I never liked drama, but at that moment I felt I was going down,” she said. “Now I feel blessed.” Coming from a conservative Christian community, she had had Bible verses thrown at her often, and especially once she started revealing her surgical plans, she said. For instance, from Deuteronomy 23: “No man who has been castrated or whose penis has been cut off may be included among the Lord’s people.” She had, in fact, undergone an orchiectomy, or removal of the testes, a couple of months prior. She thought that it would be a good first step to take, and that it would have the positive effect of reducing her need for testosterone blockers and feminizing hormones if she went no further. But she still suffered from what one expert describes as “the cosmic toothache” that plagues people with severe, persistent gender dysphoria. (Gender dysphoria is the clinical term for the distress experienced by many, but not all, transgender people.) So the next step seemed obvious: a vaginoplasty over the summer. That did not mean her nerves were steady. Exiting the train in Philadelphia, she spoke by cellphone with Ms. Cherry, who is also a transgender woman. “I’m scared, Sha-Sha,” she told her, using her nickname. Ms. Cherry responded: “Man up, girl.” Strutting toward a taxi line, Ms. Nimmons threw back her head and laughed. Laughing with her, the dispatcher flirted. “If I’d known you was coming, I’d have ordered a limousine,” he said, ushering her into a car. The taxi pulled up to Rumer Cosmetic Surgery in a stately white Victorian house in the upscale town of Ardmore. Stepping into the hushed office and settling into a black leather chair, Ms. Nimmons whispered: “Wow. We ain’t in Brooklyn anymore.” The transgender movement has challenged society to break out of traditional ways of classifying gender, and to understand that gender identity does not always fit neatly into male and female boxes. Many transgender people do not desire to alter their genitals surgically. Like Ms. Cherry, who runs a skin care business in Atlanta, they live comfortably and successfully with hormone therapy and, in some cases, “top surgery.” But for those with severe, persistent gender dysphoria, gender reassignment surgery is “a medically necessary intervention to end lifelong suffering,” said Dr. Ettner, the Illinois psychologist, who co-edited “Principles of Transgender Medicine and Surgery.” In a recent federal hearing, Dr. Ettner and other experts testified that decades of research had confirmed the therapeutic value of such surgery, finding that most patients fared better psychologically, socially and economically afterward, and that regrets were rare. Yet until recently, the American health care system considered gender reassignment surgery to be elective, cosmetic or experimental. It was available only to those who could afford to pay privately — with many traveling abroad, especially to Thailand, for better deals — and most could not. A male-to-female vaginoplasty typically costs about $25,000, and female-to-male surgery, which is more complex, can cost four times that, specialists said. Over a quarter of transgender people, meanwhile, report income of less than $20,000 a year. In 2010, the National Transgender Discrimination Survey found that 23 percent of transgender women had had vaginoplasties; an additional 64 percent aspired to have one “someday.” (Female-to-male procedures were even rarer.) In recent years, however, “there has been a tectonic change in this field,” Dr. Ettner said. A third of Fortune 500 companies now offer transgender-inclusive health care benefits, up from zero in 2002, according to the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index for 2015. And public insurers and employers have started to follow suit. Medicare lifted its ban on gender reassignment surgery last year. The federal government ordered its insurance carriers to cover transition-related care for its employees. And nine state Medicaid programs have dropped their exclusions for transgender health care, with New York doing so this past March. Still, transgender people continue to grapple with denials of transition-related care even where coverage exists, and the skeletal network of providers is grappling to meet the mushrooming demand for service. Whereas Dr. Ettner’s medical team once went from hospital to hospital in Chicago “begging them to offer us facilities for these surgeries,” now “they are begging us,” she said. Dr. Loren Schechter, a surgical specialist who is Dr. Ettner’s colleague, estimated that no more than 10 surgeons nationwide perform vaginoplasties, and that fewer than six perform both male-to-female and female-to-male genital surgery, as he does. Demand for their services has skyrocketed; collectively, they will perform some 2,000 such operations this year, he said. This fall, Dr. Schechter moderated the first panel on reconstructive transgender surgery in the 89-year history of Plastic Surgery the Meeting, the annual conference of the profession. “The surgery is finally coming out of the shadows,” he said. Dressed in a white coat, green scrubs and silver clogs, Dr. Kathy Rumer welcomed Ms. Nimmons into an examination room. A former aerospace engineer who made a midlife career switch, Dr. Rumer said she had been exposed to transgender patients during her fellowship training, and came to empathize with them as a population underserved, even shunned, by medicine in the past. She started performing transition-related surgery a decade ago, and now does about 100 transgender “bottom surgeries” a year — as well as breast augmentation, chest masculinization and facial feminization. Most of her patients, like Ms. Nimmons, travel from out of town, and she rents rooms on her third floor — she lives on the second floor, above her office — to those who need a place to stay during the post-surgical recovery period. Ms. Nimmons was her first New York Medicaid patient. New York was caught flat-footed by the new demand for transgender medicine and surgery, though the Mount Sinai Health System is set to open a Center for Comprehensive Transgender Health this winter, and plans to bring in outside experts to operate and to train and proctor its surgical team. When the new rules took effect, however, Amida Care, like other health plans, had no providers who specialized in male-to-female vaginoplasties. So it executed a “single-case agreement” with Dr. Rumer for Ms. Nimmons. Though it counts some 400 transgender people among its 6,000 members, she was the first to request and be approved for gender reassignment surgery. In fact, by Oct. 1, New York Medicaid, which had paid for a total of 18 surgical procedures for people with gender dysphoria, had yet to pay for a single genital reconstruction. This is partly because many Medicaid clients, who just began getting medically supervised health care for their transition, are not yet equipped to document their gender dysphoria in order to qualify for surgery, should they want it. They need to have undergone hormone therapy for at least 12 continuous months, and to have lived full time in their gender identity during that period. They also need to furnish two referral letters from mental health professionals. During her journey to Philadelphia, Ms. Nimmons kept removing her letters from her purse and reading aloud the line, “It would be in Ms. Nimmons’s best interest to have G.R.S. to complete her transition process.” (G.R.S. refers to gender reassignment surgery.) “A lot of girls would kill to have these letters,” she said. Emerging from her examination by Dr. Rumer, Ms. Nimmons appeared somewhat stunned. “I’ve never had no lady look between my legs before,” she said. She had learned during her examination that she needed to push back her surgery until the fall so that her orchiectomy scars would be fully healed. This came as something of a relief, she said, because it would give her more time to be mentally prepared. In the taxi back to the train station, she talked loudly on her cellphone. “Yeah, the doctor said she needs my scrotum sac to be healed better from the castration before she does the sex change,” she said. The driver swiveled his head to look at his passenger, who batted her long false lashes, and he nearly drove off the road. Ms. Nimmons sounded uncharacteristically subdued when she answered her phone on a trip home to South Carolina a few weeks later. “I’m at peace that I have lived the life I was given to the best of my abilities,” she said when asked how she was doing. “I really don’t feel my work is done, but what has to be has to be.” She was in a hospital, ragingly ill with bacterial meningitis, and the fight had gone out of her. It did not help that she had just learned that a former boyfriend, in his 30s, had entered hospice care. “Christopher helped me pay for my top surgery,” she said, referring to her breast implants. “I call him the father of my twins.” She continued: “He’s been sick 15 years; I’ve been sick 24. He always had more problems, but sometimes, you know, because of my status, my immune system gets kind of compromised and weakened.” Ms. Nimmons learned she was H.I.V. positive at 16. It was the unfortunate legacy of her very first relationship, she said, with a man 17 years older than her who died last year, leaving her not knowing whether to feel sad or mad. She had accompanied a girlfriend who needed a pregnancy test to a clinic in her hometown, Orangeburg. While there, she decided on a whim to be tested for H.I.V. The health department sent workers to track her down at home or at school to deliver the bad news. “At 16, I didn’t know what to do with the information,” she said. “I kept it hidden for years.” She had had practice keeping her mouth shut. “You’re taught within the African-American family that you have to be quiet with certain things; certain things are not to be spoken of,” she said. As a child, she thought of herself as “a little boy named Jerome that was cute, that was adorable, that was very feminine.” Attitudes were far different in the rural South in the 1980s than they are now for “my little Jazz,” she said, referring affectionately to Jazz Jennings, the transgender girl in South Florida who has an accepting family and a reality show on TLC. Ms. Nimmons knew from about age 10 that she liked boys, and everybody else knew, too. She was routinely called “sissy,” assigned the role of cheerleader during neighborhood basketball games and denied entry to a local Boy Scout troop, she said. Still, nothing was said aloud inside her home, not even after she swallowed a bottle of Midol pills, the only thing she could find in the medicine cabinet, and landed in a psychiatric hospital under suicide watch. Sometime later, after an argument, a friend of hers put a photograph of Ms. Nimmons under the windshield wipers of her mother’s car. In the picture, Ms. Nimmons was wearing a dress, one of her mother’s. Infuriated, her mother threw the picture at her and then, she said, burned it and the dress in the backyard. Soon, she said, her mother kicked her out of the house and, not knowing about Ms. Nimmons’s diagnosis, tried to scare her by saying she would end up dead of AIDS if she did not quit being gay. Her mother came to regret the remark, “feeling like she marked me, so to say, or spoke it into existence,” Ms. Nimmons said. Ms. Nimmons moved in with a friend’s family, graduated from high school and left South Carolina for Atlanta. For a year, she studied mass communications at Clark Atlanta University. But her failure to seek treatment for H.I.V. caught up with her, and she became deathly ill with pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. “That was my saddest moment,” her mother, Mamie Johnson Nimmons, said. “Learning she was H.I.V. positive and that she was so sick, in and out of the hospital — she was supposed to be in college!” At that time, in the mid-1990s, a cocktail of new drugs was being used to treat people with H.I.V., and the antiretroviral therapy was proving highly effective. But Ms. Nimmons, on leaving a hospital, did not keep taking the pills. “Back home, the health care system treated us like freaks,” she said. “So you didn’t trust the system and you didn’t trust the medication and you were basically in denial.” Transgender women, and particularly black transgender women, are at especially high risk for H.I.V. infection. A meta-analysis of studies in 15 countries estimated that H.I.V. prevalence for transgender women was nearly 50 times as high as for other adults of reproductive age. “Many trans people, shut out by their families, the education system, the workplace and the health care system, end up not having choices around what they do to survive and to transition,” said JoAnne Keatley, the director of the Center of Excellence for Transgender Health at the University of California, San Francisco. “They resort to sex work. They resort to alcohol and drugs to cope. They have poor options in terms of sex partners. “Throw in racism on top of transphobia,” she continued, “and, for transgender women of color, it’s a perfect storm for the epidemic.” In New York City, 93 percent of transgender women with newly diagnosed H.I.V. over a recent five-year period were black or Hispanic, a study showed. Doug Wirth, the president of Amida Care, said he saw providing access to transgender health care as a key step toward ending the H.I.V./AIDS epidemic by 2020, which is a New York state goal. Helping those who are already H.I.V. positive become “virally suppressed” will in turn help bring down “unacceptably high rates of new H.I.V. infection among people of trans experience,” he said. Ms. Nimmons agrees. But was it too late for her, she wondered in July, lying in the hospital bed where she had spent the previous 10 days? “I wanted to thank you,” she told a reporter on the phone. “I know whatever happens to me, you will be my storyteller.” In August, Ms. Nimmons met a man, a much younger man, who wanted to take her out on a date. “I guess I’m a cougar,” she said. Fully recovered from illness, she was preparing to lie low until her surgery. She was avoiding the subway to keep her exposure to infection at a minimum, and avoiding relationships because she was in limbo. So the timing was not great. “I made up some excuse like my boyfriend and I just got back together,” she said. “I took his number, put it in my Bible, and I’ll wait until December, I guess.” At a checkup at Housing Works, she repeated the story to her nurse, Ms. Baron, adding details. The guy was a professional boxer, 6-foot-7. She held her hands a foot apart to demonstrate the size of his feet, and laughed suggestively. “Maybe you won’t want somebody with ‘feet’ that big for quite a while,” Ms. Baron said. Relationships are tricky for transgender women, Ms. Nimmons said. “You have to figure out when to disclose,” she said. “Sometimes, you disclose, they get upset. Sometimes, you disclose, they like it too much, and you get upset. You’re dealing with a no-win situation until you have that completion.” She had a frightening experience in the spring. She invited a man to her apartment, making it clear beforehand that there would be no sex. “He thought otherwise,” she said, “and there was a struggle. The lady downstairs started banging on her ceiling. It scared him. He ran off. And I went into a deep hole for like three days. “My biggest fear,” she said, a short time after that encounter, “is having my friends come and find me dead. That’s one thing Bruce/Caitlyn will never feel. But that’s the life of a transgender woman in today’s society. Not sitting in front of a camera getting paid $100,000 to tell your story.” Before being cleared for surgery, Ms. Nimmons would have to be in good health, but her vitals and immune system appeared to have already bounced back. “She’s going to want to see your numbers,” Ms. Baron said, about Dr. Rumer. Ms Nimmons responded: “She didn’t even blink an eye at the H.I.V. She said it would be discrimination” to do so. While she was in the grip of meningitis, Ms. Nimmons had to miss the long-awaited court date for her name-change hearing. To the surprise of her lawyers, however, the judge simply approved the change in her absence. Ms. Nimmons had looked forward to making a public declaration in an open courtroom that she was transgender (and proud). So it was anticlimactic — but a relief. September passed slowly. Ms. Nimmons went through a period of the blues, during which she ate cake and ice cream and cried. She went through a stage of considerable anxiety about the vaginoplasty itself, provoked by obsessive watching of graphic YouTube videos about the surgery. She asked friends, and acquaintances, if she was doing the right thing. And finally, as the date approached, she let that all go. At the Housing Works clinic, she found herself the center of attention, and proud of it. “If you could have seen the looks on the girls’ faces of — of hope,” she said. In a stunning turnabout for their complicated relationship, Ms. Nimmons’s mother, who still lives in Orangeburg, had volunteered to accompany her to Philadelphia for the surgery. Over the last few years, as society had changed, her mother had, too. “It has been a process,” her mother said. “In the end, you can’t discriminate against your own child. You either get on the bandwagon or you get off.” Ms. Nimmons’s mother had originally intended to go to Las Vegas in the fall to celebrate her 60th birthday. “But I guess I’m going to have to put that on hold,” she said before her flight to New York. “Kricket needs me in her corner, and that’s my child.” Preparing to board a train to Philadelphia the day before her surgery, Ms. Nimmons was mortified that the ticket to her future was under the name Jerome. “Really?” she said of the ticket, which had been issued before her name change was official. “We’re going to have a burning ceremony to get rid of that ticket with that name on it.” Over the summer, she had changed her hairstyle from a flirty bob with bangs to a regal weave, with long, thick braids. She was dressed practically in jeans and a sweatshirt, no nail or eyelash extensions, cubic zirconia studs in her ears. Her usual torrent of words had tightened to near haiku. “Well, it’s come down to the wire,” she said. “One day left. Feelings are real. Very emotional.” Once aboard, she snuggled up to her mother. Grumpy about having cameras in her face, her mother looked away, out the window. She was tired, having been unsuccessful in finding any Mello Yello, her caffeinated drink of choice, in New York. And she was worried about rising floodwaters near her home in South Carolina. Ms. Nimmons, unfazed by her mother’s unresponsiveness, lifted her head from her shoulder. “And we’re off,” she said as the train started rolling. Her mother took a power nap. When she woke up, she confiscated some hard candies from Ms. Nimmons, who was supposed to be fasting. “I don’t want to hear the whining,” her mother said, “and you know you will whine.” Ms. Nimmons swiveled her head, taken aback: “I’m supposed to!” Her mother disagreed. “It’s what you wanted, so, sweetie, you got to put on your big-girl drawers and do it.” Ms. Nimmons told her mother that, given the nature of the surgery, she had not brought along drawers but rather adult diapers. “Well, put on your big-girl Depends then,” her mother said. transcript tk Once in Ardmore, as Ms. Nimmons approached the front door of Rumer Cosmetic Surgery, an African-American transgender man walked out. They eyed each other. “Hey, do I pass?” the man said, smiling. Ms. Nimmons flashed him a big grin. “We knew each other,” she said later. “Not personally. We just had a moment of understanding.” She and her mother settled into their room on the third floor, with its sloped ceiling and its stuffed red heart above the bed. Starting a preparation for the surgery, Ms. Nimmons wincingly drank a liquid mixture. Suddenly overcome by nerves, she started misplacing things — her phone, her pills. Unpacking, her mother got furious that Ms. Nimmons had brought along bags of snack food. “Just so you know, fat girls ain’t sexy,” she said. Head bowed, Ms. Nimmons left the room for her presurgical appointment. Later, turning in for the evening, she quoted a psalm: “Weeping may last through the night, but joy comes in the morning.” Before sunrise on Oct. 6, in a presurgical unit at Delaware County Memorial Hospital, Ms. Nimmons listened to gospel music through earbuds, then switched to the Christian Broadcasting Network on television and finally settled on a rerun of “I Love Lucy.” She was contemplative, shaking her head. “Little old me coming from a country town of South Carolina — Orangeburg, S.C. — is about to have G.R.S.,” she said. “Wow.” Overcome with emotion, she dabbed her eyes with paper towels. She said she was not thinking about surgical complications, but about life after the surgery, especially about the possibility of a real relationship. “You think about not having to disclose, but then you still have a history,” she said. “So there are still complications. But you think about how happy you will be. You’ll get someone who accepts you for you — mind, body and soul. Because in this world of transgenderalism, it’s hard. You know, they call us the transformers, the fembots. It’s hard for a transformer out there.” In an armchair beside her, her mother urged her one last time to be certain that she wanted to proceed with the irreversible surgery. “Mama!” she said. “How many times have you said that?” Her mother answered: “Fifty. And I’m going to say it 51 until you get your ass up in those stirrups.” Ms. Nimmons laughed, but with exasperation: “So you’re saying when I get finished I’m going to say, ‘Lord, please let me just go back’?” Her mother said yes. “No, I ain’t going to ask for it back!” she said, rolling her eyes. “They can have it. She can just take it and put it in a jar. Just sit it up on a shelf.” After a short period of silence, her mother said, “You’re going to have fun telling your daddy this.” It was moments before brakes-up on the gurney. Ms. Nimmons was stunned. “I thought you told him,” she said. “You picked a fine time to tell me you didn’t.” Revealing the nerves beneath her gruffness, her mother started crying as Ms. Nimmons was wheeled out of the room. As she rolled down the hallway, Ms. Nimmons covered her mouth with her hand and stared upward. Saying a silent prayer (whose content she later divulged), she asked God to forgive her sins and let his will be done. Tears leaked from the corners of her eyes as she disappeared, purple paw socks first, into the restricted area that held the operating room. The most common technique for a vaginoplasty is called a penile inversion. “Basically, the penis is disassembled, and its component parts are used to create the female anatomy,” Dr. Schechter said. The surgery gives patients a “neovagina,” clitoris and labia. Ms. Nimmons’s transformation took under four hours. Afterward, her mother spoke to Dr. Rumer. “The doctor said it went very well; he came through it fine,” she said, visibly relieved, though inadvertently using the male pronoun. The next morning, propped up in a hospital bed with a white-ruffled black shower cap on her head, Ms. Nimmons was surprisingly alert and eager to hold forth. “Crank it up,” she said to a videographer present. “I want to say: Never give up on your dreams,” the long soliloquy began. She effused gratitude for the doctor and nurses; her baby-faced best friend, Mr. Gilliard, who had taken a bus from New York to be by her side; and her mother: “To have her here with me is unthinkable,” she said. “Even though she done wrong in the beginning, she’s making it right in the end.” On the news that morning, she had been stunned to learn that hours before she went into surgery, a young black transgender woman named Kiesha Jenkins had been beaten, shot in the back and killed by a group of men in nearby Philadelphia. “Some of us don’t make it,” she said. “I was given an opportunity, and I’m going to ride it until the wheels fall off.” When all was said and done, who would Kricket Jerná Nimmons be? She possessed a clear vision before the surgery. She would blossom into “a real grown Southern lady.” She would blend into “straight” society, fall in love with a man who respected her, and pursue a career as an undertaker, putting crime and government assistance behind her. She would adopt a new, sophisticated look, kind of “Olivia Pope-ish,” in emulation of the lead character on “Scandal.” She would wear refined knit suits, like those made by the luxury brand St. John. She would be wasp-waisted and voluptuous. But a butterfly does not emerge from its cocoon overnight, she said. It took six weeks of near-hibernation in Brooklyn for Ms. Nimmons to recuperate sufficiently to venture forth into the world. Perhaps her first outing should not have been to Orangeburg. It was Thanksgiving time, however, and she longed to sit beneath the towering red pines, absorb the quiet and sip sweet iced tea. She missed her nieces and nephew, who accept her unconditionally, and her toy poodle, Lady, who has ears dyed pink. It was home. Or was it? “You still feel like an outcast,” she said, settling into a plastic chair outside her parents’ house because she was not allowed to take her visitors inside. “It falls into the category of — where do I belong?” Until news of her uncle’s impending death sidetracked their issues, she and her mother, and she and her brother, had been feuding. She had finally told her taciturn father about the surgery — obliquely: “I said, ‘I changed a big part of me’ ” — and he had responded with silence. Her friend Christopher, the one who had been in hospice care, had died shortly before her return — “the last of a dying breed,” she said. She felt his absence keenly, one less relationship tethering her to South Carolina. She contemplated cutting her trip short as she navigated the divide between her old and new worlds. Her hometown friends implored her to accompany them to a “leather and lace party” at a gay club in the state capital, for instance, but hadn’t she given up that lifestyle? she asked herself, even as she slipped her feet into black lace-up shoes with five-and-a-half-inch heels. Going forward, would she label herself a “heterosexual woman”? Would she — she did not know what to foresee — join a book club? Have “coffee shop dates”? Shortly before her surgery, she had unexpectedly fallen into a relationship with a 24-year-old transgender man who, as Ms. Nimmons characterized it, was “still biologically female.” This confused her. “I’ve never had a liking to women my whole life, but he’s special,” she said. Might she continue to identify as a transgender woman? It was an identity that suddenly presented her with opportunities. On her calendar for December were two — the shooting of an educational video for the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund and a role, potentially, in a scripted web series called “Eden’s Garden,” which focuses on black and Latino transgender men in New York City. She went ahead with the video, enjoying the chance to be an advocate for transgender rights as well as to be surrounded by cameras. But then she suffered a setback, physically and emotionally. After an unexpected return to Dr. Rumer’s office on Tuesday, she learned she would need revisionary surgery, which the doctor said happens with patients who do not follow postoperative instructions. Ms. Nimmons spent that night tossing and turning, and crying. The next morning, she posted this thought on her Facebook page: “Yesterday was a very trying day for me on the new journey that God has placed in my life. We ask God for a lot of things and with faith we sit and wait. But I have to say, be careful of what u ask for because you just might get it.” By Wednesday evening, she had absorbed the disappointment of what will now be a protracted period of transition, given that the corrective surgery will not be done until next year. She determined to “hold my head up high” and fight the oscillations in mood that plague her as she puzzles over a fundamental question. “Who am I now?” she asked. transcript tk Advertisement"
http://www.inquisitr.com/2629718/how-to-survive-a-mass-shooting-dallas-police-department-offers-civilians-free-survival-training-video/,"  Officer G. Dave Wilson was teaching the course at the J. Erik Jonsson Central Library to about 50 library employees when he told DMN that he wished they ""didn't have to do this.""  The Dallas Police are not the only ones trying to teach people how to survive a mass shooting. Philadelphia LancasterOnline reported that all Lancaster county employees are required to take training to learn how to survive a mass shooting. Other similar training classes are being held all over the country and have been in place for some time. The video shown above, which may be similar to or the same as the one Wilson presented, was released by the Alabama Homeland Department of Security and it gives tips like the ones Wilson was teaching the library employees in Dallas - ""Run, Hide, Fight.""  If you can't run or escape, then find a safe room or closet to hide in, lock or secure the door, silence your phone and turn out the light, and remain quiet and calm. If you are not able to hide in a locked room then try to conceal yourself behind a large object. The object should conceal you from the shooter and be able to protect you if shots are fired towards you. The video goes on to say that if you are in danger and can't run or hide, as a last option, fight back and be as aggressive as possible to the shooter. You should find whatever weapon you can and try to incapacitate the shooter, and be committed to stopping them.   The video tells you to try to be aware of your environment and always have an exit plan. It also says you should know that in shooting situations victims are chosen randomly and the event is unpredictable and may evolve quickly. As to first responders to these scenes, the narrator says they are not there to evacuate or attend to injured victims. First responders are well-trained and are there to stop the shooter. The narrator explains how you should remain calm once help arrives and follow their instructions. Know that help is on the way for the injured. The video ends with a confirmation of the three things you need to do to survive - Run, Hide, Fight. After the training session by Wilson in Dallas, library associates gave their opinions about the class. They said that they found the class helpful but scary too. ""It's clear we have issues as a country,"" said Ana Niño, 22.  [Photo by Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images]"
http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2015/dec/13/batman-explains-our-darkening-world-201/,"Batman used to carry a gun. It's true. Back in the 1930s, not only did he carry a gun, but he killed bad guys with it. The very first official Batman comic featured the Caped Crusader firing a machine gun. But the public grew uneasy. So the editors adopted a new rule: no guns for Batman. Bob Kane, the character's co-creator, would later explain that his editors worried ""that mothers would object to letting their kids see and read about such shootings."" That tale from a simpler age comes to mind as, once more, we cringe at the ease with which carnage can be inflicted by a determined shooter. We've long passed the point when parents can shield their children from seeing and reading about horrific violence, whether or not inflicted by guns. And reports about violence--especially terrorism--frighten them. A lot. If children are scared, what do we tell them? Do we say, ""Don't worry, there's no chance of a terror attack or a mass shooting in our neighborhood?"" If we say it, do we believe it? Do the children believe it? Moral panics don't lend themselves to rational analysis. Do we say, ""Despite what you might see on television, the rate of gun violence in the U.S. is down?"" I doubt that will do any good. Children are as vulnerable as anyone else to the availability heuristic--probably more so. Do we say, ""The government has matters in hand?"" We can try, but we'd be lying. This is an era, after all, when the left thinks the problem is too many guns and the right thinks the problem is too many bad people, and we can't even discuss policy without an eruption of mindless savagery in the Twitterverse. And most children, by a relatively young age, have likely heard enough political fury in their own homes to get the point that government isn't working very well just now. Do we say, ""Let's pray for the people who got hurt?"" Well, if we happen to be praying people, we might try. But see the previous paragraph, about the mindless savagery of the Twitterverse: Apparently people who don't believe in the efficacy of prayer are really angry these days at people who do. (I'm betting the kids already know that, too.) I don't know the answer. Our children are grown now, but if they weren't, I have no idea how my wife and I would explain the state of the world to them. We'd do our best to reassure them, but we would also understand that our best efforts would be unlikely to fully quiet their fears. Our Connecticut home is half an hour's drive from Newtown. Studies of children in areas where terrorism is far more common than in the U.S. tell us that many develop symptoms of post-traumatic stress even when they do not directly witness terror attacks. Some work suggests that the children who do best are those whose families maintain their routines. Parents from parts of the world sundered by violence have told me they do exactly that. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, in its fact sheet on how to talk to children about terrorism, reminds us that young people ""will usually know if you're not being honest"" and also advises, in words unintentionally chilling, ""don't make unrealistic promises."" (So maybe we should stop pretending to believe that bombing in Iraq and Syria will make Islamic State disappear.) The fact sheet adds a reminder that children will learn how to deal with their fears largely by watching how we deal with ours. Yet they are surely waiting for grownups to do something. (And, no, calling each other nasty names for disagreeing on exactly which something we should do doesn't count.) The trouble is, we don't know quite what to do. Whether facing acts of terror inspired abroad or mass murders concocted at home, we spend a lot of time flinging charges and wringing hands. The nation does not seem terribly confident just now. Our children must sense the uneasiness of the generation that's running things--and be made uneasy by it in turn. Which brings us back to Batman. The Caped Crusader, says Will Brooker in Batman Unmasked: Analyzing a Cultural Icon, has always been more fluid than other comic book heroes. He's undergone dramatic shifts in character to reflect the public sensibility of the moment. In World War II, he fought the Axis powers. During the Cold War, he often battled communist spies. He went from using guns to throwing baddies off buildings to refusing to kill. For a long time, the writers emphasized his superior intelligence, so that he did not so much outfight the bad guys as out-think them. In his latest incarnation, the Batman of the graphic novels has become a dark, brooding, violent character, much like the original. That first Batman appeared when criminal gangs were rampant in many cities and the shadow of fascism loomed over Europe. People were scared. They wanted a superhero who'd protect them by any means necessary. We're scared today, too. If we could bring one of those many Batmen to life, I wonder which we'd choose.

              since Federal Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said in an email divers retrieved objects from Seccombe Lake, as they did the previous day. But she declined to say what those were or whether they appeared to be tied to the mass shooting. The San Bernardino lake, nestled in a public park, about 2.5 miles (4 km) north of the site of the shooting, is believed to be littered with junk and debris. U.S. officials have said their investigation has yet to turn up evidence that foreign militants directed Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, or Tashfeen Malik, 29, when the married pair stormed a holiday gathering of his co-workers at a regional center in San Bernardino on Dec. 2 and opened fire with assault rifles. The couple shot dead 14 people and wounded more than 20 in a rampage the FBI said it is treating as an act of terrorism inspired by Islamic militants. If that is confirmed, it would mark the most lethal such attack on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2001. Farook, the U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, a Pakistani native he married last year in Saudi Arabia, were killed in a shootout with police hours after their assault in San Bernardino, 60 miles (100 km) east of Los Angeles. CNN and other media have reported the FBI divers at the lake were looking for a computer hard drive that belonged to the couple, but Eimiller declined to confirm that. The underwater search stemmed from leads indicating Farook and Malik had been in the vicinity of Seccombe Lake on the day of the killings, the FBI has said. The FBI has determined that the couple declared they were acting on behalf of the Islamic State. But FBI Director James Comey has said there was no evidence the militant group controlling vast swaths of Iraq and Syria was even aware of them prior to their attack. On Friday, a fire that appeared to have been intentionally set burned the entrance to a mosque in Southern California's Coachella Valley, some 75 miles (121 km) from San Bernardino, raising concerns of a possible reaction to the shooting. A 23-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of arson and for committing a hate crime, according to the Riverside County Sheriff's Department, which has not said if he was motivated by the shooting in targeting the mosque. Muslim Americans across the country have said they are worried about a backlash, as happened in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

              since Jeb Bush high-fives a voter in New Hampshire.
                            

                                Graham Flanagan/Business Insider
                              

Milford, New Hampshire — These days, the signature exclamation mark next to Jeb Bush's name could be more like a hazard symbol. In front of a standing-room-only crowd here for a town-hall event on Thursday, the former Florida governor's opening pitch was simple: Who's going to keep you safe? ""The world has been turned upside down,"" Bush told the attendees. ""We have this existential threat now that people sense. And because of that, we're getting more serious about who we're going to pick."" Amid a lag in the polls for months upon months, this is the crux of Bush's bet: As the presidential campaign becomes more dictated by foreign-policy and national-security events, the ""serious"" candidate with a history of executive-leadership experience stands to benefit. Not real-estate mogul Donald Trump, whose divisive political campaign led him to scrap a plan to visit Israel, America's closest Middle East ally later this month. Not Ted Cruz, a first-term senator. (Bush criticized Cruz by name on Thursday for voting to curb the National Security Agency's surveillance programs. ""I hope he has a change of heart,"" Bush said.) Not Hillary Clinton, who he argues had her chance to shape the world as US secretary of state and didn't live up to the task. ""I think now is the time, more recently than maybe in 20 or 30 years, because of the failure of this White House — foreign policy and national security was way down on the list of concerns and priorities,"" said Tom Ridge, the former secretary of homeland security who has endorsed Bush. ""It's been elevated,"" Ridge added. ""They've seen this erosion of America's place and prominence in the world."" Bush, campaigning Thursday with Ridge and Medal of Honor recipient Col. Leo Thorsness, argued that he's uniquely capable of tackling the challenges facing the US on a global scale. He wants to bolster the US' relationship with Israel, which he says has suffered under President Barack Obama. He wants to recalibrate the rising regional influence of Iran and global influence of China. He wants to be the president that ""destroys"" the terror group ISIS, also known as the Islamic State, which has now been linked to an act of terror in the US. ""The election may revolve more around these national-security issues more now than I anticipated,"" Bush said in an interview here with Business Insider on Thursday. It's a potentially awkward argument for Bush, who, by his last name alone, has faced more scrutiny because of his brother, former President George W. Bush. Even many Republicans now think George W. Bush had made a mistake by invading Iraq in 2003. Jeb Bush faces competition not only from Trump, who has surged to the top of virtually every Republican primary poll, but also from fellow establishment-oriented candidates like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida), Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R), and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), who have made foreign policy and national security a key component of their platforms. But Bush says choosing a commander in chief is two parts — the first of which is ""personal."" Bush is the second-most ""trusted"" Republican candidate in New Hampshire on national security, according to a survey conducted by the firm Harper Polling earlier this month. His campaign is in the midst of a $600,000-plus, three-week ad buy in New Hampshire, in which three Medal of Honor recipients explain why Bush should be voters' choice. ""It is personal who is going to be — who can be the president. Who can be commander in chief. Who has a steady hand. Who doesn't talk trash but has plans and respects the military, and has a commitment to rebuilding it. Who can build a strategy in a serious way to keep us safe,"" Bush said. ""That's one part of this,"" he added. ""The personal side."" Bush continued, ""The second part is: Who can articulate a vision for the proper foreign policy for the country?"" Jeb Bush at a town-hall event in New Hampshire.
                            

                                Graham Flanagan/Business Insider On the personal side, it's become extremely clear that Bush does not believe a real-estate mogul and reality-television star should be given the keys to America's foreign policy. He laughed as one town-hall attendee Thursday night said Trump ""is not a statesman, and he scares the bejesus out of me."" Bush himself took particular aim at Trump on Thursday for postponed a planned trip to Israel, which had been scheduled to include a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The cancellation came just a day after Trump originally said he had planned to visit the nation. ""Of course it was canceled,"" Bush said. ""Who would want to see him after he created a real problem by a blanket statement that wasn't serious?"" Bush was referring to Trump's call to temporarily bar Muslims from entering the US in the aftermath of the recent mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, in which both shooters were thought to be inspired by the Islamic State terrorist group. Netanyahu had said he planned to speak with any US presidential candidate who requested a meeting so as not to appear favorable toward any particular candidate. But news of Trump's potential visit caused an uproar and prompted calls from within Israel's Parliament for Netanyahu to cancel the meeting. ""Look, the guy's not serious. He's not a serious person,"" Bush said. ""He can't be commander in chief. He doesn't have plans. This is all dog-whistle talk. This is to provoke anger. This is to — with all due respect to the media — this is to generate massive attention to him. It's not about a serious plan. Is that a serious plan in all reality? Of course not."" Though Trump publicly canceled his meeting with Netanyahu, Bush said it was clear why Netanyahu wouldn't want to meet with a US presidential candidate who was ""endorsing a view that would be against his national-security interests."" ""If you view it as a serious proposal, which it isn't, what he's proposing is weakening our position in the world,"" Bush said, ""making it harder for us to be protected. Not stronger. He's weakening the United States' posture in the world, and he's keeping our country less safe."" Business Insider asked if that was the case already. Bush said Trump's statement alone was detrimental to the US's foreign-policy interests. ""By his statement!"" Bush said. ""If that statement was to be a policy and was implemented, it would make it harder for us to take out ISIS. Near impossible. It would make it harder for us to engage in the world. No one would take us seriously. This is ludicrous. This is not even worth talking about."" But American voters, at least, think it might be worth talking about. Some surveys have nevertheless shown a surge in support for the front-running Trump after his inflammatory comments. Bush's own town-hall event was full of voters sympathetic to Trump's point of view. One voter — who wouldn't give his name for a lack of trust in the media — said he wished to see Bush discuss what he perceived as problems of violence within Islam. Which brings up the question: How do you swing voters taking a serious look at an ""unserious"" candidate? ""The reason I think he's gaining momentum is people are starting to pay a lot more attention not to the personalities who are 'the race,'"" Ridge said. ""The race is material. They're starting to figure out, who do I want to be president? Who do I want to be commander in chief? Who do I want to sit in the Oval Office?"" Bush is betting on voters having that image in their heads when they go into the voting booth. Like one voter, in a New Hampshire diner on Friday, who said she could see herself supporting Trump for a while but wondered if all the criticism piling up made Trump more trouble than he's worth. That goes with the ""second part"" of Bush's plan: articulating a foreign-policy vision for the US. ""In that realm,"" Bush said, ""I think I do pretty good."" For you For you"

http://nypost.com/2015/12/13/it-actually-got-easier-to-buy-a-gun-after-sandy-hook/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. IOWA CITY, Iowa — The 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in which a mentally troubled young man killed 26 children and teachers, served as a rallying cry for gun-control advocates across the nation. But in the three years since, many states have moved in the opposite direction, embracing the National Rifle Association’s axiom that more “good guys with guns” are needed to deter mass shootings. In Kansas, gun owners can now carry concealed weapons without obtaining a license. In Texas, those with permits will soon be able to carry openly in holsters and bring concealed weapons into some college classrooms. And in Arkansas, gun enthusiasts may be able to carry weapons into polling places next year when they vote for president. Dozens of new state laws have made it easier to obtain guns and carry them in more public places and made it harder for local governments to enact restrictions, according to a review of state legislation by The Associated Press. The number of guns manufactured and sold and the number of permits to carry concealed weapons have also increased, data show. The trend has been discouraging to some gun-control advocates, even as other states have adopted stricter background checks. Other gun-control supporters say their movement is emboldened by the recent rise of Everytown for Gun Safety, a well-funded group backed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg that is becoming influential in some state capitols. The debate over gun rights moved to states after Congress rejected a bill in 2013 that would have expanded background checks to all gun sales, including those at gun shows and over the Internet. The arguments are expected to intensify next year as legislatures convene in the wake of the mass shooting of county government employees in San Bernardino, California, which is being investigated as an act of terrorism. Recent mass shootings at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado, a community college in Oregon and a church in South Carolina have also reignited passions on both sides. “Most of our churches are just wide open,” said Mississippi Republican Rep. Andy Gipson, who plans to file a bill next year allowing congregations to designate people who could carry guns. The pro-gun legislation reflects a growing public sentiment that “gun-free zones are magnets for bad guys,” said David Kopel, a gun policy expert at the Independence Institute, a libertarian think tank in Colorado. He said that concept was not popular after the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado, but the frequency of mass shootings since then has made the idea of having a trained, law-abiding gun owner present more appealing. “We’ve gone from, ‘You can’t even say that out loud’ to it being an evenly divided issue, with the pro-gun side having an advantage on that,” he said. “I would expect that we will see continued movement on that in the coming year.” Even before the Dec. 2 shooting at the office holiday party in San Bernardino, gun purchases and permit applications were on the rise. On the day after Thanksgiving this year, U.S. gun sales approached a single-day record. More than 185,000 federal background checks were initiated, the most in the 17-year history of the program, according to FBI data. “Everybody is swamped,” said Mike Conway, a salesman at Bullseye Sport in Riverside, California, near San Bernadino, which has run out of most guns. “A lot of first-time buyers. A lot of people that realize that they have to be responsible for their own safety.” From 2007 to 2014, the number of concealed-carry handgun permits in states nearly tripled, from 4.7 million to 12.8 million, according to a recent report by the Crime Prevention Research Center, a group whose research is often cited by gun-rights supporters. Meanwhile, several states have passed laws shielding the identities of permit holders to protect privacy and prevent potential harassment. Instead of limiting access to firearms after Sandy Hook, states such as Indiana and Mississippi passed laws to beef up the presence of police officers in schools. Kansas adopted a law allowing people to carry concealed weapons in many public buildings. Georgia and Arkansas, among others, allowed concealed weapons in bars and some churches. Tennessee made clear that permit holders can carry concealed weapons in vehicles and parks. Several states also passed reciprocity agreements recognizing gun permits approved by other states, reduced permitting fees and loosened requirements. Wisconsin, for instance, eliminated a 48-hour waiting period to buy handguns. And then there are new laws designed to thwart gun-control measures. States have prohibited authorities from seizing guns during emergencies, moved to ban the use of taxpayer funding for government gun buyback programs and banned the destruction of firearms seized by law enforcement. Some Republican-controlled states have pre-empted local governments’ ability to pass stricter firearms laws by declaring that it’s a matter for the state. Everytown President John Feinblatt said many of the measures that expanded gun rights were passed when the NRA faced little opposition in statehouses, but that is starting to change. He said his group succeeded this year in opposing bills in several states that would have allowed concealed weapons on college campuses and permitted people to carry without obtaining permits. Since Sandy Hook, six states have expanded background checks, and two more such measures are expected to be on statewide ballots next year in Nevada and Maine, Feinblatt said. His group, he added, isn’t concerned with how many guns exist, but wants rules in place to make sure they aren’t sold or transferred to criminals and the mentally ill. “If more responsible gun owners want more guns and they are doing it the right way, that’s not going to affect public safety,” he said. Eric Fleegler, a doctor at Boston Children’s Hospital who has studied state gun laws, said he worries that the expansion of gun rights could cause more fights to escalate into deadly confrontations, more people to commit suicide and more kids to die from gun accidents. “In a country with 330 million people and 310 million guns,” he said, “the suggestion that the problem is we don’t have enough guns available just doesn’t seem to hold much weight.” Share Selection"
http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/trRPiO2rr68/,"About 100 people with flatulence noise makers marched against a mock mass shooting Saturday at the University of Texas to divert attention away from pro-gun demonstrators. The group took to the streets of Austin with machines that make fart sounds in their counter “mass farting” protest, the Houston Chronicle reports. Their march was in response to guns rights groups’ plans to stage a fake mass shooting at the school, complete with fake blood. “This is about a choice between fear and a little bit of good humor,” organizer and UT alumnus Andrew Dobbs told the crowd, according to the Chronicle. “We are in a scary time right now and lots of scary things are happening, and some people want us to be more afraid.” “I choose to believe that fear is not the solution to the threat of our time,” he added. “Laughing in the face of fear is a courageous act and toting a gun around everywhere you go, maybe not so much.” Dobbs and his fellow protesters shouted “Texas farts!” and “We fart in your general direction!” according to the Chronicle. Earlier this week, a task force recommended that students at the University of Texas should be able to carry handguns in classrooms. Before the members of the Campus Carry Policy Working Group submitted the gun guidelines to the university’s president, pro-gun demonstrators said they would stage a mock shooting in a bid to end gun-free zones.

Dial was arrested late Friday in Palm Desert in connection with the suspected arson-hate crime at the Coachella Valley’s only mosque, 84-650 Avenue 49. K Sadiq, who stood vigil overnight at the mosque, said people in this world need to question what politicians and religious leaders are telling them before filling their hearts with hate. “If someone tells you to hate someone, you need to say, ‘Why?’ and not just hate them,” Sadiq said. USA TODAY Man arrested in suspected arson at California mosque The fire occurred more than a week after a mass shooting that killed 14 people and injured another 22 in San Bernardino — it is one of many similar incidents that officials say have been occurring at mosques around the country in response to the San Bernardino shootings, which authorities have said were committed by radicalized followers of an Islamic State group. According to Riverside County jail records, Dial was arrested along Country Club Drive shortly before 9 p.m. Friday by Riverside County sheriff’s investigators. He is being detained at the Riverside County Jail in Indio on suspicion of committing multiple felony offenses including: commission of a hate crime, two counts of arson, one count of maliciously setting a fire, and a count of second-degree burglary. Dial remained jailed Saturday night in lieu of $150,000 bail. He is scheduled to appear in court at the Larson Justice Center in Indio on Wednesday, according to jail records. His arrest was a comfort to many of the mosque members who gathered outside the mosque Saturday to pay their respects and lend a hand with clean-up efforts. No one there recognized Dial from his mugshot, and most people were confused that such an incident would happen in such a quiet, accepting neighborhood. Others were just ready to move forward, fix their mosque and try to put the crime behind them. “God’s going to take care of everyone,” Kassim al-Wisha said. “We’re gonna fix it. We have insurance.” USA TODAY Items reportedly found in search for San Bernardino shooters' hard drive The musallah, the room where members pray, was largely untouched by the blaze. A young man who arrived with plywood to board up the gaping doorway, which was scorched and charred by flames, asked if he would be able to step inside the musallah before beginning to work. “I just need to pray,” he said before disappearing inside. Federal authorities began investigating the arson-hate crime just hours after Cal Fire personnel extinguished the 12:09 p.m. PT blaze. People were praying inside at the time of the fire, but everyone was evacuated from the building and no injuries were reported. The doorway, lobby and areas where people perform their ablutions before prayer were heavily burnt, but the majority of the mosque sustained only smoke damage. People described hearing a “loud boom” and seeing flames, Reymundo Nour, the mosque’s acting imam, said Friday. He was not on site at the time, but said the mosque had been “firebombed.” In a news release issued late Friday, the sheriff’s department stated that investigators “believed this was an intentional act potentially resulting in a hate crime, and utilized all available resources in an attempt to identify and locate the suspect. “A person of interest was quickly identified and was subsequently located and detained pending further investigation,” the release stated, adding that additional updates would be provided as they became available. A spokesman for the sheriff’s department would not say Saturday how investigators were led to Dial. Friday’s incident was not the first time the mosque in Coachella was damaged as the result of a criminal act. On Nov. 4, 2014, during early morning prayers, someone fired five shots at the mosque. No one was injured in that incident, which was investigated as a hate crime. Despite a $12,000 reward for information leading to an arrest in the shooting, the case remains unsolved. A number of public officials condemned Friday’s suspected arson. “We see this as a cowardly act of vandalism that we do not tolerate in our community,” Coachella Mayor Steven Hernandez said. “Freedom of religion is one of our core values in this country, so any time we witness violence or vandalism directed at a religious institution, it flies in the face of everything we stand for and believe in as Americans.” He was joined by Riverside County Supervisor John Benoit and U.S. Rep. Raul Ruiz, D-Palm Desert, who each expressed their concern and called for a thorough investigation into the blaze. The fire occurred nine days after a radicalized Muslim husband and wife committed a mass shooting inside a San Bernardino County employee holiday party at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino. Syed Rizwan Farook, a 28-year-old San Bernardino County environmental health specialist, and his 29-year-old wife, Tashfeen Malik, used two semi-automatic handguns and two assault rifles to kill or injure Farook’s county co-workers Dec. 2. Farook and Malik were killed later that day in a shootout with authorities. The FBI is investigating the San Bernardino incident. Contributing: The Associated Press.

http://feeds.inquisitr.com/~r/google/yDYq/~3/Dr6ImemKPsw/,"In Texas, gun rights advocates held a march and a mock mass shooting, but many agree they failed to get their message across because of counter-protesters with fart noise machines and sex toys. According to CBS News, two gun rights groups, Come and Take It Texas and Don'tComply.com, held their mock mass shooting demonstrations at ""The Drag,"" an area of restaurants and shops near the University of Texas in Austin, on Saturday. The group members first marched to protest gun-free zones, and then they broke off, using cardboard assault weapons to hold a fake shooting of six people. Unfortunately for the groups, counter-protesters arrived in larger numbers, and they came armed as well -- with fart cannons and dildos. Think Progress reports the shooting was drowned out by the ""mass farting."" Others waved sex toys and shouted chants like ""mock shootings mock victims,"" successfully distracting many onlookers from the initial show.   The two gun rights groups have been promoting the event for roughly a week. Initially, they wanted to demonstrate on the University of Texas campus, where Charles Whitman shot 16 people from a clock tower in 1966 -- one of the worst mass shootings in American history. Campus officials refused the request. They added that if the group members were caught on campus protesting they would be charged with trespassing. The decision forced the gun rights activists onto the public streets and raised media attention. When the protesters were swamped by reporters and critics, they attempted to disperse and reorganize roughly two blocks away, where they held the mock mass shooting. According to the New York Times, Murdoch Pizgatti, president of the two groups, explained that they changed locations because protesters were ""not going to give us a space to voice our opinions."" He added that it also stressed the point that mass shootings could happen anywhere at anytime. Jason Orsek, vice president of both gun groups, reiterated that idea.  On the counter-protesters side, co-organizer Andrew Dobbs explained that he was happy to interrupt the demonstration, according to the Daily Beast.  Critics say that allowing concealed weapons in schools creates a safety hazard. Gun rights groups say the caveat, gun-free zones, are the real safety hazard. At the University of Texas Austin campus, the school plans to allow the concealed guns in classrooms, but not in the college dorms. Texas Christian University is the first private school to rally against the law, saying they would not allow guns on campus. Kathy Cavins-Tull, the vice chancellor for student affairs, explained, ""we really debated this issue a lot. People on our campus for the most part felt fewer guns make us safer."" Whether the mock mass shooting or the counter-protests had any effect is hard to say, but most participants left smiling after the spectacle according to the Daily Beast.

But in the three years since, many states have moved in the opposite direction, embracing the National Rifle Association’s axiom that more “good guys with guns” are needed to deter mass shootings. In Kansas, gun owners can now carry concealed weapons without obtaining a license. In Texas, those with permits will soon be able to carry openly in holsters and bring concealed weapons into some college classrooms. And in Arkansas, gun enthusiasts may be able to carry weapons into polling places next year when they vote for president. Dozens of new state laws have made it easier to obtain guns and carry them in more public places and made it harder for local governments to enact restrictions, according to a review of state legislation by the Associated Press. The number of guns manufactured and sold and the number of permits to carry concealed weapons have also increased, data show. The trend has been discouraging to some gun-control advocates, even as other states have adopted stricter background checks. And gun-control supporters say their movement is emboldened by the recent rise of Everytown for Gun Safety, a well-funded group backed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg that is becoming influential in some state capitols. Bill rejected by Congress The debate over gun rights moved to states after Congress rejected a bill in 2013 that would have expanded background checks to all gun sales, including those at gun shows and over the Internet. The arguments are expected to intensify next year as legislatures convene in the wake of the mass shooting of county government employees in San Bernardino, which is b9eing investigated as an act of terrorism. Recent mass shootings at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado, a community college in Oregon and a church in South Carolina have also reignited passions on both sides. Even before the Dec. 2 shooting at the office holiday party in San Bernardino, gun purchases and permit applications were on the rise. On the day after Thanksgiving this year, U.S. gun sales approached a single-day record. More than 185,000 federal background checks were initiated, the most in the 17-year history of the program, according to FBI data. “Everybody is swamped,” said Mike Conway, a salesman at Bullseye Sport in Riverside, near San Bernardino, which has run out of most guns. “A lot of first-time buyers. A lot of people that realize that they have to be responsible for their own safety.” From 2007 to 2014, the number of concealed-carry handgun permits in states nearly tripled, from 4.7 million to 12.8 million, according to a recent report by the Crime Prevention Research Center, a group whose research is often cited by gun-rights supporters. Meanwhile, several states have passed laws shielding the identities of permit holders to protect privacy and prevent potential harassment. More officers in schools Instead of limiting access to firearms after Sandy Hook, states such as Indiana and Mississippi passed laws to beef up the presence of police officers in schools. Kansas adopted a law allowing people to carry concealed weapons in many public buildings. Georgia and Arkansas, among others, allowed concealed weapons in bars and some churches. Tennessee made clear that permit holders can carry concealed weapons in vehicles and parks. Everytown President John Feinblatt said many of the measures that expanded gun rights were passed when the NRA faced little opposition in statehouses, but that is starting to change. He said his group succeeded this year in opposing bills in several states that would have allowed concealed weapons on college campuses and permitted people to carry without obtaining permits. Since Sandy Hook, six states have expanded background checks, and two more such measures are expected to be on statewide ballots next year in Nevada and Maine, Feinblatt said. His group, he added, isn’t concerned with how many guns exist, but wants rules in place to make sure they aren’t sold or transferred to criminals and the mentally ill. “If more responsible gun owners want more guns and they are doing it the right way, that’s not going to affect public safety,” he said."

http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2015/dec/14/more-gun-rights-seen-since-2012-slaught-1/,"IOWA CITY, Iowa -- The 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, in which a mentally troubled young man killed 26 children and educators, served as a rallying cry for gun-control advocates across the nation. But in the three years since, many states have moved in the opposite direction, embracing the National Rifle Association's axiom that more ""good guys with guns"" are needed to deter mass shootings.

The arguments are expected to intensify next year as legislatures convene after the mass shooting of county government employees in San Bernardino, Calif., which is being investigated as an act of terrorism. Recent mass shootings at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado, a community college in Oregon and a church in South Carolina have also reignited passions on both sides. ""Most of our churches are just wide open,"" said Mississippi Republican Rep. Andy Gipson, who plans to file a bill next year allowing congregations to designate people who could carry guns. The pro-gun legislation reflects a growing public sentiment that ""gun-free zones are magnets for bad guys,"" said David Kopel, a gun policy expert at the Independence Institute, a libertarian think tank in Colorado. He said that concept was not popular after the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado, but the frequency of mass shootings since then has made the idea of having a trained, law-abiding gun owner present more appealing. ""We've gone from, 'You can't even say that out loud' to it being an evenly divided issue, with the pro-gun side having an advantage on that,"" he said. ""I would expect that we will see continued movement on that in the coming year."" Even before the Dec. 2 shooting at the office holiday party in San Bernardino, gun purchases and permit applications were on the rise. On the day after Thanksgiving this year, U.S. gun sales approached a single-day record.

Tennessee made clear that permit holders can carry concealed weapons in vehicles and parks. Several states also passed reciprocity agreements recognizing gun permits approved by other states, reduced permitting fees and loosened requirements. Wisconsin, for instance, eliminated a 48-hour waiting period to buy handguns. And then there are new laws designed to thwart gun-control measures. States have prohibited authorities from seizing guns during emergencies, moved to ban the use of taxpayer funding for government gun buyback programs and banned the destruction of firearms seized by law enforcement. Some Republican-controlled states have pre-empted local governments' ability to pass stricter firearms laws by declaring that it's a matter for the state. Gun-Safety Movement The trend has been discouraging to some gun-control advocates, even as other states have adopted stricter background checks. Other gun-control supporters say their movement is emboldened by the recent rise of Everytown for Gun Safety, a well-funded group backed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg that is becoming influential in some state capitols.

""If more responsible gun owners want more guns and they are doing it the right way, that's not going to affect public safety,"" he said. Eric Fleegler, a doctor at Boston Children's Hospital who has studied state gun laws, said he worries that the expansion of gun rights could cause more fights to escalate into deadly confrontations, more people to commit suicide and more kids to die from gun accidents. ""In a country with 330 million people and 310 million guns,"" he said, ""the suggestion that the problem is we don't have enough guns available just doesn't seem to hold much weight."" Top New York officials on Sunday demanded that the federal government share classified watch-list information on suspected terrorists so the state can block such people from buying guns legally. U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer and Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that keeping the information secret creates a dangerous ""terror gap."" ""This loophole does nothing more than help radical people kill innocent Americans, and it must be closed,"" said Cuomo. ""The fact that reform continues to languish illustrates the stranglehold the NRA has over Washington, and it's time for our elected leaders to show the political courage to vote for the safety of the American people."" Schumer has spearheaded an effort in Congress for passage of the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act of 2015, which would give the U.S. Department of Justice authority to prevent a suspected terrorist from buying such materials. But the measure failed in the U.S. Senate earlier this month. ""We will continue to push again and again at the national level to put into practice this common-sense provision that would do so much to protect the American public, but until we do, today's push with Gov. Cuomo will add momentum to this larger effort,"" Schumer said. The senator said a faster solution to the ""federal paralysis"" would be for the DOJ to help establish a protocol for states to access the lists. ""At least let the states use the information to defend themselves,"" Cuomo added. The DOJ and NRA did not immediately respond to calls for comment. The federal government does not currently share classified background information about suspects on its terror and no-fly watch lists with states. Schumer and Cuomo said such information would keep suspected terrorists from passing a gun background check and legally obtaining a firearm -- now allowed under federal law. Last week, in response to the Dec. 2 San Bernardino massacre, Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy proposed to use an executive order to ban gun sales to those on federal no-fly lists. But any such measure must be approved by Congress. The couple that officials said was responsible for the attack was not on any security list. And they apparently purchased their weapons legally. Schumer and Cuomo also said that social media posts should be included in tracking possible terrorists. Co-attacker Tashfeen Malik had written hate-filled Facebook comments well before the attack -- but they went unnoticed by security officials. Information for this article was contributed by Ryan J.

http://www.realclearpolitics.com/2015/12/14/why_i_caved_on_guns_when_i_ran_for_governor_371632.html,"I am a lifelong Democrat. I proudly boast an “F” rating from the NRA. And, yet during my 2014 gubernatorial campaign in Texas, I supported the open carry of handguns in my state. Every few months, on the heels of a shooting that devastates a different corner of America, we find ourselves arriving at exactly the same place: Republicans offer their prayers; some offer up the idea of focusing our attention on mental health; almost none of them mention guns. Democrats talk background checks, magazine limits, closing the gun-show loophole and, ultimately, get exasperated. In the wake of the San Bernardino and Planned Parenthood shootings, the conversations we’re having now are almost exactly the same. Meaningful gun reform still seems as distant as it did when the Manchin-Toomey bill, which would have required background checks on all commercial gun sales, failed in 2013, mere months after 20 children and six adults were killed in a mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut."
http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/14/the-role-of-gun-control-in-2015-worst-mass-shootings,"In 2013, Barack Obama proposed changes to US gun law and was dramatically defeated. We analyze the possible effect of those policies in the 20 largest mass shootings of this year Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.18 BST Last Wednesday, two mass shootings happened in America. In one of them, 14 people were killed and 21 others were injured, prompting Barack Obama to describe stronger background checks for gun purchases as “common sense”. Earlier that same day, two gunmen killed one person and injured three others in Savannah, Georgia. In neither case is there any evidence that the killers obtained their guns illegally. That’s not surprising. A Guardian analysis of the 20 shootings with the most fatalities in 2015 found that most gunmen obtain their weapons legally. But had a range of proposed federal reforms designed to strengthen gun laws been in place, many of those mass shootings could have been less likely to have happened. In nine of the 12 cases where information was available, tougher laws could have prevented killers from obtaining their guns.  To fully understand the impact of America’s gun control measures, it’s important to look beyond the handful of mass shootings that acquired enough headlines to puncture national consciousness. The most thorough source that currently exists is Mass Shooting Tracker, a collaborative project where users find and verify media reports to count the number of US mass shootings each year. The group defines a mass shooting as an incident where four or more people are shot – the injuries do not have to be fatal for the shooting to be included in their database. In 42% of the 353 mass shootings recorded in 2015 so far, there were no reported fatalities. An additional 47% of those mass shootings resulted in between one and three people killed. But it’s harder to understand the role of gun control legislation in those mass shootings with fewer victims – often the shooters’ names aren’t known, let alone whether they had a criminal record or which guns they used. When only three Americans die, shootings usually aren’t remembered by the names of the locations where they took place. Killings like the ones in San Bernardino, Charleston or Umpqua Community College make up a small fraction of all shootings that happen in the US but they represent a large part of publicly available information about mass shootings. The government doesn’t keep a database on gun deaths, let alone deaths from mass shootings. And media reports on most everyday shootings do not contain sufficient detail to answer questions about how the shooter got their gun. Because of that constraint, this analysis looks at how policy might have affected the 20 mass shootings that resulted in the most fatalities in 2015. In 2013, Obama attempted to overhaul US gun law. The proposed legislation was designed to reduce the likelihood of another shooting like the one in Newtown, which had killed 20 children and six adults just four months earlier. The Senate either blocked or defeated every single proposal. If they hadn’t, would the 20 worst mass shootings this year have been less likely? The answer is a cautious “yes”. In nine of the 20 worst mass shootings so far this year, it’s a matter of public record that the gunmen obtained their weapons by legal means. In the remaining 11 cases, there’s no evidence to suggest that the guns were procured illegally. Under US law, however, some of the killers should never have been able to make those seemingly legal purchases. Since he had previously admitted to drug possession, Dylann Roof should have been prevented from buying the .45-caliber he used to kill nine people in Charleston. A series of failures meant that FBI background checks did not prevent Roof from purchasing the murder weapon. Three of the 20 worst mass shootings in 2015 would not have been committed with legal weapons had the law been changed in 2013. One of Obama’s key proposals was to reinstate and strengthen the federal ban on assault weapons that was in place for ten years from 1994 – weapons which were used by three of the killers in this analysis. In another eight of the 20 cases, it’s known that assault weapons were not used (most often those killers used handguns) and in the remaining nine cases, we were unable to find information about which weapons were used. Another very concrete legal change that was proposed in 2013 was to limit ammunition magazines to ten rounds. In 17 of the 20 worst mass shootings, the size of the magazine on the weapon has not been mentioned in media reports (in some cases, more than one weapon was used, which makes this information even harder to find). In all of the remaining three cases, research on the model and manufacturer of the weapons used indicates the guns had more than 10 magazine rounds. In the San Bernardino shooting, which killed 14 people, a Smith & Wesson M&P assault rifle was used. The weapon, according to Smith & Wesson’s site, boasts a 30-round magazine. The killers’ previous criminal records are rarely known. The only case that can be ruled out of the 20 most deadly is that of the San Bernardino attackers: the chief of the San Bernardino police department said he was not aware of the suspects having any previous contact with law enforcement. In five cases, the killers were known to have a criminal record. One of them was David Conley. In August, Conley entered his ex-girlfriend’s house in Texas through an unlocked window, gathered her husband, six children and herself into a master bedroom, then handcuffed and executed them one by one with a 9mm pistol. As well as auto theft, cocaine possession and evading arrest, Conley’s criminal record included an incident with Valerie Jackson, the ex-girlfriend he eventually killed. In a domestic violence case, Jackson told police that Conley had cut her, punched her and wrapped an electrical cord around her baby’s neck. Indeed, sheriff’s deputies made at least two welfare checks during the multi-hour ordeal in which Conley killed eight people. They apparently left when no one answered the door. In eight of the 20 worst mass shootings this year, there is no information about how any of the measures proposed in 2013 might have made a difference. Those gray areas are even more common in mass shootings like the Conley murder, where the killer was known to the victims. Evaluating some policy proposals, such as the question “were armor-piercing bullets used?”, suggests it’s likely that those gray boxes above would turn red if information were available. However, on other questions, such as whether the weapon was bought privately and whether the gun had more than 10 rounds, more information would likely reveal that some of the 20 worst mass shootings could have been affected by legislative changes that were proposed in 2013. Overall, the picture suggests that tougher gun control measures could have reduced the likelihood of some of the worst mass shootings this year. But the analysis also shows that what we don’t know about the impact of gun control is far more than what we do know. That’s partly because while San Bernardino might be remembered, the other mass shooting which took place less than 12 hours earlier that same day probably won’t be. That’s true of most of the 353 mass shootings that have happened this year and the hundreds more that will likely happen in the year to come. We won’t know how they obtained their weapons and we won’t know how US gun law impeded or facilitated their crime. "

Before the final candidate filings roll in today, let’s get a recap of what happened over the weekend. Surprising absolutely no one, Trey Martinez Fischer officially threw his hat in the ring for SD-26, facing Jose Menendez again and opening up what’s likely to be a hotly contested House race in the Alamo City. “Without mentioning him by name, Martinez Fischer said Menéndez ‘bragged’ that he voted for the state budget even though it was inadequate in many areas. ‘I doubt he bragged to our public school teachers who work in classrooms that are overcrowded and underfunded. I doubt he bragged to the parents and families who go without insurance, without Medicaid, because they can’t afford the premium or the state cut their services,’ Martinez Fischer said. “Menéndez, who took the Senate seat after serving in the House 14 years, didn’t immediately comment on his newly contested race,” writes the San Antonio Express-News’ John W.

The tallies showed Houston's long trend of voting in racial blocs held in this year's runoff, by far the closest in 12 years. “Conservative businessman Bill King took 71 percent of the vote in the city's majority-white voting precincts, where residents also turned out in the highest numbers. Turner won a whopping 93 percent of the vote in majority-black precincts, however, erasing King's turnout advantage. Turner also had an edge in the city's two predominantly Latino council districts, giving him the boost he needed to secure a 4,100-vote victory.”http://goo.gl/EvhhBa — READ the Chronicle’s post-election Q&A with Turner: http://goo.gl/LBwmOc — What to watch for this week on Cruz v. Trump, per The New York Times’ Maggie Haberman: “Things are likely to get even more awkward when they are standing side by side with millions watching. And Mr. Trump could amplify attacks on Mr. Cruz over issues like immigration in ways no other candidate can. Nonetheless, Mr. Cruz has durable popularity with conservatives and with the Tea Party faction, and he may be more difficult to slay with insults than other opponents in the race. “That political dynamic is being watched closely from across the aisle by Hillary Clinton’s campaign, which views Mr. Trump as an unlikely nominee but a hard-to-predict factor in the race. Many of Mrs. Clinton’s advisers say they believe that Mr. Cruz is the most likely nominee, according to people briefed on their views. That idea is not unanimous, but it is prevailing, and, as Politico reported, it is said to be the view of Bill Clinton, among others.”http://goo.gl/oMmwn6 — Texas dragging its feet on kicking Planned Parenthood out of Medicaid, by the Houston Chronicle’s Brian Rosenthal. “A court hearing set for Monday about the effort by Texas to halt Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood has been canceled because state officials have not yet actually kicked the organization out of the program.” http://goo.gl/qOM1Mb SPEED READ Judge throws out motions by Paxton to dismiss criminal charges, Houston Chronicle Lon Burnam files for Railroad Commissioner, Fort Worth Star-Telegram Ted Cruz.

Paul, a Kentucky senator, barely squeaked in after a poll released Sunday showed him with 5% support in Iowa. This is the first debate that took into account not only national polling (candidates needed to average 3.5% in recent surveys to qualify via their overall national standing) but also polls in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire (the bar was 4% or higher in either of the two states). For the forum that's become known as the ""happy hour"" debate, George Pataki, Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum and Lindsey Graham will square off.

Obama spoke at the Pentagon after meeting with national security advisers, including Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter, on the subject of the Islamic State, also known as Daesh, ISIS or ISIL.

""I want to provide all of you a brief update on our progress against the ISIL core in Syria and Iraq because as we squeeze its heart, we'll make it harder for ISIL to pump its terror and propaganda to the rest of the world,"" Obama said. ""This continues to be a difficult fight. As I said before, ISIL is dug in, including in urban areas, and they hide behind civilians, using defenseless men, women and children as human shields. So even as we're relentless, we have to be smart -- targeting ISIL surgically with precision.""
Obama said the military campaign against the Islamic State is ""moving forward with a great sense of urgency.""
RELATED Poll: Americans think terrorism is the country's No. 1 problem
The U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State has greatly damaged the group's militant and financial infrastructure, by striking targets such as weapons depots and oil refineries, Obama said.

""We are hitting ISIL harder than ever. Coalition aircraft, our fighters, bombers and drones, have been increasing the pace of their strikes -- nearly 9,000 as of today,"" Obama said. ""Last month in November, we dropped more bombs on ISIL targets than any other month since this campaign started.""RELATED Free Syrian Army rebel group denies it's receiving military support from Russia
""We're also taking out ISIL leaders, commanders and killers, one by one,"" Obama said, before listing a number of recently killed IS leaders such as finance chief Abu Saleh.
RELATED Report: Paris attack mastermind directed massacre by phone
""The point is ISIL leaders cannot hide and our next message to them is simple 'You are next,'"" Obama said. ""In fact, since the summer, ISIL has not had a single successful major offensive operation on the ground in either Syria or Iraq.""
Obama said Carter will be traveling to the Middle East to speak with coalition partners about how they and other international actors can increase their support in the fight against the Islamic State. Secretary of State John Kerry will be traveling to Russia as part of ongoing efforts to seek a solution for the Syrian civil war.

""So far ISIL has lost about 40 percent of the populated areas it once controlled in Iraq, and it will lose more,"" Obama said, adding that Iraqi military forces are working toward retaking Ramadi, Fallujah and Mosul -- all urban areas where the Islamic State is ""entrenched.""
""ISIL has lost thousands of square miles of territory it once controlled in Syria and it will lose more,"" Obama said. ""Meanwhile, more people are seeing ISIL for the thugs and the thieves and the killers that they are.""
Obama's statement follows the Dec. 2 San Bernardino mass shooting in Southern California, where a husband and wife, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people at a county health department holiday party. The couple reportedly shared radical Islamist sentiments and supported the Islamic State.
The Islamic State coordinated attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead have renewed international discussions on how to solve the Syrian crisis.
Syria has been blighted by a complex civil war in which the Islamic State, the Syrian government and multiple Syrian rebel groups fight for control of territory, causing a mass exodus of migrants seeking refuge elsewhere.
More than 3 million Syrians have fled to Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq and more than 1 million have reached several countries of the European Union, creating a migrant crisis that's straining economies attempting to cope with the influx of asylum-seekers.

The State Department and Department of Homeland Security are conducting a review of whether screening requirements on the K-1 visa program should be tightened, and the White House will not weigh in until after it is complete, Earnest said. ABC News reported there was a secret policy at Homeland Security that prohibits immigration officials from reviewing social media messages of foreign citizens applying for U.S. visas. Asked when the broader review would be completed, Earnest said he had no specific date to announce, but said President Barack Obama ""is feeling a sense of urgency about this.""

http://rssfeeds.cincinnati.com/~/128219975/0/cincinnati-home~Can-Kasich-tweak-combative-debate-approach/,"Has John Kasich learned his lesson? The Ohio governor's presidential campaign has stagnated after a rough GOP debate performance last month in Milwaukee. Two weeks earlier, he'd rebooted to his usual aggressive persona, interrupting his way into the conversation and attacking ideas -- especially those of Donald Trump -- that he finds ""crazy."" By the time he left the stage in Milwaukee, the approach had turned off audiences, culminating with Kasich's getting booed as he sparred with a rising Ted Cruz. As the GOP field reconvenes in Las Vegas, other candidates are poised to hold the spotlight. Cruz is challenging longtime poll leader Donald Trump in Iowa, passing the controversial billionaire in some surveys. Chris Christie and Marco Rubio are duking it out behind Trump in New Hampshire. And the whole GOP field is reacting to Trump's week-old proposal to keep Muslims out of the country, which Kasich has called ""unacceptable"" and ""the politics of division."" Still, Kasich sees an opening, if he can tweak his approach from combative to merely assertive. Following terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California, Kasich has touted his experience in government, including on the House Armed Services committee when he served in Congress. He has renewed his call for American ground troops to fight the so-called Islamic State as part of a coalition. ""I'm in this race for one basic reason: I know how to get the economy moving again and I know what we need to do with national security,"" Kasich said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""Polarization and divisions is going to lead us down the wrong path."" For now, though, voters seeking experience and spurning Trump are boosting Rubio and Christie. Tea party favorite Cruz, perhaps the hottest candidate entering Tuesday's debate, has also seen voters sidle up to him as they've started to question Trump or a fading Dr. Ben Carson. Nine Republicans will vie for voters' attention in Tuesday's main debate, which airs at 9 p.m. on CNN and on CNN.com. Here's a look at how some of the top candidates are previewing their approaches to key issues ahead of the debates, via The Associated Press. CINCINNATI.COM Fight against Donald Trump has moved beyond John Kasich, without giving him momentum TRUMP ON DEFENSE The billionaire real estate developer spent the weekend defending his proposed ban on Muslims entering the U.S., a plan that's drawn nearly universal condemnation from government leaders around the world. In interviews with CNN and Fox that aired Sunday, Trump emphasized that the ban would be temporary and not ""total and complete,"" as he had said initially. ""You're going to have exceptions,"" Trump said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Trump didn't name any, and he didn't back off the basic idea of a ban. He dismissed questions about the idea's constitutionality and suggested the proposal is not as bad as the potential attacks by extremists. TRUMP ON OFFENSE vs. CRUZ The rare detente between two GOP presidential candidates competing for conservative voters appears to be strained, if not over. Cruz was reported by the New York Times this week to have questioned Trump's judgment at a closed-door fundraiser, a departure from his public refusal to attack Trump. Since Friday, Trump has taken aim at Cruz for opposing ethanol subsidies and alienating his colleagues in the Senate. On Fox News Sunday, Trump said Cruz has conducted himself ""like a bit of a maniac."" ""You can't walk into the Senate and scream and call people liars and not be able to cajole and get along with people,"" Trump said, referring to Cruz's accusation that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had not been truthful in negotiations. McConnell denied that. Trump suggested that Cruz's approach would impair his effectiveness. ""He'll never get anything done. And that's the problem with Ted."" TRUMP ON OFFENSE vs CLINTON Trump on Sunday bristled at Hillary Clinton's suggestion that his proposed policies are dangerous. Clinton, he said, is ""one of the worst secretaries of state in the history of the country. She talks about me being dangerous. She's killed hundreds of thousands of people with her stupidity,"" Trump said on Fox. Asked to elaborate, he replied that her work as President Barack Obama's secretary of state resulted in many deaths in Iraq and Libya. RUBIO Rubio on Sunday said he continues to believe that Trump is not qualified to be president because of his level of ""understanding on some of these critical issues before our country,"" including foreign policy and national security. And he panned Obama's response to recent attacks in Paris, Mali and San Bernadino, California. Casting himself as the most knowledgeable candidate on policy issues, Rubio said that he would have acknowledged the fear people are feeling, pointed out that potential attackers are a real threat and the Islamic State group is ""not the JV team,"" as Obama had earlier suggested. Rubio then said he would have finished by saying the U.S. can defeat IS with a combination of more air strikes, a force on the ground that includes special operations forces from the U.S. and elsewhere and more aggressive communications to counter the militant group's propaganda. CARSON The retired neurosurgeon suggested Sunday on ABC's ""This Week"" that knowing all the issues is not what matters most in a presidential candidate. ""There is no way that I, or anybody else who is running, is an expert in every area,"" he said, and pointed to the way chief executives run their companies. ""Do you know how to use the people around you? Do you have wisdom and judgment? And that is demonstrated by the life that you've led."" KASICH Kasich said he does not hear people in early voting states talking about whether to keep Muslims out of the U.S. ""I hear people saying, I'm worried about my job, I'm worried about our security, I'm worried about my kid's future. What are you going to do about it? What are you going to do about Social Security? What are you going to do about college debt?'"" Ohio's governor said Sunday on CBS's ""Face the Nation."" ''I don't have people, you know, coming up and yelling about this other stuff."" CHRISTIE In an interview late last week with The Associated Press, Christie suggested two of his chief Republican rivals don't have the right experience or priorities to keep the country safe. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Christie said, hurt the country by voting against extending the National Security Agency's bulk collection program of phone records, which ended days before the shooting in California. Christie advocates reinstating the program and giving law enforcement and intelligence agencies more ways to track terrorism. ""You can't, in these dangerous times, take tools away from the government, and he's made the country weaker,"" Christie said of Cruz. Christie is battling Marco Rubio for second place in New Hampshire and says the Florida senator simply doesn't have the necessary experience. ""He's not ready to be president, he's a first-term U.S. senator, we just went through that,"" Christie said. ""You can't do on-the-job training with the presidency.""

              since Three years ago Monday, a shooter opened fire in a Connecticut school, killing 20 children and six others in the second-deadliest recorded mass shooting in US history. Three years later, the number of communities that have had to endure mass-shooting incidents remains staggering. The Mass Shooting Tracker is a crowdsourced Reddit database sourced largely from media reports listing every incident in the US in which four people have been wounded or killed by gunfire. (This differs slightly from other definitions — like that of the FBI, which defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are killed.) According to the tracker, there have been at least 1,052 such mass-shooting incidents between 2013 and the time of this writing: The Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre served as an inflection point for a country that was left shocked by the brutality of the incident. But its aftermath eventually devolved into a charged debate over stricter controls on guns. And three years after the massacre, the US has taken strikingly few steps to prevent more from occurring. In another stunning data point, an NBC analysis released Monday found that 554 children under the age of 12 have died as a result of gunshots since the Sandy Hook massacre. It works out to a child under 12 dying by gunshot about once every other day — and NBC noted its numbers may be low because of the unavailability of certain data. ""We grieve today, as we have every single day since that soul crushing December morning,"" said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Connecticut), who was a US representative in the Newtown, Connecticut, district at the time of the 2012 massacre. “We remember the little ones, and marvel at what they were, and what they could have become. We recall with awe those brave educators, who tried to protect them, and perished in the effort,"" he added. ""And we never stop searching for answers. Why did it happen? Did it have to happen? What can we do, now, to make sure it never happens again?""     For you For you"
http://www.sfgate.com/nation/article/Obama-tries-to-calm-concerns-over-terrorist-attack-6695850.php,"WASHINGTON — Fears of terrorism are hanging over America’s holiday season, so President Obama is planning a series of events this week seeking to allay concerns about his strategy for stopping the Islamic State group abroad and its sympathizers at home. Obama’s visits Monday to the Pentagon and Thursday to the National Counterterrorism Center are part of a push to further explain his terrorism fighting strategy, White House officials said, after a prime-time Oval Office address Dec. 6 that critics said failed to do much to reassure the public. Another goal is to draw a contrast with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his inflammatory remarks about Muslims. The Obama administration has warned that Trump’s rhetoric emboldens extremists looking to pull the U.S. into a war with Islam. “Terrorists like ISIL are trying to divide us along lines of religion and background,” Obama said Saturday in his weekly radio and Internet address, using an acronym for the extremist group. “That’s how they stoke fear. That’s how they recruit.” The president’s push comes as the public is jittery about the specter of terrorism after the mass shooting in San Bernardino this month and the Paris attacks a few weeks before. Seven in 10 Americans rated the risk of a terrorist attack in the U.S. as at least somewhat high, according to an Associated Press-GfK poll. That was a sharp increase from the 5 in 10 who said that in January. U.S. officials have insisted there are no credible threats to the United States. But the apparent lack of warning before San Bernardino has fueled concerns about whether the U.S. has a handle on potential attacks, especially during high-profile times such as the holidays."

Every Monday There have been 22 mass shootings in 2015 in which four or more victims were killed, slightly above average for the past 15 years. Loading... December 14, 2015 While the attack at the holiday party in San Bernardino, Calif., and the June shooting at the Emanuel A.M.E. church in Charleston, S.C., will remain seared in public consciousness, in 2015, mass public shootings remain the least common form of gun violence in America. Focusing on the widely accepted FBI definition – an incident in which four or more victims are shot and killed – there have been 22 mass shootings this year, according to a Monitor analysis of two crowdsourced databases that rely on news reports. In these 22 incidents – which averaged about one every 16 days – 133 people were killed and 52 were wounded. The shooters were usually white men acting alone, and they typically were motivated by personal disputes, rather than politics or ideology. The incidents shook communities across the country, from the deep-red towns of Roseburg, Ore., and Waco, Texas, to the liberal enclaves of Barre, Vt., and Minneapolis. But barring further shootings before the end of the year, 2015 should end up being just slightly above average when compared with the past 15 years. “There should be concern, but not alarm and not panic, and not knee-jerk reactions and quick fixes,” says James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston. “The sky is not falling; it’s just gray, and it's been gray for a while.” Professor Fox singled out the San Bernardino and Charleston killings, because of the terrorism of one and the racism of the other, as the ones that “had a strong impact on people’s consciousness.” And of course, for the victims’ families and hometowns, the aftershocks of the tragedies are profound and lasting. “But in terms of the number of cases,” he adds, “they're not out of the ordinary at all."" A report published by the Congressional Research Service in July found that, using the same definition, between 1999 and 2013 there were an average of 21 mass shootings per year, killing 1,554 people in total and wounding 441. During that 15-year period, the CRS found that about four incidents per year could be defined as “public mass shootings.” According to the CRS, there were 4.1 mass public shootings a year in the 2000s and 4.5 from 2010 through 2013. This year, there have been five or six public mass shootings (depending on how an incident between rival biker gangs in Texas is classified), including the three with the highest death tolls: the attack in San Bernardino, which is being investigated as terrorism by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore.; and the massacre in Charleston, S.C., which the FBI classified as a hate crime. The other two include Chattanooga, Tenn., where Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez killed four Marines and a sailor before being shot to death by police; and Tyrone, Mo., where Joseph Jesse Aldridge killed seven people and then himself after finding his mother dead of apparent natural causes. This year was unusual in that two of the public mass shootings were committed by three apparently radicalized Islamic extremists. Tashfeen Malik reportedly left a Facebook post pledging allegiance to the Islamic State before she and her husband, Syed Farook, killed 14 people in San Bernardino. Mr. Abdulazeez’s motives remain murkier. Prior to this year, the last public US mass shooting by an Islamist extremist was in 2009 at Fort Hood, Texas. The most recent previous Islamist terror attacks on US soil were the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013, which were committed by the Tsarnaev brothers. In 2015, the most common type of mass shooting was a “familicide” mass killing, in which a family member or former intimate partner shoots four or more victims. There were nine such cases. Jody Herring is accused of going on a shooting rampage in Barre, Vt., in August after losing custody of her daughter, with three relatives and a social worker killed. (Ms. Herring was the only other woman involved in a mass shooting in 2015, besides Ms. Malik in San Bernardino.) Fox, who has argued for years that mass shootings have plateaued after increasing in the 1970s and ’80s, is in favor of a broader definition that would include familicides and gang violence. “If you and three other people are murdered, does it matter if it’s your brother or father or a stranger? You're just as dead,” he says. One anomaly found in 2015 mass shootings is the decline in the number of “felony mass shootings,” a subcategory that the CRS defined as “attributable to an underlying criminal activity or commonplace circumstance.” The landmark felony mass shooting of 2015 was the biker gang shootout at a restaurant in Waco, Texas, which killed nine and wounded 18 (though some classify it as a public mass shooting). There have been only three others this year. Between 1999 and 2013, there was an average of eight per year. These subcategories are important, researchers say, because different kinds of mass shootings require different policy responses. ""The guy who goes home to his family [and shoots them], that’s a different event than someone who goes out and shoots someone in public,"" says Deborah Azrael, associate director of the Harvard Youth Violence Prevention Center. ""I don't rank one as being more important than the other. I think they have really different policy implications,"" she adds. Several researchers have called for consensus definitions of mass shootings to help guide the funding of research, instead of contributing to the confusion that persists at the moment, according to the CRS report. ""Different definitions of 'mass killing,' 'mass murder,' and 'mass shooting' [contribute] to a welter of claims and counter-claims about the prevalence and deadliness of mass shootings,"" wrote the report’s authors. ""With improved data, policymakers would arguably have additional vantage points from which to assess the legislative proposals that are inevitably made in the wake of these tragedies."" Dr. Azrael argues that subdividing different kinds of mass shootings and improving data collection on them will help researchers detect trends to better direct policy responses. She was part of a team of Harvard researchers last year who, analyzing 33 years of mass shooting data compiled by Mother Jones, found that the rate of public mass shootings tripled from 2011 through 2014. Noticing how prevalent familicides are, some states have enacted laws to remove firearms from the homes of persons with histories of domestic violence. Such laws are unlikely to totally eliminate such tragedies. There were no apparent warning signs before Scott Westerhuis shot his wife, their four children, and himself in their South Dakota home in September, for example. In one of the deadlier mass shootings of the year, Valerie Jackson had just changed the locks on her house when her ex-boyfriend, David Conley, climbed through a window and shot her, her husband, and their six children. And proactive measures may not be enough to prevent other kinds of mass shootings, experts say. Since mass shooters are unlikely to be deterred by gun control laws, it may be more helpful to focus on guidelines for emergency responders. Azrael cited as one example a high school shooting in Oregon last year. The shooter had already killed two students but officers arrived within minutes, at which point he fled to a bathroom and committed suicide. The local police chief said the quick response “saved many of our students’ lives.” ""Maybe we should be following that. We should be seeing what happens in active shooter situations in which police actively engage the shooter rather than waiting,"" adds Azrael. ""That has different policy implications than guns in households, that are often wielded by people who are distraught and angry, who can kill five people, and the police never even get called because there’s no time to call the police."" Garen Wintemute, director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California at Davis, describes gun violence and mass shootings as “an intractable problem.” “We’ve taken a long time to develop it,” he says, “and it’s going to take a long time to fix it.” Already a subscriber?

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in.

              since ""If I were there — I'm licensed to carry, I will tell you this — if I were there, if somebody were there, if we had some firepower in the opposite direction, those people would have been gone,"" Trump said of the Paris attackers while speaking at a rally in Las Vegas. A coordinated team of attackers, wielding assault rifles and explosives, slaughtered more than 100 people in Paris in November. The evening's attacks were linked to the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS. Trump, the Republican presidential front-runner, frequently hints that strict gun-control policies were partially to blame for both the Paris attacks and the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, earlier this month. ""They drop a few people into these various rooms in France and they start shooting everybody. And by the way ... you talk about gun control? Paris has the toughest gun control, just about, in the entire world. France has the toughest gun control, just about, in the entire world,"" Trump said Monday. ""If a few of those people that are now dead — if a few of those people had guns strapped to their ankles or strapped to their waists — you wouldn't have the problem,"" he continued. ""You wouldn't have the problem, right?"" For you For you"
http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/in-pinellas-county-three-bomb-scares-in-three-days/2257770,"First someone spotted a suspicious package in the Largo Mall parking lot on Saturday, prompting an evacuation. It turned out to be an empty suitcase. Monday morning, someone reported a paper sack on the ground in East Lake. It was someone's lunch: a Gatorade, a banana and a sandwich. Later Monday, a suspicious item reported in Palm Harbor was revealed to be a backpack with a woman's change purse inside. None of the three Pinellas County bomb scares this week has turned out to be a real threat. But the message from law enforcement officials remains the same, given the times: Just call the experts, and they'll decide whether to take it seriously. ""We don't want to discourage anyone from contacting us,"" said Tampa police spokeswoman Andrea Davis. ""The reality is, if someone does not call it in and it's something that could be dangerous to people, they'll wish that they had called."" The Tampa police and Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office bomb squads serve the Tampa Bay area. A few large stores and a movie theater were evacuated Saturday while the Tampa team assessed the package found in a shopping cart. The Hillsborough squad handled Monday's scares. First, Keystone Road was closed in both directions while the squad looked at the package near the East Lake Fire Station. When it was determined to be someone's lunch, the road was reopened. Then the team was called to assess the abandoned backpack at the Fountains Plaza in Palm Harbor. Several businesses were evacuated, but the Sheriff's Office told residents in the area not to fear. The backpack was quickly determined not to be a threat. But in the wake of terror attacks abroad and in the United States — including earlier this month in San Bernardino, Calif., the deadliest mass shooting since Sandy Hook in Connecticut three years ago — officials want citizens to be alert. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement relaunched its ""If You See Something, Say Something"" campaign less than a week after the terrorism-linked California shooting. ""We remind our citizens to remain vigilant,"" FDLE Commissioner Rick Swearingen said in a statement. ""It's important that we are aware of our surroundings and report suspicious behavior to law enforcement."" FDLE said examples of suspicious activity include people drawing or measuring buildings for no known reason and suitcases, backpacks or packages that are left behind. ""We'd rather you call and it be nothing than you not call,"" said Capt. Louis Pulford, bomb squad commander of the Marion County Sheriff's Office. Pulford said his district receives about two calls per month, but that despite the California shooting his district hasn't logged a call yet this month. Still, he doesn't want to discourage anyone from being vigilant, he said. ""The California incident just shows that it can happen pretty much anywhere,"" he said. Enterprise Reporter"
http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/128335705/0/phoenix/nation~Iowa-Poll-Parties-deeply-split-on-national-security/,"DES MOINES — On matters of national security and Middle East policy, Iowans likely to participate in the Democratic or Republican caucuses could hardly be further apart. Across a range of questions pertaining to Islamic State, Islam, refugees and terrorism, respondents to the latest Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics Iowa Poll widely agree with members of their own party, but share precious little common ground with their neighbors across the aisle. Republican caucusgoers are more hawkish on Iraq and Syria than their Democratic counterparts, more skeptical of Muslims and the Islamic faith and far less confident in the military and national security policies of Democratic President Obama. The results speak to a sharp partisan divergence on foreign policy and national security that has been evident since the beginning of the Iraq war in 2003, but that has grown more strident as the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS, has gained power and launched attacks beyond the Middle East. USA TODAY Iowa Poll: Clinton builds lead over Sanders “It’s not that surprising to see a huge partisan divide on foreign policy given where the leaders of the parties are in terms of their perceptions on what went wrong and rhetoric on what we need to do,” said Brian Lai, a University of Iowa political scientist who studies domestic politics and international relations. More than half of Republican respondents — 55% — call the fight with the Islamic State “a battle for civilization versus barbarism” and agree the United States should “commit whatever military forces are necessary to eradicate the Islamic State.” “We need to give the military powers complete decision-making authority to completely annihilate ISIS,” said Republican poll respondent Joy Gibson, a 55-year-old office manager from Burnside, Iowa, who's supporting Texas U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz in the caucuses. “It needs to be a military function, not a political function. The whole world will benefit if and when ISIS is completely annihilated.” Imgur Just 20% of Democrats, by contrast, agree with that view, while 49% say the U.S. should take a more limited role focused on training, supporting and providing intelligence to allies in the region. “We don’t want to throw our troops into something that we have to do alone,” said poll respondent John Rinde, an 85-year-old Lutheran pastor from Council Bluffs who supports the candidacy of former secretary of State Hillary Clinton. ""I’m in favor of engaging more of the surrounding people who have a stake in the territory and not engaging our troops to do all the dirty work.” The parties are even more divided on whether the United States is secure against a terrorist threat akin to last month’s Islamic State-sponsored attack in Paris. While two-thirds of Democrats are “mostly confident” that the U.S. has done enough to protect the homeland against an attack, more than three-quarters of Republicans say the opposite. They’re “mostly not confident” in the country’s security preparations. USA TODAY Iowa Poll: Cruz soars past Trump into lead among GOP “I think a lot of what’s going on right now is essentially fear-mongering,” said Democratic poll respondent Nick Janiczek, 28, of North Liberty, a supporter of Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders. “I really do think the Republican nominees right now are pushing this fear agenda and basically scaring people into thinking that things are a lot worse or that a terrorist attack could happen tomorrow.” But Republican Steve Mathis, a retired economics professor from Emmetsburg who's backing candidate Donald Trump in the caucuses, said he sees gaps in the screening process for immigrants and visitors that terrorists could easily slip through. He’s bracing for more attacks like the one in San Bernardino, Calif., this month. “It’s a difficult situation,” Mathis said. “You don’t like keeping people out, but on the other hand, you do have to protect your own citizens. And I don’t think we’re doing a very good job of it.” Iowa Poll pollster J. Ann Selzer noted that Republicans’ pessimism on national security reflects a lack of confidence in just about everything government does in this seventh year of the Obama presidency. “Any time Republicans — and Iowa GOP caucusgoers are no different — are asked about confidence in the way things are going, they resoundingly say they are not confident,” Selzer said. “That applies to measures of the economy, the direction of the nation, and so on.  In this poll, it applies to concerns about an attack on the homeland.” Imgur The Iowa Poll, conducted Dec. 7-10 for The Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines, is based on telephone interviews with 400 registered Iowa voters who say they definitely or probably will attend the 2016 Republican caucuses and 404 registered voters who say they definitely or probably will attend the 2016 Democratic caucuses. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. Partisans are similarly at odds over the reasons for destabilization in the Middle East and the rise of the Islamic State. A strong majority of Republican poll respondents place the blame with Obama: 54% blame his administration’s removal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011, and additional 18% think the administration's minimal support for Syrian rebels did the most to destabilize the region and enable the militant group. USA TODAY Elections 2016 | USA TODAY Network But most Democrats think it’s the fault of former Republican president George W. Bush. Sixty-three percent of respondents view the 2003 invasion of Iraq as the root cause of current problems. “We came in and disrupted their politics and their government,” said Democratic poll respondent and Sanders supporter Amy Jardon, 40, of Cedar Falls. “We didn’t really have any clear-cut plan for why we were in the country, and we didn’t have a real clear-cut understanding of the populations and religious populations that were there.” Shifting blame to one’s political opponents is not uncommon or particularly surprising, Selzer said. “We see this phenomenon a lot: Each party wants to blame the other party’s most recent president for things that have gone wrong,” she said. The partisan divide is clearly evident on issues related to Muslims and the Islamic religion as well. Imgur An 83% majority of Democratic respondents say Iowans “should welcome and resettle” Syrian civil war refugees who have passed federal screening. “If people will take all the needed tests and so forth, they should be able to move into our society and have a place for safety and care and, I say, as a pastor, love,” said Rinde, the Democratic poll respondent. “It’s not always easy, but it has to be done carefully and without prejudice.” Nearly three-fourths of Trump's supporters (73%) want to fight resettlement, but just 50% of Cruz's supporters do.  Among Republicans, just 28% share that view. Indeed, almost half — 47% — say Iowans should “fight against” any Syrian resettlement, and an additional 18% support resettling only Christian refugees. Majorities from both parties view Islam as an “inherently peaceful” religion, although there’s still a wide gulf between Democratic and Republican views. Eighty-seven percent of Democratic respondents believe Islam is inherently peaceful, but that some “twist its teachings to justify violence.” Fifty-six percent of Republicans share that view, but a sizable minority, 38%, say the religion is “inherently violent.” Indeed, a majority of Cruz supporters, 53%, hold that view. Poll respondent Crissy Kooker, 44, a Ben Carson supporter and nurse from Ankeny, said she feels like there’s a war underway against Christianity. “I do think that the war is against Christianity,” she said. “I do think it is against Christians, and with that being the predominate religion in the United States, like it or not, I do feel like we are being targeted. ... And that certainly involves us in the fight.”"

http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/12/what_time_channel_is_the_5th_republican_debate_on.html," Gallery: Gov. Christie Participates In First GOP Debate In Milwaukee TRENTON -- Gov. Chris Christie, Donald Trump, and other candidates vying for the Republican presidential nomination will gather Tuesday night for the fifth GOP debate of the 2016 race. Here is a look at what you need to know heading in: WHEN: As was the case the first four times, there are actually two debates: an early one featuring four of the bottom contenders and a main one featuring the top nine candidates, according to an aggregate of polls. The early debate airs at 6 p.m. Eastern time. The later one -- featuring Christie and Trump -- begins at 8:30 p.m. and will run until 11 p.m. WHERE TO WATCH: CNN -- which is co-hosting the event with Facebook and Salem Media Group -- will broadcast both events. You can also stream the debates at CNN.com and on CNN's app (iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows Phone). WHERE TO LISTEN: You can stream the event live on any Salem Media radio stations at SalemMedia.com. ON NJ.COM: NJ Advance Media will begin its live coverage at 6 p.m. Follow on NJ.com/Politics. Political reporter Matt Arco will be on the scene in Las Vegas. Follow him on Twitter: @MatthewArco. LOCATION: The Venetian, a hotel and casino on the Las Vegas strip. It is touted as the second-largest hotel in the world, complete with 4,049 rooms, 3,068 suites and a 120,000 square-foot casino -- numbers that might make Trump, a former Atlantic City casino mogul, jealous. The owner is Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino magnate and top Republican donor. MAIN DEBATE PARTICIPANTS: Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas Businesswoman Carly Fiorina Ohio Gov. John Kasich U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida Businessman Donald Trump EARLY DEBATE PARTICIPANTS: U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee Former New York Gov. George Pataki Former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania HOW THEY QUALIFIED: To qualify for the main debate, candidates needed to average at least 3.5 percent support in a group of recent national polls or at least 4 percent in polls out of either Iowa or New Hampshire -- the states that host the nation's first presidential caucuses and primary, respectfully. After being relegated to the undercard last time, Christie is back on the main stage. To make the early debate, candidates needed to average at least 1 percent in four of the polls, whether they be national, Iowa or New Hampshire. After missing the previous debate completely, Graham and Pataki are back on the early stage. WHO'S NOT HERE: Despite participating in the undercard of the first debate in August, former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore -- who is polling at the bottom of the GOP field -- has not qualified for the past four debates. And Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal quit the race not long after the previous debate, in which he clashed with Christie on the early stage. MODERATORS: CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer will moderate the debates. And similar to the second GOP debate -- which the news channel also hosted -- CNN reporter Dana Bash and Salem Radio Network host Hugh Hewitt will ask questions, as well. STORYLINES TO WATCH: * Trump has been a focal point of each of the Republican debates so far, but he may be a bigger target than ever Tuesday night. The billionaire businessman has seen a surge in recent days, strengthening his lead atop the national polls thanks to a loyal fanbase that experts say is fed up with career politicians and enamored with his brash ideas. And this debate is less than two months until voters head to the polls in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary -- meaning the GOP establishment suddenly has little time to bolster their case against Trump. ""Candidates who don't have a lot to lose, they may be kind of throwing up a hail Mary,"" said Aaron Kall, the director of debate at the University of Michigan. ""There's no reason they shouldn't."" * But watch out for Cruz. The Texas senator is now Trump's top competitor, even leading the real estate magnate in a few recent Iowa polls. Pundits say Cruz has been leery of attacking Trump, but Trump is expected to go after Cruz in the debate. ""He'll be aggressive,"" Julian Zelizer, a political science professor at Princeton University, said of Trump. ""He'll go after (Cruz). It might be diffict for Cruz to say nothing."" * This is the first Republican debate since the Paris attacks and California mass shooting -- meaning much of the focus could be on national security and the fight against terrorism. Expect there to be some debate over Trump's controversial call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the U.S. And expect more moderate candidates like Bush, Kasich and Christie -- New Jersey's former U.S. attorney -- to tout why they would offer more serious alternatives on the matter. * Christie is another candidate who has shown signs of life lately. The New Jersey governor has moved into second place behind Trump in a recent New Hampshire poll. But he hasn't seen a huge boost from previous strong debate performances. Will that change Tuesday night? ""Whatever he does will be an appeal to New Hampshire voters,"" said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. * What about Carson? The soft-spoken retired neurosurgeon was Trump's closest competitor for a while, but he has begun to fade in the polls. Can he break out again? Murray doesn't think so. ""I don't see anything in the dynamic bring Carson back up,"" he said. ""His voters have switched to Cruz."" * With only weeks to go until Iowa and New Hampshire, there are still 14 candidates in the race. Doesn't something have to give? Ross Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers University, said the field ""ought to thin out"" after the debate. The next to go, he said, may be U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky. And former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush -- once considered the GOP establishment favorite -- is ""living on life support,"" Baker said. Brent Johnson may be reached at bjohnson@njadvancemedia.com.

http://www.inquisitr.com/2634864/star-wars-texas-boy-banned-from-wearing-star-wars-shirt-to-school-because-it-has-a-gun-on-it/,"A Texas boy was told he can't wear his Star Wars shirt to school because the garment has a gun on it. The shirt worn by seventh-grader Colton Southern featured a stormtrooper character holding a futuristic blaster gun. News of the Star Wars shirt ban quickly went viral on social media and prompted posts declaring that political correctness is out of control in America. The Colton Southern Star Wars shirt ban is just one of many incidences where a student got into trouble for wearing a shirt that school officials felt possessed a threatening message because a gun was part of the design. Public school students have even been told to change their shirts or turn them inside out because the patriotic emblem on the garment included an image of the memorial soldiers cross. Even young children in elementary school have found themselves in hot water for biting pop tarts in what was considered the shape of a gun, pointing a finger, and saying ""bang"" to other students while playing at recess. As ""PC police"" angst increases when stories like the Star Wars shirt ban emerge, the ranks of homeschooling students continue to swell in the United States.  — The Rutherford Inst.

http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/los-angeles-schools-close-after-bomb-threat-w159702,"Top 5 Stories           All Los Angeles public schools were closed on Tuesday, December 15, due to a credible threat, the Los Angeles Police Department and superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District, Ramon Cortines, said in a joint press conference. “Somebody has sent information that leads us to pause to make sure that we are safe,” Cortines said in an afternoon press conference. “That our children and our staff are safe.” The threat, according to The New York Times, was called in to a member of the school board. Police officials told ABC News on Tuesday morning that the decision to close campuses was made solely by Cortines. “A threat had been made to not one school but many schools in this district,” L.A.’s school district leader said on Tuesday morning. “Some of the details talked about backpacks and other packages. After talking with him, also with the board president, I made a decision to close all of the schools.” Hours after the L.A. schools shut down, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and NYPD Commissioner William Bratton held a presser, and said the anonymous electronic message was also sent to other cities. According to de Blasio, the threat “was so generic, so outlandish, and posed to numerous school systems simultaneously,” that he decided against shutting public schools in NYC, which counts more than 1 million students. “It would be a huge disservice to our nation,” he added, if they decided to shut down local schools on Tuesday. L.A. police chief Charlie Beck spoke alongside the city’s superintendent on Tuesday in their afternoon presser. “The superintendent made a decision, we support this decision,” Beck noted. “It is very easy in hindsight to criticize a decision when the decider made the decision. . . The school district safeguards 3/4 of a million lives every day . . . I think it’s irresponsible to criticize that decision at this point.” The LAUSD is the second largest school district in America, counting 900-plus schools and 187 charter schools. It has more than 640,000 students from kindergarten through the 12th grade. According to a morning press conference, the threat was “rare” enough for the school district to take action. Faculty members and students have been advised to keep their distance from the schools and surrounding vicinities. Meanwhile, LAUSD school bus drivers — some en route to pick up kids at various bus stops — told local ABC affiliate KABC Los Angeles that they were called back by dispatchers. All of the buses were returned to their respective depots. Burbank schools remain open, as well as private schools in LAUSD. The LAUSD official Twitter account tweeted instructions for parents to pick up their kids. Superintendent: every school being searched by appropriate personnel. — L.A. Unified (@LASchools) December 15, 2015  LAUSD schools are closed today due to credible threat. Updates will be provided via https://t.co/AZDfmuaMmu & 213-241-2064. — L.A. Unified (@LASchools) December 15, 2015  Students that have arrived at school will be with staff until parents or guardians can be contacted. — L.A. Unified (@LASchools) December 15, 2015  Parents/Guardians please bring proper ID when picking up your child at school. They will be required. — L.A. Unified (@LASchools) December 15, 2015  The threat was made a day after the third anniversary of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where 20 children and six adults were killed back in 2012.

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/128405709/0/usatoday-newstopstories~mostread-stories-of/,"It was an emotional year. Tragedies that now seem all too familiar — mass shootings, terrorist attacks, celebrities dying much too young — filled our screens with news we couldn't help but read. The story was too big, too sad, too unbelievable to turn away. And then there was the supermoon eclipse. What an awe-inspiring break that was. Here are the 10 stories you clicked on most in 2015 across USA TODAY's website and mobile apps: 10. Terrorists and victims identified after Paris attacks The day after terrorists coordinated attacks on Paris, the world searched for answers. Events were canceled. Curfews were in place. Public demonstrations were banned. French newspaper Le Monde and CNN both identified one of the suicide bombers as Ismael Omar Mostefai, who at one point lived in Chartres, a city southwest of Paris. French prosecutors determined there were seven terrorists operating in three separate, coordinated teams on that Nov. 13 night. As the names of victims emerged, the U.S. mourned the loss of Nohemi Gonzalez, 20, a college student from California. Read more: Paris attacks 9. Cocaine and sex pills nearly killed Lamar Odom The former NBA player and estranged husband of Khloe Kardashian was found unresponsive at Love Ranch, a brothel in Nevada, on Oct. 13. The next day, as Lamar Odom lay comatose in a Las Vegas hospital, we learned he'd been at the ranch for a few days, and took up to 10 tabs of sexual-performance supplements. In addition, Odom used cocaine at least one of the days he was there. Initial 911 calls from Love Ranch urged dispatchers to hurry as Odom had ""blood coming out of his nose and white stuff coming out of his mouth,"" according to employee Mitzi Johnson. Kardashian, Kobe Bryant and the Rev. Jesse Jackson rushed to Odom's side in those first hours. He remains hospitalized, now in Los Angeles. 8. Bobbi Kristina Brown is 'not brain dead' Family members of Bobbi Kristina Brown remained tight-lipped during the six months that the daughter of Bobby Brown and the late Whitney Houston laid comatose in a hospital bed before she died. But sources did tell USA TODAY this: Brown is ""not brain dead,"" as had been reported. The family did not gather days after the incident to say goodbye, they were just simply gathering. And reports that the Houston and Brown families were butting heads? They ""are NOT fighting,"" said the source. Brown became unconscious in a bathtub on Jan. 31 and died nearly six months later in July. 7. U.S. adds San Bernardino, Calif., to the map of mass shootings Police chased a dark-colored SUV and shot and killed the man and woman inside, ending a day of horror in San Bernardino, Calif. The suspects, who were later identified as Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik, burst into a lunchtime holiday party at a social services center Dec. 2 and shot and killed 14 people. At least 21 more people were wounded. Farook and Malik carried long guns and wore ski masks and military-style vests. They fled the scene and went to their home until police caught up with them. Next came the car chase, shootout and the death of the suspects. The incident is the nation's deadliest shooting since a gunman killed 26 people in Newtown, Conn., in December 2012. Read more: San Bernardino shootings 6. Supermoon lunar eclipse interest was astronomical The moon was full. The moon was close to Earth. The moon fell into Earth's shadow. That is the stellar formula behind a supermoon lunar eclipse, and our inner scientists were thrilled. Because a lot of light scatters off Earth's atmosphere, the moon did not go completely dark that night on Sept. 27, but gave off a coppery red color, which tossed another magical moniker into the mix: Blood moon. The next time all of this will happen at once is in 2033. 5. The most-hyped fight in modern times killed boxing Boxing is dead, and we're all fools for paying $99.95 to watch Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao grab at each other for 36 minutes on May 2.For The Win's Chris Chase says we wanted this fight of epic hype to be something greater than it was. We wanted it to have meaning, but it was a payout fight at best. It was obvious early on that Mayweather could play defense forever; Pacquiao wasn't going to be able to get him down. After 12 rounds, Mayweather had beat Pacquiao by unanimous decision. The fight was ""a complete waste of everyone's time and money,"" Chase said. Will boxing fans learn from this experience and boycott the Next Big Match? Nah. 4. Shooter wanted everyone to watch him kill his former co-workers on live TV Vester Flanagan wanted everyone to see what he was about to do. As his former WDBJ-TV co-worker Adam Ward filmed reporter Alison Parker in a live TV broadcast on Aug. 26, Flanagan approached the journalists, raised his gun and fired. TV viewers in Southern Virginia heard gunshots, screams, and saw a glimpse of the gunman dressed in black. Ward and Parker died. Parker's interview subject, Vicki Gardner, was shot, underwent emergency surgery and was released from the hospital. The next few hours were busy for Flanagan. He faxed a 23-page manifesto to ABC News and posted his own graphic videos of the shooting to his Facebook and Twitter accounts. He fled police for hours, but as authorities closed in on him, he crashed his car, shot himself and died. Read more: WDBJ shootings 3. A hurricane beyond measurement approached Mexico The anticipation of Hurricane Patricia, one of the strongest hurricanes ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere, enthralled not only Mexico, where it would hit on Oct. 23, but all of North America. If there was such a thing as a Category 6 hurricane, this would be it said Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto. The storm's 200-mph winds ""are greater than the most intense, strongest hurricanes ever recorded on the planet,"" he said. Ahead of the storm, tens of thousands of people were evacuated from the the storm's projected path, including the port city of Manzanillo and the town of Puerto Vallarta, a resort town with a large expatriate community from the U.S. and Canada. Incredibly, Mexico's geography weakened the storm almost as quickly as it intensified, saving thousands of lives. 2. Oregon community college shooting is too familiar Chris Harper-Mercer, later described as a deeply troubled loner, shot and killed nine of his classmates at Umpqua Community College in southern Oregon. Students nearby described loud noises, like a ruler hitting a blackboard, and teachers jumping into action to keep students safe. Harper-Mercer died during an exchange of gunfire with officers. The Oct. 1 attack was the fourth shooting at a U.S. college campus since August, prompting President Obama to note that the USA is ""the only advanced country on earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months."" Read more: UCC shootings 1. Paris devastated by multiple terror attacks, mass casualties News of explosives and gunfire throughout Paris spread, and the list of deadly locations seemed to multiply. A Friday in Paris turned into a night of terror as 130 people were killed on Nov. 13 at multiple locations throughout the French capital. Restaurants, bars, concert venues and a soccer stadium were all targeted by multiple attackers, prompting French President François Hollande to close the country's borders. The Bataclan concert venue, featuring a California rock band, became the deadliest scene after terrorists shot and threw explosives, taking more than 100 people hostage. The night is the city's bloodiest since WWII. Read more: Paris attacks USA TODAY The 10 most-read stories of 2014 Hear more about how this list came together in the below podcast about USA TODAY's most-read stories of 2015:"

To receive TomDispatch in your inbox three times a week, click here. Sometimes what matters most takes up every inch of space in the room and somehow we still don't see it. That's how I feel about our present media moment. Let me put it this way: I'm a creature of habit, and one of those habits has long been watching NBC Nightly News, previously with anchor Brian Williams and now with Lester Holt.  It's my way of getting some sense of what an aging cohort of American news viewers (like me) learns daily about the world -- what stories are considered important and not, and in what order, and how presented. Here's one thing it's hard not to notice: the line-up of stories that we used to call the ""news"" seems increasingly like a thing of the past. Remarkably often these days, the ""news"" is a single hyped-up story -- most recently, the San Bernardino shootings -- reported frenetically and yet formulaically, often in near-apocalyptic fashion. Clearly, such an approach is meant to glue eyeballs in a situation in which viewers are eternally restless and there are so many other screens available. This single story approach is both relentless and remarkably repetitious because a lot of the time next to nothing new is known about the supposedly unfolding event (which is nonetheless presented as if our lives depended upon it). To fall back on the anchor of Avon, it often enough seems like a tale told by a collective idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. What this form of news certainly does is suck all the air out of the newsroom. On some days, when one of these 24/7 events is running wild, you could be excused, at the end of half an hour of ""national news,"" for thinking that nothing other than the event at screen center had happened anywhere on Earth. And I mean nothing. Not even the weather, generally such a favored subject of the nightly news because it offers disaster in its most picturesquely chaotic and yet expectable form. Above all, the 24/7, all-hands-on-deck news story obliterates context, or rather becomes the only context of the moment. To offer the most obvious recent example: in the days in which the San Bernardino shootings ate the screen, most Americans would not have noticed that the fate of the planet was being seriously discussed and negotiated in Paris by representatives of just about every country.  There was next to nothing but those shootings available -- the exploration of the backgrounds of the two killers, their marriage, their arsenal of weaponry, a pledge of allegiance by the wife to ISIS, the contents of their house, what relatives and friends in Pakistan had to say, their bank account, heart-rending tales of those killed, testimony from survivors, and on and on.  Even more than a week after the event, it was still the lead story on NBC Nightly News evening after evening.  (""San Bernardino Shooters Discussed Jihad in 2013 Before Engagement,"" ""FBI Divers Search Lake Near San Bernardino Massacre for Clues."")  Viewers might be pardoned for thinking that Islamic terrorism was indeed an apocalyptic threat for most Americans rather than the distinctly minor one it is. Sucking the Air Out of the Newsroom Mass shootings, a particularly American phenomenon, seem like the perfect story for our news moment.  They are guaranteed to eat any screen and recur so regularly, with uniquely gruesome twists, that covering them has become formulaic.  They are the equivalent of no-brainers: disturbed (or disturbing) shooters, horrified victims, blood and guts, grim hospital scenes, the testimony of victims, the rites around the dead, and in the case of San Bernardino the added attraction (or repulsion) of Islamic terrorism. Put another way, what passes for the news is often enough closer to a horror movie in which, just around the next corner, another nightmare is readying itself to leap out and scare you to death.  Maybe it's not what you really want to see, but once it starts, you can't take your eyes off it.  And that's the point. Unfortunately, none of this is actually a horror movie.  When these all-too-real events loom so much larger than life and without context, they seem to trigger panic, fear, even hysteria, and a profound sense of endangerment in many Americans; they create, that is, a vision of how the world works and of its dangers that bears little relationship to the place we actually live. Someday someone will surely figure out how to create a panic, fear, and hysteria, or PFH, index (in a world where nothing should be without its acronym) to measure the effects of this phenomenon.  One way to gauge it in the meantime is via opinion polls.  In the week after the San Bernardino coverage, for instance, the number of Americans who expressed satisfaction with the way things are going in this country took a ""rare"" seven percentage point nosedive, according to a Gallup poll.  Similarly, a New York Times/CBS News poll found that, in the wake of those shootings, 19% of Americans now believed that ""the threat of terrorism [is] the top issue facing the country.""  Only 4% had a month earlier. Another obvious measure, at least when it comes to mass shootings, is gun sales.  After San Bernardino and the usual apocalyptic coverage, Americans once again flocked to gun stores to arm themselves. Sales of firearms soared (as did the stock prices of gun makers). Consider the irony of this.  Despite the millions of Americans now ""carrying"" and the many millions more with guns in their homes, I doubt that an armed citizen has made any difference in any major mass shooting incident.  Instead, what all those weapons stored in homes ensure is further death and tragedy-to-come, as any grasp of the true dangers of American life would suggest: new suicides, new wife and girlfriend killings, new toddler shootings, and of course more weaponry potentially available for new mass shootings. For all of this, the media now bears a certain unacknowledged responsibility.  Above all, single-event news throws our American world -- and particularly its dangers -- out of whack, while playing into irrational fears and prejudices.  It helps create news of its own in an increasingly unbalanced country.  What it doesn't offer is perspective. Now, it's true that such 24/7 screen experiences are hardly a new phenomenon.  I remember well, for instance, the day that President Kennedy was assassinated.  I was a college student, sitting in a hole-in-the-wall burger joint when someone stuck his head in the door and said, ""The president's been shot.""  And I can remember us all later gathered in disbelief around a television set in the basement of our dorm -- there were so many fewer screens then -- to watch that 24/7 version of the news.  But the occasions on which such things happened were so rare as to be unforgettable. Though different people might date the onset of our present in-your-face era of news differently, it first made it onto my radar screen with the bizarre spectacle of the 1994 O.J. Simpson ""low-speed"" car chase.  It proved that, with the right elements -- in this case, a black former Hall of Fame football star and movie actor accused of killing his white wife -- you could glue eyes to any kind of onscreen inanity, including cars creeping along a highway for an hour.  You could even draw viewers to ""the news"" from major televised sports events.  It would prove a potentially winning formula for the onrushing world of cable news.

http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/128432793/0/usatoday-newstopstories~Lowrated-Republicans-stage-happy-hour-debate/,"LAS VEGAS — The four lowest-polling Republican candidates, looking to spark their campaigns headed into a new year, argued Tuesday about how to confront radical extremists, fight the Islamic State — and deal with GOP front-runner Donald Trump. Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and former New York governor George Pataki focused on counter-terrorism during the preliminary debate, which preceded a prime-time event with nine leading GOP candidates. ""The next president is going to be a wartime president, whether they like it or not,"" Graham said during a debate in which he repeatedly condemned the Islamic State, the militant group responsible for the recent attacks in Paris and that inspired the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. Huckabee said Americans have ""lost confidence in our government"" to fight terrorism, and he will restore that trust. Pataki, who cited his experience as New York governor in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, said Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has a weak national defense while Trump wants to target law-abiding Muslims with his proposal to ban them from entering the United States. ""Neither is fit to be president of the United States,"" he said, later describing Trump as ""the know-nothing candidate."" Santorum said ""we have entered World War III,"" and he, too, attacked the foreign policies of Clinton and President Obama as inadequate to dealing with radical Islamic extremists. USA TODAY The most quotable moments from the fifth Republican debate The candidates all criticized Trump's proposed ban on Muslim entry, but to varying degrees. Santorum said Trump was more critical of the Obama administration's ability to properly vet people entering the country. Graham urged Santorum to be more critical of Trump, saying his proposed ban is alienating Muslim nations that the U.S. needs to help fight the Islamic State. Graham also said Republicans should not make it appear that they are criticizing the Muslim religion, as opposed to extremists who abuse it. Huckabee said Trump's plan is unworkable but that he ""touched a nerve"" among fearful Americans; he also said Trump would still be a better president than Clinton. The four candidates also supported, again to varying degrees, increased surveillance powers for government in an effort to uncover potential terrorist attacks. USA TODAY 6 things to watch at the Las Vegas Republican debate As for the Islamic State, Graham, Pataki and Huckabee said the United States needs to send ground troops to move the militant group out of territory it holds in Syria and Iraq. Santorum disagreed, saying the U.S. should only help train local forces to carry the fight on the ground. ""You're not going to win that way, Rick,"" Graham told Santorum, who said the Islamic State actually wants the U.S. to commit troops to another bloody war. (Later in the debate, Santorum accused Graham of being too soft on the subject of illegal immigration.) Graham expressed more vocal support for the idea of U.S. intervention in other countries, including Syria, and at one point said he wished that George W. Bush was still president. Huckabee, however, said the U.S. habit of backing factions in other countries has led to destabilization in Syria, Yemen, Libya and other places. The South Carolina senator also went out of his way to criticize two candidates in the prime-time debate, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul. He described both as ""isolationists"" over their opposition to certain government surveillance programs and to the use of U.S. ground troops to fight the Islamic State. In another exchange, Pataki criticized Santorum for saying he might reverse a new policy allowing women in combat roles. All four Republican candidates in the preliminary debate attacked President Obama's foreign policy, particularly the nuclear deal with Iran and the Syrian refugee program. Time is running out for the four candidates who failed to qualify for the prime-time stage because their poll numbers are so low. The first votes in the Republican presidential nomination contest come Feb. 1 with the Iowa caucuses. Three candidates — Santorum, Graham and Pataki — participated in their fifth consecutive ""happy hour"" debate, having yet to qualify for the main stage at a Republican debate. The fourth candidate, Huckabee, debated in prime time during the first three Republican events but found himself relegated to the preliminary debate last month in Milwaukee. USA TODAY USA TODAY GOP Power Rankings: Cruz the new king, Christie gains ground New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who also participated in last month's undercard, has seen his poll numbers rise in recent weeks in New Hampshire, which hosts the nation's first primary on Feb. 9. That enabled Christie to return to the main stage Tuesday at The Venetian hotel and casino in Las Vegas. Unlike previous debates, CNN, which hosts Tuesday's debates, took into account polling in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire when deciding which candidates would qualify for the prime-time event. Huckabee said before the debate that one reason his numbers fell is that he didn't get much time to answer questions in those main stage debates. ""One good thing about being on the undercard: there's only four of us,"" Huckabee told CNN. ""I think we're going to get more time, more opportunity to answer questions.""

Time is running out for the four candidates who failed to qualify for the prime-time stage because their poll numbers are so low. The first votes in the Republican presidential nomination contest come Feb. 1 with the Iowa caucuses. Three candidates — Santorum, Graham and Pataki — participated in their fifth consecutive ""happy hour"" debate, having yet to qualify for the main stage at a Republican debate. The fourth candidate, Huckabee, debated in prime time during the first three Republican events but found himself relegated to the preliminary debate last month in Milwaukee. USA TODAY USA TODAY GOP Power Rankings: Cruz the new king, Christie gains ground New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who also participated in last month's undercard, has seen his poll numbers rise in recent weeks in New Hampshire, which hosts the nation's first primary on Feb. 9. That enabled Christie to return to the main stage Tuesday at The Venetian hotel and casino in Las Vegas. Unlike previous debates, CNN, which hosts Tuesday's debates, took into account polling in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire when deciding which candidates would qualify for the prime-time event. Huckabee said before the debate that one reason his numbers fell is that he didn't get much time to answer questions in those main stage debates.

http://nypost.com/2015/12/15/common-sense-gun-safety-is-a-scam/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Two days after the massacre in San Bernardino, Marco Rubio said something that most gun-control supporters probably thought was outrageous. The Florida senator, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, told CBS News “none of the major shootings that have occurred in this country over the last few months or years” would have been prevented by the gun laws proposed in response to them. Last week, Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler, asked to investigate Rubio’s statement by a colleague who thought “it was almost certainly incorrect,” discovered that Rubio was right. The implication, which Kessler was too polite to spell out, is that activists and politicians who push legislative responses to mass shootings are either fooling themselves or trying to fool us. The latter seems more likely. President Obama has repeatedly implied that members of Congress have blood on their hands because they refuse to “do something” in response to mass shootings. Yet at a briefing the day after Kessler’s article appeared, White House press secretary Josh Earnest could not cite any mass shootings that might have been stopped by expanded background checks or a federal ban on “assault weapons,” the measures that Obama reflexively proposes after such crimes. Instead, Earnest talked up another policy that would have made no difference: banning gun purchases by people on the federal government’s “no fly” list, none of whom has been linked to a mass shooting. The idea that “assault weapon” bans can prevent mass shootings is clearly a fantasy. The vast majority of guns used in these attacks — 86 percent, according to a tally by Mother Jones — don’t qualify as “assault weapons,” an arbitrary category defined by military-style features such as folding stocks, pistol grips and flash suppressors. Even if a law could magically eliminate the millions of “assault weapons” already in circulation, it would leave plenty of equally lethal alternatives. Banning assault weapons makes even less sense as a response to less newsworthy crimes, which account for about 97 percent of homicides. According to the FBI’s numbers, rifles in general, which include many guns that aren’t considered assault weapons, were used in about 2 percent of homicides last year. There are similar problems with legal limits on magazine size, which Obama also supports. Laws can prohibit new sales but can’t make larger magazines disappear. And as Kessler pointed out, “an experienced shooter . . . can change a magazine in just two to four seconds,” a pause that is unlikely to make a significant difference in attacks on unarmed people. Expanding the federal background-check requirement to cover private gun transfers as well as sales by licensed dealers — another idea favored by Obama — cannot reasonably be expected to have a noticeable impact on mass shootings either. As Kessler noted, the perpetrators of such crimes often have passed background checks, and in any case, rarely have criminal or psychiatric records that would legally disqualify them from buying guns. Furthermore, decreeing that a background check be conducted every time a gun changes hands and making it happen are two very different things. It’s hard to see how such a requirement could be enforced, especially without a national gun registry. Felons who buy guns are already breaking the law, and so are the people who supply them, assuming they know about the buyers’ criminal records. Yet criminals don’t seem to have much trouble arming themselves. Survey data indicates that they generally obtain guns from people they already know or from black-market dealers, sources that would be unimpeded by a new background-check requirement. The “common-sense gun safety laws” touted by the president would impose new restrictions and burdens on law-abiding Americans in exchange for highly uncertain benefits. Especially when considered as responses to mass shootings, which is how the president and his allies present them, these measures make little sense upon calm reflection — something that gun controllers seem eager to prevent by blinding us with blood.

http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2015/12/fact-check-cnn-republican-debate-000009,"iStock The Agenda Our policy reporters truth-squad the Republican debate. 12/15/2015 08:43 PM EST Nine Republican presidential candidates. The fifth debate. Here's POLITICO's analysis of where the Republican field stretched the truth, steered around some inconvenient facts, or just plain got it wrong. Cruz's version of ""carpet-bombing"" is not carpet bombing In describing his plans as commander-in-chief, Ted Cruz said: â[I would use] overwhelming air power to utterly and completely destroy ISIS.... You would carpet bomb where ISIS is -- not a city, but the location of the troops. You'd use air power. You'd have embedded special forces direct the airpower. But the object isn't to level the city â the object is to kill the ISIS terrorists."" His description of is pretty much the opposite of carpet bombing. Those are precision strikes aimed at specific targets â such as recent U.S. strikes against trucks transporting black-market oil for the Islamic State. Carpet bombing denotes indiscriminate attacks targeting a large area, leveling the area as if a carpet had been rolled over it. The tactic was widely used during World War II. â Austin Wright Fiorinaâs claims on Obama Iraq withdrawal ignore Bush role Carly Fiorina faulted President Obama for the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, saying it was âagainst the advice of every single general.â Thatâs not exactly the opinion of the entire brass. Just before his retirement, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Raymond T. Odierno in September
noted that the Iraq withdrawal actually had its roots in an agreement negotiated by the Bush administration. âThat was always the plan, we had promised them that we would respect their sovereignty,â he said then. A number of retired U.S. generals dating back to the mid-2000s, including Wesley Clark and William Nash, had also called for the redeployment of U.S. troops. â Darren Samuelsohn Wyden fact-checks Rubio on surveillance Criticizing Ted Cruzâs vote for the USA Freedom Act, Marco Rubio said the law doesnât give the government any new powers. Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregonâa leading voice on surveillance issues, who sits on the Intelligence Committeeâresponded by issuing a public statement pointing out that Section 102 of the law did expand their powers, by allowing law enforcement and intelligence agencies to obtain records in an emergency and get court approval later. â Isaac Arnsdorf Cruz: Obama toppled Mubarak? Don't tell the Egyptians. Ted Cruz said: âThe Obama administration, encouraged by Republicans, toppled Mubarak, who had been a reliable ally of the United States, of Israel.â Itâs unclear how well Cruz remembers the Arab Spring. Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak only stepped down after 18 days of relentless protests by Egyptians. As the Tahrir Square demonstrations played out on international television, the White House appeared flummoxed by how to respond to the early days of the Arab Spring, and Obama
eventually endorsed his departure. Itâs true that U.S. government-financed organizations promoting democracy âplayed a bigger role in fomenting protestsâ than was immediately clear, according to an April 2011 report in
The New York Times on how the U.S. ânurturedâ the uprisings of the previous few months, based in part on WikiLeaks cables. But the same article notes, âno one doubts that the Arab uprisings are home grown, rather than resulting from âforeign influence,â as alleged by some Middle Eastern leaders.â (For the record, itâs not just Middle Eastern leaders who routinely allude to dark stage-managing by the Americans and the CIA; Vladimir Putin is also a fan of linking upsetting domestic events to the hidden hand of the West.) â Katy O'Donnell Fiorina claims Obama pushed generals out; not quite Carly Fiorina: âOne of the things I would immediately do, in addition to defeating [the terrorists] at home, would be to bring back the warrior class â Petraeus, McChrystal, Mattis, Keane, Flynn. Every one was retired early because they told President Obama things he didnât want to hear.â Not exactly. David Petraeus, who was the commander in Iraq and Afghanistan under Obama, retired from the Army in 2011 when Obama appointed him director of the CIA. (He resigned a year later after news of an extramarital affair and a parallel FBI investigation.) Stanley McChrystal, then the commander in Afghanistan, was relieved and later retired in 2010 after an unscripted interview for a
Rolling Stone magazine profile quoted his aides mocking Vice President Joe Biden. And Jack Keane, who served as vice chief of staff of the Army, retired in 2003, when Obama was still an Illinois state senator, years from the presidency. Two that do fit her narrative a bit better are James Mattis, who retired as head of U.S., Central Command in 2013 after 44 years in the Marine Corps and has since said the U.S. was suffering from âstrategic atrophy,"" and Michael Flynn, an Army lieutenant general, who retired a year early in 2014 after questioning the Obama administration narrative that the terrorist threat was under control following the 2011 killing of Osama bin Laden. â Bryan Bender Chris Christie and the King Trying to assert his foreign policy chops, Christie laid out what he'd say to King Hussein of Jordan. Hussein died in 1999. The king of Jordan is his son, Abdullah. â Isaac Arnsdorf Rand, U.S. terrorists aren't just immigrants Rand Paul said: âEvery terrorist attack weâve had since 9/11 has been [from] legal immigration.â Not quite. Major Nidal Hasan, the U.S. Army psychiatrist convicted of killing 13 people in 2009 at Fort Hood, was an American, born in Arlington, VA. Was that a ""terrorist attack""? Republicans at the time pilloried the Obama administration for appearing to waffle over labeling the mass shooting as terrorismâPentagon officials used the administrationâs âworkplace violenceâ classification in an argument anticipating a âfair trialâ appealâbut President Obama this month referred to the shooting in a speech about terrorism. And while San Bernardino attacker Syed Farookâs fellow shooter and wife was an immigrant born in Pakistan, Farook himself was born in the United States,
according to the Council on American-Islamic relations. â Katy O'Donnell Kasich gets ahead of himself on encryption John Kasich stated confidently that the San Bernardino attackers cloaked their communications with encryption technology, preventing law enforcement from monitoring them. Authorities havenât yet shown any evidence to support that. Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.)
asked the Justice Department to provide any evidence it may have. â Isaac Arnsdorf Cruz conflates Obama and Clinton's Syrian refugee plans Ted Cruz lumped President Obama and Hillary Clinton together in their plans to deal with the humanitarian crisis in Syria, saying both Democrats âpropose bringing tens of thousands of Syrian refugees to this country.â While Cruz is right that Clinton has called for the U.S. to accept up to 65,000 refugees, heâs conflating hers with the plan thatâs actually coming out of the White House. Obamaâs plan is really much more limited; In September, he directed his administration to raise the number of Syrian refugees admitted to at least 10,000 for fiscal year 2016. Itâs an increase from 2,000 in FY '15, but not quite of the magnitude Cruz labeled it. â Darren Samuelsohn Cruz, the FBI can't vet refugees? Sure it can. Sen. Ted Cruz said, âThe head of the FBI told Congress that we cannot vet these refugees.â Thatâs not exactly right. The federal government has developed a
significant vetting process for refugees that requires in-person interviews and can take years. When FBI director James Comey testified before Congress in November, he told them something different: âIf we donât know much about somebody, there wonât be anything in our data,â he
said. âI canât sit here and offer anybody an absolute assurance that thereâs no risk associated with this.â So yes, the FBI can vet refugees. What it can't do is guarantee vetting will sort out all the bad guys. â Danny Vinik Trump: tens of thousands of people with ISIS on their cellphones? CNN delivered on speculation that it would kick off the cage match by taking on Donald Trumpâs proposal to ban Muslim immigration. Trump responded with warnings of âtens of thousands of people having cell phones with ISIS flags on them.â Who are they? He seems to referencing a report circulating in
European and
right-wing press, which said that police found hundreds of Syrian refugees with images of executions and beheadings on their phones. Even if those reports are true, Trumpâs figure is off by several orders of magnitude. â Isaac Arnsdorf And one from the undercard... Huckabee, the US can't replace Saudi oil. Mike Huckabee said at the undercard Republican presidential debate that the U.S. should become ""the energy exporter to the world and take the weaponry out of the hands of the Russians, the Iranians and the Saudis by taking their money away, and let America become the number one energy exporter to the entire world."" But even if Congress passes a measure currently under consideration to end the 40-year-old ban on crude oil exports, experts say the amount of oil that would flow from U.S. fields to the world market would be little more than a trickle. Charles Ebinger, the Brookings Institution senior fellow who co-wrote a 2014 report on lifting the oil export ban, said at current prices, U.S. oil producers might hike their output by about 100,000 barrels per day. That's less two-tenths of a percent of the total world production of 93 million barrels per day. âTo think that weâre going to see a flood of crude oil exports in this market is pretty much pie in the sky,â

http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2015/12/5_takeaways_from_the_republica.html," Gallery: 2016 GOP presidential candidates debate in Las Vegas With less than two months left before primary season kicks off, Republican presidential candidates met in Las Vegas late-Tuesday for the party's fifth debate of the 2016 election cycle. The top nine polling GOP White House hopefuls took the stage for the prime time event hosted by CNN and Salem Radio from the Venetian casino, while four lower polling candidates went head-to-head in an earlier debate. With many of the 2016 presidential candidates having focused on the issue of terrorism following the recent terror attacks in Paris and a mass shooting in California that's being investigated as a possible act of terrorism, much of the prime time debate revolved around national security. It also touched on issues like immigration - a subject which Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump recently drew criticism over after calling to temporarily halt Muslims from entering the U.S., as well as border security and government surveillance. CNN Political Anchor Wolf Blitzer moderated the event, which Ayla Brown, the daughter of former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, opened by sining the national anthem. Jeb Bush said Trump is a ""chaos candidate"" and would be a ""chaos president,"" if elected to the White House. The former Florida governor took issue with Trump's Muslim immigration proposal, saying the country should focus on destroying the so-called Islamic State over denying Syrian refugees from entering the country. Bush questioned how the U.S. will get Muslims to join a coalition to fight ISIS if it doesn't allow them into its borders. He called Trump's plan ""not a serious proposal,"" adding that it will push Muslims away at a time the U.S. needs their help. ""Donald is great at the one liners, but he is a chaos candidate, and he would be a chaos president,"" Bush said. ""He would not be the commander-in-chief we need to keep our country safe."" The former governor added that ""leadership is not about not attacking people and disparaging people."" Trump, who defended his Muslim and other immigration proposals as being about national security - not religion or other issues, attributed Bush's criticism to his campaign's lag in the polls. ""Nobody cares,"" the businessman said. Bush again blasted Trump for complaining about the debate questions, suggesting that if the businessman believes them to be too tough, he'll have a rough time as president. Trump, in a brief heated exchange with the former Florida governor, pointed to his place in the polls compared to Bush's. Businesswoman Carly Fiorina also took jabs at Trump, saying America needs solutions, not an ""entertainer to throw out soundbites that draw media attention."" U.S. Sen Rand Paul, R-Ky., meanwhile, questioned Trump's seriousness as a candidate and asked would-be supporters of the businessman to examine whether or not the believe in the Constitution. Candidates offered different takes on how they would combat ISIS. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, argued that if elected president he would use overwhelming air power ""to utterly and completely destroy ISIS,"" including employing several airstrikes per day. He called the Obama Administration's current amount of daily air bombings in ISIS-controlled areas ""photo-op foreign policy."" Criticizing Cruz's focus on bombing ISIS, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., called for a propaganda campaign to show show what life is really like under ISIS. Trump, meanwhile, said the U.S. needs to be tougher than its been in combatting terrorist threats. The businessman said he would be ""very firm"" with families of suspected terrorists and consider executing them to send a message to others looking to commit such crimes. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson said he'd listen to the advice of military experts and support additional troops on the ground if it's what's needed to keep America safe. Candidates took aim at what they called ""political correctness."" Stressing that America is at war, Carson said the country needs to do away with its culture of political correctness if it wants to keep people safe. ""If there are a lot of people engaging there in radicalizing activities, then we need to be suspicious of it, we need to get rid of all this P.C. stuff,"" he said. ""This is craziness."" The retired neurosurgeon cautioned that groups like ISIS could exploit America's P.C. attitude to its advantage. The country, he added, won't be cured by its political correctness or timidity and asked Congress to declare war on ISIS. Cruz also blasted political correctness, saying that because politicians are too afraid to draw criticism they are putting the American people at risk. He pointed to the Obama Administration's monitoring of everyone's cell phones and emails not just those of suspected threats. ""Political correctness is killing people,"" the Texas senator said. Paul took jabs at Chris Christie's ""Bridgegate"" scandal. Raising concerns over the New Jersey governor's claim that he would shoot down a Russian plane in a Syrian no-fly zone, Paul argued that Christie is the candidate for those in favor of World War III and referenced his connection to a scandal involving lane closures on the George Washington bridge. ""We need to confront Russia from a position of strength, but we don't need to confront Russia from a point of recklessness that would lead to war,"" Paul said. ""It's having that type of judgement - who you appoint and how you're going to conduct affairs that is incredibly important. ""I think when we think about the judgement of someone who might want to World War III, we might think about someone who might shut down a bridge because they don't like their friends."" Trump said he will stay in the Republican Party and not wage a White House run as an independent candidate. Despite recent assertions that he may leave the GOP and run for president as an independent candidate, Trump affirmed that he will remain in the Republican Party. ""I am totally committed to the Republican Party, I feel very honored to be the front-runner and I think I'll do very well if I'm chosen - if I'm so fortunate to be chosen, I think I'll do very well"" he said. ""Polls have come out recently say I'd beat Hillary, I would do everything in my power to beat Hillary Clinton."" Carson, who has also alluded to leaving the GOP following reports of a possible ""brokered convention,"" meanwhile, said he has spoken to party leaders and been assured that they are not going to ""thwart the will of the people.""

http://www.ibtimes.com/are-movie-theaters-safe-exhibitors-plan-show-force-star-wars-security-2226822,"Movie theaters are taking security seriously for ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" – even Darth Vader won't be allowed in. It's true: The major chains are asking fans to leave their masks, lightsabers or anything resembling a weapon at home. Theater chains are beefing up security in advance of the opening of the latest installment of ""Star Wars"" on Thursday night. The most visible change will be a literal show of force: Visible armed guards will be posted at multiplexes across the country, a response to increased concern about so-called soft targets in the wake of terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California. Theaters have been on edge since 2012 when a mass shooting at a multiplex in Aurora, Colorado, killed 12 people and injured 70 others, and then two more shootings in Tennessee and Louisiana in 2015. But this week's release of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is expected to bring millions of fans to U.S. theaters; major chains are adding shows at 2 a.m., 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. “Theaters have doubled security across the board over the past couple weeks,” said Tom DeLuca, owner of Global Security Services, which provides security personnel to more than 200 AMC, Regal and Cinemark cinemas. “Our big mantra is deterrence through high visibility, meaning when you walk into a theater and buy your ticket you see an armed man or woman with law enforcement or military training. People find that comforting.” AMC, Regal and Cinemark theaters have banned “Star Wars” fans from wearing masks, face paint or bringing simulated weapons (including blasters) to any movie showings. Cinemark and Regal will prohibit lightsabers. AMC will allow lightsabers but has asked that fans turn them off during the movie. DeLuca estimated that when “Star Wars” premieres, a busy theater in the heart of Manhattan will have eight trained security guards carrying sidearms at all times, while a smaller theater area in a rural area might only have a team of two personnel on duty. In some communities, local police will be involved. ""We will have an increased police presence monitoring theaters in the area,"" Diana Cooley, spokeswoman for the Aurora, Colorado, police department, said. James Holmes killed 12 people during a showing of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" in that city in 2012. Police in Aurora also increased security following theater shootings earlier this year. Part of the rationale for that visibility approach is based on the notion that terrorists and would-be criminals survey a potential target before an attack. “Typically you have one or two guards, either armed or unarmed, on duty. But now they might have three or four guarding the front and back entrances,” said Mark Lerner, CEO of Epic Security, which provides guards and security services in the New York City area. “No one is looking for a shootout. Our clients are looking to not have an incident, rather than an incident and security wins.” But beyond the show of force, actual security procedures such as bag checks are expected to remain unchanged. Regal Cinemas announced in August that it would begin checking customers' bags after shootings in Louisiana and Tennessee. But it’s not clear how often Regal moviegoers are screened, if at all, and DeLuca said the number of theaters that carry out bag checks in 2015 is minimal. Regal, AMC, Cinemark, Carmike and Marcus theaters did not respond to a request for comment on this story. “The movie theater is a place of comfort. When I was a kid I used to go there with my friends as a safe place to escape adults for two hours, and if you walk in and see metal detectors it becomes another one of those things we all hate,” DeLuca said, adding that AMC Theatres lost revenue when customers went through additional screening after 9/11. “Across the board, the response is that patrons feel good about security now.” One in every 3 U.S. moviegoers said they believe metal detectors and armed guards should be in theater lobbies, according to a study from the research firm C4 conducted days after a shooter killed two people at a Louisiana showing of “Trainwreck.” But only 13 percent of those respondents said they’d be willing to pay an additional $3 that would come with another layer of security. Metal detectors are almost never used at the movies, in part because of an annual $200,000 to $1 million in estimated operating costs, depending on the size of the theater. The U.S. saw 351 mass shootings, defined as ""a case in which four or more people are killed or injured by gunfire in a single event, with a killed or injured perpetrator also counting in the tally,"" over a period of 334 days as of Nov. 30, according to previous reporting in International Business Times. Since 2013, there have been more than 1,000 mass shootings in the United States. Compare that to the 611,105 Americans who died of heart disease, or the 32,719 people who died in motor vehicle crashes in 2013 alone. “I don’t think move theaters are any different from any other place where people congregate in terms of risk,” said Sherry Towers, an Arizona State University researcher who found that 20 to 30 percent of all mass shootings trigger a copycat crime, in part because of the national spotlight. “The media may be overblowing the risk of going to a movie theater compared to dying in any other number of ways that day.”"
http://www.ibtimes.com/los-angeles-2024-olympics-security-concern-officials-amid-global-terror-threats-2228042,"With the Los Angeles community still reeling from terror attacks in nearby San Bernardino, California less than two weeks ago, bid officials leading the campaign hoping to bring the 2024 Olympics to L.A. said security was a focus for the committee. Officials with the bid group called LA 2024 said Tuesday they have begun to form plans to keep the proposed sporting event safe. ""It’s something we’ve given a lot of thought to,"" LA 2024 CEO Gene Sykes said, according to Sporting News. ""We’ve actually worked closely to get help from city and state and county officials who deal with security and we actually will take some steps that we’ll be ready to announce in the next several weeks that will reflect the kinds of things that we expect to do. It’s obviously a very high priority for us."" The increased focus on security comes after a Dec. 2 mass shooting in San Bernardino that killed 14 people. The suspected shooters in the terror attack in the city about an hour outside of L.A. were purportedly inspired by ISIS.

Paul Chapman reports. Video Transcript: The Republicans' last debate of the year in Las Vegas was a lively affair in a city famed for heavyweight boxing matches. Donald Trump came under fire from some of his rivals, some of whom afterwards blamed the media for giving him the spotlight as former New York Governor George Pataki did. ""The more outrageous and stupid things he says the more media attention he gets and it's impacting the race."" ""I know that all of you think you're journalists but you're run by a business and the business is there to make money and Donald Trump makes you all money so that's why you're talking about him,"" said former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum. Trump clashed sharply during a debate on national security with Jeb Bush who called him a 'chaos candidate'. Afterwards Trump brushed off the criticism, saying Bush was having a tough time in the polls. ""You know, I really enjoyed this evening. I think Jeb tries very hard. He's having a hard time, let's face it."" Trump's caused outrage with some of his presidential campaign comments, including a proposal to stop Muslims entering the U.S. after the San Bernadino mass shooting by a Muslim couple."

http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/16/chicago-christian-wheaton-college-suspends-professor-wearing-headscarf,"Larycia Hawkins, associate professor at Wheaton College, placed on leave after saying she’d wear a hijab as demonstration of ‘human solidarity’ with Muslims Last modified on Fri 14 Jul 2017 21.21 BST A Christian college in Chicago has suspended a tenured professor who has been wearing a headscarf to show solidarity with Muslims, a decision she said was made as part of her Christian Advent worship and has prompted “pushback almost exclusively from other Christians”. Last week, Larycia Hawkins, an associate professor of political science at Wheaton College, announced her decision to wear a hijab as a demonstration of “human solidarity” with Muslims, in the wake of the recent mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, which authorities said was inspired by Islamist terrorists.  “I stand in human solidarity with my Muslim neighbor because we are formed of the same primordial clay, descendants of the same cradle of humankind,” she posted on Facebook. “I stand in religious solidarity with Muslims because they, like me, a Christian, are people of the book.” But the comments made by the 43-year-old generated confusion at Wheaton’s campus about “complex theological matters”, the college asserted in a statement last Friday. And, it continued, some Christians may have interpreted Hawkins’ remarks as a failure to “reflect the distinctively Christian theological identity of Wheaton College”. As a result of Hawkins’ comments, Wheaton, a private evangelical liberal arts college in Chicago’s west suburbs, placed the professor on administrative leave, pending a review the college said she’s entitled to receive as a tenured faculty member. The college declined a request for comment but in a statement issued on Wednesday, Wheaton president Dr Philip Ryken said it has “no stated position” on whether headscarves can be worn “as a gesture of care and concern for those in Muslim or other religious communities that may face discrimination or persecution”. “We support the protection of all Americans including the right to the free exercise of religion, as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States,” Ryken said. Hawkins, who did not respond to requests for comment, told the Chicago Tribune she planned to don the hijab everywhere until Christmas. The US is currently dealing with “real vitriolic rhetoric by fellow Christians, sometimes, and people who aren’t Christians who conflate all Muslims with terrorists – and that saddens me – so this is a way of saying if all women wear the hijab we cannot discriminate,” Hawkins told the newspaper. Prior to her decision, Hawkins sought the advice of the Council on American Islamic Relations (Cair) chapter in Chicago, to ensure it wasn’t offensive for a non-Muslim to wear the hijab. Hawkins and a staff member at the Cair office had an informal discussion, and “he supported the idea, as do we officially”, Rehab said. “It speaks really to her sense of compassion and integrity as a human being,” executive director Ahmed Rehab told the Guardian. Hawkins was confident her decision fell in line with her understanding of the religion, Rehab said, “but it turns out that others within the Christian tradition felt that this was out of bounds, unfortunately”. “We’re dismayed by [Wheaton’s] decision,” he said, “because essentially it is an act of human solidarity meant to be rooted in theological compassion – to stand with students, Muslim students at Wheaton and elsewhere who are the victims of this current backlash of Islamophobia and anti-Muslim bigotry.” Rehab said the reasoning of Hawkins’ decision was clear. “She’s walking a mile in someone else’s shoes,” he said, and it was rooted in Christian theology of compassion. “Anyone who disagrees with that,” he continued, “I would ask them why? Why they believe Christianity should be non-compassionate, and why they would differ with this Christian woman and her understanding. I’d love to hear an answer to that.” Students at Wheaton drew attention last week in an open letter decrying statements by Liberty University president Jerry Falwell Jr that students armed with firearms could “end those Muslims”. The letter called on evangelical Christian leaders to condemn Falwell’s remarks. On Wednesday, they demanded Hawkins’ reinstatement and launched a social media campaign under the hashtag #ReinstateDocHawk. The headline on this article was amended on 16 November 2015 to reflect that Hawkins’s comments, not her decision to wear a hijab, lead to her being placed on leave."

HUNTINGTON BEACH – Without warning a gunman rushed Wednesday morning into the Huntington Beach City Council Chambers, pointed a pistol at more than 100 people seated inside and barked out a threat. “Everyone is going to die,” the assailant snarled. But the crowd wasn’t frightened. A few even smiled. Then they began pelting the shooter with weapons at the ready, including water bottles, pens, shoes and an electrical outlet cord. Suddenly, three burly men rushed from the audience, tackled the gunman, pinned him to the floor and quickly took his weapon away. The self-defense reenactment by Huntington Beach police for more than 400 city workers Tuesday and Wednesday provided a twist to the “run, hide and fight” training making the rounds in workplaces across Orange County following the San Bernardino mass shooting. The large turnout for the 90-minute sessions demonstrate that city workers want to take precautions against workplace violence, said Sgt. David Dereszynski, training unit supervisor for the Huntington Beach Police Department. “People definitely see the need (for training),” he said. “They want to protect themselves and their fellow workers.” The sessions, which featured several instructional videos and basic training in fashioning a tourniquet out of clothing items, seemed to make some city workers more comfortable in their ability to handle a mass shooting. “It was very informative,” Dennis Thompson, an employee with the beach maintenance department, said. “I got a lot out of it.” It’s unfortunate that such training is needed, but being prepared for workplace violence is a new reality, Thompson added. “It’s a change of the times,” he said.

http://blog.cleveland.com/letters/2015/12/nra_letter_to_the_editor_5.html,"Every time there is a shooting, a mass shooting, or any other gun violence, the politicians, NRA, gun manufacturers and lobbyists immediately refuse to discuss any changes to our present gun legislation on the grounds it will infringe on our Second Amendment rights. Seriously? The manufacture and sale of firearms legally or otherwise is a billion-dollar industry. Nearly 35 Americans killed every day by gun violence is the cost of doing business. The right to bear arms was intended to prevent the federal government from seizing privately and legally owned arms from citizens, in order to disarm any state militia. It was not intended to allow every maladjusted, malcontented miscreant or fanatic with an ax to grind to walk around with an assault rifle and 1,000 rounds of ammunition. The objection to even the most reasonable gun legislation changes has very little to do with the Second Amendment and everything to do with the bottom line.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/derrick-de-lise/courageous-conversation-w_b_8797294.html,"Author. Advocate. William ""Bill"" Lindsey Dealing with a LGBTQIA+ identity within any of the segments of Christianity is rarely, if ever, easy. There are an ever-growing number of writers publically addressing the dissonance many feel within the church and how queerness can affect one's faith journey. This is a part of a series of profiles of those courageous people furthering the conversation. William ""Bill"" Lindsey is a theologian ""who writes about the interplay of belief and culture."" Bill and his husband of forty-four years, Steve, have shared a life celebrating ""the amazing grace we find in our journey together and love for each other. We live in hope; we remain on pilgrimage. Q: Could you describe how your faith journey has been impacted by your LGBTQIA+ identification? A: I think that when LGBTQIA+ people come to terms with their real identities -- usually, as the result of struggle -- their lives become more real. The life of faith is also in and of itself a constant struggle to live in the world of reality. Accepting one's sexual orientation makes the spiritual journey more real, for those interested in pursuing such a journey. Q: What would advice would you give to your younger self? A: Live with eyes wide open. Q: In what areas do you hope your work will most help others? A: I'm particularly concerned with the way in which misuse of religious ideas and texts harms LGBTQIA+ young people. I'd like to make a difference for those young people, to make their way easier than it was for many people of my generation. Q: What were some of the unexpected hurdles you faced in your work? A: As an openly gay and partnered (now married) theologian, I've found that Christian institutions, and the universities they sponsor, are capable of brutal and immoral treatment towards LGBTQIA+ employees. It's not merely the discrimination and lack of job protection, it is also the willingness to violate the most basic of moral norms -- e.g., speaking the truth -- on the part of leaders in these institutions, when they're dealing with LGBTQIA+ folks. [Which sometimes leads them to] denying our rights, and in many cases lying about us or to us. Q: What were some of the unexpected benefits you accrued after you started your blog, Bilgrimage? A: I felt less alone in my life journey, my spiritual journey. I discovered that there are many others on a similar journey, and they're found all over the world. Q: What would you most like to celebrate, at the end of next year, as your accomplishment? A: I think we are at a perilous political moment in the U.S. when the scales could easily tip in the direction of an overt fascism that will have horrible consequences for LGBTQIA+. If the 2016 elections do not turn out to be as dismal as I'm anticipating after the Paris attacks and the San Bernadino mass shooting, I'll feel I (and many others) will have accomplished something. Q: Who is your role model? Why? A: I'm not sure I can pinpoint a single person. I'm drawn to intelligent, passionate, committed people who use their gifts to reach out to others on the margins. I think of people like Bayard Rustin, for instance. I have long been attracted to his ideal of being an angelic troublemaker in my local community. Q: Can you describe for me what you achievement you're most proud of? A: I received little encouragement from my parents to obtain a good education. Part of the problem, I now see looking back, was that my parents were torn regarding questions of my gender ""presentation."" I was a shy, bookish boy who excelled in school, and they wanted -- my father, in particular, wanted -- a more typical ""mannish"" son. Encouraging me to obtain a good education worked against the ideal of ""making a man"" of me, I think. And so I'm particularly proud that, against the odds and without parental support, I won a full-tuition scholarship to college, and received a Ph.D. and M.A. in theology from the University of St. Michael's College, an M.A. in English from Tulane University, and a B.A. in English from Loyola, New Orleans. Q: Why did you decide to publically proclaim yourself a gay Christian? A: To be honest, I'm not sure I made that decision. I think in many ways it has been made for me by something beyond my control that traditional faith language would call Spirit. I struggle to be faithful to a vocation handed to me against my will, in many ways. Q: How do you feel changing technology has impacted your work? A: The Internet age makes it possible for us to connect instantly to others sharing journeys similar to our own. Technology also levels the playing field for people whose vocation is writing and teaching. The academy has long been skewed in the direction of powerful heterosexual males. They were the ones who got access to secretarial assistance early in their careers. LGBTQIA+ scholars have seldom had access to such privilege and assistance. Having a computer levels the playing field, since it's like having an instant secretary at one's fingertips, as one writes, researches, revises. Q: What would you recommend to someone just starting on his or her faith journey? A: Seek the ground. Seek to be true to yourself. Seek to keep your feet on the ground. Q: Do you have any tips or advice on prayer? If so, what are they? A: Prayer is hard. I'm not sure that I always I know how to do it. I think the goal of prayer is to be in contact with -- at rest in -- one's deepest self, and then to open the door of that self to the Spirit. Q: What is the most effective way, in your experience, to help people overcome anti- LGBTQIA+ attitudes? A: I think that every LGBTQIA+ who lives a ""normal,"" fulfilled, open, unashamed life becomes a living witness to the fact that LGBTQIA+ are human in the very same way everyone else in the world is human. Q: How has your family been with regards to both your LGBTQIA+ status and your public life? A: My immediate family has been anything but supportive. I have family members in my wider family circle who are wonderful, loving, accepting and including people. Those are the family ties on which I rely and which I celebrate. I encourage you to read some of William Lindsey's work on his blog. Author. Advocate."

http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2015/12/17/San-Bernardino-weapon-supplier-to-be-criminally-charged-by-federal-authorities/5531450358900/,"SAN BERNARDINO, Calif., Dec. 17 (UPI) -- A friend of accused San Bernardino terrorist Syed Farook was charged Thursday with conspiracy for allegedly acquiring and selling two rifles that police say were used in the Southern California rampage earlier this month.
Enrique Marquez, Jr., who previously lived next door to Farook, faces a federal charge of conspiring to lend material support to terrorists. He also faces a count of making false statements to authorities about the firearms and an unrelated count of immigration fraud in connection to his marriage to a Russian national.

The 37-page criminal complaint, filed with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California Thursday, say Marquez colluded to provide weapons, explosives and even personnel.
Marquez, 24, previously admitted that in 2012 he purchased two semiautomatic AR-15 assault rifles -- weapons that investigators say were used by Farook and his Pakistani wife, Tashfeen Malik, to kill 14 people during a shooting rampage at a San Bernardino social services center on Dec. 2.
RELATED Sanders passes 2 million campaign contributionsRELATED San Bernardino weapon supplier linked through marriage; could face charges
Officials say Marquez bought the weapons as a favor to Farook, who said he didn't want to be on a gun registry.

While the conspiracy charge doesn't specifically accuse Marquez of having any advanced knowledge of the San Bernardino plot, FBI investigators said he and Farook did acquire the firearms with the intent of carrying out some type of violent attack -- which they allegedly began discussing in 2011.
""Mr. Marquez conspired with Mr. Farook to commit vicious attacks,"" U.S. Atty. Eileen M. Decker said. ""His prior purchase of the firearms and ongoing failure to warn authorities about Farook's intent to commit mass murder had fatal consequences.""
RELATED New York prisons to eliminate disciplinary food item
One potential terror plot the men discussed, officials said, involved nearby Riverside City College and another would take place on a busy Southern California freeway during rush hour, the Los Angeles Times reported.
During questioning, federal authorities said Marquez admitted to discussing the plots and added great detail in how they would be carried out.
Officials have said Marquez is cooperating with investigators. If convicted, Marquez faces up to 35 years in federal prison.
A licensed dealer is required for any firearm transfer and authorities have found no documents showing Marquez legally passed on the weapons.
The court documents filed Thursday also added new public details to the San Bernardino attack.

Prior to the shooting, investigators say Farook attended a company holiday party at the Inland Regional Center. After abut 90 minutes, he placed an item on a table in a conference room and left. That item was later found to be an improvised explosive device. The affidavit says Farook and his wife returned about 20 minutes later and started shooting.
Authorities said Marquez admitted that he and Farook had reviewed instructions how to make IEDs from an al Qaeda militant magazine.
Several people who knew Marquez personally have said he was known for his shy and friendly demeanor -- a claim supported, incidentally, by an unrelated ""feel good"" news report by KTLA-TV in April that features an interview with a seemingly friendly and mild-mannered Marquez. In the report, Marquez talks about his part in saving a friend's dog who had been bitten by a rattlesnake.
""Enrique wasn't a violent kid. He wasn't a tough guy ...That's what's spooky about it,"" said Jerry Morgan, a bar manager who has known Marquez for years.
""People felt comfortable around him.""

Non-partisan audit in Wisconsin finds no widespread fraud in 2020 election
 Oct. 22 (UPI) -- Independent auditors determined there was no widespread fraud in the 2020 election in Wisconsin but made dozens of recommendations for new rules Friday. SAN BERNARDINO, Calif., Dec. 17 (UPI) -- A friend of accused San Bernardino terrorist Syed Farook was charged Thursday with conspiracy for allegedly acquiring and selling two rifles that police say were used in the Southern California rampage earlier this month. Enrique Marquez, Jr., who previously lived next door to Farook, faces a federal charge of conspiring to lend material support to terrorists. He also faces a count of making false statements to authorities about the firearms and an unrelated count of immigration fraud in connection to his marriage to a Russian national.
Advertisement The 37-page criminal complaint, filed with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California Thursday, say Marquez colluded to provide weapons, explosives and even personnel. Marquez, 24, previously admitted that in 2012 he purchased two semiautomatic AR-15 assault rifles -- weapons that investigators say were used by Farook and his Pakistani wife, Tashfeen Malik, to kill 14 people during a shooting rampage at a San Bernardino social services center on Dec. 2.
RELATED Sanders passes 2 million campaign contributions Officials say Marquez bought the weapons as a favor to Farook, who said he didn't want to be on a gun registry.
Advertisement While the conspiracy charge doesn't specifically accuse Marquez of having any advanced knowledge of the San Bernardino plot, FBI investigators said he and Farook did acquire the firearms with the intent of carrying out some type of violent attack -- which they allegedly began discussing in 2011. ""Mr. Marquez conspired with Mr. Farook to commit vicious attacks,"" U.S. Atty. Eileen M. Decker said. ""His prior purchase of the firearms and ongoing failure to warn authorities about Farook's intent to commit mass murder had fatal consequences.""
RELATED New York prisons to eliminate disciplinary food item One potential terror plot the men discussed, officials said, involved nearby Riverside City College and another would take place on a busy Southern California freeway during rush hour, the Los Angeles Times reported. During questioning, federal authorities said Marquez admitted to discussing the plots and added great detail in how they would be carried out. Officials have said Marquez is cooperating with investigators. If convicted, Marquez faces up to 35 years in federal prison. A licensed dealer is required for any firearm transfer and authorities have found no documents showing Marquez legally passed on the weapons. The court documents filed Thursday also added new public details to the San Bernardino attack.
Advertisement Prior to the shooting, investigators say Farook attended a company holiday party at the Inland Regional Center. After abut 90 minutes, he placed an item on a table in a conference room and left. That item was later found to be an improvised explosive device. The affidavit says Farook and his wife returned about 20 minutes later and started shooting. Authorities said Marquez admitted that he and Farook had reviewed instructions how to make IEDs from an al Qaeda militant magazine. Several people who knew Marquez personally have said he was known for his shy and friendly demeanor -- a claim supported, incidentally, by an unrelated ""feel good"" news report by KTLA-TV in April that features an interview with a seemingly friendly and mild-mannered Marquez. In the report, Marquez talks about his part in saving a friend's dog who had been bitten by a rattlesnake. ""Enrique wasn't a violent kid. He wasn't a tough guy ...That's what's spooky about it,"" said Jerry Morgan, a bar manager who has known Marquez for years. ""People felt comfortable around him."""
http://www.ibtimes.com/who-enrique-marquez-san-bernardino-syed-farook-neighbor-faces-criminal-charges-2230179,"UPDATE, Dec. 17, 6:30 p.m. EST:  Enrique Marquez, a friend of San Bernardino, California, shooter Syed Rizwan Farook, was arrested Thursday. The 24-year-old man is accused of purchasing two of the semiautomatic rifles used by Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, to kill 14 people Dec. 2. Marquez faces federal charges of providing material support to terrorists; of making a false statement in connection with the acquisition of firearms, and of immigration fraud. He is not charged with having advance knowledge of the plot. Original story: A man who allegedly purchased the assault rifles used in the San Bernardino, California, mass shooting could face criminal charges, NBC News reported Thursday. Enrique Marquez, 24, legally purchased the rifles from an authorized gun dealer in 2011 and 2012, but he could face legal problems because there was no record of any transfer of the weapons from him to Syed Rizwan Farook or Farook's wife, Tashfeen Malik, the radical Muslim couple who carried out the Dec. 2 attack on a social services office in California, killing 14 people. It's unclear what charges Marquez may face, though they could be linked to terrorism. The charges could be filed as early as Thursday, NBC News reported. Marquez told investigators he purchased the guns for Farook, his former neighbor, after he claimed he would not pass a background check, the Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday. Marquez allegedly knew Farook was planning a different attack in 2011 or 2012 that was never carried out. He talked to investigators after waiving his right to have an attorney present. ""I think the guy is definitely facing some serious potential problems,"" UC Hastings law professor Rory Little, a former federal prosecutor, told the Los Angeles Times. ""The idea that he is talking to them without a lawyer makes everybody gasp."" #BREAKING Criminal charges expected today for Enrique Marquez, ex-neighbor of San Bernardino shooters! @news965wdbo pic.twitter.com/DxKfKHB6Bd  Under California law, it's illegal to transfer ownership of a firearm from one person to another without involving a registered gun dealer. The dealer is required to hold the weapon while the buyer undergoes a background check by state officials. Failing to do so is a misdemeanor offense. Farook and Marquez were apparently close friends, and Marquez eventually converted to Islam and married a member of Farook's extended family, a Russian emigre. Farook and his wife were allegedly supporters of the Islamic State group based in Syria and Iraq."
