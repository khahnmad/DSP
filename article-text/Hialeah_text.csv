19550224,2010-06-07 14:51:49,Cumbria killer Derrick Bird was dumped by his Thai lover weeks before rampage,http://www.nypost.com/p/news/international/cumbria_killer_derrick_bird_before_BHVMEHasHNs0rxB9a3mbBO?CMP=OTC-rss&FEEDNAME=,en,False,murders and attempted murders,7,New York Post,http://www.nypost.com/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Cumbria killer Derrick Bird was dumped by his Thai lover — who he had reportedly sent thousands of pounds to — only weeks before his murderous rampage, British media reported Monday, citing Bird’s friends. The 52-year-old, who knew the 32-year-old Thai woman as “Hon”, met her on holiday three years ago and she had promised to move to England to be with him, The Daily Mail reported. But a few weeks ago she told him she was seeing someone else and sent him a text message breaking off their relationship. A Thai bar owner, Chris Bulmer, told The Sun that Bird fell for the bar girl at the Kennel bar, and that she ripped him off. Bulmer said: “Derrick made the mistake, like many Westerners do, of falling in love and he thought she felt the same.” Bird, who killed 12 people in a deadly shooting spree on June 2, is reported to have spent thousands of pounds on the hooker — transferring £1,000 (US$1400) into her bank account last month just before she sent him a message saying she’d met another man. The taxi driver was reported to be devastated by the break up, with speculation that it added to the tax pressures thought to have triggered the mass shooting in north-west England. Bird’s two children Graeme Bird, 28, and Jamie, 16, said on Sunday they could not understand what had turned their “loving” dad into a monster who slaughtered 12 and injured another 25, before killing himself, The Sun reported. In a statement read by their vicar Reverend Jim Marshall after a service at his church in Lamplugh, Cumbria, the pair said their father was a “loving cheerful character” who would be missed by family and friends. “We would also like to send our condolences to the families and people involved in this tragic incident,” the statement added. “Our thoughts are with them.” Share Selection"

659227349,2010-07-05 08:00:00,“13 Reasons Why” Makes a Smarmy Spectacle of Suicide,http://www.newyorker.com/culture/jia-tolentino/13-reasons-why-makes-a-smarmy-spectacle-of-suicide,en,False,"education and schools,recordings (audio),television,reviews",1101,New Yorker,http://www.newyorker.com/,"To revisit this article, select My Account, then View saved stories To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories By Jia Tolentino “13 Reasons Why,” the Netflix show about a beautiful teen-age girl who slits her wrists in a bathtub after recording thirteen meticulous cassette tapes detailing who is to blame, has become a runaway hit. Netflix doesn’t release ratings, but the show, which is based on a young-adult book of the same name, by Jay Asher, was tweeted about eleven million times in the month after its March 31st release. It has inspired many sombre reviews that recommend the show for being socially important, as well as a bevy of tongue-in-cheek memes on the preteen-centered social network Musical.ly. It has also provoked such a strong and collective reaction in its intended audience—teen-agers—that schools across the country have been sending letters home, warning parents that “13 Reasons Why” might have an effect that directly contradicts its stated project. Rather than starting a valuable conversation that could help students who are struggling with mental-health issues, the show, these schools fear, might push students with issues over the edge. The series opens on the posthumously decorated locker of Hannah Baker, who is played, in extended flashbacks, by the Australian newcomer Katherine Langford. She smiles out calmly from the frame of a photo: dark brown waves, blue eyes, full lips—the looks of a John Hughes heroine. Paper flowers and notes surround her face. “You were always so good and kind. We miss you so much,” one message reads. “Hey, it’s Hannah,” she says in voice-over, as an acoustic folk song plays in the background. “Hannah Baker. That’s right—adjust whatever device you’re hearing this on. It’s me. Live and in stereo, no return engagements, no encore.” The perspective shifts to a hapless-looking teen-age boy named Clay Jensen, played by Dylan Minnette, who goes home after the school day to find a package wrapped in brown paper at his doorstep. It’s a shoebox filled with tapes. Gentle, anticipatory music begins swelling. “I’m about to tell you the story of my life,” Hannah says. “Or, more specifically, why my life ended. And if you’re listening to this tape, you’re one of the reasons why.” Each of Hannah’s tapes—which are all, like her intro, written and delivered with an implausible, maudlin aplomb—singles out an individual who abandoned her on her journey to suicide. There’s the girlfriend who slapped her, the guy who designated her as “Best Ass” on a list, the guy who published her poetry nonconsensually, the guy who let another guy rape his unconscious girlfriend at a party while Hannah was hiding in the room. The narrative progression of the tapes is chronological, dire, and thematically monotonous: over thirteen episodes, Hannah goes from an earnest and hopeful young woman to a helpless victim of slut-shaming and sexual assault. Clay, the other main character of “13 Reasons Why,” is the subject of the eleventh tape, but he’s an exception to the pattern: Hannah admired him, and noted that he didn’t do anything wrong. Tape twelve is about the aforementioned rapist, who also raped Hannah, and the final tape is dedicated to the school’s counsellor, who failed to see her predicament clearly when she came to see him on the day of her planned suicide. Hannah’s tapes function as a sort of chain letter: a second set will be released to the public, she warns, if the people named in the tapes do not listen to them in full and pass them on. In the book, which was published in 2007 and hit No. 1 on the New York Times_ _Y.A. paperback best-seller list, Clay listens to all of the tapes in a single night. In the TV show, he draws out the process for days on end, out of some combination of puppy love and masochistic self-indulgence; he wanders around town, retracing her steps and confronting his classmates. In both the book and the show, Hannah’s history and Clay’s present-tense story are intertwined, and the tone is set by Hannah’s coy, melodramatic narration: “A rumor, based on a kiss, is just the beginning . . . And Justin, honey, stick around. You’re not going to believe where your name crops up next.” But the book is paced quickly, and is stylistically economical; the show demands that you listen to a suicide note for nearly thirteen hours, while the suicide in question is built up as the grand climax, the mystery whose specifics will finally be revealed. It’s somehow grotesque and dull, didactic and indulgent all at once—“Gossip Girl,” minus the pleasure and personality, crossed with the 1971 best-seller “Go Ask Alice,” a diary of a teen-age girl’s drug spiral that is now widely understood to have been fabricated by a therapist as a sort of flamboyant P.S.A. The team behind “13 Reasons Why,” which includes Selena Gomez as executive producer, the playwright Brian Yorkey, and the “Spotlight” director Tom McCarthy, has made it clear that its members think the show is indeed performing a public service. This is why, as they’ve explained in interviews, and in a companion episode called “Beyond the Reasons,” they decided to depict Hannah’s suicide in such “unflinching” detail. In the book, she swallows pills. In the show, she saws vertically at her forearms with razor blades, sobbing and screaming in an overflowing, pinkish tub. I am not a squeamish consumer, but the scene is unhelpful. “Suicide should never be an option,” Gomez says in “Beyond the Reasons.” But it can, apparently, be the whole point of a show. In the rape scenes, too, the TV series diverges from the book, which is not to say that the way Asher renders the scene on paper is low-key. In the book, Hannah gets in a hot tub with Bryce, whom she has recently seen raping her ex-friend, and Clay thinks, “You knew what you were getting into, Hannah.” (His nice-guy shtick frequently feels unbearable: in the book, he becomes vaguely afraid of Hannah when rumors start circulating that she’s slutty; in the show’s final episode, he says, “I cost a girl her life because I was afraid to love her.”) Hannah, in turn, narrates her assault like this: “You were touching me . . . but I was using you. I needed you, so I could let go of me, completely.” Given the weight and complication of what Asher is trying to capture in this scene—simultaneous acts of rape and sexual self-destruction pushing a teen-age girl closer to her death—the simplicity of this language can seem almost lewd. But the scene ends quickly in the book. In the show, it goes on for a very long time, as does the earlier rape scene. Physical details not given by Asher keep the eye of the camera: Hannah is held down and raped from behind; Bryce, a smiling meathead, pulls her hair back enthusiastically, then pins her head against the tile. Her eyes gradually go dead, and she drags herself home, thinking, “I decided no one would ever hurt me again.” In other recent TV shows, like “Jessica Jones” and “Sweet/Vicious,” a young woman’s desire to exert control after trauma is the foundation of a story line; in “13 Reasons Why,” it is the story’s end. Hannah is a mere illustration of the fact that rape exists, that it occurs physically, and that it is spiritually destructive. In “Beyond the Reasons,” it’s dizzying to watch Justin Prentice, the actor who plays Bryce, say, “As a society, we tend to shy away from these hard topics. . . . This says, ‘No, this is a problem, and it needs to be addressed.’ ” And it’s true: after watching that rape scene, which the show films in closeup and, with cuts to the present, stretches across almost four minutes of screen time, I did indeed come away with a sense that there was a problem I hadn’t thought about deeply—one of TV shows giving themselves license to shovel trauma at their audience while assuring their audience that it’s actually healthier this way. “Beyond the Reasons” is supposed to counteract and explain the seemingly gratuitous violence in the thirteen hours that precede it. It’s supposed to ward off the phenomenon of suicide contagion that school administrators have recently become afraid of, for good reason—a phenomenon that the “13 Reasons Why” writers wrote directly into the show, having a character named Alex attempt suicide toward the end of the season. (This does not happen in the book.) A perversely dutiful banner at the bottom of the screen asks “Need Help Now?” and points viewers having suicidal thoughts to 13reasonswhy.info. And if I had less faith in the ability of teen-agers to know bullshit when they see it, I would worry about what they might take from “13 Reasons Why,” which never touches on the subject of mental illness, and which presents Hannah’s suicide as both an addictive scavenger hunt and an act that gives her the glory, respect, and adoration that she was denied in real life. But I am more troubled by the show’s smarmy, disrespectfully pedagogical aesthetic. In her 2011 book “The Art of Cruelty,” Maggie Nelson writes about cultural products that “seem designed to analyze themselves, and to make a spectacle of their essentially consumable perversity.” In the last episode of “13 Reasons Why,” we see one of the characters planning a mass shooting. On Sunday, Netflix announced that the show had been renewed for another season.

        Esther Wang Posted on June 22, 2016, at 10:19 a.m. ET Last Tuesday, the day after a vigil at Stonewall Inn for the victims of the Pulse nightclub massacre drew a crowd of thousands, a much smaller group gathered in front of Club Evolution, a gay club in New York’s Jackson Heights neighborhood that caters to the queer Latino community. Unlike most other events that had taken place in the city and throughout the country, this crowd was mostly Latino and Spanish-speaking. The popular transgender club performer Laura Martinez had organized the vigil, and she was holding court, resplendent in a snug rainbow-striped spandex bodysuit and a semi-sheer white fishtail skirt. People had traveled from all over the city and its suburbs to converge at the busy intersection of 77th Street and Roosevelt Avenue, leaving work early or taking the day off to be there. The mood was somber, looks of shock and resignation in equal measure on people’s faces, and no one was talking much. Several people cried soundlessly. Inside the club, as the lights on the ceiling flashed through all the colors of the rainbow and bachata blared from the speakers, Gabriel Gonzalez was sitting at the bar alone and nursing a beer. A bartender on one of the Circle Line boats that tour the Hudson River, he’s lived in Jackson Heights for the past five years. The neighborhood is more than just where he lives — it’s a place where, as a gay Latino man, he feels comfortable in a way that he doesn’t in Manhattan’s white-dominated scene. Jackson Heights is, as the owner of Club Evolution Eddie Valentin put it, “the gay Village for Latinos,” where in a 10-block radius clustered around the Roosevelt Avenue subway station, you’ll find several gay bars decked in rainbow flags, and if you step inside, you’re more likely to hear Spanish than English. Gonzales’ voice cracked as he remembered the moment he saw the photos of the victims and he realized they looked like him. Gonzales took off his glasses to wipe his eyes, apologizing for crying. He’s Puerto Rican, as were almost half of those who died. “We’re a Latino community, that was a Latino community that got affected,” he said, though he added, “I’m not hearing much that it was a hate crime towards gay people, specifically, it was Latino people.” If certain elected officials and media accounts have elided the fact that the majority of the victims and survivors were Latino and that many were immigrants and undocumented, the people gathered at the vigil were determined to highlight the names and faces of the victims and survivors. “You start recognizing these faces as the faces you see in the bars here all the time,” said Andrés Duque. Duque is a filmmaker and advocate who immigrated to the U.S. from Colombia in 1990. He remembered the first time he found a gay bar in Jackson Heights, hearing a Donna Summer song streaming out into the street and following it into a bar where he was “just floored” when he saw that it was full of gay Colombian men, dancing and kissing each other. “I always remember that point when I walked into that door, a feeling of being home away from home, because there was this gay Colombian community,” he said. That club, the Love Boat, no longer exists, but a handful of gay bars and clubs still dot the neighborhood — Club Evolution; Bum-Bum Bar, known as a lesbian hangout; Friend’s Tavern, the oldest gay bar in the neighborhood, opened by Valentin’s partner in 1989; Hombres; True Colors; and a handful of others, all nestled on busy commercial streets and tucked in between Korean restaurants, South Asian threading salons, taco restaurants, panaderias, and Peruvian joints serving pollo a la brasa — visual reminders of why many call Jackson Heights a miniature United Nations. According to census data, more than half of the neighborhood is Latino and almost a quarter of the residents are Asian. For queer Latino immigrants in particular, the club plays a critical role — for many, it becomes home, the first place they’ve found where they don’t have to carve their identities into discrete pieces, the first place in the world where they feel a small measure of freedom to be their whole selves. “We’re a sanctuary for people who have no place to go,” said Valentin, the longtime owner of Club Evolution. “There are a lot of people who come from other countries, and they leave primarily because of the fact that there’s so much prejudice and homophobia in their countries. When they get to the U.S., the first thing they do is look for a business that’s gay, more likely a bar or a club, where they can make their first friends.” The Latino LGBT community participated in a vigil for the victims of the Orlando Pulse shooting on June 12, 2016, in Jackson Heights, Queens, New York. Jackson Heights was a gay neighborhood decades before it became a Latino one — its proximity to La Guardia airport as well as its easy access to Times Square had long made it a bedroom community for many of the white gay New Yorkers who worked for the airlines and in Manhattan’s theater community. As white flight accelerated in the late 1960s in the wake of the passage of the Fair Housing Act and as more immigrants flocked to the neighborhood from countries throughout Latin America as well as Asia, slowly its gay bars changed hands to new, and mostly Latino, owners. Some still remember the days when 37th Road was called Vaseline Alley, a stretch of the neighborhood known as a place where gay men could go cruising late at night. While a few gay bars operated publicly, many more were clandestine operations where you’d need a password or an invitation from someone in the neighborhood to slip through its doors. It was the 1990 murder of Julio Rivera, a bartender who was beaten to death in the neighborhood by three white men who were prowling the streets looking for a gay man to attack, that first catalyzed the LGBT community in Jackson Heights. Following his death, activists in the neighborhood held the first Queens Pride Parade and founded the borough’s first LGBT center, Queens Pride House. Council Member Danny Dromm, one of the city’s first openly gay elected officials and a longtime resident of the neighborhood, was involved in the earlier organizing work and recalled how difficult it was to generate outrage about the murder of Rivera. He compared the response to Rivera’s murder to the outcry over the death of Matthew Shepard in 1998. “I always look back on that and think, perhaps it was because Julio, even in the minds of white LGBT activists, was, you know, a Latino guy [who] lived in the outer boroughs,” Dromm said. “Oftentimes they’re overlooked,” he said of the queer Latino community. “In the minds of many people of color, the movement has been a white male Chelsea/Greenwich Village-led movement,” a sentiment that is, he noted, rooted in reality. For Mauro Julca, Orlando was a wake-up call for the queer Latino community, which is, as he put it, a “minority within a minority.” “We’ve got to step up our game,” he said, “because the truth of the matter is, these things might happen.” Julca immigrated to New York City from Peru when he was 20 years old. His mother, whom he came out to when he was 16, knew many gay and transgender Peruvians from the hair salon where she worked, so she knew that the LGBT community faced high levels of violence. In Peru, he said, hate crimes are “more like the norm.” So they left, and came to New York. “I thought I’d be safer here in the U.S.,” he said. Yet Julca, a community advocate with a group called Latinos Diferentes de Nueva York, recognizes that violence is a reality that many queer Latinos in the United States face every day. Last year, a friend of his was attacked and robbed as he left a gay bar in Jackson Heights. He collapsed in the stairwell of his apartment building, Julca told me, and wasn't found until the next morning by his roommate. A New York Times analysis of FBI data recently found that of all groups in the U.S., LGBT people are the most likely targets of hate crimes, and the Anti-Violence Project, a group based in New York City that tracks and works with survivors of bias crimes, notes that within the LGBT community, transgender and gender-nonconforming people of color and undocumented immigrants are the most likely to experience physical violence. “We know that LGBTQ folks are suffering tremendous amounts of violence, and this event just made it super visible to the world,” said Natalia Aristizabal, a queer immigrant from Colombia who leads the LGBT organizing project at Make the Road New York. Aristizabal stressed that for LGBT Latinos who live at the intersections of gender identity and race and immigration status, the fear of violence is always present. She listed two recent incidents in New York City from the past two weeks alone, one involving a gay man whose attacker beat him while shouting anti-gay slurs; the other a Latina trans woman who was stabbed. For the past five years, Make the Road has organized a trans Latina march, and this year, it happened to be scheduled for the day after the shooting in Orlando. “We had planned for Monday's march to be saying 'Stop the hate violence,'” Aristizabal said. “We didn't even have to change the theme.” What will happen post-Orlando, in the coming weeks and months? Some of the contours of what is to come are already taking shape, with the dominant discussion centering on gun control. The Human Rights Campaign, the country’s largest LGBT advocacy group, has pivoted to the issue, making it one of its legislative priorities. And while it appeared for a brief moment that Congress, after a 15-hour filibuster led by Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, might vote to enact basic gun control provisions, those efforts failed on Monday night. Yet for many, it’s not enough if the debate around safety and violence focuses only on access to guns. Divisions along race (not to mention class and gender) have long existed in the LGBT community, and many are concerned that as in the past, LGBT Latinos, and especially trans and immigrant Latinos, will be left behind by the mainstream gay movement. Much like the recent Stonewall movie erased the actual leaders of the riot — black and Latina trans women, butch lesbians, drag queens — and whitewashed its history, will we forget that the victims and survivors of the Pulse shooting were Latino, were immigrants, were queer people of color? This is a question on the minds of many queer Latino advocates. “The white gay community, there’s a lot of services, advocacy, but I think they’re failing to look [at] minorities. There’s a lot of crimes, there’s a lot of acts of hate that are still happening,” Julca said. “But sometimes, it’s sad to say that because you’re not white, because you don’t speak the language, it doesn’t get addressed.” Duque, who works at Queens Pride House, expressed a similar sentiment. “Right now, everybody’s hurt and everybody’s looking for unity and being one. I’m not a pessimist, but I think it’s [easier] said than done,” he said. “Looking at the broader universe of LGBT community in the United States, I think there are real divisions in terms of access to power, access to money, to funding.” He’s referring to groups like the Human Rights Campaign. “I don’t know if there’s a venue for an organization like HRC to do some of the groundwork in terms of the local Latino communities across the United States,” Duque said. For club owners like Eddie Valentin, safety is foremost on their minds in the aftermath of Orlando. “We have to bring more security. We have to do more pat-downs, including our good customers, which is something we were trying to avoid,” said Valentin. While not everyone is pleased with the additional security, he believes it’s necessary, and he’s also put in an order for handheld metal detectors. The owner of Hombres, another gay bar in the neighborhood, is planning to add another security guard and has already spoken to his staff about increased awareness of who is at the bar. Days prior, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio had announced that there would be increased police presence at the Manhattan pride parade, a move that has since been repeated by authorities from around the country, who are promising tighter security and more police officers on patrol at this month’s parades and celebrations. In New Orleans, that has already prompted one organization whose membership is primarily queer youths of color to pull out of the pride parade this past weekend. The group wrote on Facebook: “[W]hat does it mean for the only LGBTQ youth organization made up of predominately youth of color with experiences of criminalization in New Orleans — the very youth who were targets of police in New York and Los Angeles and all over the country in 1969 when the Stonewall riots against police were kicked off — to feel unsafe at Pride 47 years later?” Does more policing keep the LGBT community safe? The mass shooting in Orlando has reignited this heated and long-standing debate, one that is often fractured along racial lines, reflecting the reality that it is queer and trans people of color who often are the targets of police violence. At last Monday’s vigil at Stonewall Inn, NYPD Commissioner William Bratton was booed loudly as he spoke, people in the audience drowning him out with shouts of “You kill people” and chants of “Say their names.” One young man even screamed from atop a bus pole, “Bill Bratton and his NYPD are gunning down gay, lesbian, and transgender black and brown youth.” There isn’t unanimity in Jackson Heights on this question. “We need to have more police outside,” said William Pena at last week’s vigil outside of Club Evolution. Another bar patron, Steven Urrea, believes that the NYPD has made progress in its treatment of LGBT New Yorkers. “The police have been a great support in the community, and that has changed,” Urrea said. Not everyone agrees. “Hello, Stonewall, they came in and got us, right? It started with police brutality,” said LaLa Zannell, a transgender black woman and community organizer with the Anti-Violence Project. Until police officers begin to treat queer people of color with respect, Zannell said, “there will forever be a disconnect between the LGBT people of color community and the NYPD.” Aristizabal of Make the Road New York sided with Zannell. “Having a cop in front of a club? That's never meant safety for us,” she said. “You don't understand how many police reports we get, and it's like, ‘Man dressed in a woman's clothing gets stabbed.’ And we're like, think about it. That's not a man dressed in women's clothing, that's a trans woman who was on their way home or on their way to work and then this happened to them.” But the tragedy in Orlando has galvanized the queer Latino community, and especially LGBT Latino immigrants, in a way that even the deadly beating of Julio Rivera in 1990, the murder of gay Colombian immigrant Edgar Garzon in 2001, and the killing of trans performer Lorena Escalera in 2012 did not. “I see it happening on the streets. Four nights of marching, and tonight will be the fifth,” Council Member Dromm said on the Thursday after the shooting. “I have not seen that in the history of Jackson Heights.” Equally as important, said Duque, is the way it has raised the visibility of LGBT Latinos within the broader Latino community. “This is the way the Latino community starts to own the LGBT Latino community as their own,” Duque said. “It took this,” he said, “for people to realize that the Latino community is this beautiful, is this vibrant, is this amazing.” I went back to Club Evolution a few days after Tuesday’s vigil and found a community that was still in mourning. A makeshift mural had sprung up on the wall of the bar, made up of pictures of the victims, their faces along with their names and ages taped together to form a public remembrance. Hung below the black-and-white portraits was a banner, covered with handwritten messages: “We love you.” “I wish I was there to protect you.” “Love is love is love is love.” “Su muerte no sera en vano.” Your death will not be in vain. If, in the wake of the shooting in Orlando, people were afraid to go to the clubs and bars that they loved, on that night they hadn’t let their fear stop them. And in Jackson Heights, at least for a few scant hours, questions of safety, of what change will occur after the tragedy in Orlando, were pushed to the back of people’s minds. At Club Evolution, the TVs ringing the bar were all playing the USA vs. Ecuador Copa America soccer match, cheers erupting when either side scored a goal. Inside Friend’s Tavern just down the street, as bachata and Rihanna and merengue and Michael Jackson spilled from the speakers, everyone was doing the things that most people do on a night out — taking selfies, smiles pasted to their faces; sitting alone at the bar, taking in the scene; shimmying as their favorite song started playing; scrolling through their Instagram feeds, their arms draped over one another — a scene both beautiful and mundane and uncelebrated by most until tragedy struck, the quotidian now turned into acts that feel like defiance, everyone happy to be alive. •  Esther Wang is an emerging writers fellow for BuzzFeed and is based in New York.

All rights reserved. FAQ - New Privacy Policy Apple will open a data center in mainland China with ties to the country's government, raising concerns about the security of iCloud accounts that store personal information transferred from iPhones, iPads and Mac computers there. The data center announced Wednesday will be located in the Guizhou province and run by a company owned by the Chinese government. Apple is teaming up with the company, Guizhou on the Cloud Big Data, to comply with a new Chinese law requiring data-storage providers to keep the information of mainland China customers on computers located within the country. The Guizhou data center will store photos, video, documents and other personal information uploaded to iCloud accounts by Apple customers who live in mainland China, even when they're traveling outside the country. Backups and other data stored in iCloud accounts by customers outside China will continue to be stored in data centers in the U.S. and eventually Denmark. Other major technology companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM, have already made similar deals to run data centers in mainland China to remain in the good graces of the country's Communist government. But Apple's acquiescence is striking because CEO Tim Cook has made preserving customers' privacy a company cornerstone. The Cupertino, California, company underscored that commitment last year in a high-profile battle with the U.S. government over a legal demand to crack open the iPhone of a suspected killer in a mass shooting. Apple has a strong incentive to toe the line in China because that country already is its third-largest market behind North America and Europe, with all signs pointing to it become an even bigger profit center. China currently accounts for about 20 percent of Apple's revenue. Even though it's working with a government-owned company, Apple sought to reassure customers in China that the arrangement won't compromise their privacy. ""As our customers know, Apple has strong data privacy and security protections in place and no backdoors will be created into any of our systems,"" the company said in a statement. What's more, Apple says it will hold to the security keys protecting the data that people routinely back up in iCloud accounts. But experts believe the data center will make it easier for the government to retrieve the information through legal demands or other means. Apple will find it more challenging to resist any order from a Chinese court to give authorities there access to an iCloud account that they want to sift through, predicted Nate Cardozo, a senior staff attorney specializing in privacy for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group. Currently, the Chinese government has to funnel those demands through the U.S. court system, a more difficult process to negotiate. Cardozo recommends that Apple customers in mainland customer turn off the iCloud feature on their iPhones and other devices to protect their information from prying eyes. Data stored on the devices themselves should remain secure as long as they lock them with passwords that only the user knows. Even if the government seizes a device, Apple won't have the keys to unlock data. But with iCloud, Apple does have the keys. The exception is passwords and credit card data synced with iCloud Keychain. Ajay Arora, CEO of data security specialist Vera, also warns that Apple's partnership with a company owned by the Chinese government increases the chances that authorities could secretly pry their way into iCloud accounts. ""It's like Apple is putting the fox in charge of the henhouse,"" Arora said. Quotes displayed in real-time or delayed by at least 15 minutes. Market data provided by Factset.

All rights reserved. FAQ - New Privacy Policy The day after the Las Vegas Strip massacre, the worst mass shooting in U.S. history, President Donald Trump turned to two of his most trusted supporters to get their advice on how to start the healing process for the victims of Sunday’s tragedy which claimed 59 lives and injured over 500, FOX Business has learned. Billionaire casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, who has a net worth of $36 billion according to Forbes,  and his wife Miriam, were already scheduled to meet with Trump and his son in law Jared Kushner at the White House on Monday to discuss future policy decisions, instead they brainstormed ways to assist the victims and their families, administration officials tell FOX Business. These same officials would not get into specifics about the policies that were to have been discussed. On the same day as the President’s meeting with the Adelsons, Trump addressed the nation calling the shooting an “act of pure evil.” Trump will visit Las Vegas on Wednesday. Adelson, chairman and chief executive officer of Las Vegas Sands Corporation (NYSE:LVS), and his wife Miriam were two of Trump’s top donors during the 2016 presidential campaign, giving $20 million to the pro-Trump super PAC Future45, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Adelson also promised to contribute $100 million to Trump’s campaign to help the then Republican candidate defeat Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. Miriam Adelson is a doctor and chairman of The Dr. Miriam & Sheldon G. Adelson Clinic for Drug Abuse Treatment and Research. According to its website, the clinic is a “private, non-profit organization founded by Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G. Adelson and dedicated to treating the disease of opiate (heroin and painkillers) addiction by providing methadone (maintenance) treatment and counseling services.” Adelson, a pro-Israel philanthropist, reportedly expressed disappointment with Trump that the U.S. embassy has not yet been moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, according to Israel’s Channel 2 Television News. A spokesman for the Las Vegas Sands Corporation did not return FOX Business’ emails for comment. Jared Kushner has been a key player in his father-in-law’s administration’s attempt at establishing peace between Israel and Palestine. As a senior White House adviser, Kushner has traveled to the Middle East on numerous occasions to meet with representatives from both regions, as well as leaders from Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan. Trump has refused in the past to publicly commit to on the so-called two-state solution, in which an independent Palestinian state would co-exist alongside Israel. Trump's reluctance to embrace this solution is a departure from the official policy of the previous two presidential administrations. In a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in September, the two leaders discussed the possibility of a peace deal between Israel and Palestine but did not elaborate on whether a two-state solution is the answer. ""Most people would say there is no chance whatsoever, but I actually think with the capability of Bibi and frankly the other side, I really think we have a chance,” Trump said then. ""I think Israel would like to see it, and I think the Palestinians would like to see it."" Quotes displayed in real-time or delayed by at least 15 minutes. Market data provided by Factset.

All rights reserved. FAQ - New Privacy Policy Apple will likely seek to invoke the United States' protections of free speech as one of its key legal arguments in trying to block an order to help unlock the encrypted iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters, lawyers with expertise in the subject said this week. The company on Thursday was granted three additional days by the court to file a response to the order. Apple will now have until Feb. 26 to send a reply, a person familiar with matter told Reuters. The tech giant and the Obama administration are on track for a major collision over computer security and encryption after a federal magistrate judge in Los Angeles handed down an order on Tuesday requiring Apple to provide specific software and technical assistance to investigators. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook called the request from the Federal Bureau of Investigation unprecedented. Other tech giants such as Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet's Google have rallied to support Apple. Apple has retained two prominent, free-speech lawyers to do battle with the government, according to court papers: Theodore Olson, who won the political-speech case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission in 2010, and Theodore Boutrous, who frequently represents media organizations. Government lawyers from the U.S. Justice Department have defended their request in court papers by citing various authorities, such as a 1977 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld an order compelling a telephone company to provide assistance with setting up a device to record telephone numbers. The high court said then that the All Writs Act, a law from 1789, authorized the order, and the scope of that ruling is expected to be a main target of Apple when it files a response in court by early next week. But Apple will likely also broaden its challenge to include the First Amendment's guarantee of speech rights, according to lawyers who are not involved in the dispute but who are following it. Compared with other countries, the United States has a strong guarantee of speech rights even for corporations, and at least one court has ruled that computer code is a form of speech, although that ruling was later voided. Apple could argue that being required to create and provide specific computer code amounts to unlawful compelled speech, said Riana Pfefferkorn, a cryptography fellow at Stanford University's Center for Internet and Society. The order against Apple is novel because it compels the company to create a new forensic tool to use, not just turn over information in Apple's possession, Pfefferkorn said. ""I think there is a significant First Amendment concern,"" she said. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles declined to comment on the possible free-speech questions on Thursday. A speech-rights argument from Apple, though, could be met with skepticism by the courts because computer code has become ubiquitous and underpins much of the U.S. economy. ""That is an argument of enormous breadth,"" said Stuart Benjamin, a Duke University law professor who writes about the First Amendment. He said Apple would need to show that the computer code conveyed a ""substantive message."" In a case brought by a mathematician against U.S. export controls, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers California, found in 1999 that the source code behind encryption software is protected speech. The opinion was later withdrawn so the full court could rehear the case, but that rehearing was canceled and the appeal declared moot after the government revised its export controls. The FBI and prosecutors are seeking Apple's assistance to read the data on an iPhone 5C that had been used by Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, carried out the San Bernardino shootings that killed 14 people and wounded 22 others at a holiday party. U.S. prosecutors were smart to pick the mass shooting as a test case for an encryption fight with tech companies, said Michael Froomkin, a University of Miami law professor. That is because the shooting had a large emotional impact while also demonstrating the danger posed by armed militants, he said. In addition, the iPhone in dispute was owned not by Farook but by his employer, a local government, which has consented to the search of the iPhone. The federal magistrate who issued the order, Sheri Pym, is also a former federal prosecutor. ""This is one of the worst set of facts possible for Apple. That's why the government picked this case,"" Froomkin said. Froomkin added, though, that the fight was enormously important for the company because of the possibility that a new forensic tool could be easily used on other phones and the damage that could be done to Apple's global brand if it cannot withstand government demands on privacy. ""All these demands make their phones less attractive to users,"" he said.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Traders rushed to buy into gun makers Monday, as lawmakers reignited calls for new gun-control regulations in the aftermath of the terrorist attack in Orlando. Smith & Wesson (NASDAQ:SWHC) and Sturm, Ruger & Co. (NYSE:RGR), two of the largest gun manufacturers in America, both rallied to kick off a new week of trading. Smith & Wesson rallied 6.9% to $22.88, and Ruger jumped 7.9% to $61.93. Vista Outdoor (NYSE:VSTO), which owns Savage Arms and Federal Premium ammunition, rose 2.3% to $48.11. Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, is pushing for a reinstatement of a ban on “assault weapons” following the terrorist attack. Law enforcement officials say a gunman, who reportedly pledged his allegiance to ISIS, killed at least 49 people at a nightclub in Orlando early Sunday morning. “This is the deadliest mass shooting in the history of the United States and it reminds us once more that weapons of war have no place on our streets,” Clinton said in a statement. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has promised to protect gun rights. In a speech Friday, Trump said Hillary Clinton wants to “abolish the Second Amendment.” Former President Bill Clinton signed a 10-year federal ban on AR-15 rifles in 1994. The ban had a 10-year sunset provision, so it expired under President George W. Bush in 2004. The AR-15, a semi-automatic rifle design purchased by Colt in the early 1960s, was later adopted by the U.S. military as the M16. After the 1994 ban was lifted, the AR-15 became a popular firearm on the consumer market. AR-15 models—also known as modern sporting rifles—are manufactured by multiple companies, including Smith & Wesson and Ruger. Gun stocks have widely outperformed the broader market during President Barack Obama’s time in office. Since Jan. 23, 2009, Smith & Wesson has gained 737%, and Ruger is up 822% as of the closing bell Friday. The S&P 500 has increased 135% over the same period. According to the FBI, background checks for gun purchases and permits hit a record 23.1 million in 2015. So far this year, background checks are up 31% at 11.7 million through May.

All rights reserved. FAQ - New Privacy Policy President Donald Trump is calling for a focus on mental health and school safety in response to shootings like the one that took 17 lives in Florida, but his budget would cut funding in both areas. Trump's latest budget would slash the major source of public funds for mental health treatment, the Medicaid program serving more than 70 million low-income and disabled people. The budget also calls for a 36 percent cut to an Education Department grant program that supports safer schools, reducing it by $25 million from the current level of $67.5 million. However, some smaller mental health programs would get an increase. The budget was issued Monday, before the horrific mass shooting at a South Florida high school. Spending priorities often change in response to events that galvanize national attention. In this case, advocates and policy experts said the budget numbers call into question how much value the administration places on mental health. ""Whatever small increases they are asking for is more than offset by the changes they would make to Medicaid,"" said Andrew Sperling, legislative advocacy director for the National Alliance on Mental Illness. The budget resurrects a GOP Medicaid plan that failed in Congress last year, which calls for turning the program over to the states and limiting future federal payments. That would mean a cut of about $1.4 trillion over 10 years from projected spending. States would face hard choices over competing priorities like mental health or addiction treatment, nursing home costs or prenatal care for low-income women. ""The only area where I see the budget providing an increase is on the opioid addiction side,"" said Diane Rowland, a Medicaid expert with the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. ""Not all people who have mental health challenges are going to be substance abusers."" On school safety, the administration wants to slash funding for national school safety initiatives by nearly $25 million in 2019, down from this year's projected funding of $67.5 million. The administration wants school districts to use these funds on opioid addiction and prevention programs, but Education Department spokeswoman Liz Hill that schools can also spend the money on violence prevention and safety. ""The department is committed to providing resources, direct support and technical assistance to schools who have suffered unthinkable tragedy,"" Hill said. The department also has more than $5 million in special emergency response grants that schools can use in the aftermath of shootings and other tragedies. Hill did not address why a cut to the grant program was needed in the first place. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Thursday called on Congress to start a serious national conversation on tackling mental health issues in the aftermath of the deadly Florida high school shooting. ""One of these shootings is one too many and we have got to have an honest conversation and Congress has to lead on this, it's their job,"" she told conservative host Hugh Hewitt. A senior Democratic lawmaker involved with health care as well as budget issues said leadership is supposed to come from the White House. ""If the president was serious about stopping the scourge of gun violence...he would work with Congress on common sense gun safety measures, rather than pointing to mental health services and school safety as the only solutions just days after introducing a budget that slashes those very investments,"" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said in a statement. The future of Medicaid under Trump and a GOP Congress is one of Murray's central concerns. The program's role in mental health care was underscored by a Kaiser Foundation study that found the program accounted for 25 percent of what the nation spent in 2014, or more than $46 billion. Medicaid was only slightly behind private payments for mental health care, which accounted for 28 percent. The administration says states will be able to run Medicaid more efficiently, without sacrificing the health and well-being of their residents. Getting Trump's Medicaid overhaul through Congress would be a tall order, since key Republican governors opposed it last year, and there doesn't seem to have been much effort to get them on board now. Also in the mental health area, the administration is highlighting a $15-million budget request for ""assertive community treatment,"" a new approach that seeks to keep people with serious mental health problems from being cycled through jails and emergency rooms. However, Sperling said that program had been already authorized by Congress and focuses on people with a long history of serious illness. In budget documents, the Trump administration noted that an estimated 43 million American adults met the medical standard for having a mental, behavioral or emotional disorder that substantially interfered with or limited major life activities. Of those, 10 million people had a serious mental illness. ___ AP state government reporter Christina A. Cassidy in Atlanta contributed to this report.

(CNN) -- Hundreds of family members, friends and neighbors of four of the eight victims of a workplace shooting rampage gathered at funeral services around Manchester, Connecticut, on Saturday to share tears and memories. The four men who were laid to rest had each worked at Hartford Distributors for around 30 years before Omar Thornton's shooting spree Tuesday, which ended when he took his own life. ""We're a pretty tight neighborhood,"" said Mary Bey of South Windsor, at the funeral of Craig Pepin, 60, who she described as a ""wonderful neighbor and friend and coach and referee."" ""He touched so many people's lives in South Windsor ... he was a very unique, kind and wonderful man,"" she told CNN Connecticut affiliate WTNH. Bey also knows a Hartford Distributors employee who was injured in the rampage. ""We're very happy he made it through,"" she said of Steven Hollander, a neighbor who was treated and released from Hartford Hospital. Besides Pepin, Bryan Cirigliano, 51, Douglas Scruton, 56, and Victor James, who was killed on his 61st birthday, were also buried Saturday. ""We've just had an outpouring of support,"" James' daughter told WTNH. ""And it just felt good to hear the stories and just to see the amount of people that came to see my dad."" Funeral services for two other shooting victims are scheduled for Sunday and Monday, and a candlelight vigil for those killed is scheduled for Sunday evening in Manchester's Center Park. Connecticut Gov. M. Jodi Rell has called for Monday to be a day of remembrance for the victims, asking state residents to observe a moment of silence at 9:15 a.m. On Friday, police arrested a woman they said had accepted stolen beer from a delivery truck driven by Thornton. Hartford Distributors said it had asked Thornton to resign after it found him stealing and selling alcoholic beverages. Thornton's girlfriend told CNN he was being racially harassed at work, but Hartford Distributors' president said Thursday that there were no grievances filed with the company or with Thornton's union."

23365235,2010-09-01 17:13:29,"There was second survivor from Mexico massacre, officials say",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_mostpopular/~3/Kga7otDuwQE/index.html,en,False,murders and attempted murders,1095,CNN,http://www.cnn.com/,"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- A second person survived a massacre in which 72 migrants from Central and South America were killed last week in northern Mexico, Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa and Mexican officials said. A man from Ecuador was previously thought to be the only survivor. That man, identified as Luis Freddy Lala Pomavilla, said someone else also lived through the mass shooting, Correa said at a news conference late Tuesday night upon his return to Ecuador from a trip to Haiti. Correa did not provide details other than to say the second survivor came from Honduras. ""We don't want to put him in danger,"" Correa said. Viviana Macias, a spokeswoman for the Mexican attorney general's office, confirmed Wednesday that a second person had survived the attack. The attorney general's office said authorities had not revealed news of the second survivor in order to protect the person's safety. For the same reason, officials said Wednesday, they will not reveal the person's identity. The attorney general's office said in a release Wednesday afternoon that the survivor is being held and protected as a witness and has given officials ""relevant information to identify those presumed to be responsible."" The agency has been in touch with authorities in Honduras, the release said. Lala Pomavilla, the Ecuadorian survivor, was returned to his homeland  late Sunday. The young man was wounded in the attack and said he survived by playing dead. He later walked several miles to a military roadblock near the town of San Fernando in Tamaulipas state, less than 100 miles from the U.S. border. Officials are investigating whether members of the Zetas drug cartel were responsible for the deaths. The bodies of the 72 victims are being returned to their homelands, which include Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Brazil. Mexican officials returned the remains of 16 migrants to Honduras on Wednesday. A live broadcast on CNN affiliate Televicentro showed six-man honor guards wheeling the bodies one by one off a transport aircraft. Bereaved relatives and friends cried and held each other as the gray caskets glided by slowly, guided solemnly by soldiers in dress uniforms and red-plumed hats. The caskets, each adorned with a bouquet of flowers on top, were placed under a large tent on the tarmac at the air force airport in Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras. ""Repatriation,"" said the Televicentro banner imposed over the bottom of the TV image. ""What started as a search for the American dream ended in a mortal nightmare."" After the 16 caskets were gathered in the tent, a Roman Catholic priest prayed over them. ""Don't lose your faith in God,"" he told those gathered there before he sprinkled holy water on each of the caskets. Honduran President Porfirio Lobo also addressed the crowd, merely reading the names of the 16 victims before walking back to his spot in a line of dignitaries. Some family members were brought up to have a word with Lobo, who hugged them and spoke quietly with them. The caskets were released to the families after the ceremony, and at one point Lobo went to where a man with a gray New York Yankees cap was sobbing as he leaned on a coffin. Lobo patted the man on the shoulder and reached out to a woman standing next to him. The victims will be taken to their hometowns for burial. CNN's Jose Antonio Flores, Krupskaia Alis and Arthur Brice contributed to this report."
