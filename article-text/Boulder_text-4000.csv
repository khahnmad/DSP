The victims — three women and a man — were at a residence in the Englewood neighborhood when the bullets started flying around 5:45 a.m. CT, Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown said. All four four were pronounced dead at the scene, a house in the 6200 block of South Morgan Street, Brown said. Brown released no other details about the four victims or what sparked the latest outbreak of gun violence in the Windy City. He said no arrests have been made and there was no sign of forced entry, but police have found shell casings inside the house and a large-capacity “drum magazine.” Mayor Lori Lightfoot called the mass shooting “a tragedy that’s ripped apart families and inflicted intense trauma on several individuals.” “It tells us that we still have much work to do in our mission to end gun violence here in Chicago and in particular, to limit the access of individuals to illegal guns,” Lightfoot said. Meanwhile, three men and a woman were recuperating in nearby hospitals police said. The woman was in critical condition at the University of Chicago Medical Center. Two men, ages 25 and 41, were both shot in the backs of their heads. Their conditions were not immediately available. Both are at Christ Hospital. Also, a 23-year-old man who had been shot in the back managed to get himself to St. Bernard Hospital and has since been transferred to the University of Chicago Medical Center. His condition was not known. A 2-year-old girl was removed from the residence and taken to Comer Children’s Hospital to be checked out, but did not appear to be injured, the Chicago Sun-Times reported, citing the police. It was the third mass shooting on the Southside in a little over the week. But before the recent spate of deadly shootings, violent crime had been declining in Chicago this year, according to police. While homicides tend to peak in big cities like Chicago this time of year, May was the second straight month the number of homicides in the city declined compared to the same month last year, police said. There was also less violent crime over Memorial Day weekend compared to last year. Corky Siemaszko is a senior writer for NBC News Digital. © 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL"
