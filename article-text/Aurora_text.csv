86780013,2012-08-04 19:29:59,"Inside The Rings: For Lolo Jones at the Olympics, Everything Is Image",http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/05/sports/olympics/olympian-lolo-jones-draws-attention-to-beauty-not-achievement.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,en,False,,1,New York Times,http://nytimes.com,"Advertisement Supported by Inside the Rings By Jeré Longman LONDON — Judging from this year’s performances, Lolo Jones seems to have only a slim chance of winning an Olympic medal in the 100-meter hurdles and almost no possibility of winning gold. Still, Jones has received far greater publicity than any other American track and field athlete competing in the London Games. This was based not on achievement but on her exotic beauty and on a sad and cynical marketing campaign. Essentially, Jones has decided she will be whatever anyone wants her to be — vixen, virgin, victim — to draw attention to herself and the many products she endorses. Women have struggled for decades to be appreciated as athletes. For the first time at these Games, every competing nation has sent a female participant. But Jones is not assured enough with her hurdling or her compelling story of perseverance. So she has played into the persistent, demeaning notion that women are worthy as athletes only if they have sex appeal. And, too often, the news media have played right along with her. In 2009, Jones posed nude for ESPN the Magazine. This year, she appeared on the cover of Outside magazine seeming to wear a bathing suit made of nothing but strategically placed ribbon. At the same time, she has proclaimed herself to be a 30-year-old virgin and a Christian. And oh, by the way, a big fan of Tim Tebow. If there is a box to check off, Jones has checked it. Except for the small part about actually achieving Olympic success as a hurdler. At the 2008 Beijing Games, Jones led before hitting the 9th of 10 hurdles. She stumbled home in seventh place. To her credit, she stood and answered reporters’ questions with grace, but her career has since ebbed. Anything could happen here, as Beijing showed. Still, Jones is far from a favorite. She barely made the 2012 Olympic team with a third-place finish at the United States trials. Nineteen hurdlers internationally have posted faster times this year than Jones’s best, 12.74 seconds, including the other two Americans in the field. Not all of those faster hurdlers will compete in London, but enough of them will to seemingly minimize Jones’s chances. Sally Pearson of Australia is the favorite. Dawn Harper, the reigning Olympic champion from the United States, is also a candidate to win the gold medal, as is Kellie Wells, another American. Yet, Harper and Wells remain in shadow while Jones stands in the spotlight. “It reminds me of Anna Kournikova,” said Janice Forsyth, the director of the International Centre for Olympic Studies at the University of Western Ontario. This was a reference to the former Russian tennis player whose looks received far more attention than her relatively meager skills. “It’s really a sad commentary on the industry Lolo is in,” Forsyth said. “Limited opportunities are there for women to gain a foothold unless they sell themselves as sex kittens or virgins for sale. I don’t know if this is Lolo being Lolo or part of a marketing scheme to remain relevant in an Olympic industry where if you are not the Olympic champion, you are nothing.” Ilana Taub, a spokeswoman, said Jones would have no comment. Previously, Jones has defended her nude ESPN photograph on artistic grounds. And she has denounced a double standard that celebrates male athletes as sex symbols but derides women. She has a point. No one is complaining that Ryan Lochte is athletic eye candy. Of course, Lochte is also appreciated for his haul of Olympic swimming medals. Victory alone is often not enough for women. Harper, the 2008 Olympic hurdles champion, grew up in tattered East St. Louis, Ill. That city’s famous Olympic athlete, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, was her mentor. In Beijing, Harper had no shoe endorsement, so she ran and won in a pair of borrowed spikes. But all anyone asks about is Jones. At one point, it was frustrating, Harper said, adding that she resolved the matter through prayer. “I don’t care what anyone else is getting; I’m excited to be here,” she said. “At the end of the day, you can talk about all that, but you’ve still got to mention my name.” Yet Harper acknowledged being startled by the extent to which Jones has revealed details about her own dissolute childhood in Des Moines. Her father spent time in prison. Her family lived for a period in a Salvation Army basement. She had a brief and desperate career as a child shoplifter. “I’ve had family issues as well, but I’m not willing to say all of them just so it can be in the papers,” Harper said. “I don’t want that for myself or my family.” In recent days, Jones has been criticized for what many have called an insensitive Twitter remark in the wake of the mass shooting in a theater in Aurora, Colo. After the United States lost the gold medal to Italy in the team archery competition, Jones wrote, “When’s da Gun shooting competition?” She clarified her remark, saying she was referring to American pre-eminence in hunting, which she had done with Southerners. (Jones attended Louisiana State in a state known as the Sportsman’s Paradise.) Not always the most confident athlete, Jones has acknowledged battling doubt all season. Her modest times show it. Heats of the hurdles begin Monday. If Jones can remain composed and improve her technique and speed, she can also write a great and improbable story of Olympic redemption. After stumbling four years ago, she is back on her feet, back in the Games. Back in position to be appreciated for her athletic skill, not merely her sex appeal. Back in position to undress her opponents, not herself. Advertisement"

Something sure dragged down box office results: North American theaters sold about $135 million in tickets over the weekend, a 25 percent decline from the same period last year, according to studio distribution executives.
                                        “The Dark Knight Rises” (Warner Brothers) was No. 1, taking in an estimated $64 million —
                                        a 60 percent drop from last weekend, when the movie benefited from strong advance ticket sales. “The Dark Knight Rises” has now taken in about $289.1 million in the United States and Canada, or 14
                                        percent less than its franchise predecessor grossed over the same period in 2008, after adjusting for inflation. “Ice Age: Continental Drift” (20th Century Fox) was second for the weekend, selling about $13.3 million in tickets, for a three-week total of $114.8 million, according to Hollywood.com,
                                        which compiles box-office data. “The Watch,” a Fox ensemble comedy, was third, taking in about $13 million. “The Watch,” which cost $68 million to make, experienced publicity setbacks
                                        after the February shooting of a Florida teenager by a community watch participant. “Step Up Revolution” (Lionsgate) was fourth, taking in an estimated $11.8 million — the lowest opening-weekend
                                        gross in the history of this four-film series; “Revolution” cost about $33 million to make. “Ted” (Universal) managed $7.4 million in ticket sales, enough for fifth place and a five-week
                                        total of about $193.6 million. ArtsBeat, a blog about arts and culture, has been archived. Find our latest recaps and our full archive here. Follow"

                                        on Sunday. That total ranks as one of the best on record — particularly for a movie that did not benefit from premium-priced 3-D shows — but falls about 15 percent below prerelease expectations, a clear indication
                                        that Friday’s mass shooting at a screening of the film in Colorado may have frightened away potential moviegoers. Warner said “The Dark Knight Rises” took in an additional $88 million in 17 international markets. The Hollywood Reporter characterized that total as “strong,” but there were signs that the
                                        shootings also hurt the movie abroad. For instance, “Rises” took in $22.5 million in Britain, a 6 percent decline from first-weekend sales for “The Dark Knight” in 2008, after adjusting
                                        for inflation. “The Dark Knight Rises” will roll out in 40 additional overseas markets on Friday. The film cost an estimated $400 million to make and market, meaning that ticket sales will need to total $800 million
                                        or so for Warner to break even, after splitting box office revenue with theater owners.

                                        anger over the shooting rampage that left 12 people dead and 58 injured
                                        at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., early Friday. As my colleague, Erica Goode, reports in an article  about those who died, some people did not learn the fate
                                        of their missing relatives or friends until late Friday night after many of them had conducted desperate searches at area hospitals. Late Saturday, the Arapahoe County Coroner’s Office released the names of the people who had died: Jessica N. Ghawi, 25; John T. Larimer, 27; Alexander J. Boik, 18; Jesse E. Childress, 29; Rebecca Ann Wingo, 33; Jonathan T. Blunk, 26; Alex N. Sullivan,
                                        27; Gordon W. Cowden, 51; Micayla C. Medek, 23; Alexander C. Teves, 24; Matthew McQuinn,
                                        27; and the youngest victim, Veronica Moser-Sullivan, who was 6. By then, many friends and family members had already turned to blogs, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and YouTube to mourn and remember. From the moment he learned that his sister, Jessica, had been shot early Friday, Jordan Ghawi used his blog and Twitter to share thoughts about
                                        his sister and regular updates about what he was learning about her fate and his family’s plans for a memorial service in Texas

Her boyfriend, Jay Meloff, a professional hockey player who lives in Toronto, shared his loss on Twitter, and over the weekend, retweeted some of the Twitter posts they shared. Every experience in life was amplified beyond my wildest dreams with you. — Jay Meloff (@Jay_Meloff) 20 Jul 12 It was on Facebook, where many friends of Ms. Wingo, a single mother of two small children, first learned that she was among the dead after her father, Steve Hernandez, posted this Facebook message on Saturday: “I lost my daughter yesterday to a mad man, my grief right now is inconsolable. I hear she died instantly, without pain, however, the pain is unbearable. Lord why, why, why?” On Saturday, friends of Mr. Boik, an 18-year-old who had attended Gateway High School in Aurora, set up a Facebook page called Remembering AJ Boik, which had
                                        drawn more than 2,000 comments and condolences by late afternoon. By Monday, nearly 5,000 people joined in. Some friends shared cellphone videos of Mr. Boik, including a video of him dancing in a high school hallway, drawing laughs from his classmates.   Friends also created memory pages on Facebook for other victims, including Mr. Sullivan,    Ms. Ghawi,
                                        Ms.  Medek and
Mr. McQuinn. Mr. McQuinn. Others used hashtags on Twitter. Because Ms. Ghawi, an aspiring sportswriter, loved Twitter, her family asked people to post messages using the hashtag #RIPJessica as a way to keep the conversation focused on the victims
                                        instead of the gunman. And they did. Mother of @JessicaRedfield says her daughter loved @Twitter and has asked that #RIPJessica trend instead of killer. Please RT if you agree. — Dale Arnold (@DaleEArnold) 21 Jul 12 Soon, hashtags popped up on Twitter with the names of the other victims, including #RIPAJBoik, #RIPMattMcQuinn and others. Please pray for families. #RIPJessica #RIPAlexSullivan #RIPAJBoik #RIPAlexTeves #RIPMicaylaMedek #RIPMattMcQuinn #PrayforAurora — Katy Mitchel (@Katy_Mitchel) 21 Jul 12 For some of the victims, the first details about their lives and loves emerged from their own Facebook pages and Twitter accounts and later from family members and friends giving interviews to news organizations. Here are links to articles and videos about the victims, which we will continue to collect and share. Shortly before he was killed, just days before his wedding anniversary, Alex Sullivan posted on Twitter how excited he was to see the movie,
                                        “The Dark Knight Rises,” the third in a Batman trilogy by the director Christopher Nolan. #TheDarkKnightRises @Reel_Nerdsoh man one hour till the movie and its going to be the best BIRTHDAY

Maneka Singh, a high school friend, said Mr. Sullivan was “always smiling and the type of guy who had too many friends and loved them all.” On her Facebook page, Micayla Medek, 23, described herself this way: “My name is Micayla, but everyone usually calls me Cayla. I’m a simple independent girl who’s just trying to get her life together while still having fun.” She took classes at a community college and worked at Subway since 2008 as a sandwich maker and closer, adding: “I do everything lol.” Her father, Greg Medek, told The Los Angeles Times that waiting for
                                        news on Friday after he was unable to find his “sweetheart angel girl” was torture as he agonized about her lying on the theater floor. “I’m just a guy trying to make it, to trust in
                                        his Lord as best as he can,” Mr. Medek said in the interview. “I lost a precious soul.” Matt McQuinn, 27, who grew up in Springfield, Ohio, was one of them. A family spokesman said that he threw himself over his girlfriend, Samantha Yowler, when the shots rang out. Ms. Yowler is in stable
                                        condition with a bullet wound to the knee. The couple moved to Colorado last September from Ohio to get a fresh start. They both worked at Target. The couple can be seen smiling in a profile picture on his Facebook page,
                                        where he had recently “liked” Batman. The Dayton Daily News reported  how his family desperately tried to learn what had happened to him after learning
                                        of the shooting. Both the Yowler and McQuinn families are now in Colorado. Jonathan T. Blunk, 26, a Navy veteran, was killed while shielding his girlfriend, Jansen Young. She recounted his heroic efforts in an interview on
                                        Saturday with NBC News. Mr. Blunk is survived by two children, ages 4 and 2, who lived with his estranged wife, Chantal Blunk, in Reno, Nev. In an interview on
                                        Saturday with The Reno Gazette-Journal, Ms. Blunk said: “We still talked every day, even though we were separated. We still said ‘I love you’ to each other. He’d always send videos to
                                        say hi.” The father of Alexander Teves, 24,  told ABC News that his son died while trying to save his girlfriend. Mr. Teves, who is originally from Arizona and studying to be a physical therapist, was in Colorado studying for advanced degrees. He went to the theater that night with his girlfriend, Amanda, and another friend who
                                        is an active Twitter user under the name Caitlin. He died, Amanda, said shielding her from the bullets by throwing himself on top of
                                        her. In the last couple of days, Caitlin has posted regular updates on her Twitter feed, revealing first the confusion after the shots were fired and the anguish of not being able to find Mr. Teves. Then finally, this news: Alex didn’t make it. — Caitlin (@dingos8myTARDIS) July 21, 2012 Alex Teves was one of the best men I ever knew.

                                        of Chicago. He was among those who died shielding someone else. Julia Vojtsek, who grew up near him, told a Chicago radio station WBBM that
                                        they had known each other for years but only recently had started to date after her father had moved to Aurora. When the shooting began, she said he held her head and “protected my whole body with his, and
                                        saved me. My boyfriend saved my life. ” Mr. Larimer was the youngest of five children, reports                                        the Chicago Tribune. Another serviceman from Buckley Air Force Base who attended the film was Staff Sgt. Jesse Childress. In a heartbreaking interview                                        on NBCNews4, his friend, Munirih Gravelly, tearfully recounted how he threw himself in front of her, which she said saved her life. “I feel really sorry … that he’s gone,” she told NBC4’s
                                        Beverly White, “that none of us were able to at least hold his hand and look him in the eye while he passed. I lost a friend.” Mr. Childress, 29, grew up in southern California. A makeshift memorial was created outside of his family’s home in Lake Los Angeles. He was a cyber systems operator, on active duty orders in the 310th Force

When she died, she was working at Schryver Medical as a customer

                                        personality to WABC-TV – Channel 7 in Denver. She grew up in Quinlan, Texas, east of Dallas. She was the mother of two little girls. In her final post on her Facebook page, she talked about her daughters. ”My little baby started kindergarten
                                        today. She is so excited to be in the big girl school with her sister. Oh how the time flies.” Alexander J. Boik, 18, had just graduated from Gateway High School in Aurora. So when the call went out on Facebook for his friends to gather
                                        and remember him on Saturday night, they decided to meet at the school’s bleachers. Hundreds of people showed up. Known as A.J., to his friends, Mr. Boik was headed to Rocky Mountain College of Art and Design in the fall. In a statement, his family said his dream was to become an art teacher and eventually have his own studio.
                                        “A.J. was loved by all that knew him,” his family said. The Denver Post reports that his friends, some holding purple balloons, recalled him
                                        at the gathering on  Saturday night as a friend “who made people laugh, who loved softball and who loved movies so much he never missed a premiere.” Gordon W.

                                        to Colorado about a dozen years ago, from Texas, where he grew up near Austin in West Lake Hills. He was the son of a Texas state representative. The newspaper said friends and family described him as “a
                                        true Texas gentleman that loved life and his family” Growing up, he attended First Baptist Church, where reporters for KXAN-TV in Austin spoke to friends who shared their memories in this broadcast report uploaded to YouTube.   At first, some people thought Jessica Redland was among those who died. That was the name that 25-year-old Jessica Ghawi use for her Twitter handle, and her warm,
                                        funny, engaging personality came right through her Twitter feed. In a post about grief during the “social media age,” Callie Schweitzer wrote wrote how she was deeply touched by Ms. Ghawi’s
                                        Twitter feed. “I spent much of Friday poring over Jessica’s tweets and couldn’t help thinking how well we’d get along. She was an aspiring journalist with an amazing sense of humor. Her comebacks. Her use of capital letters and exclamation
                                            marks to show excitement. Her determination. She had a self-awareness and confidence that many people spend entire lives trying to cultivate. Put simply, she was fabulous. The kind of fabulous you want to surround yourself with. The kind of fabulous you know is going somewhere in life.” Ms. Ghawi was the first victim whose identity was publicly known. And people also got to know her through her blog,
                                        where she described narrowly escaping a mass shooting at a Toronto shopping mall in early June. From that experience, she said she learned valuable lessons, which she wrote about and shared. “I was shown how fragile life was on Saturday. I saw the terror on bystanders’ faces. I saw the victims of a senseless crime. I saw lives change. I was reminded that we don’t know when or where our time on Earth will end. When or
                                            where we will breathe our last breath. For one man, it was in the middle of a busy food court on a Saturday evening. I say all the time that every moment we have to live our life is a blessing. So often I have found myself taking it for granted. Every hug from a family member. Every laugh we share with friends. Even the times
                                            of solitude are all blessings. Every second of every day is a gift. After Saturday evening, I know I truly understand how blessed I am for each second I am given.” The Lede is a blog that remixes national and international news stories -- adding information gleaned from the Web or gathered through original reporting -- to supplement articles in The New York Times and draw readers

At least 12 people were killed in the rampage and 58 were injured, one fewer than earlier reported. Of those injured ""nearly everyone was shot,"" Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates said Friday night, adding that a handful of people were hurt in the resulting chaos. Ten of the victims were killed inside the theater while two others died at hospitals. As of Friday evening, the 10 bodies had been removed from the complex and authorities were preparing to begin ""the agonizing process"" of notifying families, Oates said. A mug shot of suspect James E. Holmes has not been released. Witnesses to the shooting described him as wearing a gas mask that concealed much of his face and head. But the federal law enforcement source's information about the suspect's appearance fits with a statement from New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, who was briefed by Colorado authorities Friday. Oates declined to comment on Holmes' appearance other than to describe what he was wearing, and said he would not release his booking photo ""for investigative reasons."" The Joker has long been a fixture in Batman comics and was famously brought to life by the late Heath Ledger in 2008's ""The Dark Knight,"" the predecessor to Friday's release of ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Ledger won a posthumous Academy Award for his sinister portrayal of the iconic villain who encourages anarchists to take over Gotham City. Meanwhile, authorities were faced with the difficult task of entering Holmes' Aurora apartment, which was left rigged with traps. ""It's booby-trapped with various incendiary and chemical devices and trip wires,"" Oates said, adding that it could take days to work through the apartment safely. Five buildings around the apartment building were evacuated, Oates said. Residents were allowed back home briefly Friday night to retrieve such emergency items as medicine. Authorities have postponed until Saturday any attempts to enter the apartment and are bringing in resources from the federal government to help with the situation, Oates said. Shootings cast pall over 'Dark Knight Rises' blockbuster weekend Police say Holmes, 24, dressed head-to-toe in protective tactical gear, set off two devices of some kind before spraying the Century 16 theater with bullets from an AR-15 rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun and at least one of two .40-caliber handguns police recovered at the scene. Oates said the guns were purchased legally by Holmes at stores in the Denver area in the past two months. More than 6,000 rounds of ammunition were also purchased online, according to Oates. A receipt obtained by CNN shows Holmes bought some of the tactical gear, including a vest and magazine pouch, online on July 2. Oates said investigators are ""confident"" that Holmes acted alone. The shooting unfolded inside a darkened theater packed with Batman fans, some in costume for the premiere of the movie. Aurora police said how the suspect entered the theater is still under investigation. A law enforcement source working the investigation told CNN that the gunman walked into the movie theater after purchasing a ticket. After the movie was under way, he went out a rear exit door, propping it open, and gathered weapons before re-entering through the door, the source said. As he re-entered, he tossed in a canister before starting to shoot, according to a second law enforcement source involved in the investigation and several witnesses. Screaming, panicked moviegoers scrambled to escape from the black-clad gunman, who shot at random as he walked up the theater's steps, witnesses said. It was a scene ""straight out of a horror film,"" said Chris Ramos, who was inside the theater. ""He was just literally shooting everyone, like hunting season,"" Ramos said. In Aurora, the agonized seek answers through faith A federal law enforcement official told CNN the man used tear gas, but Oates said Friday afternoon that it was not clear what the substance was. Holmes surrendered without resistance within seven minutes of the first calls from panicked moviegoers reporting the shooting, Oates said. Victims flooded overwhelmed hospitals. One of the injured is just 4 months old, the child's mother said. The infant was treated and released from the hospital. ""I don't know how else to explain it. It's horrific,"" said Tracy Lauzon, director of EMS and trauma services at Aurora Medical Center. Theater shooting unfolds in real time on social media Oates said the man was wearing a ballistic helmet and protective gear for his legs, throat and groin, black gloves and a gas mask. Jennifer Seeger, who survived the attack, said she had seen the man and thought his get-up was part of the entertainment for the film's debut. She said the man first shot toward the ceiling, then began shooting at people. He reloaded during his attack, she said. ""He was just literally just massacring anybody that got up that was trying to run away,"" Seeger said. As of Friday afternoon, 30 people remained hospitalized, 11 of them in critical condition, according to Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper. Holmes is scheduled to appear in an Arapahoe County, Colorado, courtroom Monday morning, Rob McCallum, spokesman for the Colorado Judicial Department, said Friday. The court file was sealed, according to a court order. He is being held in the Arapahoe County jail, Oates said. A statement from Holmes' family in San Diego asked for ""privacy during this difficult time."" ""Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved,"" the statement said, adding, ""We are still trying to process this information."" Shooting turns movie into surreal horror: 'This is real' The FBI is assisting in the investigation, officials said, though it did not appear that the incident was related to terrorism. Prior to Friday's shooting, Holmes' criminal record in Aurora consisted only of a traffic summons. Aspiring sports reporter feared dead in shooting President Barack Obama canceled campaign events Friday, telling supporters at what had been scheduled as a rally in Fort Myers, Florida, that ""there will be other days for politics."" ""This will be a day for prayer and reflection,"" he said, calling for the country to unite as one and support the victims. Flags at the White House were lowered to half-staff Friday afternoon in honor of the victims. iReporter witness: 'We have to run' A law enforcement source said two of the guns used in the attack were purchased at a Bass Pro Shop in Denver, while the two others were bought at separate Gander Mountain Guns outlets in the area. Investigators also found a drum magazine, capable of carrying 100 rounds of ammunition, which was attached to the AR-15 rifle, two law enforcement officials said. KWGN: Witnesses first thought gunfire was part of movie A statement from Bass Pro Shops said its Denver store followed appropriate protocol on the sale of the two weapons. Authorities also searched the suspect's car in the parking lot of the movie theater and found more magazines and ammunition, a federal law enforcement official said. ""It was everywhere,"" the official said. Opinion: Gun control won't stop mass murder Christopher Nolan, director of ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" condemned the shooting as ""savage"" and ""appalling."" ""The movie theatre is my home, and the idea that someone would violate that innocent and hopeful place in such an unbearably savage way is devastating to me,"" Nolan said in a statement on behalf of the cast and crew of the film. ""Nothing any of us can say could ever adequately express our feelings for the innocent victims of this appalling crime, but our thoughts are with them and their families."" Four Aurora theaters showing ""The Dark Knight Rises"" will have extra security for the foreseeable future ""out of an abundance of caution,"" Oates said. Warner Bros., the studio behind the film, canceled the movie's Paris premiere, while New York police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said his officers would watch over screenings of ""The Dark Knight"" in the city to prevent copycat shootings. AMC Theatres, meanwhile, said it would not permit guests in costumes that make others uncomfortable, nor will it allow face-covering masks or fake weapons. 911 tape: 'I need somebody to shut this movie off' Aurora, a Denver suburb, is about 13 miles from Littleton, Colorado -- site of the April 1999 Columbine High School massacre. In that incident, two teenage students, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, armed themselves with guns and bombs and shot people inside the high school.

(AP) -- A U.S. Navy veteran who served three tours of duty in the Middle East. A 6-year-old girl excited about her swimming classes. A Target employee who shielded his girlfriend and her brother with his own body. They and nine others were killed in the shooting rampage during a midnight showing of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" in a Denver suburb. Here are their stories: ___ Jonathan Blunk had high hopes for the future, with plans to re-enlist in the Navy and the goal of becoming a Navy SEAL. The 26-year-old served three tours in the Persian Gulf and North Arabian Sea between 2004 and 2009, said close friend James Gill of Brighton, Colo. ""It was guts or glory for him,"" Gill told The Associated Press. ""It always surprised me that he didn't serve in a situation more on the front line. He wanted to be a first responder on the front line."" Blunk was also a certified firefighter and emergency medical technician, Gill added. He died in the shooting Friday after throwing himself in front of friend Jansen Young and saving her life, she told the NBC ""Today"" show. He told her to stay down. ""That's something he would do,"" Gill said. ""If he was going to choose a way to die, that's how he wanted to go -- defending someone from a (person) like that."" Blunk, a 2004 graduate of Hug High School in Reno, Nev., most recently worked at a hardware store. His estranged wife, Chantel Blunk, lives with their 4-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son in Sparks, Nev. ___ Alexander J. Boik, known as AJ, recently graduated from high school and was to start classes at the Rocky Mountain College of Art and Design in the fall, The Denver Post reported. The family said in a statement that the 18-year-old was loved by all who knew him and was dating ""a beautiful young lady"" who was with him at the theater and survived. ""We want to try and focus on the beautiful lives that were ended and not the evil that is responsible,"" the family said. A friend, Jordan Crofter, described Boik as someone who ""didn't hold anything back. He was just his own person."" ""He was a ball of joy. He was never sad or depressed. He wanted everybody to be happy,"" Crofter told The Associated Press. Crofter said Boik played baseball from when he was a child through his junior year in high school. He said Boik and his girlfriend were the ""perfect couple"" and people expected them to get married. ""If he were still here, he'd try to make everyone have a positive outlook of the situation and not allow it to affect their outlook of life,"" Crofter said. ___ Jesse Childress was an Air Force cyber-systems operator based at Buckley Air Force Base in Aurora. Air Force Capt. Andrew Williams described the 29-year-old from Thornton, Colo., as knowledgeable, experienced and respectful. ""We're going to miss him incredibly,"" he said. Tech Sgt. Alejandro Sanchez, a co-worker, told the AP that Childress was his good friend and they were on a bowling team together. ""He would help anyone and always was great for our Air Force unit,"" he said. Another co-worker, Ashley Wassinger, said Childress ""was a great person fun to be with, always positive and laughing."" ""Really just an amazing person, and I am so lucky to have been his friend,"" she said. ___ Gordon Cowden loved life and his family, and he had gone to the midnight movie premiere with his two teenage children. At 51, he was the oldest of the victims killed in the shooting. He lived in Aurora, but was described as a ""true Texas gentleman"" in a family statement. He loved the outdoors and owned his own business. ""A quick witted world traveler with a keen sense of humor, he will be remembered for his devotion to his children and for always trying his best to do the right thing, no matter the obstacle,"" his family said. His teenage children escaped the shooting unharmed. His family declined to be interviewed in their request for privacy but expressed appreciation for words of concern offered in the wake of the shooting. ""Our hearts go out to everyone that has been harmed by this senseless tragedy,"" they said. ___ Jessica Ghawi recently wrote a blog post after surviving a shooting at a Toronto mall, saying it showed her ""how fragile life was."" Friends say the 24-year-old, who moved to Colorado from Texas about a year ago, didn't let the June 2 shooting in Toronto change her outlook on life as she pursued a career in sports journalism. ""I think she even looked at that like, 'Hey, even after that, I'm able to pursue my dream,'"" said Peter Burns, a radio sports show host with Mile High Sports Radio in Denver, where Ghawi recently interned. That shooting left two dead and several injured. Her blog post last month said: ""I saw the victims of a senseless crime. I saw lives change. ""I was reminded that we don't know when or where our time on Earth will end. When or where we will breathe our last breath."" Former colleagues described her as ambitious and hardworking. She went by the name ""Redfield,"" a play on her red hair, because it was easy to say and remember, both professionally and on her social media accounts. She was a regular tweeter and her last post to the micro-blogging website stated in all capital letters, ""movie doesn't start for 20 minutes."" ___ John Larimer was a Navy sailor based at Buckley Air Force Base, where he was a cryptologic technician -- a job that the Navy says on its website should be filled by someone with ""exceptionally good character, above-average writing and speaking skills, a good memory, curiosity and resourcefulness."" Those who knew him described him in similar terms. The 27-year-old and another active service member, Air Force Sgt. Jesse Childress, were killed in the shooting rampage, the military said Saturday. Larimer, who grew up in the Chicago suburb of Crystal Lake, Ill., joined the service just over a year ago, the Navy said. ""A valued member of our Navy team, he will be missed by all who knew him. My heart goes out to John's family, friends and loved ones, as well as to all the victims of this horrible tragedy,"" said Cmdr. Jeffrey Jakuboski, his commanding officer, in a written statement. A family member told the Daily Herald newspaper in Arlington Heights, Ill., that Larimer was the youngest of five siblings. Neighbors in his hometown recalled his sense of humor. ""We love you, John, and we will miss you always,"" his parents said in a statement. ___ As the attack in the movie theater unfolded, Matt McQuinn dove in front of his girlfriend and her older brother to shield them from the gunfire. He died protecting them, said Rob Scott, an Ohio attorney retained by the families of McQuinn and his girlfriend, Samantha Yowler. Scott confirmed McQuinn's death to The Associated Press. He was 27. ""Unfortunately, Matt McQuinn perished from the injuries he sustained during the tragic events that unfolded in Denver, Colorado, and went home to be with his maker,"" Scott said in a statement. ""As both families mourn the loss of Matt, they ask for everyone to give them distance and time. Again, the families thank everyone for their love, prayers and ask that we respect their families' wishes."" Yowler was recovering from surgery after she was shot in the knee at the theater. Her 32-year-old brother, Nick Yowler, who also shielded his sister, was not injured. McQuinn and Yowler moved to Colorado from Ohio last fall. A Colorado co-worker told the Springfield News-Sun that McQuinn and Samantha Yowler worked with her at Target. ""They're really fun people. We always go out together,"" said Melissa Downen. ___ The death of 23-year-old Micayla Medek was heartbreaking, said her father's cousin, Anita Busch. But Busch said the news also was a relief for the family after an agonizing day of waiting. ""I hope this evil act ... doesn't shake people's faith in God,"" she said. Micayla Medek lived in the Denver suburb of Westminster, Colo., and attended Aurora Community College. Her aunt, Jenny Zakovich, 57, of South Milwaukee, Wis., said Medek and her father were both huge Green Bay Packers fans. ___ The youngest of the victims killed in the attack was Veronica Moser-Sullivan. She had just learned to swim, and at age 6, she was a ""great little girl, excited about life,"" her great-aunt Annie Dalton said. ""She should be at 6 years old."" Her mother, Ashley Moser, remains hospitalized with gunshot wounds to her neck and abdomen. She has been in and out of consciousness and asking for her daughter during moments of lucidity. ""Nobody can tell her about it,"" Dalton said. ""She is in critical condition, but all she's asking about is her daughter."" ___ Alex Sullivan's family called him ""their real life super hero,"" and he was at ""The Dark Knight Rises"" premiere celebrating his 27th birthday and his first wedding anniversary. ""Alex was a gentle giant, known and loved by so many. He always had a glowing smile on his face and he made friends with everyone. Alex enjoyed all sorts of movies, was an avid comic book geek and loved the New York Mets,"" the family said in a statement. Sullivan had a warm smile and an innocence that endeared him to people, said Shelly Fradkin, whose son Brian was good friends with Sullivan. She sat next to a makeshift memorial Friday near the theater where an oversized birthday card with a photo of a smiling Sullivan was displayed. ""He's amazing. He was just a big teddy bear. Great hugs,"" she said. She said Sullivan was such a big movie fan that he took jobs at theaters just to see movies. Fradkin and her son spent an ""excruciating"" day trying to find Sullivan before learning of his death, she said. ""We're shocked. We're numb. We're sick,"" she said. ""Our hearts are broken, and we're crushed."" ___ Alexander C. Teves, 24, of Phoenix, earned a master's degree in counseling psychology in June from University of Denver. He was a lovable person who made friends quickly and had a lot of them, said his grandfather, Carlo Iacovelli of Barnegat, N.J. As a boy, Teves moved from New Jersey to Phoenix with his parents. Iacovelli and his wife wintered there and spent a lot of time with him. ""He was what you might call an ideal grandson,"" Iacovelli said. ""He was a fun guy. He loved to eat."" Teves was planning to become a psychiatrist, his grandfather said. ""He had a lot to look forward to,"" Iacovelli said. ___ Rebecca Ann Wingo had started a job several months ago as a customer relations representative at a mobile medical imaging company. She was 32. Shannon Dominguez, who worked with Wingo on weekends, said she was friendly with everyone and always seemed to be in a good mood. ""I didn't really know her well but she had a really bubbly personality,"" Dominguez said. ""She was a pretty happy person. She just never really seemed ... like with work, she never got irritated. She was pretty happy to be here."" Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. July 23, 2012:  In this file photo, James Holmes, accused of killing 12 people in Friday's shooting rampage in an Aurora, Colo., movie theater, appears in Arapahoe County District Court with defense attorney Tamara Brady in Centennial, Colo. (AP) The suspect in the Colorado movie theater massacre is reportedly claiming to have amnesia. James Holmes, who is accused of killing 12 people and injuring 58 when he allegedly opened fire on a crowded Aurora movie theater at the midnight showing of ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" is reportedly telling jail staff he doesn't know why he’s in prison. ""He claims he doesn't know why he's in jail,"" an unnamed jailhouse worker told The New York Daily News. ""He asked 'Why am I here?'"" Holmes, 24, also reportedly was complaining about the food and of a stomachache, the worker told the newspaper. ""The guy killed 12 people, and he's upset that he' not getting a four-star meal?"" the unidentified Arapahoe County Detention Center worker told The Daily News, suggesting Holmes is ""faking it."" Holmes remains under 23-hour lockdown, leaving his cell only once a day. Neighbors and friends in San Diego, where Holmes grew up, have described him as brilliant and sometimes awkward but never displaying signs of violence. On Thursday a judge barred the University of Colorado Denver from releasing any records about the former graduate student’s time there. What happened to Holmes during his time in the school’s neuroscience program is one of the many mysteries lingering after last Friday’s mass shooting. Click for more from The Daily News.

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg (AP) New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg doubled down this week on his call for more gun control following the Colorado massacre – suggesting police strike until additional laws are passed. Bloomberg, the Republican-turned-independent, wasted little time in calling for tougher gun laws, saying just hours after the mass shooting early Friday at a movie theater that President Obama and Mitt Romney must address the gun violence issue. Then on Monday night, when asked by cable TV host Piers Morgan why Americans don’t demand tougher laws after such a tragedy, he said:  ""I would take it one step further. I don't understand why police officers across this country don't stand up collectively and say, 'We're going to go on strike. We're not going to protect you unless you, the public, through your legislature, do what's required to keep us safe.'"" Bloomberg, co-founder of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, backpedaled a bit on Tuesday. “I didn’t mean literally go on strike. In fact, in New York (police) can’t go on strike. There’s a law against it,"" he said. However, he continued to press Obama, Romney and other officials for change. “We’re not getting any help from Washington ... the current candidates or those who want to come into office,” he said, according to The Wall Street Journal. “And yet our people are getting killed every single day.” When questioned why he brought police into the debate, though no officer was shot in the Colorado incident, he said police have more at stake. “Because they get killed, and they have families,” Bloomberg said. New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly told The Journal that the mayor made the comments out of frustration. Bloomberg on Friday said that “soothing words are nice, but maybe it’s time that the two people who want to be president of the United States stand up and tell us what they are going to do about (gun violence) because this is obviously a problem across the country.” Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox Subscribed You've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!

Like the familiar plot-lines of a Hollywood blockbuster we already know what happens next. In fact, news reports, op-eds, and blogs already have a painful familiarity. An event that should be rare and unexpected has become the latest sequel in a long series of mass shootings, and is prequel to the next. We have been in Aurora, Colorado before, many times, and will again. Today feels so damn familiar, like any well-known story, and the familiarity makes me even more sad and angry than I would otherwise be, and I hope you too. We wouldn’t be in such a well-known story, essentially inside well-established social conventions, if we didn’t have such a violent past. Plus, these conventions re-establish what normal feels like so we end up stuck in place with ever more efficient people-killing technologies (i.e., assualt weapons) getting into the hands of people who want to use them. While Aurora is sequel to the last shooting, it’s prequel to the next. Here’s the trailer for the Aurora version: Stories, often inspiring stories, will be told about how surviving victims and the grief-stricken heal, about people finding ways to move on with life. Because our built-in psychological resilience is strong, most won’t need more than time, ritual, and the love of family and community--including what the nation as a whole can provide. But not all. We’ll also hear how some get trapped in trauma and need additional help. And then some of the survivors will follow in the footsteps of people like James Brady and Representative Carolyn McCarthy and join the growing legion of gun-control advocates who have had their bodies and lives mangled by a savage shooting. Some political leaders will strike the exact right tone of mourning and compassion, like both President Obama and Governor Romney did yesterday. Or Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper who described “an anger that can’t find focus” thereby giving everyone words unique to this version of the familiar story. And others will show themselves to be craven opportunists, like Representative Louie Gohmert who used the shootings to stoke the fires of fear and prejudice. Another part of the national response ritual will soon be stories about the “mind of the monster.” This will reach a crescendo when the legal proceedings take place. What were his demons?  What led James Holmes to spend 6 weeks gathering assault weapons and then booby-trapping his apartment before shooting-up a crowded theater while supposedly claiming to the The Joker? Mental-health professionals like me will use this as “teaching moment” to educate about mental illness. We’ll try to turn this into a moment when we can reduce the stigma of mental illness. And we’ll bloviate about the need for more and better access to high-quality mental health care. All to little effect. Just today, Saturday, the victims’ families were notified. Burials have yet to be planned. Shock has not yet given way to grief. And still the talking heads are getting ready for what is the big blockbuster special effect explosion in stories of American gun savagery: the gun control debate. Irrational and polarized positions will talk past each other. And it will be loud. On one side we will see well-intentioned reformers reasonably arguing the need to regulate people-killing machines. “I don’t want to worry about my kids going to the movies” will be the rallying cry. Unfortunately, you can’t reason with passion, and people are passionate about their guns. Continuing to throw rationality against the winds of passion is itself rather irrational. On the other side will be the irrational champions of vigilante justice passionately defending their right to unlimited weapons. If only the theater had been filled with George Zimmermans all would be well (of course, they would have had to have kevlar-piercing weapons, as well as being shooters equipped with night vision googles, perfect aim, and the steely nerves of a well-trained Navy SEAL). The outcome of all this will be that the side with the most money (i.e., the NRA) will once again shift the conversation their way, guaranteeing yet another version of America’s mass shooting story. When the credits roll on the Aurora murders most of us will see a tracking shot moving from close-up to a distance. And from that distance Aurora will seemingly be at peace. But it won’t be. Just like other places scarred by gun violence. It especially won’t be for the people who had their lives mangled by assault weapons intentionally fired in a confined public space. Nor will the next town be at peace, not when violence is about to erupt there. As this sequel fades to black, everyone knows another version is brewing someplace, sometime. Our American story of  savage gun violence will be told yet again. I'm a clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst.

The Denver Post website posted a photo of Bale, who plays Bruce Wayne/Batman in the film, posing with one victim, Carey Rottman, at the Medical Center of Aurora. The actor had asked the hospital not to notify the media about his visit, but the news leaked after Rottman's friends tweeted the photo. Bale met seven victims in all -- five people being treated at the Medical Center and two who came from another hospital to meet him, Medical Center President Bill Voloch told the Post. The actor and his wife also met with several doctors, police officers and EMTs who were first responders to the shooting, which occurred at a midnight Friday screening of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" at a movie theater in Aurora, a Denver suburb. Bale was at the Medical Center for about two and a half hours, and spent about 10 minutes with each person. ""It was good for the patients,"" Voloch said. ""We hope it was therapeutic for them, and all the staff really appreciated him coming."" Bale on Saturday had released a statement offering his condolences to the victims. ""Words cannot express the horror that I feel,"" he said in the statement. ""I cannot begin to truly understand the pain and grief of the victims and their loved ones, but my heart goes out to them."" A spokeswoman for Warner Bros., the studio behind the film, on Tuesday said Bale was in Aurora ""as himself,"" and not on behalf of the studio. Coincidentally, a Facebook user reportedly had begun an online petition to get Bale to visit the youngest victims of the tragedy dressed as Batman. ""They need to know heroes can be real, too, not just the bad guys,"" the user wrote. More around the Web • Sharon Osbourne wrote in a tweet to fellow judge Howard Stern on Tuesday that she's not returning to ""America's Got Talent."" Osbourne's reps had not commented. NBC entertainment Chairman Bob Greenblatt later told TheWrap.com that Osbourne's tweet surprised the network, and that it ""absolutely"" wants her back. • With her family-centered reality show gone, Kate Gosselin reportedly is now looking to do a dating reality show, according to E! News. The show does not yet have a network. • Irish actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers, who starred on Showtime's ""The Tudors,"" will play the title role in the new NBC series ""Dracula.""

A gunman in a gas mask barged into a crowded Denver-area theater during a midnight premiere of the Batman movie on Friday, hurled a gas canister and then opened fire, killing 12 people and injuring at least 50 others in one of the deadliest mass shootings in recent U.S. history.  A Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputy withholds toy guns from Batman fans from Indiana at Universal CityWalk in Los Angeles.  New York City police officers stand in front of a midtown Manhattan movie theater as people arrive for a screening of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" on Friday.  Some theaters and police around the U.S. stepped up security at daytime showings of the new Batman movie Friday after the massacre in Colorado, and while many fans were undeterred by the tragedy, others were nervous about going to see the film. Two police officers were stationed outside the AMC theater in New York’s Times Square, which had showings of the “The Dark Knight Rises” beginning every 20 minutes. Later in the day, the officers gave way to a police cruiser that was parked out front with an officer in it. The precautions were taken after a gunman in Aurora, Colo., wearing a gas mask set off a gas canister and fired into a crowded theater in the Denver suburb at a midnight opening of the movie, killing 12 people and injuring at least 50 others, authorities said. The National Association of Theatre Owners announced Friday that it is “reviewing security procedures” in theaters after the attack. Locally, the Orange County Sheriff’s Department said they will be monitoring activity around movie theaters tonight. No added enforcement has been planned so far. Officers in Orange were informed about the deadly mass shooting at the Denver-area theater. “The watch commanders for each shift will be discussing the incident in more detail, along with extra patrol checks for our theaters,” Orange police Sgt. Fred Lopez said. In online comments, moviegoers said the attack had left them edgy. “Not going to the movies for a while,” tweeted one Costa Mesa woman. “No place is safe.” Allison Sweetland of Huntington Beach, who goes to school in Denver, said she was shocked by the tragedy as she waited in line at the Century 20 Huntington Beach at Bella Terra cineplex. “I’m grateful that none of my Colorado friends were in that theater,” she said. “I can’t believe it. My prayers go out to those families.” Another, moviegoer, Matthew Pate of Huntington Beach, called mass shooting “a tragedy for the entire nation.”: “I am always surprised by the ability of people to commit such violent crimes,” he said. “I am also glad that both presidential candidates suspended their campaigns in light of the tragedy.” Christine Cooley, who works for the University of Florida at a campus installation near Tampa, Fla., said she and her 15-year-old daughter were stunned to wake up to the news. Cooley said her daughter has sworn off going to the movies. “It’s tainted the movie completely for her,” Cooley said. “It’s summertime. That’s a big movie time for teenagers. That movie is off the list now. Movie theaters in general are off her summer to-do list because of that.” Cooley said she tried to explain that the shooting was random and not an indication of security at theaters in general, “but I can see where she’s coming from. Why put yourself in harm’s way?” At the United Artists Riverview Stadium 17 in Philadelphia, a steady stream of people headed in for morning showings of “The Dark Knight Rises.” Staff members said that there was extra security, but that that was normal for big movies — and not because of the shooting in Colorado. Neal Mates, 38, a professed “film geek,” said: “Shootings can happen anywhere. … I think it’s silly to blame the film.” Executives of St. Louis-based Wehrenberg Theatres had discussions before dawn with managers of its 15 cinemas in Illinois, Missouri, Minnesota and Iowa, spokeswoman Kelly Hoskins said. She said the company feels comfortable with security already in place and plans no changes. She said she hopes other theater chains don’t panic and cancel showings. “That just wouldn’t be good,” she said. “It’s like a terrorist attack — you don’t want them to think we’re all scared.” The National Association of Theater Owners said in a statement that its members are “working closely with local law enforcement agencies and reviewing security procedures.” ——— Register staff writers Denisse Salazar, Alejandra Molina and the Associated Press contributed to this report.

Online,http://www.eonline.com/,"The eyes were on The Dark Knight Rises' weekend number, but the tell was possibly in Spider-Man's. And Ice Age's. And so on and so on. Much of Hollywood, and not just the new Christopher Nolan Batman movie, looked to take a hit in the wake of the Aurora, Colo., theater shooting. The Dark Knight Rises, with much of its business staked in advance-ticket sales made before the rampage at one of its midnight screenings, emerged on top, with a $160.9 million Friday-Sunday debut, per numbers released by its studio. Opening-weekend audiences graded the movie an A. Is Dark Knight Rises Too Hard Too Watch After Aurora? The debut is the third-biggest on record, and the top take for a film shown strictly in 2-D and 2-D IMAX. But it's not quite what was expected of the followup to the box-office-record-setter The Dark Knight. ""We'll never be able to know how much money this tragedy cost Warner Bros.,"" Exhibitor Relations box-office analyst Jeff Bock said Monday. ""I think it's safe to say it [would've made] $15 million-$20 million more if that had never happened."" Elsewhere, Ice Age: Continental Drift ($20.4 million), the previous weekend's No. 1 film, saw ticket revenue plunge nearly 60 percent, while The Amazing Spider-Man ($10.9 million), which lost a good chunk of screens, was down nearly 70 percent. The comedy Ted ($10 million) dipped 55 percent. Among holdover films in the Top 10, Pixar's Brave ($6 million) did the best, with business down just 46 percent. Will Batman's Legacy Forever Be Marred? ""The family demographic possibly stayed away from The Dark Knight Rises, and they stayed away from films in general,"" Bock said, ""and that's not a surprise given what happened."" Hollywood.com's Paul Dergarabedian said the dips also could be attributed to the Batman movie's domination of the multiplex. ""it's hard to tell,"" he said in an email. It likewise was too soon to tell what Aurora meant, or will mean, to The Dark Knight Rises. Its opening-day gross of $75.8 million, bolstered by strong advance-ticket sellouts, was the third-biggest in Hollywood history. But take away the midnight portion of the opening-day performance, and The Dark Knight Rises ran behind 2008's The Dark Knight all weekend long: Friday's non-midnight gross was about $45.8 million versus the $48.7 million non-midnight take for The Dark Knight; Saturday came in at $44.9 million versus The Dark Knight's $47.7 million; and Sunday brought in $40.2 million versus the earlier film's $43.6 million gross on the same day. The Dark Knight Rises' opening-night midnight screenings were the only ones that occurred either before the Aurora shooting or before news of the incident broke wide. Overall, Hollywood ticket revenue was up significantly over last week and the same weekend last year, two periods which lacked for a Batman-size blockbuster. About the best thing The Dark Knight Rises, if not the film industry, has going for it is the A grade, usually a sign of good box-office things to come. The numbers are the first in days. The results, usually issued on Sunday morning, were delayed when Warner Bros., the company behind The Dark Knight Rises, and the other major studios opted to remain silent over the weekend. Twelve people were killed and many more wounded in the largest mass shooting in U.S. history at an opening-night, midnight-Friday screening of Dark Knight Rises in Aurora.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Then-Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama in 2012. (AP) SAN FRANCISCO  – The acrimonious presidential campaign eases back into action Monday after a weekend pause for the nation to absorb the shock of a horrific mass shooting at a Colorado movie theater. The massacre stalled a race for the White House that has become increasingly heated in recent weeks. President Barack Obama, Republican rival Mitt Romney and their advisers are now weighing how soon after the shootings to resume their attacks or whether to temper the tenor of the campaign. ""There's not a playbook for this,"" said Jen Psaki, Obama's campaign spokeswoman. ""Just like everybody, we're taking this day by day."" Both campaigns were keeping their largely negative television advertisements off the air in Colorado, a key battleground state in the November election. The Obama campaign said it would not advertise in Colorado for the rest of the week; Romney campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul said the Republican's ads in the state would be down at least through Monday. The campaigns pulled the ads Friday, part of a widespread dialing back of election year politicking after shootings that left 12 dead and dozens more injured. The candidates and their surrogates also canceled campaign events and media interviews for much of the weekend. Romney made a low-key return to political activity Sunday night in northern California, where he courted Republican donors at three campaign fundraisers. Romney told supporters he would tone down his political rhetoric, at least for the night, in ""keeping with the seriousness of the day."" The former Massachusetts governor avoided attacking Obama by name. Obama on Sunday dashed for Aurora, Colo., the site of the shooting. He spent nearly three hours in emotional private meetings with the families of the dead and also met with some of those injured in the attacks. ""I hope that over the next several days, next several months, we all reflect on how we can do something about some of the senseless violence that ends up marring this country,"" Obama said. Romney said Obama's trip was ""the right thing for the president to be doing on this day."" From Colorado, Obama flew to San Francisco to start a previously scheduled three-day trip that includes a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Reno, Nev., campaign fundraisers in California, Oregon and Washington state, and a speech to the National Urban League convention in New Orleans. But the campaign cancelled a rally planned for Portland, Ore. Officials said they felt the tone of the larger event would be inappropriate. Romney also spent Sunday night in San Francisco following his fundraisers. Like Obama, he was to return to campaigning in earnest Monday, with a roundtable discussion with small business leaders and a fundraiser in southern California. Much of Romney's week will be focused on America's role abroad. He'll deliver a foreign policy-focused speech at the VFW convention Tuesday. The next day he will launch his first trip abroad as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. He's expected to attend the opening ceremonies of the Olympics in London and meet with foreign dignitaries in England, Israel and Poland. The Colorado shooting halted the campaign in the midst of a particularly negative stretch. With the race deadlocked less than four months from Election Day, both camps have been ramping up their attacks as they seek to gain an edge. The Obama campaign, trying to overcome the weak U.S. economy, has pummeled Romney's business record and financial secrecy. Led by Obama himself, the campaign has pushed the wealthy Romney to release more of his personal tax returns and raised questions about whether his tenure at the helm of private equity firm Bain Capital coincided with outsourcing and bankruptcies. Romney responded with his own harsh criticism, attacking Obama as anti-private sector for saying: ""If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen."" The Romney campaign used the phrase in an ad last week. Friday's shooting also put fresh focus on the issue of gun control, which has played virtually no role in a race focused on the economy. Last year, following the killing of six people and wounding of then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson, Ariz., Obama called for a series of steps to ""keep those irresponsible, law-breaking few from getting their hands on a gun in the first place."" But Psaki, his campaign spokeswoman, said it was ""too early to say"" whether the president would propose any new gun control policies following the Colorado shootings.

The director of “Bowling for Columbine,” a documentary about the 1999 massacre at a Colorado high school, said the president has to be the “leader” on the issue and praised his speech in Aurora, Colo., as “powerful,"" but added that he wondered what Obama would do if his two daughters had been in the theater where last week's mass shooting took place. “And yet when he brought his own children into it, when he said, you know, my two daughters go to the movies and what if it were them — well I guess if President Obama is watching right now, and I say this with all due respect: What if it were them?” Moore said on “Piers Morgan Tonight” in a clip released before the 9 p.m. broadcast. “What if it were them last Thursday night? Would you stand at the microphone the next day and say I feel your pain and, you know, the existing gun laws, that’s what he said, the existing laws are enough. Is that really what you’d say, Mr. President? I don’t think so.” Moore's temperature rose as he called for people to ""rise up and say, ""Dammit, this is not the America I'm going to live in.'"" ""And I am not going to come on another damn TV shows, either, after the next one of these shootings, Pierce, because I haven't done it for 10 years,"" he added. ""To be nice to you, and you're a good guy, and you made a good case to me to come on. But I'm sick of this. I refuse it.

Citing box office insiders, The Hollywood Reporter, Los Angeles Times, New York Times and other media outlets reported today that the latest Batman sequel earned $160 to $162 million. That amount would best the $158.4 million debut of ""The Dark Knight"" in 2008 and give ""Dark Knight Rises"" the third-highest domestic weekend opening ever after the 3-D films ""The Avengers"" with $207.4 million and ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows — Part 2"" with $169.2 million. Tickets for 3-D films cost a few more dollars than 2-D screenings, netting extra cash at the box office. Movies released in 3-D typically earn under half of their income in 3-D screenings, sometimes as little as a third. Sony, Fox, Disney, Paramount, Universal and Lionsgate joined ""Dark Knight Rises"" distributor Warner Bros in publicly withholding their usual revenue reports out of respect for the victims and their families. Box-office tracking service Rentrak also did not report figures following the Aurora, Colo., shootings that killed 12 and injured 58 at a midnight screening of the new Batman sequel on Friday. ""This tragedy did not seem to impact the box office in a major way,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, an analyst for Hollywood.com who specializes in box office. ""For this film to still be in the rarified air of the top-three openings of all time is phenomenal, given the unfortunate circumstances surrounding the release of this film."" Dergarabedian noted that the box-office ranking of director Christopher Nolan's final installment of his Batman trilogy would not be official until Warner Bros. and other studios release their final weekend box-office tallies Monday.

86430745,2012-07-23 15:49:59,Colorado rampage suspect is in court for 1st time,http://www.mercurynews.com/crime-courts/ci_21137794/colorado-rampage-suspect-is-court-1st-time?source=rss,en,True,,35,San Jose Mercury News,http://www.mercurynews.com/,"Trending: CENTENNIAL, Colo. — Wearing orange-red hair and looking dazed, the man accused of going on a deadly shooting rampage at the opening of the new Batman movie appeared Monday in court for the first time. With his eyes at times downcast, James Holmes sat in maroon jailhouse jumpsuit as the judge advised him of the case. Holmes, 24, has been held in solitary confinement at an Arapahoe County detention facility since Friday. Holmes is being held on suspicion of first-degree murder, and he could also face additional counts of aggravated assault and weapons violations. Authorities have disclosed that he is refusing to cooperate and that it could take months to learn what prompted the horrific attack on midnight moviegoers at a Batman film premiere. Eighteenth Judicial District Attorney Carol Chambers said Monday her office is considering pursuing the death penalty against Holmes. She said a decision will be made in consultation with victims’ families. Holmes has been assigned a public defender, and Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates said the former doctoral student has “lawyered up” since his arrest early Friday, following the shooting at an Aurora theater that left 12 dead and 58 wounded, some critically. “He’s not talking to us,” the chief said. Holmes has been held without bond at the lockup in Centennial, Colo., south of Denver and about 13 miles from the Aurora theater. His hearing is at the same complex, and security there was tight early Monday. Uniformed sheriff’s deputies were stationed outside, and deputies were positioned on the roofs of both court buildings at the Arapahoe County Justice Center. Police have said Holmes began buying guns at Denver-area stores nearly two months before Friday’s shooting and that he received at least 50 packages in four months at his home and at school. Holmes’ apartment was filled with trip wires, explosive devices and unknown liquids, requiring police, FBI officials and bomb squad technicians to evacuate surrounding buildings while spending most of Saturday disabling the booby traps. Investigators found a Batman mask inside Holmes’ apartment after they finished clearing the home, a law enforcement official close to the investigation said Sunday on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media. Officials at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus were looking into whether Holmes used his position in a graduate program to collect hazardous materials, but that disclosure was one of the few it has made three days after the massacre. It remained unclear whether Holmes’ professors and other students at his 35-student Ph.D. program noticed anything unusual about his behavior. His reasons for quitting the program in June also remained a mystery. Holmes recently took an intense oral exam that marks the end of the first year. University officials would not say if he passed, citing privacy concerns. Amid the continuing investigation of Holmes and his background, Sunday was a day for healing and remembrance in Aurora, with the community holding a prayer vigil and President Barack Obama arriving to visit with families of the victims. Obama said he told the families that “all of America and much of the world is thinking about them.” He met with them at the University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora, which treated 23 of the people injured in the mass shooting; 10 remain there, seven hurt critically. Congregations across Colorado prayed for the shooting victims and their relatives. Elderly churchgoers at an aging Presbyterian church within walking distance near Holmes’ apartment joined in prayer, though none had ever met him. Several thousand gathered for healing at the vigil Sunday night. “You’re not alone, and you will get through it,” said the Rev. Kenneth Berve, pastor at Grant Avenue United Methodist Church and a witness to Friday’s horrors. “We can’t let fear and anger take control of us.” Meanwhile, the owner of a gun range told the AP that Holmes applied to join the club last month but never became a member because of his behavior and a “bizarre” message on his voicemail. Holmes emailed an application to join the Lead Valley Range in Byers on June 25 in which he said he was not a user of illegal drugs or a convicted felon, said owner Glenn Rotkovich. When Rotkovich called to invite him to a mandatory orientation the following week, Rotkovich said he heard a message on Holmes’ voicemail that was “bizarre — guttural, freakish at best.” Rotkovich left two other messages but eventually told his staff to watch out for Holmes at the July 1 orientation and not to accept him into the club, Rotkovich said. The pastor for the suspect’s family recalled a shy boy who was driven to succeed academically. “He wasn’t an extrovert at all. If there was any conversation, it would be because I initiated it, not because he did,” said Jerald Borgie, senior pastor of Penasquitos Lutheran Church. Borgie said he never saw the suspect mingle with others his age at church. He last spoke with Holmes about six years ago. “He had some goals. He wanted to succeed, he wanted to go out, and he wanted to be the best,” Borgie said. “He took pride in his academic abilities. A good student. He didn’t brag about it.” During the attack early Friday, Holmes allegedly set off gas canisters and used a semiautomatic rifle, a shotgun and a pistol to open fire on theater-goers, Oates said. Holmes had bought the weapons at local gun stores in the past two months. He recently bought 6,000 rounds of ammunition over the Internet, the chief said. The gunman’s semiautomatic assault rifle jammed during the attack, forcing him to switch to another gun with less firepower, a federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press. That malfunction and weapons switch might have saved some lives. Oates said a 100-round ammunition drum was found in the theater, but he said he didn’t know whether it jammed or emptied. The shooting was the worst in the U.S. since the Nov. 5, 2009, attack at Fort Hood, Texas. An Army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 soldiers and civilians and wounding more than two dozen others. —— Associated Press writers Kristen Wyatt and Thomas Peipert in Aurora; Dan Elliott, Gillian Flaccus and Colleen Slevin in Denver; and Alicia A.

86436526,2012-07-23 20:59:18,"Little to gain, lots to lose for Obama and Romney on guns",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_latest/~3/hm6wMrHclWU/index.html,en,False,,1095,CNN,http://www.cnn.com/,"Don't expect President Barack Obama or Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney to talk about the issue of gun control in the wake of last week's deadly mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado -- there's little to gain from bringing up the issue. While gun rights issues are split along party lines, independents, who will determine the outcome of the election, are also divided over the issue. Both men and their surrogates have steered clear of discussing thorny Second Amendment issues since the shootings. Polls, such as one conducted by the Pew Research Center in April, have found that 55% of highly coveted independents feel it is ""more important to protect gun ownership than to control guns,"" with 40% saying controlling gun ownership is more important. The poll also found that 72% of Republicans feel protecting gun ownership is important, while 27% of Democrats feel that way. This tracks with similar polls conducted after other mass shootings such as last year's assassination attempt on Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona, in Tucson in which six people were killed. A Pew poll conducted after the shooting found that ""49% of Americans say it is more important to protect the rights of Americans to own guns, while 46% say it is more important to control gun ownership."" And the issue likely won't play well in a battleground state such as Colorado, with its culture of strong and proud gun ownership but a recent history of deadly mass shootings such as Friday's theater massacre and a similar event in 1999 at Columbine High School, said Alan Lizotte, dean and professor at the State University of New York at Albany's School of Criminal Justice. ""It's political suicide to"" to advocate greater gun control in Colorado, Lizotte said. Colorado is also a state with a fast-growing segment of independent voters, according to a study by the Third Way, a Washington-based, moderate-leaning think tank. ""No politician in their right mind would say anything about gun control in Colorado because you simply won't get it,"" said Lizotte, who grew up in Grand Junction, Colorado. ""Growing up I didn't know anyone who didn't own a gun."" So despite New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, calling for Obama and Romney to debate gun issues, the two candidates are unlikely to move gun policy discussions from anything more than a back-burner debate. That's because in moving the conversation about guns front and center both politicians could get burned. Romney has had a mixed history on the issue of gun control, according to the Pulitzer Prize-winning PolitiFact website, which grades the accuracy of political comments. ""During his campaigns for statewide Massachusetts office, Romney openly spoke of his support for -- to use his words from 2002 -- 'tough gun laws,' "" PolitiFact found. During the 2008 Republican primaries, Romney said, ""I don't line up 100 percent with the NRA."" However, the GOP presidential hopeful's ""pro-gun rhetoric has become sharper and virtually all nuance was erased. He even touted the bill he signed in Massachusetts by scrubbing any reference to the provisions banning assault weapons,"" the site found. The site noted that ""even in the 1994 campaign (Romney) didn't take a full-blown, pro-gun-control stand."" And though Romney's messaging sounds more pro-gun, he ""has never gone so far as to specifically renounce his prior positions, such as his signing of the 2004 Massachusetts law,"" an assault weapons ban mirrored after a similar federal ban. Romney earned a ""Half Flip"" from the site for messaging on guns that ""has been more on the rhetorical level than substantive."" Meanwhile, Democrats long gave up the messaging battle on guns. ""Democrats finally figured out that this was an issue that they were getting walloped on in many Western, Southern states and many swing states,"" said Jim Manley, who worked in the Senate for more than 20 years as a top aide to Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. ""So they began a subtle shift to try to coordinate and/or get more pro-gun Democrats to run."" He said, ""For many Democrats, it's smart politics not to get into the gun control debate."" Talk of gun rights was largely absent from Obama's speech in the aftermath of the Fort Hood shooting in 2009 and after Giffords and others were shot in Arizona last year. Obama mentioned gun safety only in passing after the Tucson shootings to describe the polarizing nature of the issue. The president penned an opinion piece two months after the Tucson shootings that acknowledged the importance of the Second Amendment and called for a ""focus"" on ""effective steps that will actually keep those irresponsible, law-breaking few from getting their hands on a gun in the first place."" Political discourse on guns is unlikely to increase since polls indicate Americans don't want to make gun laws more strict and overall gun violence has actually decreased, said Kristin A. Goss, an associate professor of public policy and political science at Duke University and author of ""Disarmed: The Missing Movement for Gun Control in America."" ""Historically the pro control side has struggled to come up with a compelling narrative that will help people come over to the case of stricter gun control laws,"" Goss said. ""For a long time these gun violence rates and massacres speak for themselves. They relied on that to make the case but were up against a very powerful but very well-disciplined and skillful army that was good at taking those arguments apart."""

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. James Holmes, the suspect responsible for the worst mass shooting in U.S. history, has begun a legal journey that will include an extensive psychiatric evaluation and may include a plea that he is not criminally responsible for his acts--an ""insanity"" plea.  As a forensic psychiatrist, I have participated in many such evaluations and then rendered expert testimony about killers in court. Here's how they work: First, given the extraordinary change in Holmes' mental status--from brilliant neuroscience Ph.D candidate to a mass killer--all organic (i.e. physical) causes for psychiatric symptoms must be excluded via an extensive medical work-up, including an MRI (to rule out a brain tumor or slow bleed), an EEG (to rule out seizures), a lumbar puncture (to obtain cerebrospinal fluid to rule out a central nervous system infection) and blood work (to rule out toxicity from heavy metals, other physiological abnormalities and any use by Holmes of illicit drugs).  Any medication with which Holmes has recently been treated will be considered for its possible psychiatric side effects. Second, a detailed series of psychiatric interviews will be conducted to create a timeline of Holmes' life story--from birth right through any recent stressors--and to attempt to determine how Holmes thinks, feels and communicates.  This will include an analysis of Holmes' personality, as well as a determination of whether he harbors any fixed and false beliefs (delusions)--like being under the control of aliens, being specially selected to save the world, being pursued by the CIA or having thoughts implanted into his head by devices in the walls of his apartment.  Pains will be taken to observe whether he acts as though he is hallucinating--hearing voices or seeing visions or experiencing odd bodily sensations (of, for example, his skin peeling away) in the absence of any stimulus to account for them. Long, written psychological tests--like the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory--will likely be used, as well, in order to support or refute data gleaned from the clinical interviews, to gain further insight into Holmes' ways of thinking and feeling and to determine whether he is faking or exaggerating symptoms or, conversely, attempting to cover up symptoms.  The tests and the way they are analyzed have built-in mechanisms to identify those who are trying to seem crazy when they are not--or trying to seem normal when they are not. The medical work-up, psychiatric interviews and psychological testing will probably both be used first to determine whether Mr. Holmes is competent to stand trial or too burdened by mental illness.  The bar is pretty low.  The issue is whether Holmes knows how a courtroom works (that a judge administrates the proceedings and a jury determines guilt or innocence, that his defense attorney will attempt to establish his innocence and a prosecutor will attempt to establish guilt, that he is the one accused of a crime) and that Holmes can assist his attorney in defending him (rather than being too confused to follow along or too distracted by voices or refusing to speak with his attorney, whom he considers, for example, to be an alien or one of the people sent by the devil to make him renounce God). The medical and psychiatric evaluation(s) will also form the basis of any ""insanity"" plea Holmes may put forward.  The questions at the heart of that matter will be whether a major mental illness so impaired Mr. Holmes as to render him unable to tell right from wrong, or if he still knew right from wrong, and whether an illness so impaired him as to render him unable to conform his behavior to the requirements of the law. While forensic psychiatrists hired by the state and those hired by the accused often disagree whether a defendant suffers from a mental illness that qualifies him or her as not criminally responsible, sometimes they do agree--and, sometimes, the fact that they are in complete agreement even before trial leads to a trial never taking place.  After all, the district attorney in Colorado will need to decide whether to take this case to court or, after receiving information from psychiatrists, whether to agree Holmes should simply have his plea of insanity (if offered) automatically accepted, leading to his hospitalization on a locked psychiatry unit. It is important to note that while planning a killing is part of the data used to evaluate the mental state of a killer, some people who are psychotic and who kill based on incredibly powerful, unavoidable delusions, do so with a great deal of planning.  If, for example, one were to believe that aliens had invaded the Earth and taken the form of one's family, one might plan for a long time how to do away with them and save the universe.  Yet, the foundation of one's motivation would be a product of mental illness. Contrary to popular belief, defendants who are found not criminally responsible by virtue of a mental illness generally remain on locked psychiatry units for several decades--or for life.  This has been the case, for example, for John Hinckley, Jr., the man who, in 1981, shot Ronald Reagan to impress actress Jodi Foster.  He has remained an inpatient--with some passes to his family home--at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington, D.C. for more than 30 years. Holmes' journey through the system is just beginning.  Insanity pleas are notoriously unsuccessful.  The vast, vast majority fail, probably because juries simply don't want to worry over whether a person capable of horrific acts will ever hit the streets.  So, if Holmes should offer such a plea and prevail, it will be because he isn't even close to sane and because the culprit who stole 12 lives and shattered dozens more was mental illness, camouflaged by those accomplices who saw it hobbling a man and did nothing--or too little.

The 24-year-old former medical student's apartment is about four miles from the theater where at least 12 people were killed and 50 were wounded Family releases statement Police released a written statement from Holmes' family: ""Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved."" Possible victims' kin seek relative AURORA, Colo. (AP) -- Family members are showing up at a suburban Denver high school where witnesses to a mass shooting at a movie theater were taken. Tom Sullivan arrived at Gateway High School in Aurora Friday morning with a photo of his son, Alex, and was asking reporters if they'd seen him. Byron Settles was at the high school looking for his nephew, Tyrell Hardiman. Settles says it's unusual because Hardiman was supposed to be at work but wasn't. Obama 'saddened' President Barack Obama said he was saddened by the ""horrific and tragic shooting,"" pledging that his administration was ""committed to bringing whoever was responsible to justice, ensuring the safety of our people, and caring for those who have been wounded."" It was the worst mass shooting in the U.S. since the Nov. 5, 2009, attack at Fort Hood, Texas, when an Army psychiatrist killed 13 soldiers and civilians and more than two dozen others wounded. In Colorado, the shooting was the deadliest since the Columbine High School massacre on April 20, 1999, when two students opened fire at the school in the Denver suburb of Littleton, killing 12 classmates and a teacher and wounding 26 others before killing themselves. Witness ducked in time Jennifer Seeger, 25, from Aurora said she was in the second row, about four feet from the gunman, when he pointed a gun at her face. At first, ""I was just a deer in headlights. I didn't know what to do,"" she said. Then she ducked to the ground. The gunman shot people seated behind her. ""There were bullet (casings) just falling on my head. They were burning my forehead,"" Seeger said. The gunman fired steadily except when he stopped to reload. ""Every few seconds it was just 'Boom, boom, boom,'"" she said. ""He would reload and shoot and anyone who would try to leave would just get killed,"" she said. Seeger said she began crawling toward an exit when she saw a girl about 14 years old, ""lying lifeless on the stairs."" She saw a man with a bullet wound in his back and tried to check his pulse, but ""I had to go. I was going to get shot."" ""I thought it was showmanship. I didn't think it was real,"" she said. 'Thought it was a joke, a hoax' Sylvana Guillen, 20, said when a man appeared at the front of the theater clad in dark clothing looking like a SWAT team member as Catwoman made an appearance in the movie, the audience ""thought it was a joke, a hoax."" Then they heard gunshots and smelled smoke from a canister he was carrying, and Guillen knew it was real. The gunman began walking toward the seats and firing. Guillen said she told her friend, Misha Mostashiry, ""You better get ready to be shot."" Mostashiry, also 20, said they couldn't tell where the gunman was. ""All you could do is hope he didn't come for you,"" she said. ""We ran to the emergency exit and nothing happened. Nothing happened to us,"" Mostashiry said, with surprise and relief in her voice. On their dash to the exit, they saw a man slip in the blood of a wounded woman he was trying to help. Dash to escape Tanner Coon told the NBC ""Today"" show he was at the movie with a friend and his friend's 12-year-old brother when about 20 minutes into the movie the gunman appeared. Coon said that when they realized they were being shot at, they got on the floor in front of their seats. After ""a period of quiet"" everyone started to run out. He said he went to a row behind him and ""slipped on some blood and landed"" on a woman. He said he shook her, telling her they needed to get out, but she was unresponsive and he ""presumed she was dead."" He said the 12-year-old was ""freaking out"" and ""really upset"" after they escaped the theater.

That's the upshot of our fall fundraising drive, and we're hoping to raise $250,000 in a shorter than normal three-week window so we can keep right on doing it. Xinhua/ZUMA Press A mass shooting at a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises in Aurora, Colorado, has left at least twelve people dead and 58 wounded. The massacre occurred at the Century 16 cineplex at the Aurora Town Center Mall. The suspected shooter is a local resident named James Eagan Holmes who is in police custody, along with the weapons used in the shooting. There is no clear motive for the attack known at this time. This story will be updated throughout the day as we receive more information. Click here to jump to the latest update. How Holmes Was Armed Holmes carried an assault rifle, a shotgun, and two pistols, the Associated Press reports. Holmes reportedly entered the theater from the emergency exit wearing a gas mask and a bullet proof vest. Witness Accounts According to two witnesses whose interview was flagged by the Huffington Post, he entered the theater, tossed canisters of some kind of gas, and then started shooting. “He looked so calm when he did it, it looked scary,” the witness says.  One of the witnesses says he “thought it was part of the show.” Here’s another interview with a witness to the shooting, conducted by a local NBC affiliate in Colorado:   The witness says “we thought special effects, midnight showing, that’s awesome—what theater does that anymore?” After a few moments, the witness continues, he saw “holes in the walls” and realized that the smoke wasn’t part of the show. Poynter, a journalism news site, has collected tweets from people who were at the movie theater in Aurora when the shooting started. More About the Shooter Holmes, the suspected shooter, was a former graduate student in neuroscience at the University of Colorado-Denver School of Medicine. He withdrew from the college last month. He attended Westview High School in San Diego, California, graduating in 2006. He has no previous criminal record. The city of Aurora police chief says that Holmes’ apartment contains “very sophisticated” explosives, and that police could be at the scene “for hours or days.” According to a federal law enforcement source, Holmes had colored his hair red and told local police that he was “The Joker,” the villain in The Dark Knight (2008). Official Response In the wake of the mass killing, other police departments across the country are now stepping up security measures at area theaters. The Paris gala premiere of the film was cancelled. President Barack Obama was reportedly briefed on the incident early Friday morning. In light of the tragedy, the president has cancelled a campaign event in Winter Park, Florida. The White House released a statement early Friday morning, and Obama will address the shooting at 11:20 a.m. in Fort Myers, Florida. It’s common for presidents and other top national politicians to release statements in the wake of big national tragedies, and both Obama and rival Mitt Romney have already expressed “shock and sorrow” at the incident. The Obama and Romney campaigns have both suspended running political advertisements on Colorado television stations, said spokespeople for the campaigns. Bill Burton, cofounder of the pro-Obama Priorities USA Action super-PAC, tweeted that his group was suspending its Colorado ads as well. President Obama remarked on the shooting Friday morning at a campaign stop in Fort Myers, in southwestern Florida. He said he’d spoken with Aurora Mayor Steve Hogan and Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper to express his and First Lady Michelle Obama’s sadness at the shooting. “The federal government stands ready to do whatever’s necessary to bring whomever’s responsible for this heinous crime to justice,” Obama said. “We will take every step possible to ensure the safety of all of our people. We’re going to stand by our neighbors in Colorado during this extraordinarily difficult time.” During a press briefing Friday morning aboard Air Force One, White House press secretary Jay Carney was asked if President Obama believes that the Aurora massacre warrants a review of gun safety laws. Carney told reporters the following: The president believes that we need to take common-sense measures that protect Second Amendment rights of Americans, while ensuring that those who should not have guns under existing law do not get them…But I have nothing new—nothing additional on that for you. UPDATE, Friday, 11:45 a.m. EST: Suspected gunman’s landlord won’t talk publicly In a brief conversation with Mother Jones, Joan Holley, the manager of Holley Realty who rents out units at the Aurora, Colorado, apartment building where suspected gunman James E. Holmes lived, said she is not yet speaking publicly about Holmes. “Out of respect to the victims and other people involved, I am declining to answer any questions at this time,” Holley said. Holley would not confirm whether she knew Holmes. Asked if she had yet talked to the local police, she said, “I’m going to say goodbye now. I cannot answer at this time.” According to a former resident of that building (who did not know Holmes), the building is mostly rented to college students. Holmes reportedly attended an area medical school but withdrew last month. UPDATE 2, Friday, 12:25 p.m. EST: Photo of suspected gunman Multiple news sources say this is a photo of suspected shooter James E. Holmes:  The image was sent to a local ABC affiliate by the University of Colorado, where Holmes was reportedly a student. UPDATE 3, Friday, 12:35 p.m. EST: Suspected gunman’s yearbook photo Here’s Holmes’ high school yearbook photo, according to San Diego 6 News:   UPDATE 4, Friday, 1:22 p.m. EST: Organizations respond with calls for gun control Dan Gross of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the largest group in the United States of its kind, issued a statement this morning expressing sympathies to the victims’ families and survivors, and also called for action on gun laws: This tragedy is another grim reminder that guns are the enablers of mass killers and that our nation pays an unacceptable price for our failure to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. We are outraged. We understand that President Obama has just spoken and so might Mitt Romney. As someone who has suffered the lasting impact of gun violence, and President of Brady, I can tell you that we don’t want sympathy.  We want action…We are insistent that our elected leaders take action to prevent future tragedies. Political cowardice is not an excuse for evasion and inaction on this life-and-death issue. The United States Conference of Mayors responded similarly: The nation’s mayors express their shock at a mass shooting and send their condolences to the victims, their families, and their community…While we don’t yet have all of the facts in the case, we do know that all evidence this morning points to a heavily armed assailant now in police custody. While questions about his motives and about how he obtained his weapons will be answered in the hours and days ahead, the fact remains that once again guns have been used in a mass killing of innocent people. The U.S. Conference of Mayors is repeating its call for reasonable changes in our gun laws and regulations that could help to prevent senseless tragedies such as the one that has rocked Aurora and the nation this morning.  UPDATE 5, Friday, 2:05 p.m. EST: “Not speculating on motive.” During a joint press conference, Aurora police chief Dan Oates told reporters that his department is “not speculating on motive” at this time. He also mentioned that the explosives for boobytrap found in alleged gunman Holmes’s apartment were “linked together with all sorts of wire.” Oates stated that the police are “not prepared to release [Holmes’] booking photo” today, and that he didn’t yet know whether or not the weapons used were possessed legally. UPDATE 6, Friday, 3:27 p.m. EST: Stars of The Dark Knight Rises cancel promotional events Dark Knight Rises stars Morgan Freeman and Marion Cotillard have pulled out of major press and promotional events scheduled for today and and this evening in France. “The whole team decided out of respect for the families to cancel the premiere,” Cotillard representative said. Warner Bros., which is distributing the film, has not announced whether or not they will cancel future promotional events.  UPDATE 7, Friday, 3:35 p.m. EST: Firearms bought legally, “drum-style” ammo clip used ABC News has confirmed that the three firearms used in the theater shooting—a AR-15 assault rifle, a Remington twelve-gauge shot gun, and a .40 Glock handgun—were purchased legally. ATF agents are currently tracing the weapons. A high-capacity, drum-style ammo clip for the AR-15 was also used in the massacre, according to the Associated Press. (Click here, here, and here for Mother Jones‘ past coverage of these kinds of large gun clips.) Here’s a photo of a precision built, ultra-high capacity, drum-style magazine for an AR-15: Brownells.comUPDATE 8, Friday, 3:59 p.m. EST: Defense Department statement US Navy and Air Force service members were among the injured. The Department of Defense released the following statement: The Department of Defense is deeply saddened by the news of the tragic incident at the Aurora Mall Movie Theater in Aurora, Colo. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and the families of those impacted by this event. One sailor was injured and one, known to have been at the theatre that evening, is currently unaccounted for. Two airmen were injured in the incident. The Navy and the Air Force are working with the families of these service members to ensure they have the care and attention they need. We can also confirm that the alleged gunman in this incident, James Holmes, is not a past or current member of any branch or component of the U.S. Armed Forces. UPDATE 9, Friday, 5:49 p.m. EST: Patients at University of Colorado Hospital Physicians at University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora treated 23 of the most critically wounded victims.  UPDATE 10, Friday, 8:09 p.m. EST: The Dark Knight Rises director Christopher Nolan weighs in Christopher Nolan, the director of The Dark Knight Rises, issued a statement on the mass shooting: Speaking on behalf of the cast and crew of The Dark Knight Rises, I would like to express our profound sorrow at the senseless tragedy that has befallen the entire Aurora community. I would not presume to know anything about the victims of the shooting but that they were there last night to watch a movie. I believe movies are one of the great American art forms and the shared experience of watching a story unfold on screen is an important and joyful pastime. The movie theatre is my home, and the idea that someone would violate that innocent and hopeful place in such an unbearably savage way is devastating to me. Nothing any of us can say could ever adequately express our feelings for the innocent victims of this appalling crime, but our thoughts are with them and their families.

Other politicians are increasingly wary of weighing in in favour of anything that might circumscribe the Second Amendment right to bear arms, in the face of the National Rifle Association's massive lobbying firepower. The American public narrowly, but definitively, tells pollsters it favours gun rights over new restrictions. Gun control advocates are on the back foot almost everywhere in the US. Unless the tragedy involves guns. Then our whole public reasoning process goes haywire.

      Quotes displayed in real-time or delayed by at least 15 minutes. Market data provided by Factset. Powered and implemented by FactSet Digital Solutions. Legal Statement. Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. WASHINGTON – President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney both have softened their positions on gun restrictions over the years. As they expressed shock and sorrow over the bloodshed at a Colorado movie theater, neither suggested that tougher gun control could make a difference, a notion that has faded from political debate. Romney signed a ban on assault weapons as Massachusetts governor. But as the presumptive Republican nominee, he now bills himself as the candidate who will protect gun owners' rights. Obama called for reinstating the federal ban on assault weapons during his 2008 presidential campaign. But since his election, he hasn't sought to get that done or pushed other gun control proposals, either. Neither man is likely to raise gun control as a campaign issue — beyond Romney's insistence that an Obama presidency is bad for gun owners. Both say they'll protect the Second Amendment right to bear arms. A look at the evolution of the candidates' positions and where they stand on guns: OBAMA 1997-2004: As an Illinois state senator, Obama supports banning all forms of semiautomatic weapons and tighter state restrictions generally on firearms, including a failed effort to limit handgun purchases to one per month. 2005: In the U.S. Senate, Obama votes against protecting firearms makers and dealers from lawsuits over misuse of their products by others. The bill is signed into law by President George W. Bush. 2008: During his first presidential campaign, Obama supports a return to the federal ban on assault weapons, which began during the Clinton administration and expired under Bush. He also endorses requiring background checks for buyers at gun shows. The National Rifle Association attacks him as an anti-gun zealot — a stand the group continues to take today. April 2008: Obama is criticized for elitism after sounding dismissive of gun owners in a talk to campaign donors. He said voters in struggling small towns in Middle America ""cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them"" to explain their frustrations. September 2008: Obama seeks to reassure gun owners: ""I believe in people's lawful right to bear arms. ... There are some common-sense gun safety laws that I believe in. But I am not going to take your guns away."" Nonetheless, gun sales go up when Obama wins, apparently because of fear that new restrictions are imminent under his administration. 2009: As president, Obama signs a law allowing people to carry concealed weapons in the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and other national parks and wildlife refuges and another that lets people carry guns in their checked bags on Amtrak trains. 2010: The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence gives Obama a grade of ""F'' for failing to push even the gun restrictions he supported while campaigning. 2011: Obama says the shooting that severely wounded then-Rep. Gabriel Giffords, D-Ariz., and killed six people should lead to ""a new discussion of how we can keep America safe for all our people."" He calls for ""sound and effective steps"" to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, including strengthening background checks on gun buyers. But he's short on specifics, and the Obama administration hasn't proposed any new gun initiatives since then. March 2012: Obama calls the fatal shooting of black teenager Trayvon Martin by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida ""a tragedy,"" saying Americans should do some soul-searching and ""examine the laws"" to figure out why it happened. He hasn't called for any legal changes in response to the case, which mostly brought attention to some states' ""stand your ground"" laws making it easier for a shooter to claim self-defense. Indeed, most gun regulations are imposed by states. The primary federal law is the Brady law requiring background checks on firearms purchasers. July 20: Obama says he's heartbroken by the Aurora, Colo., movie theater massacre and calls for Americans to unite in prayer for the victims: ""If there's anything to take away from this tragedy it's the reminder that life is very fragile, our time here is limited and it is precious."" Asked whether the mass shooting should prompt a new review of gun laws, White House spokesman Jay Carney declines to comment beyond reiterating Obama's existing stance in support of ""common-sense measures that protect Second Amendment rights of Americans, while ensuring that those who should not have guns under existing law do not get them."" ___ ROMNEY 1994: In his unsuccessful challenge to liberal Democratic Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, Romney sounds moderate on guns, supporting an assault weapons ban and insisting, ""I don't line up with the NRA."" 2002: Running for governor of Massachusetts, Romney says he supports and will protect the state's ""tough gun laws."" The NRA gives his Democratic opponent a higher rating on gun-rights issues and makes no endorsement in the race. 2003: As governor, Romney upsets gun owners by signing a law that quadruples the state's gun-licensing fee — from $25 to $100 — as part of a widespread effort to eliminate the budget deficit. 2004: Romney signs a Massachusetts ban on assault weapons. He mollifies many gun rights advocates by coupling it with looser rules on gun licenses and an extension of the duration of licenses, reducing the effect of the earlier fee increase. 2005: Declares May 7 as ""Right to Bear Arms Day"" in Massachusetts. 2006: As he prepares for his first presidential run, Romney becomes a lifetime NRA member. 2007: While campaigning, Romney declares he sometimes hunts ""small varmints"" — a comment ridiculed by some as an awkward attempt to pander to pro-gun voters. 2008: In a Republican primary debate, Romney says he would have signed the federal assault weapons ban if it came to his desk as president, but he opposes any new gun legislation. 2011: Making his second presidential bid, Romney's campaigns on a promise to protect and promote the Second Amendment. 2012: Romney tells gun owners that Obama wants to erode their rights. ""We need a president who will enforce current laws, not create new ones that only serve to burden lawful gun owners,"" Romney told the National Rifle Association's annual convention. ""President Obama has not. I will."" July 20: Like Obama, Romney avoids talking politics on the day of the Aurora shooting. He says Americans are coming together in their sorrow: ""There is something we can do. We can offer comfort to someone near us who is suffering or heavy laden, and we can mourn with those who mourn in Colorado.""

Federal authorities detonated one small explosive and disarmed another inside James Holmes' suburban Denver apartment, including one that emits a shock wave and water, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press. The official spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the ongoing investigation into the shooting rampage that killed 12 people and wounded 58. Holmes' apartment appears to have three types of explosives -- jars filled with accelerants, chemicals that would explode when mixed together and more than 30 ""improvised grenades,"" the official said. Makeshift memorials sprang up for the victims, including a 6-year-old girl, an aspiring sportscaster and a man celebrating his 27th birthday, after police grimly went door to door with a list of those killed in the worst mass shooting in recent U.S. history. Holmes, 24, was arrested early Friday outside the Aurora theater after witnesses say he unleashed gunfire and gas canisters on a crowd of moviegoers watching the midnight showing of the new Batman film, ""The Dark Knight Rises."" The devices in Holmes' booby-trapped apartment were ""set up to kill that person and that could have been a police officer executing a search warrant,"" Aurora police Sgt. Cassidee Carlson said. Police planned an intricate procedure to disarm the possible weapons without destroying evidence that could be in the apartment. ""We don't want to lose evidential value,"" Carlson said. Federal officials said in a bulletin obtained by The Associated Press that they still hadn't determined a motive for the suspect as families grieved and others waited at hospitals, where seven of the wounded remained in critical condition on Saturday. In his Saturday radio address, President Barack Obama urged Americans to pray ""for the victims of this terrible tragedy, for the people who knew them and loved them, for those who are still struggling to recover."" The victims included 23-year-old Micayla Medek, said Anita Busch, the cousin of Medek's father. The family took the news hard, but knowing her fate after waiting without word brought them some peace, Busch said. ""I hope this evil act, that this evil man doesn't shake people's faith in God,"" she said. Besides Medek, relatives confirmed that Alex Sullivan and Jessica Ghawi were among those killed, Sullivan on his 27th birthday. Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates said Holmes used a military-style semi-automatic rifle, a shotgun and a pistol to open fire on the unsuspecting theater-goers. He had bought the weapons at local gun stores within the last two months. He also recently purchased 6,000 rounds of ammunition over the Internet, the chief said. The suspect's stellar academic record, apparent shy demeanor and lack of a criminal background made the attack even more difficult to fathom. It also wasn't known why the suspect chose a movie theater to stage the assault, or whether he intended some twisted, symbolic link to the film's violent scenes. The Batman movie, the last in the trilogy starring Christian Bale, opened worldwide Friday with midnight showings in the U.S. The plot has the villain Bane facing Bale's Caped Crusader with a nuclear weapon that could destroy all of fictional Gotham. The Dark Knight Rises"" earned $30.6 million in Friday morning midnight screenings, and, according to industry estimates, roughly $75-77 million on the day. That put it on track for a weekend total of around $165 million, which would be the second highest opening weekend ever, following ""The Avengers."" Warner Bros. has announced it would forgo the usual revenue reports until Monday out of respect for the victims. Sony, Disney and Universal also said they would delay reporting box office receipts until Monday, a day later than the routine Sunday releases for Hollywood. In New York City, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said: ""It clearly looks like a deranged individual. He has his hair painted red. He said he was the Joker, obviously the enemy of Batman."" Oates would not confirm that information, but did say he spoke to Kelly. Asked whether Holmes had makeup to look like the Joker, Oates said: ""That to my knowledge is not true."" Near the entrance to the theater's parking lot, a makeshift memorial of 12 candles sat in a row alongside piles of flowers. Up the hill from the theater, about 20 pastors led a vigil for 350 people, some hugging and crying. A sign read, ""7/20. Gone Not Forgotten.""  Gallery: Colorado theater shooting An emotional Gov. John Hickenlooper said earlier Friday that people would not be defined by the tragedy. ""We are clear that we are going to rise back and lift ourselves above this,"" he said. A federal law enforcement official said Holmes bought a ticket to the movie, went into the theater as part of the crowd and propped open an exit door as the movie was playing. The suspect then donned protective ballistic gear and opened fire, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the investigation. Authorities said Holmes shot scores of people, picking off victims who tried to flee. At least one person was struck in an adjacent theater by gunfire that went through the wall. Adding to the terror and chaos were two gas canisters thrown by the suspect that filled the theater with smoke. Tanner Coon, a 17-year-old Aurora resident who was watching the film with two friends, said he first thought the gunshots were firecrackers. When he realized what was happening, he ducked between seats and waited for the shooter to bark demands. ""When is he going to start telling us what to do? When is this going to become a hostage situation?"" Coon said. When the firing ended, Coon said he started running up the row but slipped in blood and fell on a woman who was lying on the ground. He tried shaking her, he said, but she didn't respond, so he left her behind and ran from the theater. The shooting was the worst in the U.S. since the Nov. 5, 2009, attack at Fort Hood, Texas. An Army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 soldiers and civilians and wounding more than two dozen others. It was the deadliest in Colorado since the 1999 attack at Columbine High School, where two students killed 12 classmates and a teacher and wounded 26 others before killing themselves. Holmes had enrolled last year in a neuroscience Ph.D. program at the University of Colorado-Denver, though he left last month for unknown reasons. In academic achievement, ""he was at the top of the top,"" recalled Timothy P. White, chancellor at the University of California, Riverside, where Holmes earned his undergraduate degree before attending the Denver school. Those who knew Holmes described him as a shy, intelligent person raised in California by parents who were active in their well-to-do suburban San Diego neighborhood. Holmes played soccer at Westview High School and ran cross-country before going to college. Police released a statement from his family Friday that said, ""Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved.""

We've received your submission. Mitt Romney leaves a campaign event after speaking about the mass shooting in Colorado at an event in Bow, N.H., Friday. (AP) SAN FRANCISCO — Silenced for a weekend, the race for the White House reverted to divisive form Monday, as President Barack Obama and Republican Mitt Romney found enough distance from a national tragedy to get back to the politics of getting elected. Obama tried to put the squeeze on Romney, with the president’s campaign aides demanding “substantive” expectations for the Romney’s upcoming trip to England, Israel and Poland. Headed for Nevada, Obama was touting his foreign policy record to the Veterans of Foreign Wars a day before Romney addresses the group. Romney, addressing donors, returned to his critique that Obama is “out of ideas, out of excuses, and we’ve got to make sure in November we put him out of office.” He cautioned the public not to look to government for answers in response to the Colorado shooting. Instead, he urged people to reach out locally to help people in need. Still in the shadow of a rampage that united the nation in grief, the campaigns weighed how much and how fast to calibrate their tones. They seemed intent on returning to the business of defining their message and their opponents, albeit not quite yet with the vitriol of earlier weeks. The race is tight, both nationally and in the select states expected to decide the outcome, polls show. That leaves little time for either side to dial down. Foreign policy and national security, marginalized in this economy-centered election year, moved briefly to the fore. In a conference call with reporters, Obama campaign officials challenged Romney to offer specific policy ideas during his three-country trip this week. Romney’s travels are highly anticipated as a measure of how well he can stand up on the world stage. Obama took an even broader such trip as a candidate in 2008. “If Romney wants to be president, if he is ready to be commander in chief, he needs to prove that he’s willing to have open and honest discussions about his world views, about his beliefs, about his policies with some of our strongest allies,” said Michele Flournoy, a campaign adviser and former top policy official at the Pentagon. Four years ago, trying to burnish his own credentials against military hero Sen. John McCain, Obama traveled extensively to the Middle East and Europe, with stops in both war fronts of Afghanistan and Iraq. Obama adviser Robert Gibbs said the question for Romney is whether his trip “will be similar substantively” for voters. In California, Romney was raising money in the wealthy and Republican heavy area of Orange County on Monday after holding three fundraisers in the San Francisco Bay area the previous night. He was expected to raise $10 million during the swing. Romney was scheduled to hold a business discussion in Irvine, Calif., before heading to Reno, Nev. for his VFW speech on Tuesday. Obama is on a previously scheduled three-day trip that includes campaign fundraisers Monday in California and Tuesday in Seattle. He was expected to raise more than $6 million on the West Coast. Both campaigns were keeping their largely negative television advertisements off the air in Colorado, a key battleground state in the November election. The presidential race resumed as the accused Colorado shooter appeared in court Monday for the first time. Vice President Joe Biden, campaigning for his boss in Florida, jettisoned his typical speech to focus on the shooting victims and the stories of heroism from that night. He told National Association of Police Organizations: “There’s a hell of a lot more good out there than the evil you’re sworn to take on.” The massacre stalled a race for the White House that had becoming increasingly bitter. Romney made a low-key return to political activity Sunday night at his fundraisers, telling supporters he would tone down his political rhetoric, at least for the night, in “keeping with the seriousness of the day.” The former Massachusetts governor avoided attacking Obama by name. Obama on Sunday spent hours in emotional private meetings with the families of the dead and also met with some of those injured in the attacks. “I hope that over the next several days, next several months, we all reflect on how we can do something about some of the senseless violence that ends up marring this country,” Obama said. Romney said Obama’s trip was “the right thing for the president to be doing on this day.” The Obama campaign launched the week with a web video titled “Welcome Home Our Veterans,” celebrating Obama’s record on veterans’ issues. It includes personal testimonials from former servicemen and women who thank him for supporting the troops. The film takes special note of Obama’s work to end the U.S. military role in Iraq. Much of Romney’s week will be focused on America’s role abroad. In his first trip overseas as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, he is expected to attend the opening ceremonies of the Olympics in London and then meet with foreign dignitaries in England, Israel and Poland.

86717444,2012-08-01 18:38:17,Orange County prosecutors: UC Irvine Prof's email revealed mass shooting plot,http://www.mercurynews.com/crime-courts/ci_21207953/orange-county-da-after-sons-suicide-uc-irvine?source=rss,en,True,,35,San Jose Mercury News,http://www.mercurynews.com/,"Trending: SANTA ANA — Six weeks after his 14-year-old son killed himself, a grieving Rainer Reinscheid downed some sleep medication, cracked open two bottles of wine and wrote a chilling email titled “a good plan” on how he wanted to get revenge on the people he blamed for his boy’s abrupt suicide. Reinscheid’s son hung himself hours after being disciplined by the assistant principal at his high school in Irvine, setting the university professor on a weekslong downward spiral that authorities say included setting small fires and sending emails in which he vented his anger about school officials. He wrote about fantasizing about buying a dozen guns, killing 200 University High students, sexually assaulting the guidance counselor and killing the assistant principal. “I will make him cry and beg, but I will not give him a chance, just like he did to Claas,” Reinscheid wrote, using his son’s name. “I will make him die, slowly, surely. Next I will set fire to (the school) and try to burn down as much as I can, there should be nothing left that gives them a reason to continue their miserable school.” The emails, which prosecutors say he wrote to himself and to his wife, were obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday from court filings. Reinscheid never acted on his most violent musings, and authorities said they found no evidence that he made any preparations to obtain weapons. They believe Reinscheid acted alone in setting fires that targeted his late son’s school, the assistant principal’s home and the park where the teen hanged himself. The emails were discovered on Reinscheid’s smartphone by Irvine police who were investigating the arsons and were filed by prosecutors in court to support a motion to deny bail. Reinscheid, who also holds German citizenship, has not been charged with anything related to the content of the emails because they were private communications between Reinscheid and his wife, said Farrah Emami, a district attorney spokeswoman. Defense attorney Ron Cordova did not return multiple calls for comment. He told the judge in court Tuesday that he didn’t want his client to “suffer from a media circus.” In an email to himself in April, while he was on medication and drinking his second bottle of wine, Reinscheid wrote he had dreams of burning down the school and killing himself in the place where his son died. He also told his wife he loved her and was sorry if he disappointed her, and asked her to take care of her two children as a single mother. “I hope you will tell Timmy only one story: Daddy was so sad when Claas passed away, he was just eaten away by his sadness and stopped breathing,” he wrote to his wife. The case began on March 14, when the boy hanged himself after being disciplined by the assistant principal for stealing from a student store. Reinscheid, a professor at the University of California, Irvine’s pharmaceutical sciences department, struggled with his son’s suicide and was angry with school officials, who he believed hadn’t properly handled his son’s case, family friends said. After the suicide, rumors circulated around school that the teen had been bullied, but police and the school district say they investigated and found no evidence of it. Ian Hanigan, a district spokesman, said Reinscheid was angry with school administrators because they informed the teen’s step-sister of his death at the school, with no family members present, after trying to reach everyone on her emergency contact list with no luck. The school had no other contact with Reinscheid after his son’s death and the professor hadn’t threatened any school administrators, staff or students, Hanigan said. Bruce Blumberg, a colleague at UC Irvine, said Reinscheid was angry over the investigation into his son’s suicide and was considering legal action against the district. “I think everyone would like to see the circumstances surrounding Claas’ death enlightened,” said Blumberg, a professor of pharmaceutical sciences. “This is all a tragedy. A boy is dead and he shouldn’t be and his father is doing allegedly crazy things that he shouldn’t be doing. It’s all a crazy situation.” Another colleague and longtime friend, Olivier Civelli, said Reinscheid was devastated by his son’s suicide but tried to keep it quiet among colleagues at work. He showed no signs of the deep anger and violence evident in the emails prosecutors included in their case, said Civelli, professor and chairman of the pharmacology department. “That doesn’t fit with the Rainer I know. I can tell you that is not the Rainer I know. Rainer is not a violent person. Rainer never had a gun, I can tell you that,” said Civelli, who helped Reinscheid by picking up his car after his arrest last week. “I think that maybe he was doing that to vent his anger, he was telling to someone who was close — his wife,” Civelli said. That’s an argument that Reinscheid’s defense attorney will likely use with the jury when the case goes to trial — and perhaps an argument that could keep the emails away from the jury’s eyes entirely, said Jacqueline Goodman, a criminal defense attorney in Orange County. His attorney will likely argue that Reinscheid never intended to act on his writings, which he calls “dreams” at one point, and was simply expressing his anguish, she said. “You have to take into account the context in which these writings come. He’s so emotionally distressed and now he’s under the comingled influence of psychotropic drugs and alcohol and he’s writing these things — not acting on them — just writing them down,” Goodman said. “He’s clearly not in his right mind. It’s like writing in a diary.” Reinscheid has been at UC Irvine for about a dozen years and rode his bike to work every day from his house on campus. His research included studying molecular pharmacology and psychiatric disorders, including studies of schizophrenia, stress, emotional behavior and sleep, according to the school’s website. ———- Associated Press writers Greg Risling and Shaya Mohajer contributed to this story.

) They took bullets for their beloveds. Three young men are being hailed as heroes for their old-fashioned chivalry and courage under fire in saving the lives of their girlfriends. While using their bodies as shields, Matt McQuinn, 27, Jonathan Blunk, 26, and Alex Teves, 24, were killed in the worst mass shooting in US history. Nine others were also murdered when deranged gunman James Holmes unloaded a fusillade of bullets into the packed Century 16 theater early Friday in Aurora, Colo. McQuinn dived in front of his girlfriend, Samantha Yowler, also 27, when the gunfire erupted. She was shot in the knee. McQuinn was fatally struck three times. Jonathan Blunk threw his date, Jansen Young, 21, to the floor, pushing her under the seat. “Stay down!” he told her, moments before he was shot to death. “He took a bullet for me,” Young told NBC’s “Today” show. “He always talked about if he were going to die, he wanted to die a hero,” Blunk’s estranged wife, Chantel Blunk, told NBC News. Teves, of Phoenix, used his body to cover girlfriend Amanda Lindgren, Teves’ grandmother Rae Iacovelli told The Post. “He shielded her. He got down on the floor and covered her up,” said Iacovelli, who lives in Barneget, NJ. “She was pulled out from under him. I don’t know who pulled her out.” Teves, born in Verona, NJ, and raised in Phoenix, had just finished graduate school in Denver. He turned 24 a month ago and had been dating Lindgren for just over a year. “They were very serious,” Iacovelli said. “He was a good kid. He had so many friends. No matter where he went, he put people at ease. He was a fun kid. A happy boy.” McQuinn and Yowler met while working at a Target store in Springfield, Ohio. They shared a love of video games and began dating in March 2009. They recently transferred to a store in Aurora, where Samantha’s brother, Nick, has lived for eight years. The three went to the movie together. Nick told relatives they saw the gunman march into the theater. When he started firing into the audience, Matt and Nick, sitting with Samantha between them, “both jumped sideways in front of her,” family lawyer Ron Scott told The Post. “Matt took three hits, one in the chest, one in the back, and one in the leg,” he said. “He was a great kid, and we consider him part of the family,” the Yowler family said of Matt. Yowler was listed in fair condition after surgery yesterday at Denver Health Medical Center. “She’s on the path to a full recovery,” Scott said. Both families rushed to out to Aurora to cope with the crisis. “They’re absolutely shocked and trying to make sense of what happened,” the lawyer said. Blunk, a divorced dad of two, started dating Young last October. To their surprise, they managed to snag tickets that day for the highly anticipated “Dark Knight Rises” premiere. When the masked gunman, identified as James Eagan Holmes, launched his attack on the crowd, Blunk drew on his military experience. “He knew, and threw me on the ground and was like, ‘We have to get down and stay down,’ ” she told the “Today” show. As shots and screams rang out, she felt herself get struck several times with what she believes was shrapnel. “Jon gave me one good push against that concrete again, and then . . . I didn’t really feel his arms against my back anymore, but I knew he was still there.” Then she realized what happened. “I guess I didn’t really know he had passed until I started shaking him and saying, ‘Jon, Jon we have to go . . .” she said. “I know I would not be here today if Jon had not been next to me in that movie theater.”  VERONICA MOSER, 6 “I want to die,” wailed Ashley Moser, when she awoke yesterday to news her beautiful, 6-year-old daughter, Veronica, was dead — the youngest victim in the nation’s worst mass murder. Moser, weeping and in critical condition in her bed at Aurora Medical Center with bullet wounds to her neck and abdomen, screamed out in her waking moments in the ICU for her little girl. Ashley was suffering before the shooting ever began, having lost her father three weeks earlier, Annie Dalton, her aunt, told The Post. “It’s just a terrible time,” she added. The very close mother and daughter had just moved to Aurora recently, Dalton said, for a brand-new start. Moser had been accepted to medical school. “They expect her to have some paralysis but don’t know how extensive it will be,” the aunt said. Veronica was thrilled that her mom was taking her to the midnight premiere of “The Dark Knight Rises.” “She was excited about life, as she should be. She’s a 6-year-old girl,” Dalton said.  JOHN THOMAS LARIMER, 27 The Navy sailor was described as an “outstanding shipmate,” by his fellow servicemen. John Larimer of Crystal Lake, Ill., became a cryptologic technician third class, an intelligence officer with the US Fleet Cyber Command stationed at Buckley Air Force Base in Aurora. “I am incredibly saddened by the loss of Petty Officer John Larimer,” Commander Jeffrey Jakuboski said. Larimer was the youngest of five siblings and graduated from Crystal Lake South HS in 2003. “John was only 27 with an incredible life waiting for him,” said his aunt Randee Larimer on Facebook. “John had [an] incredible mind, a rapier wit.”  Jessica Ghawi, 24 A witty redhead who blogged about hockey and aspired to be a broadcast journalist, Ghawi dodged death at a mall shooting in Toronto a month ago but was unable to escape the movie theater in Aurora. She went by the pen name Jessica Redfield and wrote for the Mile High Hockey blog where she covered the NHL’s Colorado Avalanche. In one blog entry, Ghawi, who grew up in San Antonio, compared her dating options to pro hockey teams, awarding the title of Class Clown to the New York Islanders. “There’s something about that team that cracks me up though. Maybe it’s the way that Rick DiPietro takes a punch,” she quipped.  JESSE CHILDRESS, 29 The 29-year-old Air Force staff sergeant was honored with flowers by three of his fellow airmen at a makeshift memorial near the theater. They said he was a “great man.” Childress hailed from California and was a reservist on active duty as a cyber-systems operator based at the Buckley Air Force Base in Aurora. “This tragic event has affected everybody here at Buckley Air Force Base and our local community friends and neighbors,” base commander Col. Daniel Dant said in a statement. “We are deeply saddened by the loss of each and every loved one.”  ALEX SULLIVAN, 27 He turned 27 the night of the premiere. An hour before the bloodbath, he tweeted it would “be the best BIRTHDAY ever.” Today, Alex would have celebrated his first wedding anniversary with wife Cassandra. He was elated she had returned from a 3¹/₂-week vacation Wednesday. “I love you, Cassie,” he gushed on Facebook. Alex had recently attended the Denver Comic Con, declaring, “I’m about to get my geek on all night.”  MICAYLA MEDEK, 23 Known as Cayla, she worked as a “sandwich artist” and store closer at a local Subway franchise while also working toward a degree at the Community College of Aurora. She liked to laugh about her busy life. “I do everything lol,” the 23-year-old wrote on Facebook. “I’m a simple independent girl who’s just trying to get her life together while still having fun,” she added. Cayla saw the movie with a bunch of pals. “I lost my Cayla. I lost my Cayla. I want to bring my baby home,” her dad said, according to the LA Times.  REBECCA WINGO, 33 She did it all — working as a waitress, a Chinese interpreter for the military and most recently as an intake specialist at a medical center. But her most important job was caring for her two daughters. “Those two little girls were the light of her life,” one friend said at a memorial service. Marcus Weaver, a friend who was with Wingo, 33, when she died, described her as outgoing, philosophical and extremely positive. “She has tons of friends,” he said.  A.J. BOIK, 18 A class clown and comic-book fan, the Gateway HS student had already seen “The Avengers” four times when he went to see “The Dark Knight Rises.” The teen also hoped to marry his girlfriend Lasamoa Cross, whom he took to see the film. Known as a class clown, pals put a video of him dancing in a tie-dyed shirt on an online memorial page. “If you looked anything but happy, he would come up to you and say, ‘This ain’t working. You got to smile,’ ” his friend Michal Westrich told reporters.  GORDON COWDEN, 51 Going to see “The Dark Knight Rises” premiere was a special event for this hard-working father of three, who was so busy running his real-estate appraisal business, he could hardly get out. Cowden “was always working, always busy during the day. For him to go out at night, it was a treat for him,” said neighbor Mike Paszel. Cowden, a Texas native whose son Weston is a student at the Merchant Marine Academy, enjoyed the outdoors and particularly liked to hike and ski, a pal said.  Share Selection"

86338999,2012-07-20 10:24:03,Police: 12 dead in Colorado theater shooting,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2012/jul/20/several-injured-possibly-dead-shooting-batman-prem/,en,True,,56,Arkansas Democrat-Gazette ,http://www2.arkansasonline.com/,"AURORA, Colo. — Officials announced that a total of 71 people were shot by a gunman in a Friday morning rampage at Colorado movie theater that left 12 dead. A former medical student in a gas mask barged into a crowded Denver-area theater during a midnight showing of the Batman movie on Friday, hurled a gas canister and then opened fire. The suspect was taken into custody and identified by federal law enforcement officials as 24-year-old James Holmes. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation. Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates said in a Friday morning press conference that Holmes was dressed head-to-toe in tactical protective gear, including a ballistics helmet, throat protector and gas mask. Oates added that the suspect fired an ""unknown amount of rounds"" during the massacre. The shooting began in theater no. 9 of the Century 16 Theater. In all, Oates said that Holmes was suspected to use an AR-15 assault rifle, a Remington 870 12-gauge shotgun and 40-caliber handgun. Police apprehended Holmes in the back of the theater. The first 911 call came in of the shooting reached authorities at 12:36 a.m. Oates said that in all, around 200 police were on scene. Oates added that Holmes lone brush with the law was a summons for speeding last year. Authorities did not release a motive. The FBI said there was no indication of ties to any terrorist groups. When the smoke began to spread, some moviegoers thought it was a stunt that was part of the The Dark Knight Rises, one of the most highly anticipated films of the summer. They saw a silhouette of a person in the haze near the screen, first pointing a gun at the crowd and then shooting. ""There were bullet (casings) just falling on my head. They were burning my forehead,"" Jennifer Seeger said, adding that the gunman, dressed like a SWAT team member, fired steadily except when he stopped to reload. ""Every few seconds it was just: Boom, boom, boom,"" she said. ""He would reload and shoot and anyone who would try to leave would just get killed."" Holmes had an assault rifle, a shotgun and two pistols, a federal law enforcement official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation.

FBI agents and police used a hook and ladder fire truck to reach Holmes' apartment in Aurora, Oates said. They put a camera at the end of a 12-foot pole inside the apartment, and discovered that the unit was booby trapped. Authorities evacuated five buildings as they tried to determine how to disarm flammable and explosive material. Victims were being treated for chemical exposure apparently related to canisters thrown by the gunman. Some of those injured are children, including a 4-month-old baby who was released from the hospital. Aurora police spokesman Frank Fania on ABC's Good Morning America said he didn't know yet if all the injuries were gunshot wounds. He said some might have been caused by other things such as shrapnel. Police released a written statement from Holmes' family: ""Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved."" The movie opened across the world Friday with midnight showings in the U.S. The shooting prompted officials to cancel the Paris premiere, with workers pulling down the red carpet display at a theater on the famed Champs-Elysees Avenue. President Barack Obama said he was saddened by the ""horrific and tragic shooting,"" pledging that his administration was ""committed to bringing whoever was responsible to justice, ensuring the safety of our people, and caring for those who have been wounded."" It was the worst mass shooting in the U.S. since the Nov. 5, 2009 attack at Fort Hood, Texas, when an Army psychiatrist killed 13 soldiers and civilians and more than two dozen others wounded. In Colorado, it was the deadliest since the Columbine High School massacre on April 20, 1999, when two students opened fire at the school in the Denver suburb of Littleton, killing 12 classmates and a teacher and wounding 26 others before killing themselves. Friday's attack began shortly after midnight at the multiplex theater at a mall in Aurora, the state's third-largest city. The film has several scenes of public mayhem — a hallmark of superhero movies. In one scene, the main villain Bane leads an attack on the stock exchange and, in another, leads a shooting and bombing rampage on a packed football stadium. It was the final installment of the Dark Knight trilogy directed by Christopher Nolan, starring Christian Bale as Batman. The series has a darker tone than previous Batman incarnations. It is the follow-up to The Dark Knight, which won Heath Ledger a posthumous Oscar for his searing portrayal of The Joker. The gunman released a gas that smelled like pepper spray from a green canister with a tag on it, Seeger said. ""I thought it was showmanship. I didn't think it was real,"" she said. Seeger said she was in the second row, about four feet from the gunman, when he pointed a gun at her face. At first, ""I was just a deer in headlights. I didn't know what to do,"" she said. Then she ducked to the ground as the gunman shot people seated behind her. She said she began crawling toward an exit when she saw a girl about 14 years old ""lying lifeless on the stairs."" She saw a man with a bullet wound in his back and tried to check his pulse, but ""I had to go. I was going to get shot."" Witness Shayla Roeder said she saw a young teenage girl on the ground bleeding outside the theater. ""She just had this horrible look in her eyes .... We made eye contact and I could tell she was not all right,"" Roeder said. Police, ambulances and emergency crews swarmed on the scene after frantic calls started flooding the 911 switchboard, officials said. Officers came running in and telling people to leave the theater, Salina Jordan told the Denver Post. She said some police were carrying and dragging bodies. Hayden Miller told KUSA-TV that he heard several shots. ""Like little explosions going on and shortly after that we heard people screaming,"" he told the station. Hayden said at first he thought it was part of a louder movie next door. But then he saw ""people hunched over leaving theater."" Officers later found the gunman near a car behind the theater. Oates said there was no evidence of any other attackers. Holmes was a student at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver until last month, spokeswoman Jacque Montgomery said. She did not know when he started school or why he withdrew. At least 24 people were being treated at Denver area hospitals. ""Warner Bros. and the filmmakers are deeply saddened to learn about this shocking incident. We extend our sincere sympathies to the families and loved ones of the victims at this tragic time,"" the studio said. Copyright © 2021, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc. All rights reserved.

Obama spoke for about six minutes Friday morning at a Fort Myers, Florida, convention center full of supporters who awoke this morning thinking they were going to a spirited rally. Instead, they like the rest of the nation, learned 24-year-old gunman James Holmes reportedly burst into a darkened movie theater, tossed in tear gas, and loosed a barrage of gunfire on audience members during an early Friday morning screening of the new Batman movie. Timeline: Worst mass shootings in U.S. In Fort Myers, there was an American flag, but no Obama campaign signs with the now familiar ""Forward"" campaign slogan. There was no music. The mood was somber. ""What matters ... is not the trivial things which so often consume us. ... Ultimately it's how we choose to treat each other and how we love one another,"" Obama told the gathering. ""There will be other days for politics,"" the president continued. ""This will be a day for prayer and reflection."" Theater shooting unfolds in real time on social media Obama canceled afternoon events and headed for the White House, where he was to meet with  FBI director Jack Lew,  Homeland Security Adviser John Brennan and other key staff  to get an update on the Aurora shooting. Obama was in Palm Beach, Florida, in the middle of a two-day swing through the battleground state when Homeland Security Adviser John Brennan told him of the shooting at 5:26 a.m. The president spoke first with Aurora Mayor Steve Hogan and then called Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper from his motorcade from the Fort Myers airport to the convention center. The Obama campaign's scripted attack for the day on how Romney's ""economic agenda would be devastating for small businesses,"" was scrapped. The campaign raced to pull down ads in Colorado, designed to point out the differences between Obama and Romney. ""We have asked affiliates to pull down our contrast advertising for the time being. It takes time for stations to be able to do this, but we are making every effort,"" Obama's traveling campaign press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters aboard Air Force One. Vice President Joe Biden and first lady Michelle Obama also canceled their events. Romney, who spent Thursday attending meetings at his campaign headquarters in Boston, also used his first scheduled appearance of the day in Bow, New Hampshire, where to address the shootings. Romney and his wife, Ann, also canceled their events. Aspiring sports reporter killed in theater shooting A top Romney adviser said the candidate made the decision to set aside his usual stump speech and wrote a new one to offer his own personal reflections on the tragedy. ""He wanted to say something,"" the adviser told CNN. In a speech that was steeped in Biblical references, Romney said,  ""This is a time for each of us to look into our hearts and remember how much we love one another."" ""The apostle Paul explained, 'Blessed be God who comforteth us in all our tribulations that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble,"" Romney said. He, too, stood on a stage that was stripped of campaign banners and music. The Romney campaign also pulled its ads in Colorado until further notice, according to campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul. Major Republican super PAC American Crossroads and its affiliate Crossroads GPS have also requested that all television and Internet ads in Colorado be suspended for the time being. Few hints of alleged shooter's past Both Obama and Romney made the right call, political analysts say. ""No decent person hears about a mass murder and thinks immediately of politics,"" said Democratic strategist and CNN political contributor Paul Begala. ""President Obama handled it just right, speaking as our national Pater Familias, offering comfort, canceling his campaign appearances and pulling down his negative ads in Colorado.  Mitt Romney, too, wisely offered prayerful condolences and did not seek to politicize this tragedy."" ""Will this permanently alter the political discourse? Of course not,"" Begala said. One of the nation's most outspoken advocates of stricter gun-control laws saw the tragedy a underscoring the need for both Obama and Romney to address the issue. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, said in a radio interview Friday the two candidates for president needed to take a firmer line in addressing gun violence. ""Soothing words are nice, but maybe it's time that the two people who want to be president of the United States stand up and tell us what they are going to do about it, because this is obviously a problem across the country,"" Bloomberg said on WOR Radio's ""The John Gambling Show."" Gun control supporters, such as Bloomberg, said Friday's tragedy should spark greater focus on how guns reach killers. Opinion: Gun control won't stop mass murder ""The horrific nightmare of a mass shooting on innocent civilians in a crowded public place has, sadly, come true once again,"" said Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-New York, whose husband was killed in the 1993 shooting on the Long Island Railroad and son was seriously injured. ""We as a nation should also not continue to ignore avenues to prevent tragedies like this from happening in the future."" The National Rifle Association was cautious in its response. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families and the community. NRA will not have any further comment until all the facts are known,"" said Andrew Arulanandam, director of public affairs for the NRA. NRA tweeter was 'unaware' of Colorado shooting, spokesman says"

We've received your submission. LOS ANGELES — “The Dark Knight Rises” was on track to earn $160 million, which would be a record for 2-D films, over the weekend following a mass shooting at a Colorado screening of the Batman film. That amount would best the $158.4 million debut of “The Dark Knight” in 2008 and give “Dark Knight Rises” the third-highest domestic weekend opening ever after the 3-D films “The Avengers” with $207.4 million and “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows — Part 2” with $169.2 million. Citing box office insiders, The Hollywood Reporter, Los Angeles Times, New York Times and other media outlets reported Sunday that the latest Batman film earned $160 to $162 million. “This tragedy did not seem to impact the box office in a major way,” said Paul Dergarabedian, an analyst for Hollywood.com who specializes in box office. “For this film to still be in the rarified air of the top-three openings of all time is phenomenal, given the unfortunate circumstances surrounding the release of this film.” Dergarabedian noted that the box-office ranking of director Christopher Nolan’s final installment of his Batman trilogy would not be official until Warner Bros. and other studios release their final weekend box-office tallies Monday. Sony, Fox, Disney, Paramount, Universal and Lionsgate joined “Dark Knight Rises” distributor Warner Bros in publicly withholding their usual revenue reports out of respect for the victims and their families. Box-office tracking service Rentrak also did not report figures following the Aurora, Colo., shootings that killed 12 and wounded 58 at a midnight screening of the new Batman sequel on Friday.

We are committed to bringing whoever was responsible to justice, ensuring the safety of our people, and caring for those who have been wounded. As we do when confronted by moments of darkness and challenge, we must now come together as one American family. All of us must have the people of Aurora in our thoughts and prayers as they confront the loss of family, friends, and neighbors, and we must stand together with them in the challenging hours and days to come.” — President Barack Obama. —— “Ann and I are deeply saddened by the news of the senseless violence that took the lives of 15 people in Colorado and injured dozens more.

Innocent people suffered a heartbreaking loss, but the victims and their families are not alone.

Everyone affected by this violent act will be in our hearts today and for a long time to come.” — Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. —— “You know, soothing words are nice, but maybe it’s time that the two people who want to be president of the United States stand up and tell us what they are going to do about it, because this is obviously a problem across the country.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. SAN FRANCISCO – Silenced for a weekend, the race for the White House reverted to divisive form Monday, as President Barack Obama and Republican Mitt Romney found enough distance from a national tragedy to get back to the politics of getting elected. Obama tried to put the squeeze on Romney, with the president's campaign aides demanding ""substantive"" expectations for the Romney's upcoming trip to England, Israel and Poland. Headed for Nevada, Obama was touting his foreign policy record to the Veterans of Foreign Wars a day before Romney addresses the group. Romney, addressing donors, returned to his critique that Obama is ""out of ideas, out of excuses, and we've got to make sure in November we put him out of office."" He cautioned the public not to look to government for answers in response to the Colorado shooting. Instead, he urged people to reach out locally to help people in need. Still in the shadow of a rampage that united the nation in grief, the campaigns weighed how much and how fast to calibrate their tones. They seemed intent on returning to the business of defining their message and their opponents, albeit not quite yet with the vitriol of earlier weeks. The race is tight, both nationally and in the select states expected to decide the outcome, polls show. That leaves little time for either side to dial down. Foreign policy and national security, marginalized in this economy-centered election year, moved briefly to the fore. In a conference call with reporters, Obama campaign officials challenged Romney to offer specific policy ideas during his three-country trip this week. Romney's travels are highly anticipated as a measure of how well he can stand up on the world stage. Obama took an even broader such trip as a candidate in 2008. ""If Romney wants to be president, if he is ready to be commander in chief, he needs to prove that he's willing to have open and honest discussions about his world views, about his beliefs, about his policies with some of our strongest allies,"" said Michele Flournoy, a campaign adviser and former top policy official at the Pentagon. Four years ago, trying to burnish his own credentials against military hero Sen. John McCain, Obama traveled extensively to the Middle East and Europe, with stops in both war fronts of Afghanistan and Iraq. Obama adviser Robert Gibbs said the question for Romney is whether his trip ""will be similar substantively"" for voters. In California, Romney was raising money in the wealthy and Republican heavy area of Orange County on Monday after holding three fundraisers in the San Francisco Bay area the previous night. He was expected to raise $10 million during the swing. Romney was scheduled to hold a business discussion in Irvine, Calif., before heading to Reno, Nev. for his VFW speech on Tuesday. Obama is on a previously scheduled three-day trip that includes campaign fundraisers Monday in California and Tuesday in Seattle. He was expected to raise more than $6 million on the West Coast. Both campaigns were keeping their largely negative television advertisements off the air in Colorado, a key battleground state in the November election. The presidential race resumed as the accused Colorado shooter appeared in court Monday for the first time. Vice President Joe Biden, campaigning for his boss in Florida, jettisoned his typical speech to focus on the shooting victims and the stories of heroism from that night. He told National Association of Police Organizations: ""There's a hell of a lot more good out there than the evil you're sworn to take on."" The massacre stalled a race for the White House that had becoming increasingly bitter. Romney made a low-key return to political activity Sunday night at his fundraisers, telling supporters he would tone down his political rhetoric, at least for the night, in ""keeping with the seriousness of the day."" The former Massachusetts governor avoided attacking Obama by name. Obama on Sunday spent hours in emotional private meetings with the families of the dead and also met with some of those injured in the attacks. ""I hope that over the next several days, next several months, we all reflect on how we can do something about some of the senseless violence that ends up marring this country,"" Obama said. Romney said Obama's trip was ""the right thing for the president to be doing on this day."" The Obama campaign launched the week with a web video titled ""Welcome Home Our Veterans,"" celebrating Obama's record on veterans' issues. It includes personal testimonials from former servicemen and women who thank him for supporting the troops. The film takes special note of Obama's work to end the U.S. military role in Iraq. Much of Romney's week will be focused on America's role abroad. In his first trip overseas as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, he is expected to attend the opening ceremonies of the Olympics in London and then meet with foreign dignitaries in England, Israel and Poland. ___ Beaumont reported from Irvine, Calif.

86523477,2012-07-26 00:00:00,Futile Remedies for Mass Shootings,http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/07/26/futile_remedies_for_mass_shootings_114909.html,en,False,,1040,RealClearPolitics,http://realclearpolitics.com/,"By Steve Chapman - July 26, 2012  When someone is ill or anxious to avoid illness, he may be open to any possible treatments. That's why quack remedies, untested formulas and obvious placebos often find takers. When a mass shooting occurs, the urge to find a cure is powerful. As a rule, though, those that emerge are sugar pills. A nation with very few guns, exceedingly tight firearms restrictions and little interest in such weaponry would not experience these atrocities as often as ours does. But in a society with hundreds of millions of guns and huge demand for them, as well as high rates of violent crime of all sorts, the challenge borders on the insurmountable. The tactics of the alleged killer in this case serve gun control supporters as a roadmap to what should be done. He had an AR-15 ""assault weapon,"" proving we should prohibit these guns. He had a magazine that can hold 100 cartridges, dramatizing the need to restrict magazine capacity. He bought some 6,000 rounds over the Internet, suggesting that the government should outlaw large purchases or monitor anyone who makes them. All these conclusions sound perfectly plausible. And none of them offers any prospect of averting the next massacre. Take the danger posed by ""assault weapons."" It turns out the one recovered in Aurora, Colo., might have been illegal under the federal ban that was in effect from 1994 to 2004. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., calls for reviving that law on the ground that ""these are weapons that you are only going to be using to kill a lot of people in close combat."" What she and many others don't realize is that ""assault weapons"" are functionally indistinguishable from ordinary semi-automatic hunting rifles. They don't fire more rapidly, they don't deliver more lethal rounds, and they don't ""spray"" bullets. They only look like military arms. The features that disqualified a gun under the federal ban were ones that didn't affect destructiveness, such as pistol grips and bayonet mounts. If accused killer James Holmes had been prevented from buying this gun, he could have found plenty of others that would have served his purpose just as well. Almost everyone who buys an AR-15 uses it to hunt small game or perforate targets. The number of customers who obtain guns like this only ""to kill a lot of people in close combat"" is just slightly above zero -- a market that would be far too small to induce a company to make them. Holmes reportedly equipped his rifle with a 100-round magazine -- compared to the maximum of 10 allowed under the old federal law. But limiting magazine size would most likely be an exercise in futility. In the first place, a halfway competent shooter can quickly replace an empty magazine with a fresh one, or else switch to another gun. (Holmes allegedly used three and had a fourth.) The brief interruption a killer needs for reloading is helpful only if someone can seize the moment to subdue him -- something more common in movies than in real life. Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck says he knows of only one mass shooting in which that happened, in 1993. In the 2011 Tucson shooting, the suspect was overcome when his gun jammed after he reloaded. Tracking anyone who makes large ammunition purchases? David Kopel, research director at the free-market Independence Institute in Denver, points out that more than a billion rounds are sold each year in the United States -- many of them in bulk by target shooters who burn through hundreds or thousands every month. If the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were to investigate each of these buyers, it would have little time to do anything else. And it would probably catch no criminals, since they would buy in smaller lots to avoid detection. Besides, most of the rounds that Holmes allegedly bought lay idle. The quantity of ammunition he is said to have used could have been obtained in a few purchases that would set off no alarms. The rest of his fearsome stockpile had no bearing on the outcome. Ideas like these are proposed anytime a mass shooting takes place but lately, at least, never go anywhere. Supporters take that as proof of the vast, unhealthy influence of the National Rifle Association. But it could be Americans just have no appetite for solutions that don't solve.

86575152,2012-07-27 12:49:07,"Romney Stumbles in London, but Will It Matter?",http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/07/27/romney_stumbles_in_london_but_will_it_matter_114931.html,en,False,,1040,RealClearPolitics,http://realclearpolitics.com/,"By Erin McPike - July 27, 2012  For months, Londoners' readiness to handle the crowds and ensure security at the Olympics -- all while maintaining their enthusiasm for the grand international sports spectacle -- has been a big question in the run-up to the Summer Games. But when Mitt Romney gave voice to those doubts on the eve of Friday's opening ceremonies, he suddenly made himself the story. And not in a good way. In an interview with NBC’s Brian Williams, the Republican presidential nominee was asked his view of British preparedness. “There are a few things that were disconcerting, the stories about the private security firm not having enough people, the supposed strike of the immigration and customs officials -- that obviously is not something which is encouraging,” he replied. “Because in the games there are three parts that makes games successful. “Number one, of course, are the athletes. That's what overwhelmingly the games are about. Number two are the volunteers. And they'll have great volunteers here. But number three are the people of the country. Do they come together and celebrate the Olympic moment? And that's something which we only find out once the games actually begin.” This skepticism did not go over well with his hosts, who found it ungracious, not to mention gratuitous. And they responded in kind. None other than British Prime Minister David Cameron fired back at the hero of the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City. “We are holding an Olympic Games in one of the busiest, most active, bustling cities anywhere in the world,” Cameron said testily. “Of course it’s easier if you hold an Olympic Games in the middle of nowhere.” On Friday morning, Romney awoke to the headlines in the famously unrestrained British tabloids: “Mitt the Twit,” blared one. “Who Invited Party-Pooper Romney?” asked another. In an attempt at damage control, he ventured back before the cameras of NBC -- the network covering the Olympics -- to make amends. “After being here a couple of days, it looks to me like London is ready,” he said on NBC’s “Today” show. “Of course it is hard to put on games in a major metropolitan area,” he added, in a concession to Cameron’s dig. “What they have done that I find so impressive is they took the venues and put them right in the city.” And in a remark that few viewers on either side of the Atlantic would dispute, Romney also said: “In just a few moments all the things politicians say will get swept away because the athletes will take the stage.” But back in the States, Democrats pounced, blasting out several versions of documents taunting Romney for getting a spate of bad headlines on the first stop of his European tour. The Democratic National Committee released a web video Friday morning that drew together footage from Thursday’s network newscasts in the United States drawing attention to Romney’s uncertain foray into international diplomacy. Included is a clip of London Mayor Boris Johnson telling a crowd outside the Olympic park: “There are some people coming from around the world who don’t yet know all the preparations we’ve done to get London ready in the last seven years. There’s a guy called Mitt Romney who wants to know whether we’re ready.” Although Romney endured a tough day of press coverage, the only London residents who can vote in U.S. elections are American ex-pats, and it seems unlikely that his rather innocuous comments would alienate many voters back home. Nonetheless, some stateside Republicans felt compelled to come to his defense. “I hope the London Olympics go off without a hitch,” tweeted conservative writer Jim Geraghty. “But the idea that Romney said anything controversial or undiplomatic is just flat wrong.” It’s a matter of conjecture whether what Romney said will bother Americans one way or the other. Most probably will not care, while a few might think it reflects poorly on his ability to represent the United States on the world stage. But in an election that is shaping up to be very close, every little bit has the potential to help -- or hurt. Mostly, this unforced error may represent a lost opportunity: it diverted attention from Romney’s chance to spotlight his own experience successfully running the games a decade ago, while reinforcing President Obama’s reputation as a guy who makes a good impression on the locals when he travels abroad.

Two days after moviegoers in the Colorado municipality were sprayed with bullets in a senseless attack that killed 12 and injured 58, Obama on Sunday visited each family who had lost someone as well as survivors struggling to recover. Speaking to reporters at the University of Colorado hospital, near the scene of the massacre, Obama acted as ""comforter-in-chief"" just as he had in the wake of the 2011 mass shooting in Tucscon that wounded Congresswoman Gaby Giffords. Beginning his speech by quoting Bible scripture, Obama said he had been deeply moved by his experience talking to victims and their relatives. ""I come to them not so much as president, as I do as a father and husband,"" he said. Obama described hearing a story of how one young woman had saved the life of her shot friend by remaining in the cinema, staunching the bleeding with her fingers, as the rampage continued. Such stories of bravery and survival were a comfort amid the tragedy, Obama said. ""Even in the darkest of days life continues and people are strong and people bounce back and people are resilient."" Obama's speech was also notable for what he did not say. He deliberately avoided mentioning the suspected killer's name. And he gave no sign of entering into a political debate over stricter gun controls that could in future prevent the mass shootings that seem to have become a regular part of American life. As Obama visited, further details emerged of the victims – police released a list of all 12, including a navy service member and a six-year-old girl whose mother was wounded and remains in hospital. Aurora held an official vigil outside the town hall – thousands gathered to lay flowers, say prayers and listen to church choirs singing in a ceremony of mourning and remembrance. Further clues about what motivated the gunman may be revealed on Monday when suspect James Holmes makes his first appearance in court. The murder spree stunned the suburban Denver community and shocked America as a whole. Even in a nation used to random mass killings, Aurora seemed unusually cruel and bizarre. Holmes, 24, is alleged to have propped open the side door to the Century 16 movie theatre prior to the late-night screening of new Batman movie, The Dark Knight Rises. When he re-entered the suspect was armed with a military-style assault rifle, a shotgun and a handgun, and was covered nearly head to toe with body armour, it is claimed. He had apparently dyed his hair red and referred to himself as classic Batman villain the Joker, making the reference as he was taken into custody. Police experts spent much of Saturday defusing boobytraps at Holmes's one-bedroom apartment a few miles from the theatre. They used robots and a controlled explosion to disarm a tripwire and other devices he had allegedly left in the Paris Street home. Police have suggested it all forms a picture of a man who meticulously planned for Friday's massacre. Holmes, a bright and talented science student, is alleged to have prepared for months. He had apparently spent more than $15,000 on the internet amassing an arsenal of 6,000 rounds of ammunition and his bulletproof clothing. At least 90 packages were delivered to Holmes over a period of four months. Police say they have collected surveillance footage of Holmes collecting his purchases – vital for prosecutors seeking to show he carefully planned the crime well in advance. ""What we're seeing here is evidence of, I think, some calculation and deliberation,"" said the Aurora police chief, Daniel Oates. Holmes bought his four guns in person at local gun shops. All of the firearms, ammunition and equipment were purchased legally, taking advantage of America's relaxed gun ownership laws. Despite his collection of weapons and bullets it is clear that no one saw Holmes as a serious threat. He may have been having a hard time finding work, and was leaving his postgraduate studies in Colorado, but Holmes has been consistently described as a quiet, shy individual who seemed normal and certainly not a potential mass killer. In a resume posted on the job hunting website Monster.com, Holmes listed himself as an ""aspiring scientist"" and said he was looking to work as a laboratory technician. Instead of finding a job he appears to have dedicated himself to creating spectacular mass carnage. He transformed his apartment into a lethal trap by priming explosives and turning on music at a high volume, police say. Residents fortunately did not open the door and instead called the authorities. ""The apartment was designed to kill whoever entered it,"" said Oates, outlining a belief that it might have been aimed specifically at taking out Aurora police officers responding to the shooting. ""If you think we are angry, we sure as hell are angry."" It emerged that the massacre could have been worse if not for one of Holmes's weapons apparently jamming in the theatre. The Associated Press, quoting an unnamed federal law enforcement official, reported that Holmes's semi-automatic rifle stopped working, forcing him to change to a gun with a much lower rate of fire. That almost certainly reduced the death toll but is likely to be of little comfort to the relatives of the 12 dead and many wounded. As the identities of those killed emerged over the weekend, it was revealed that the youngest victim was six-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan, who had just learned to swim over the summer. Her mother, Ashley Moser, remains in hospital with gunshot wounds. Other victims included a local bartender, a serving soldier and restaurant workers. The list of dead and injured was a random slice of suburban American life. The only thing that truly united them was the fateful choice to go and see The Dark Knight Rises late on Friday."

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: AURORA, Colo.—Despair all around him, President Barack Obama on Sunday offered hugs, tears and the nation’s sympathy to survivors of the Colorado shooting rampage and to families whose loved ones were shot dead. He looked for hope in the heartbreak, insisting a brighter day will come for the grieving and declaring that “much of the world is thinking about them.” In dramatic detail, Obama offered a glimpse inside the horror that took place in the Denver-area movie theater early Friday, relaying a story he said spoke to the courage of young Americans. With two fingers pressed to his own neck, Obama recalled how one woman saved the life of a friend who had been shot by keeping pressure on a vein that had “started spurting blood” and by later helping carry her to safety. In private, Obama visited one by one with anguished families gathered at a hospital and wounded patients recovering in intensive care. He emerged before the TV cameras and kept his focus on the lives and dreams of the fallen and the survivors, not the sole shooting suspect or his “evil act.” “I come to them not so much as president as I do as a father and as a husband,” said Obama, addressing reporters from a hospital hallway after his visits. “The reason stories like this have such an impact on us is because we can all understand what it would be to have somebody we love taken from us in this fashion.” For a president nearing the end of his term and seeking a second one, it was another grim occasion for him to serve as national consoler in chief, a role that has become a crucial facet of the job. National tragedies compel presidents to show leadership and a comforting touch—or risk a plummeting public standing if they cannot match the moment. The massacre in the Aurora movie theater left 12 dead and 58 wounded. It also temporarily silenced a bitter campaign fight for the White House between Obama and Republican Mitt Romney. Both men were searching for the right time and manner to re-enter the political debate. Obama’s stop in Colorado—which happens to be a key electoral state in the race—came as he was about to shift into a mix of campaign fundraisers and official travel across the West starting Monday. Romney resumed political activities Sunday in California, where he courted Republican donors in three fundraisers in the San Francisco area. “I know the president is in Colorado today,” Romney told supporters while keeping a subdued tone. “He’s visiting with families and friends of the victims, which is the right thing for the president to be doing on this day—appreciate that.” Obama said his conversations with family members were filled with memories of brothers, sons and daughters who had left their mark on others. He said there were laughs as well as tears. Jordan Ghawi, brother of shooting victim Jessica Ghawi, tweeted that Obama was already familiar with his sister’s story before sitting down with him but wanted to learn more. “My main task was to serve as a representative of the entire country and let them know that we are thinking about them at this moment and will continue to think about them each and every day,” Obama said. “The awareness that not only all of America but much of the world is thinking about them might serve as some comfort.” A single suspect, James Holmes, is being held without bond on suspicion of multiple counts of first-degree murder after the shooting rampage, which occurred minutes into a premiere of “The Dark Knight Rises” Batman movie early Friday in this suburb outside Denver. Obama said he assured the families that even though the suspect behind “this evil act has received a lot of attention over the last couple of days, that attention will fade away. And in the end, after he has felt the full force of our justice system, what will be remembered are the good people who were impacted by this tragedy.” The president’s most vivid lines came in describing the story of two friends, 19-year-old Allie Young and her best friend, 21-year-old Stephanie Davies. Both were in Young’s hospital room when Obama visited. Obama recounted that when the gunman entered the movie theater and threw canisters of gas at the start of his killing spree, Allie stood up to warn people. “And she was shot in the neck, and it punctured a vein, and immediately she started spurting blood,” Obama said. “And apparently, as she dropped down on the floor, Stephanie—21 years old—had the presence of mind to drop down on the ground with her, pull her out of the aisle, place her fingers over where Allie had been wounded, and applied pressure the entire time while the gunman was still shooting,” Obama said. The president said Davies eventually joined others in carrying her friend to an ambulance. He said Young was going to be fine. “As tragic as the circumstances of what we’ve seen today are, as heartbreaking as it is for the families, it’s worth us spending most of our time reflecting on young Americans like Allie and Stephanie,” Obama said. “They represent what’s best in us, and they assure us that out of this darkness a brighter day is going to come.” The task of articulating sorrow and loss has become a familiar one for Obama. In November 2009, he led mourners at a service for victims of the mass shooting at Texas’ Fort Hood. In January 2011, he spoke at a memorial for the six victims killed in Tucson, Ariz., when a gunman attacked Rep. Gabrielle Giffords as she met with constituents. The following April, when some 300 people were killed in a multistate series of tornadoes, Obama flew to Tuscaloosa, Ala., to commiserate with residents whose homes were in ruins. A month later, Obama went to Joplin, Mo., after a monster twister claimed 161 lives. ——— AP White House Correspondent Ben Feller in Washington and AP writers Steve Peoples in San Francisco and Catherine Tsai in Denver contributed to this report.

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: In recent years, St. Paul police have trained for a possible massacre like the one Friday, July 20, in Aurora, Colo.
“I think it prepares the police department for real-life situations,” police spokesman Sgt. Paul Paulos said. “I think it prepares the officers to have the knowledge of what to do when he or she encounters a scenario and how to act appropriately.”
Since 2006, the St. Paul SWAT unit has trained every police academy class on how to respond to a gumman, Paulos said. In 2006 and 2010, the unit trained members of the patrol division.
At the end of this month, the department will hold another training in “preparation for another level,” this time for 22 officers and 10 St. Paul firefighters. “It’s a three-echo concept: enter, evaluate and evacuate,” Paulos said.
Typically, SWAT members are the most highly trained members of the police force, with the most experience in major public safety events. At any time, up to five SWAT members are on patrol, and they are typically the first responders to a scene, Paulos said.
In training, mock scenarios prepare officers, and police look at past real events such as the shootings at Columbine, Red Lake, Minn., and Virginia Tech, Paulos said.
“Then you say, ‘How can we better do this?’ ” he said about crafting a police response. “After this instance in Colorado, we’ll say, ‘What can we take a look at here?’ ”
A mock scenario, which amounts to intense role-playing, is as close to the real thing as possible.
“Down from initial radio call to shots being fired in a building to people running at them when they’re coming out and multiple distractions as they’re going through the building,” Paulos said. 
“People running at you; is that one the bad guy? People lying on the ground; do you stop and help? Because often the shooting is still going on. Did they deploy gas? Is there an explosive device? 
“There’s a lot of things we try to throw at the officers during the training, for the possible, actual scenario they might come across one day,” he continued.

People lying on the ground; do you stop and help? Because often the shooting is still going on. Did they deploy gas? Is there an explosive device? “There’s a lot of things we try to throw at the officers during the training, for the possible, actual scenario they might come across one day,” he continued.

Childress, 29, was among the 12 victims killed in Friday’s mass shooting. The three Airmen, two women and a man, all in their Air Force uniforms, placed flowers at the memorial and then straightened the Air Force flag that was already in place. The male Airman, who declined to give his name, then turned to face the crowd of mourners. “We lost a great man, you guys,” he said. Childress lived in Thornton, and was one of two victims stationed at Buckley Air Force Base in Aurora. The other was John Larimer, a sailor in the U.S. Navy. The base released a statement Saturday: “This tragic event has affected everybody here at Buckley Air Force Base and our local community friends and neighbors,” base commander Col. Daniel Dant said in a statement. “We are deeply saddened by the loss of each and every loved one.” According to the Air Force Reserve Command, Childress worked as a cyber systems operator and was on active duty. “He was a huge part of our unit, and this is a terrible loss. The person that did this was an incredible coward,” said Air Force Chief Master Sergeant Schwald, who spoke on behalf of the three Air Force members Saturday. She declined to give her first name.

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: WASHINGTON—To his friends, Neil E. Prescott was a “gentle giant”—a physically towering young man with a background in computers and electronics and a sarcastic, even biting, sense of humor that people close to him knew to shrug off as innocuous. But police say they had no choice but to take it seriously when Prescott threatened to shoot up his workplace and referred to himself as “a joker,” comments that raised particular alarm in the wake of last week’s mass shooting at a Colorado theater during the latest Batman movie. The man accused in those shootings dyed his hair reddish-orange, and New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly has said the man called himself the Joker—a reference to Batman’s nemesis. Prescott, 28, was taken into custody early Friday at his apartment in Maryland, where officers found several thousand rounds of ammunition and a cache of about two dozen weapons including semi-automatic rifles and pistols. He was receiving an emergency psychiatric evaluation at a hospital and had not been charged as of Saturday afternoon. Two friends told The Associated Press Saturday that they couldn’t imagine that Prescott, who was in the process of being fired or already had lost his job, intended to be taken seriously when he allegedly told a supervisor: “I’m a joker and I’m gonna load my guns and blow everybody up.” “Neil’s the kind of guy who had the ability to say the wrong thing at the wrong time and not mean anything by it. So to him, he thinks it’s funny,” said Wesley Weber, who said his friend, at 6 feet 7 inches, was a “gentle giant” prone to bouts of exaggeration and inappropriate jokes who “talked big but didn’t walk the walk.” “He has the ability,” Weber added, “to say things that could be taken out of context.” Another friend, Mike Cochran, said Prescott has a history of wearing T-shirts with sarcastic, provocative and even inflammatory messages and is “no stranger to sarcasm regardless of political correctness.” When first approached by officers, police say, Prescott was wearing a shirt that said “Guns don’t kill people. I do.” “The Neil I know made those comments sarcastically in an environment where he felt he could make them without being taken seriously,” Cochran said in an email. Friends say that over the years, Prescott had shown deep interest in hobbies like such as computer software, electronics and ham radio. His clique of friends at one time gathered at parties to play multi-player video games and consume the highly caffeinated Jolt cola, Weber recalled. A sometime disc jockey, he’d also spin house music at Baltimore nightclubs and was the DJ for Cochran’s bachelor party in 2005. In recent years, though, he’d cultivated a passion for collecting firearms. He’d practice his shot at the training range, friends said, and communicate online with fellow gun enthusiasts about the ins and outs of firearm equipment and gun laws. At least some of the firearms recovered from his apartment in Crofton, near Annapolis, appear to have been legally owned, authorities said. A search for Neil Prescott on a website that tracks users’ online activities led to a profile that appears to be him on mdshooters.com, a website for Maryland gun hobbyists. On it, he trades advice about firearms with a display of technical know-how while at times expressing concern about break-ins near his apartment and detailing interactions with the police. Cochran, who also posts on the site, said he doesn’t know when Prescott started his gun collection but that he had been anxious about home invasions. He said he received one message from Prescott last November that said, “Might be sleeping in tomorrow, just had a suspicious male at my door. Notified PD but am gonna be lookin out tonight. Some crazy breakins near me recently.” In March, he provoked a spirited back-and-forth on the site when he complained that two police officers responding to a possible break-in at a nearby apartment “told me never to answer the door on my own property carrying.” He said he called a sergeant to complain about the directive. Last week, he was still on the site, talking with fellow users about 30-round magazines and boasting about his night-vision goggles. “During the power outage i spent lots of time loading mags and mounting lights, when the zombie apocalypse comes i’ll be ready,” he wrote. Maryland state court records for Prescott list only a speeding ticket in 2007. It wasn’t immediately clear if he had a lawyer. Police say Prescott, an employee of a subcontractor for software and mailroom supplier Pitney Bowes, made the threats during two Monday morning phone conversations with a supervisor. The supervisor, who declined to comment Saturday to a reporter who came to his house, said the comments made him afraid, especially because he was aware of Prescott’s weapons’ cache. Prescott at one point said he wished to see his supervisor’s “brain splatter all over the sidewalk,” but also acknowledged that he shouldn’t be saying such things over the phone, according to a search warrant applications. The threats were reported to the police, who paid an initial visit to Prescott’s apartment on Thursday before taking him into custody Friday morning. Cochran said he’s known Prescott since 2001, when they were colleagues at a technical support outsourcing company. He said Prescott was a network engineer. “With his skill set and education he would have had no problems finding other work with good pay. Neil did not at any point indicate to me that he had problems with where he was working,” Cochran wrote. Pitney Bowes spokeswoman Carol Wallace said Prescott had not been on any company property in at least four months. It wasn’t clear why he was losing his job. Weber said he thought the remark was inappropriate, but that it was bound to receive more attention now than it may have years ago, especially one week after the Colorado shooting. “We live in a different world now,” he said. ——— Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://twitter.com/etuckerAP ——— Associated Press writer Brian Witte and AP researcher Judith Ausuebel contributed to this report.

We've received your submission. High-capacity ammo magazines — like the 100-round clip James Holmes attached to a military-style AR-15 assault rifle for his movie-theater massacre — should once again be banned, gun-control advocates in Congress said yesterday. “The bigger the clips, the more people it’s going to kill,” said Rep. Carolyn McCarthy (D-LI), who was elected to Congress after her husband was killed in the 1993 Long Island Rail Road mass shooting. “What happened on that train, what has happened in all these mass killings, what happened this past weekend, there was one thing in common and they were the large magazine clips,” she said. The expiration of the assault weapons ban in 2004 also made it legal again to buy magazines that hold more than 10 bullets. McCarthy and Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) introduced legislation to renew the ban on high-capacity clips after Jared Loughner used a Glock with a 33-round clip in a 2011 rampage that killed six and severely wounded Rep. Gabby Giffords. Share Selection"

""I confessed to them that words are always inadequate in these kinds of situations, but that my main task was to serve as a representative of the entire country and let them know that we are thinking about them at this moment, and will continue to think about them each and every day,"" Obama told reporters after the meeting at the University of Colorado Hospital, one of several area medical centers that treated the 58 people wounded in Friday's attack. Though much attention has been paid to the ""perpetrator of this evil act,"" that spotlight will fade, leaving behind just the good memories of those impacted by the tragedy, Obama said. Focusing on the victims, not the suspect James Holmes, 24, is being held in connection with the shootings early Friday morning and the subsequent discovery of his booby-trapped apartment, which the authorities believe he rigged before leaving for the Century Aurora 16 multiplex. He is scheduled to appear in court on Monday morning. Obama recounted stories told to him by the victims' families and those recovering from injuries. ""It reminds you that even in the darkest of days, life continues and people are strong,"" the president said. ""Out of this darkness a brighter day is going to come."" Obama spoke before the start of a prayer vigil that brought together state and local officials with thousands of residents. Remembering the victims Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper read the names of those killed. And to each name, the crowd responded: ""We will remember."" Pastor Robin Holland led a prayer for comfort. ""City of Aurora, the healing has begun. Your presence here is the step of healing that this nation needs to see. And I am so proud to be a citizen of Aurora, Colorado,"" he said. Residents lit candles, while balloons, flowers and simple, white crosses collected at a makeshift memorial. ""It is not this senseless act of violence that marks us as a community. It is the lives and acts of these heroes and the innumerable acts of kindness, love, and care for our neighbors that defines who we are,"" Aurora Mayor Steve Hogan said at the vigil. ""We will reclaim our city in the name of goodness, kindness and compassion."" Massacre suspect's neighbor: 'I'm counting my lucky stars' The man accused of opening fire inside the theater left a trail of evidence that the police say suggests the shooting was part of a calculated plan that included killing anyone who tried to learn more about him in the aftermath of the attack. The authorities have said little about what they believe was the motive of the accused shooter, though investigators say there is evidence planning was under way for months. Holmes received a high volume of deliveries over the past four months to both his home and work addresses, which the police believe begins to explain how he got his hands on some of the materials used in the attack and those found at his apartment, said Aurora Police Chief Daniel Oates. ""What we're seeing here is evidence of, I think, some calculation and deliberation,"" Oates said. Gov. Hickenlooper told CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday that he spent a day going from hospital to hospital, talking with survivors. He concluded that Holmes was a person who wanted to terrorize and instill fear in people's lives, but said he can't conceive of a motive. ""This is a deeply troubled, twisted, delusional person,"" he said. Shooting survivors recount Colorado movie theater horror One survivor, Josh Nowlan, sustained gunshot wounds, but said he is happy just to be alive. He wouldn't be, he said, if the suspect's weapon had not jammed. ""I know I wouldn't be here. If that gun did not jam, I am full certain that I probably would not be here,"" he said from his hospital bed Saturday. Echoing Nowlan's comments, a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation said Sunday that a semi-automatic rifle used in the killings jammed, apparently because of a problem with the 100-shot magazine feeding it. The military-style AR-15 had a separately purchased drum magazine, which can have trouble feeding bullets into the firing chamber if the gun is fired rapidly, the source told CNN on condition of anonymity. Victims recalled through poignant stories Investigators say the rifle was one of three guns used by the suspect, along with a shotgun and a .40-caliber pistol. Police gained access Saturday to Holmes' apartment after intentionally detonating two rigged explosives. Technicians, with the help of a robot, worked to handle traps, wires and possible explosive and incendiary devices, Jim Yacone, a special agent with the FBI, told reporters Saturday. The operation proceeded with an eye toward preserving evidence, all of which will be sent to an FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, Yacone said. Among the items seized from the apartment were a Batman poster, Batman mask and a computer, according to the law enforcement source. The shootings occurred during a screening of the new Batman movie, ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Tales of heroism abound from tragedy Hundreds of residents were evacuated from five buildings, including the modest, three-story brick building where Holmes told the police he had rigged his top-floor, one-bedroom apartment with explosives. All occupants except those who live in the suspect's building were allowed to return home Saturday night. Share your tribute to the victims on CNN iReport."

Online,http://www.eonline.com/,"It is the rare American spectator sport that runs year-round. But not today. Today, the weekend box office was called. In the aftermath of the Aurora, Colo., shooting rampage, Warner Bros., as pledged, did not issue Friday-Sunday estimates for The Dark Knight Rises.The other major studios followed Warners' lead, and top reporting agencies like Exhibitor Relations and Hollywood.com did not issue reports for numbers they didn't have. FULL COVERAGE: Dark Knight Rises tragedy The silence was deafening. ""I cannot recall the studios ever choosing to not report box-office grosses, even around 9/11,"" journalist and TheWrap.com founder Sharon Waxman said in an email. Twelve people were killed and 58 injured at a midnight Friday, opening-day screening of The Dark Knight Rises in Aurora. The incident was the largest mass shooting in U.S. history. ""All the movie studios are trying their best to be sensitive to the tragedy, and to react with the appropriate decorum,"" Waxman said. MORE: Dark Knight Rises' Opening Day:  Not Business as Usual Max Keiser, who cofounded Hollywood Stock Exchange, a site that taps into the box-office obsession, took a dimmer view. ""[Warners] is ashamed that the box office is probably going to benefit due to the massacre,"" Keiser said in an email. But the numbers are expected to tell another story. Projections are being downsized, and where once the most-optimistic estimate had The Dark Knight Rises scoring a nearly $200 million domestic debut, and challenging the opening-weekend record of The Avengers, now the talk, per Exhibitor Relations, is of an opening between $155 million and $170 million. Presales, some made weeks in advance of the Aurora shooting, were believed to have driven much of the midnight, opening day and Saturday revenue. Sunday was to be the wild card: Would walk-ins still walk in? Would families show? The anecdotal evidence was not encouraging. MORE: The Dark Knight Rises' tragic legacy? Twitter, in particular, was rife with posts on Sunday from users claiming to be moviegoers in ""practically empty,"" ""virtually empty"" and ""half empty"" theaters showing the Christopher Nolan Batman movie. One tweet even came with a reputed snapshot of a ""completely empty"" screening room. The formal proof will come Monday when Warners and the other studios release their numbers. Hollywood is delaying the box-office weekend, not canceling it, as it were. Professor Robert J. Thompson called the box-office blackout a gesture, and in the scheme of things, not a terribly meaningful one. At the same time, Thompson, director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University, did not dismiss the Sunday-morning routine that is the parsing of the weekend numbers. The game—who's ahead? who's behind?—is a sport for people who aren't necessarily into sports, he said. And better than most sports, box-office results depend on the spectators' collective participation. ""When you hear this movie or that movie broke all records,"" Thompson said, ""you feel like you were part of something."" Just like maybe, perhaps the people in the opening-night theater in Aurora wanted to feel part of something. ""By delaying the numbers,"" Thompson said, ""there is some [acknowledgement] that those numbers would include in them some people who went to the movies on Friday, and didn't come back.""

And I don’t know if you’ve seen the movie, but the movie is pretty much a piece of crap. Yea, spoiler alert.” “I know that if none of that would have happened, pretty sure that somebody in that theater, about 25 minutes in, realizing it was a piece of crap, was probably like ‘ugh f------ shoot me,’” Cook remarked. The crowd’s response was a mix of groans, laughter and cheers. Last week, Warner Bros. studios, which produced “The Dark Knight Rises” contributed money to the relief fund for the victims of the mass shooting of a midnight showing of the film, where 12 people were killed and dozens wounded. The suspect, 24-year-old James Holmes is being held in solitary confinement, where he has been since his arrest on July 20. He made his first court appearance Monday.

When he arrived at work Friday morning — just hours after a gunman killed 12 and injured 58 others at the Century Aurora 16 theater — there already were 15 to 20 people waiting outside the store, Meyers said. He called Monday ”probably the busiest Monday all year” and said the basic firearms classes that he and the store’s owner teach are booked solid for the next three weeks, something that hadn’t happened all year. “A lot of it is people saying, ‘I didn’t think I needed a gun, but now I do,’ ” Meyers said. ”When it happens in your backyard, people start reassessing — ‘Hey, I go to the movies.’ ” Between Friday and Sunday, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation approved background checks for 2,887 people who wanted to purchase a firearm — a 43 percent increase over the previous Friday through Sunday and a 39 percent jump over those same days on the first weekend of July. The biggest spike was on Friday, when there were 1,216 checks, a 43 percent increase over the average number for the previous two Fridays. The checks are required before anyone may legally purchase a gun in Colorado. Because some purchasers may have bought more than one gun or decided against their purchase, the actual number bought may have been different from 2,887. Such increases aren’t unusual in the wake of mass shootings. After a gunman in Tucson killed six people and injured others, including Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, in 2010, background checks in Arizona jumped 60 percent over the same date one year earlier, according to the FBI. A similar increase occurred in Virginia after the shootings at Virginia Tech University in 2007. Dion Studinski, who teaches a course required for people to apply for a concealed-carry permit, said his class for Saturday at Firing-Line gun store and indoor shooting range in Aurora is overbooked. “We’ve definitely had an increase,” he said. Tom Mauser, a gun-control advocate whose son Daniel was killed at Columbine High School in 1999, said he wasn’t surprised by the numbers. “To me that’s just symbolic of the fear that drives (people),” he said. State Rep. Rhonda Fields, D-Aurora, said she understands what people are thinking when they walk into a gun shop. But she hopes buying a gun isn’t the only response people have. She would also like to see Congress reinstate an assault-weapons ban, and she said Colorado should look into other measures that could prevent tragedies like Friday’s shooting. “I think that’s what the conversation needs to be,” she said. ”I don’t think that to be preventative, we need to provide or have more guns.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters"

In a small courtroom packed with media, relatives of the dead and injured, and even some of the walking wounded themselves, Holmes sported a shock of dyed orange hair and a prison jump suit. His hands were cuffed and he did not say a word. He did not seem to look at his victims, either staring straight ahead or looking at his feet. He had been brought into the building via an underground tunnel from a next-door jail, where he is being held in solitary confinement and is on suicide watch. Holmes seemed dazed and at one point had to be encouraged to stand up, prompting speculation that he was on medication. The brief 10-minute appearance now sets in train what is expected to be a lengthy legal battle as prosecutors prepare a huge charge sheet and defence lawyers mull whether he is mentally fit to stand trial. Holmes, 24, will be accused of bursting into a midnight screening of the latest Batman movie in the Denver suburb of Aurora, hurling gas canisters and shooting his victims. He also left behind a booby-trapped apartment filled with homemade bombs. When arrested he reportedly told police he was the Batman villain the Joker, who also has coloured hair. It was not clear if any of Holmes's family attended the hearing, but a lawyer retained by the family, Lisa Damiani, held a press conference to clarify a remark by the suspect's mother to an ABC-TV reporter soon after the shooting. Damiani, speaking in San Diego, said that at the time of that early-morning phone call, Arlene Holmes was not yet aware of the attack or accusations that her son was involved. In telling the reporter, ""You have the right person,"" Arlene Holmes was confirming her identity and not referring to her son, Damiani said. Damiani said Arlene Holmes' comment to ABC had been misconstrued by some media to suggest that she was not surprised to hear that her son had been involved in the shooting rampage. For victims in the court, seeing the man who had brought such agony to their quiet slice of suburbia was surreal and upsetting. ""I just wanted to see him face to face. He was not able to look at me,"" said Mckayla Hicks, 17, who was shot in the jaw by a bullet that went through the wall of the theatre and into the next auditorium. Hicks still has the bullet lodged in her face but decided to come to court anyway as a way of coming to terms with the senselessness of the event. ""I feel a lot of confusion and anger, just wondering why he wasted all his talents,"" she said. That is a common question in Aurora, and one that has been posed by everyone from ordinary citizens to President Barack Obama, who visited the community on Sunday night and spent several hours with each family whose relatives had died. The picture that has emerged so far of Holmes is of a lonely, shy person, but a talented scientist, who had grown up in a stable middle-class home in San Diego and been a camp counsellor and an excellent student. ""I know people say he was a genius. It is hard to see someone that smart throw it away,"" said Hicks. But some victims in the courtroom were less keen on trying to understand what might have been going through Holmes's mind. David Sanchez, whose son-in-law was shot but survived, was visibly upset by being near to Holmes. ""He was pretty crazy looking. There was something not right about him,"" Sanchez said and added: ""Justice would be served for him to get the death penalty."" Holmes's first court appearance likely marks the start of Aurora's process of coming to terms with being the site of such a tragedy. The city has already held an official vigil and service of remembrance at which local officials, victims and ordinary citizens prayed and listened to church choirs sing. ""The pain is still raw but we will reclaim our city,"" said Aurora mayor Steve Hogan. At the vigil, Colorado's governor John Hickenlooper read off the names of each of the 12 dead and the crowd responded: ""We will remember."" But if Aurora has been unimaginably convulsed by the event, so far there is little sign of the shooting sparking any meaningful political debate over the issue of America's relaxed gun laws. Gun controls have actually grown looser since the 1999 Columbine school shooting – which also happened in suburban Denver just a few miles from Aurora in the city of Littleton. In his speeches on the tragedy, Obama has spoken of the suffering of the victims and the sense of the shock that has spread across the nation, but has not mentioned any support for tightening gun laws. Less unexpectedly, neither has his Republican challenger Mitt Romney, whose party base is fiercely opposed to any gun control legislation. Only New York mayor Mike Bloomberg has been a rare voice publicly calling for action. That is of little surprise to leading anti-gun campaigners, including Denver local Tom Mauser, whose 15-year-old son Daniel died in the Columbine shooting. Mauser, who is now a leading voice on stricter controls, said that he believed America was simply in thrall to the gun lobby. ""It is so pervasive in America. This is nothing to do with Colorado. This is to do with America's gun violence, "" he told the Guardian. Much has been made of the size of the arsenal that Holmes collected over the past four months and will be accused of putting to grim use inside the movie screening. It consisted of four guns, including a semi-automatic assault rifle, more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition and head-to-toe bullet proof protection. However, all of it was bought entirely legally either online or in person in gun store. There were a few warning signs that with hindsight appear to show a troubled young man. A year ago Holmes had tried to rent an apartment from one Aurora building manager but she turned him down, despite good references and a clean criminal record, because he had seemed unreliable and slightly strange. Then, in recent months, Holmes also alarmed the owner of a local gun range that he had applied to join by having a nonsensical voicemail message. Yet none of that even remotely seemed to suggest that Holmes was planning such a massive assault on a crowded room of strangers settling in to watch a summer blockbuster."

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama will not push for stricter gun laws this election year, the White House said Thursday, July 26, one day after his impassioned remarks about the need to keep assault weapons off the streets suggested he might plunge into that political fight and challenge Congress to act.
Instead, Obama’s stand on the government’s role ended up right where it was after the mass shooting in Colorado last week: Enforce existing law better.
That is the same view held by his GOP opponent, Mitt Romney, as both reach for broader and more politically appealing ways to keep guns away from killers.
Obama still wants Congress to reinstitute a federal ban on military-style assault weapons that lapsed years ago, his spokesman Jay Carney said. But the president is not and has not been pushing for that ban, a nod to the politics of gun control.
There is no interest among many lawmakers of both parties to take on the divisive matter, especially not with an election in just over 100 days.
Sealing the matter, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Thursday the Senate’s schedule is too packed to even have a debate on gun control.
Public opinion has shifted away from tighter gun control. Twenty years ago, polls showed that a substantial majority supported stricter limits on guns. Now Americans appear evenly divided. Nearly every statement on the matter from Romney and Obama includes reminders that they stand by the Second Amendment.
From the White House, Carney said: “There are things that we can do short of legislation and short of gun laws.”
The lack of legislation reflects that reality, too: Police say laws and background checks are often futile in keeping someone with horrifying intent from executing a massacre. Authorities say the suspect in the Aurora, Colo., shootings broke no laws when he purchased the guns he is accused of using, and he passed the required background checks.
Obama and his team “gain nothing politically, and they just don’t have the horsepower to pass anything,” said William Vizzard, professor emeritus of criminal justice at California State University, Sacramento, and an author on gun control politics. “And then the problem is trying to craft a law that would really do something.”
Yet at least one prominent gun control group sought Thursday to pressure Obama and Romney to offer voters concrete plans. The group’s president, Dan Gross, said words alone were not enough in a nation in which 32 people are killed by guns each day. He specifically challenged Obama.
“The president said very similar things in his last campaign,” said Gross, head of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. “A speech is not a plan. An endorsement of a measure is not a solution.”
Romney, in an interview Thursday with CNN, said new laws won’t help. He cited the case of Timothy McVeigh, who was convicted and put to death for the 1995 bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City, which killed 168 people. McVeigh used fertilizer in constructing his bomb.
“I think that the effort to continue to look for some law to somehow make violence go away is missing the point,” Romney said. “The real point has to relate to individuals that are deranged and distressed, and to find them and help them and to keep them from carrying out terrible acts.” WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama will not push for stricter gun laws this election year, the White House said Thursday, July 26, one day after his impassioned remarks about the need to keep assault weapons off the streets suggested he might plunge into that political fight and challenge Congress to act.

The red carpet will not roll out Friday on the Champs-Élysées after a mass shooting left 12 dead and 40 wounded in suburban Denver at a screening of The Dark Knight Rises. After a fatal mass shooting early Friday left 12 dead and 40 wounded in suburban Denver at a screening of The Dark Knight Rises, promotional activities for the film in France have been suspended. The red carpet will not roll out Friday evening on the Champs-Élysées, where the latest installment in the Batman franchise was due to premiere in Paris. Warner Bros., the studio behind the movie, quickly canceled a press junket scheduled for Friday morning at the luxury Bristol hotel, steps from the Élysée Palace—even while cast members prepared for interview sessions and dozens of film critics waited their turn—as word spread of the multiplex massacre some 5,000 miles away. The Colorado killings took place shortly before 9 a.m. Paris time. The film, featuring France’s own Marion Cotillard, among other cast members, is due to open on 900 French screens Wednesday. On an otherwise quiet summer Friday in France, coverage of the killings has dominated the media, heading top news sites throughout the day and leading 24-hour-news-channel loops. In the afternoon a crew was shown dismantling the premiere setup on the vast sidewalk in front of the Gaumont Champs-Élysées Marignan cinema. The TF1 TV network told Agence France-Presse that a late-morning taping of interviews with Cotillard and Morgan Freeman, scheduled to appear on the national 8 p.m. newscast just as the premiere was scheduled to begin, had also been canceled. Fellow stars Christian Bale and Anne Hathaway and director Christopher Nolan, all expected this evening on the “most beautiful avenue in the world” for the superhero blockbuster’s French debut, were also reportedly waiting in the wings at the Bristol as reporters were asked to leave. “We waited an hour and 45 minutes,” Sophie Grassin, a film critic for Le Nouvel Observateur present at the Bristol, told the French weekly’s website. “Then, around 11:30 a.m., we saw Marion Cotillard arrive, made up, well dressed. The Warner folks led her into a room where they evidently told her the terrible news. The Warner team was in tears.” Visiting the Tour de France on Friday, French President François Hollande said in a statement: “The President of the Republic has learned with very deep emotion of the shooting in a cinéma near Denver which, according to estimates that remain provisional, cost the lives of 12 people and injured about 40. He understands how much this drama deeply upsets America’s youth and bereaves all of America. In these tragic circumstances, he would like to impart all of his solidarity to American authorities and to the American people and to express, in the name of France, his condolences to the families and friends of the victims.”"

In the wake of other murderous outbursts in this state, from the Columbine massacre in 1999 to the New Life Church shootings in 2007, people are left asking — here and nationally — why Colorado? It is a compelling question with no easy answer. Our state does not seem burdened with onerous national stereotypes that  have saddled other states  such as Arizona (reactionaries), California (weirdness) and New Jersey (corruption). If anything, there is an image of Colorado as a haven for chilled-out mellowness amid sunshine and gorgeous scenery. Gov. John Hickenlooper went before the cameras Saturday to call the  shootings the act of an “unspeakably troubled individual.” “There’s no way we can turn the clock back, but we can take this abhorrent, inconceivable event and do everything we can to make it better,” he said. But  three massacres in a 13-year span  raise unsettling thoughts about why this  has happened here. “I think it’s a tough but  valid question,” said Del Elliott, founding director of the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence at the University of Colorado at Boulder. “These events are disturbing to me, but they look like an anomaly — terrible but within the realm of random events.” Elliott said that nationwide, Colorado is in the bottom third statistically for gun violence. “But the particular form of this violence — shooting with massive amounts of death — we do seem to have more of that,” he added. Elliott noted that the state narrowly avoided a similar disaster in 2006,  when law officers killed Duane Morrison, who had taken students hostage at Platte Canyon High School. One student, Emily Keyes, was killed by the gunman. “I’ve heard arguments about the number of guns in Colorado and the perspective we have on them,” Elliott said. “But these events seem very carefully planned, so that the availability of guns is almost irrelevant. Anyone with that level of intent is going to find weapons, legally or illegally.” Jennifer Harman, a professor at Colorado State University specializing in social psychology and violence, said there could be “cultural and social differences in the West about using violence as a way to deal with stress or provocation.” “There is even a theory that there are regional differences in when it’s acceptable to use violence,” she said. “The thinking is that it’s more acceptable in the South or West.” Harman  cited a study called “Culture of Honor: The Psychology of Violence in the South,” authored by Richard Nisbett and Dov Cohen, that made the case for regional  differences in the use of violence to settle grievances. Still, Harman said that  theory gets complicated in Colorado, where so many residents arrive from elsewhere. (James Eagan Holmes,  the 24-year-old man accused in the shootings, grew up in California.)  Thousands of native Midwesterners live here. Ditto for East Coasters, Texans and Californians. The Old West myth — and the New West one too, for that matter &mdash; holds that people can pull up roots and reinvent themselves. But such transience can lead to emotional isolation. And Harman noted that people who are social misfits and feel ostracized tend to lash out, not withdraw. “It does seem this state has an image that people are happy here,” said Patricia Limerick, a CU history professor who chairs the Center of the American West. “But if you’re unhappy and wildly so, that’s a way to contrast yourself with the rest of the world and withdraw.” Limerick said she could see no Colorado connection. “In these cases, it just seems the terrible strangeness of the individual is so much more of a factor that I can’t put it in relationship to the state,” she said. On Friday, Hickenlooper assured people that this is a “safe city, in a safe state, in a safe country.” Former Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, in a telephone interview, said the shooting was “just happenstance.” “I don’t think there’s anything unique to Colorado that caused this,” Romer said. “In our search for answers, we reach for connections that aren’t there.”Romer, governor from 1987 to 1999, pointed to the general availability of guns as the driver in such incidents. Aurora police said Holmes brought an AR-15  rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun and two .40-caliber Glock handguns to the Century  Aurora 16. “When I woke up and heard this story, the first thing that occurred to me as the cause is the widespread possession of guns in our society,” Romer said. “We have to understand as a society that the proliferation of guns will lead to their use. It’s just common sense.” Elliott, the CU professor, concurred — up to a point. “When we moved here from California in 1967, one of the reasons we came was because Colorado seemed a much safer place to live and raise a family,”  Elliott said. Like the rest of us, he was still trying to wrap his head around what happened and why, once again, mass murder had found its way to Colorado.

We've received your submission. Recently there have been calls for the NYPD to cut down on street stops, sometimes known as “stop, question and frisk” — a tactic that has been a part of policing since time immemorial. As far back as 1911, the state Legislature passed the Sullivan Law, with its seven-year sentence for individuals who carried a gun without a license — and cops began routinely searching persons who appeared to be carrying a firearm. In other states, field interrogations were always a common police tactic. The US Supreme Court upheld the practice in 1968; the key question in individual cases is whether the search is “reasonable.” In determining that, appellate courts will often disagree by margins of 3-2 or 5-4. But a police officer faced with the prospect of being shot can’t engage in a leisurely deliberation. During the crime deluge of the 1960s, ’70s and ’80s, New York cops had less time to conduct field interrogations because they were spending as much as 90 percent of their tours of duty answering 911 calls. The NYPD was reduced to containing crime rather than significantly reducing it. By 1990 the city was recording over 2,000 murders a year, up from about 500 in the mid ’60s. Then the NYPD commenced a huge rollback of crime, employing intensive patrolling and enforcement in high-violence areas. In this model, police don’t wait for someone to call 911 after a crime occurs; they instead try to stop criminals before they can strike. These police interventions sometimes cause people to complain. In the wake of the Colorado mass shooting, there will be calls for stricter law enforcement against guns. Yet when police take action they are criticized. For example, the fact that relatively few guns are recovered in New York street stops is cited as negating the need for searches. Actually, that fact indicates that gun-carrying has declined significantly because criminals fear they may be searched. New York’s efforts have been so successful that our overall crime rate is now 75 percent lower than it was 20 years ago. Murders are back down to the 500-a-year level. The story’s different elsewhere. If we look at murder (a crime that is very accurately reported), our rate per 100,000 population is now about a fourth as high as Chicago’s, and a fifth of Philadelphia’s. If we had Philly’s rate, we’d be in the range of 2,000 murders this year — back to the bad old days. Some argue that the NYPD should adopt “community policing,” a concept that’s been touted for nearly 40 years but has never been shown to have much effect on the crime rate. Chicago has maintained an extensive community policing program for years, yet homicides there are going through the roof. Gang members who go around shooting up neighborhoods don’t listen to community leaders who implore them not to engage in violence. Nor do gang-bangers and characters like the Colorado shooter turn in their weapons at the local police station when a gun-buyback is announced. New Yorkers today have to choose between retaining proactive policing, which has kept the city safe for so long, or going back to the reactive model that was in effect when the streets of many neighborhoods were dominated by criminals. In deciding, keep in mind the fate of Detroit. Not too long ago, it was one of America’s top five cities. Then violence began to tear it apart. Its murder rate is now 10 times higher than New York’s — and Detroit has seen two thirds of its population flee. Back in 1990, New York looked to be heading that way, with national publications featuring stories about the fall of the Big Apple. It didn’t happen because New Yorkers fought back effectively. New York’s current policing model (like any program) can always be improved. But calls to virtually abolish it must be resisted, lest we return to the bad old days when gunmen ruled the streets and crime threatened to destroy the greatest city in the world. Thomas A.

We've received your submission.  Alleged workplace shooting plotter Neil Prescott. (
) A Maryland man calling himself “a joker” is accused of threatening to shoot up the business from which he was about to be fired and was wearing a T-shirt that read “Guns don’t kill people. I do,” when he first talked to officers who arrested him, police said Friday. An official with knowledge of the investigation told The Associated Press that Neil Prescott phoned in the threat to software and mailroom supplier Pitney Bowes near Washington, D.C. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is unfolding, and police would not confirm the suspect’s name. “I am a joker and I’m gonna load my guns and blow everybody up,” he is accused of saying on the phone to Pitney Bowes, Prince George’s County Police Chief Mark Magaw said at a news conference. READ THE SEARCH WARRANT Investigators said a search of the 28-year-old man’s apartment in Crofton, Md., turned up some 25 firearms, including semi-automatic rifles and pistols, and several thousand rounds of ammunition. Police said they were surprised by the number of weapons they found. He was undergoing an emergency mental health evaluation and charges are pending, police said. Investigators say he called in the threat earlier this week. Pitney Bowes spokeswoman Carol Wallace said in an emailed statement that Prescott was an employee of a subcontractor to the company and had not been on any Pitney Bowes property in more than four months. Though the suspect referred to himself as “a joker” when he called in the threat, the official said there is no other known connection to a deadly shooting last week at a Colorado movie theater during the latest Batman movie. At a news conference Friday, officials said the man made several threats on separate phone calls. “If you call your business, if you call a loved one, if you call anybody and you threaten to do harm, kill people, we’re going to believe you, and we did,” said Prince George’s County Police Deputy Chief Hank Stawinski. Police say they considered the threat especially significant since a gunman in Colorado killed 12 people during the latest Batman movie. Share Selection"

86363584,2012-07-21 02:45:56,"Shooting suspect was doctoral student, had 'obvious intellectual capacity'",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_mostpopular/~3/kZ6iiRsjpTE/index.html,en,False,,1095,CNN,http://www.cnn.com/,"James E. Holmes is described by those who know him as a doctoral student who is clean-cut, quiet and responsible, an image difficult to reconcile with the same man who police allege opened fire in a crowded movie theater. Days after the 24-year-old was arrested on suspicion of a mass shooting at the Century 16 multiplex in Aurora, Colorado, the portrait of Holmes that is emerging is as limited as it is confusing. Pictures obtained of Holmes show a bright-eyed young man, who is tall with dark hair, which contrasts the description of the man by a law enforcement official who said he dyed his hair red and identified himself as ""the Joker"" to authorities after he was arrested early Friday morning for allegedly shooting people during a screening of the new Batman movie. Remembering the victims By all accounts, Holmes is a bright student. He entered the University of California, Riverside, in 2006 as a scholarship student and graduated with highest honors with a bachelor's degree in neuroscience in 2010. ""Academically, he was at the top of the top,"" Chancellor Timothy P. White said. UC Riverside police have no record of any contact with Holmes, the university said. Neither did police at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, where Holmes enrolled in 2011 as a doctoral candidate in its neuroscience program at the Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, university officials said in a statement released Sunday. In fact, the sole contact authorities in Colorado appeared to have had with Holmes was a speeding summons in 2011, according to Aurora police. A syllabus that lists Holmes as a student at the medical school shows that he may have taken a class in which he studied topics as diverse as substance abuse, schizophrenia, depression and other disorders. According to the document, he was to have delivered a presentation in May about microRNA biomarkers. Though there are indications that something may have been amiss in Holmes' life in recent months. He withdrew from the program in June 2012, though ""he gave no reason for his withdrawal from the graduate school,"" said Jacque Montgomery, spokeswoman for the University of Colorado. It is not immediately clear if Holmes, who also worked in a paid position in the university's neuroscience research program, was still employed there after withdrawing from the program. Holmes received a large volume of deliveries over the past four months to both his home and work addresses, which police believe begins to explain how he got his hands on some of the materials used in the rampage and the subsequent discovery of his booby-trapped apartment, Aurora Police Chief Paul Oates. The police chief has declined to release details about a possible motive or Holmes' appearance at the time of his arrest, citing an ongoing investigation. But he did say Holmes purchased four weapons and more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition in recent months. Police: Evidence of 'calculation and deliberation' in Colorado theater shooting Police allege Holmes was dressed in black, wearing a ballistic helmet, a tactical ballistic vest, protective leggings, a throat and groin protector and a gas mask during the attack. Witnesses to the shooting say because the gunman wore a gas mask, they did not see his face. Unlike most people his age, Holmes does not appear to have a social media footprint -- no Facebook, no Twitter and no Tumblr account, though authorities are investigating whether he posted a profile on sex website Adult Friend Finder. The profile contains a picture of a man with fiery red hair, a law enforcement source said. Police believe it may be a picture of Holmes, said the source, who was not authorized to speak to the media. The profile said it was created by a 24-year-old man from Aurora and has since been taken down. Theater shooting unfolds in real time on social media It's a profile that contrasts with news that Holmes worked as a counselor at a summer camp for needy children in 2008. Camp Max Straus caters to needy children ages 7-14, and is run by Jewish Big Brothers Big Sisters of Los Angeles, which confirmed his employment but would not offer further details or comment. The man who grew up in the upscale northwest San Diego neighborhood of Rancho Peñasquitos was renting an apartment on in Aurora, according to police and realty records. Tom Mai, a neighbor of the Holmes family in San Diego, described Holmes as ""clean-cut, quiet, responsible."" At the time of his arrest, Holmes was living in a small, three story  brick building on Paris Street in Aurora, in Apartment 10, within walking distance to the university. ""Neighbors report he lived alone and he kept to himself,"" Oates said. A neighbor who lives one floor below Holmes' third-floor apartment, Tori Lynn Everhart, described the apartments this way: ""It's not like true ghetto. It's not the safest neighborhood, but it's definitely improving."" Apparently, Holmes told police during his arrest he had booby-trapped the third-floor apartment. Kaitlyn Fonzi, a 20-year-old grad student and neighbor, said she heard techno music blasting from his apartment around the time of the shooting, and had nearly opened Holmes' unlocked apartment door to complain, unaware that the unit was booby trapped with explosives. Massacre suspect's neighbor: 'I'm counting my lucky stars' A timer had turned the music on so that it would blare in his apartment after he left for the Aurora multiplex, according to a law enforcement source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. Bomb technicians worked Saturday to clear ""all hazards"" from the apartment, and began allowing some evacuated residents to return. Jackie Mitchell, who lives close to Holmes, had a beer with him on Tuesday. Mitchell was stunned at news of Holmes' alleged involvement in the attack. ""You would never guess he was a violent guy,"" Mitchell said, describing Holmes as ""nerdish"" and ""a book-smart type guy."" In San Diego, the suspect's family issued a statement saying they were still trying to process the news. ""Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved,"" the Holmes family said, without giving any information about him. Gun-control, gun-rights groups prepare for renewed debate"

(AP) — A former medical student in a gas mask barged into a crowded Denver-area theater during a midnight showing of the Batman movie on Friday, hurled a gas canister and then opened fire, killing 12 people and injuring at least 50 others in one of the deadliest mass shootings in recent U.S. history.

86466007,2012-07-24 11:40:40,"'Dark Knight Rises': Official box office is in, Batman movie earns $160.9 million on opening weekend",http://www.cleveland.com/movies/index.ssf/2012/07/dark_knight_rises_official_box.html,en,True,,1641,cleveland.com,http://www.cleveland.com/,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — ""The Dark Knight Rises"" earned a sizeable $160.9 million over the weekend, making it the biggest 2-D opening ever, but falling slightly below expectations following the mass shooting at a Colorado screening of the Batman film. Warner Bros. said Monday that the final installment of director Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy earned $160,887,295. The debut makes ""The Dark Knight Rises"" the biggest 2-D opening ever ahead of its 2008 predecessor, ""The Dark Knight."" It also gives the movie the third-largest opening after the 3-D films ""The Avengers"" with $207.4 million and ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows — Part 2"" with $169.2 million. Despite the impressive $160.9 million opening, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" fell somewhat below box office expectations going into the weekend, which ranged from $170 million to $200 million. ""Clearly, 'The Dark Knight Rises' was on everyone's minds,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, an analyst for Hollywood.com who specializes in box office. ""I think the American public showed they were not going to be sacred away from the movie theater by the actions of a lunatic."" Dergarabedian called the film's opening ""extremely impressive given the tragic events that unfolded on Friday."" ""Dark Knight Rises"" earned $19.1 million alone from IMAX screenings. Tickets for 3-D and IMAX films cost a few more dollars than 2-D screenings, netting extra cash at the box office. Movies released in 3-D typically earn under half of their income in 3-D screenings, sometimes as little as a third. Sony, Fox, Disney, Paramount, Universal and Lionsgate joined ""Dark Knight Rises"" distributor Warner Bros. in publicly withholding their usual revenue reports this weekend until Monday. They did so out of respect for the victims and their families after the mass shooting that left 12 dead and 58 wounded at a midnight screening of the movie in Aurora, Colo. Following behind ""Dark Knight Rises"" in the No. 2 spot was ""Ice Age: Continental Drift,"" the animated Fox film which dropped 56 percent in its second weekend to $20.4 million, and the Sony superhero reboot ""The Amazing Spider-Man,"" which earned $10.9 million during its third weekend at the box office, in the No. 3 position.

We've received your submission. CENTENNIAL, Colo. — The “Joker” isn’t laughing now. Accused gunman James Holmes frequently stared blankly into his lap during an initial court appearance today, following his alleged massacre inside a Colorado movie theater. His hair still dyed a flaming orange-red, Holmes, 24, said nothing while sitting in court with a female guard close to his side.  Holmes is being held on suspicion of first-degree murder, and could also face additional counts of aggravated assault and weapons violations. (AP) James Holmes, left, the suspected gunman in Friday’s Colorado theater massacre, makes his first appearance in court with his attorney Monday. (AP) Prosecutors asked the judge, which the court granted, for more time to file charges in the horrific case, in which Holmes allegedly shot 70 people – 12 fatally – early Friday in an Aurora, Colo., movie theater during a midnight showing of “The Dark Knight Rises.” Holmes is set to be arraigned next week. He was placed on a no-bond hold. The unshaven, handcuffed Holmes sat in maroon jailhouse jumpsuit as the judge advised him of the case. Holmes sat motionless, his eyes appearing tired and drooping. David Sanchez, whose son-in-law Caleb Medely was shot in the head and survived, was in court today. “He looks demonic. His eyes are just crazy,” Sanchez said. “There’s something wrong with that man.” He also said the death penalty “would be justice served.” Sanchez’s daughter Katie was set to give birth today. Holmes has been held in solitary confinement at an Arapahoe County detention facility since Friday. Holmes is being held on suspicion of first-degree murder, and he could also face additional counts of aggravated assault and weapons violations. Authorities have disclosed that he is refusing to cooperate and that it could take months to learn what prompted the horrific attack on moviegoers. Eighteenth Judicial District Attorney Carol Chambers said today her office is considering pursuing the death penalty against Holmes. She said a decision will be made in consultation with victims’ families. Holmes has been assigned a public defender, and Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates said the former doctoral student has “lawyered up” since his arrest early Friday, following the shooting at an Aurora theater that left 12 dead and 58 wounded, some critically. “He’s not talking to us,” the chief said. Holmes’ hearing is was at court complex, about 13 miles from the Aurora theater. Courthouse security there was tight today, as uniformed sheriff’s deputies were stationed outside, and other lawmen were positioned on the roofs of both court buildings at the Arapahoe County Justice Center. Police have said Holmes began buying guns at Denver-area stores nearly two months before Friday’s shooting and that he received at least 50 packages in four months at his home and at school. Holmes’ apartment was filled with trip wires, explosive devices and unknown liquids, requiring police, FBI officials and bomb squad technicians to evacuate surrounding buildings while spending most of Saturday disabling the booby traps. Investigators found a Batman mask inside Holmes’ apartment after they finished clearing the home, a law enforcement official close to the investigation said yesterday on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media. Holmes, with an undergraduate from the University of California at Riverside, had been a student at the prestigious neuroscience doctoral program at the University of Colorado’s Anschutz Medical Campus. He quit the program last month for reasons still unknown. Holmes recently took an intense oral exam that marks the end of the first year. University officials would not say if he passed, citing privacy concerns. Amid the continuing investigation of Holmes and his background, yesterday was a day for healing and remembrance in Aurora, with the community holding a prayer vigil and President Obama arriving to visit with families of the victims. Obama said he told the families that “all of America and much of the world is thinking about them.” He met with them at the University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora, which treated 23 of the people injured in the mass shooting; 10 remain there, seven hurt critically. Congregations across Colorado prayed for the shooting victims and their relatives. Elderly churchgoers at an aging Presbyterian church within walking distance near Holmes’ apartment joined in prayer, though none had ever met him. Several thousand gathered for healing at the vigil last night. “You’re not alone, and you will get through it,” said the Rev. Kenneth Berve, pastor at Grant Avenue United Methodist Church and a witness to Friday’s horrors. “We can’t let fear and anger take control of us.” Meanwhile, the owner of a gun range told The Associated Press that Holmes applied to join the club last month but never became a member because of his behavior and a “bizarre” message on his voicemail. Holmes emailed an application to join the Lead Valley Range in Byers on June 25 in which he said he was not a user of illegal drugs or a convicted felon, said owner Glenn Rotkovich. When Rotkovich called to invite him to a mandatory orientation the following week, Rotkovich said he heard a message on Holmes’ voicemail that was “bizarre – guttural, freakish at best.” Rotkovich left two other messages but eventually told his staff to watch out for Holmes at the July 1 orientation and not to accept him into the club, Rotkovich said. The pastor for the suspect’s family recalled a shy boy who was driven to succeed academically. “He wasn’t an extrovert at all. If there was any conversation, it would be because I initiated it, not because he did,” said Jerald Borgie, senior pastor of Penasquitos Lutheran Church. Borgie said he never saw the suspect mingle with others his age at church. He last spoke with Holmes about six years ago. “He had some goals. He wanted to succeed, he wanted to go out, and he wanted to be the best,” Borgie said. “He took pride in his academic abilities. A good student. He didn’t brag about it.” During the attack early Friday, Holmes allegedly set off gas canisters and used a semiautomatic rifle, a shotgun and a pistol to open fire on theatergoers, Oates said. Holmes had bought the weapons at local gun stores in the past two months. He recently bought 6,000 rounds of ammunition over the Internet, the chief said. The gunman’s semiautomatic assault rifle jammed during the attack, forcing him to switch to another gun with less firepower, a federal law enforcement official told The AP. That malfunction and weapons switch might have saved some lives. Oates said a 100-round ammunition drum was found in the theater, but he said he didn’t know whether it jammed or emptied. The shooting was the worst in the U.S. since the Nov. 5, 2009, attack at Fort Hood, Texas. An Army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 soldiers and civilians and wounding more than two dozen others. With AP Share Selection"

One was enjoying a night at the Batman premiere to celebrate his birthday. Another described herself as ""a simple independent girl"" on her Facebook page. As America came to terms with another inexplicable gun massacre on Saturday, new details emerged of the victims of the theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado, in which 12 people died and 70 were injured. As might be expected from a crowd of eager film-goers going to an early screening of the latest Batman film, many were young, and just starting out on their adult lives, full of hopes and ambition.  There was Alex Sullivan, a married local bartender, shot dead on his 27th birthday. ""Alex was smart, funny, and above all, loved dearly by his friends and family,"" his family said in a statement. Just before going to the film he had posted a message on Twitter. ""Oh man one hour till the movie and it's going to be the best BIRTHDAY ever.""Instead he died in the terrifying attack. There was Micayla Medek, 23, a student at a local community college. ""I'm a simple independent girl who's just trying to get her life together while still having fun,"" she wrote on her Facebook page. Jessica Ghawi, 24, a talented sports blogger, was another victim. Details of her death emerged through her brother, Jordan, who wrote on his blog about the terrible scenes inside the theater and the moment his sister was shot. Such openness, with many victims having blogs, Facebook accounts and Twitter feeds, contrasts sharply with that of James Holmes, the secretive silent individual alleged to have burst into the theatre dressed head-to-toe in black bulletproof clothing and begun spraying the theater with bullets. No trace of Holmes has been found on Facebook, LinkedIn, Myspace, Twitter or elsewhere on the internet. In an age of social media and openness, he was a closed book. Police last night carried out a controlled explosion at the Aurora apartment where Holmes lived. A source close to the bomb disposal effort said the living room of Holmes's apartment was strewn with about 30 softball-sized improvised explosive devices. There were also bullets, gun powder and jars of flammable liquid. ""This is home made. It is improvised… There is a level of sophistication that we see here,"" the source said. Several nearby apartment blocks in the area, a down-at-heel working class neighbourhood of cheap rentals and rundown housing, had been evacuated following the discovery of what appeared to be tripwired booby traps. A block away one apartment manager spoke of her relief at having refused to rent to Holmes last April. Joanne Southard, 55, said Holmes had been neat and tidy when she encountered him, but his failure to answer or return phone calls gave her concern. ""Thank God I had a sixth sense, otherwise he might have tried to build that thing in one of my apartments,"" she said. Holmes's references for an apartment building were good. ""They said he was quiet. He was happy,"" Southard said. His arrest record was also a blank, save for a single speeding ticket. All in all that made him a potential model tenant. But Southard turned him down. ""He seemed nice. Clean cut. But I guess there was something just a little off. He seemed unreliable. So I said no,"" she said. Southard's account came as a more detailed picture began to emerge of Holmes. The 24-year-old was a doctoral student whose family came from a middle class area of San Diego. He was a brilliant science student, the son of a nurse and a software manager. He had graduated with highest honours in the spring of 2010, with a neuroscience degree from the University of California, Riverside. He then enrolled last year in a neuroscience PhD programme at the University of Colorado, Denver, after struggling to find work, but was in the process of withdrawing this year. It is not known why he was leaving. Perhaps somewhere in there lies his motivation. Holmes, whom many have described as a shy loner, appeared to go through life leaving only the smallest of ripples. Until now. On Saturday President Barack Obama devoted his weekly radio address to the shootings. ""I'm sure many of you who are parents had the same reaction I did when you first heard this news: what if it had been my daughters at the theatre, doing what young children enjoy doing every day?"" he said. ""Michelle and I will be fortunate enough to hug our girls a little tighter this weekend, as I'm sure you will do with your children."" Yet such family emotions disguise the fierceness of the political battle that is likely to break out over the issue of guns in American life. The New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, often touted as a possible independent candidate for president, challenged both Obama and his political rival, the Republican Mitt Romney, on the issue. ""Soothing words are nice, but maybe it's time that the two people who want to be president of the United States stand up and tell us what they are going to do about it,"" he said on a radio programme. Many have noted that the four guns and 6,000 rounds of ammunition that Holmes was reported to have had were bought and owned legally. But while many commentators in the media, the National Rifle Association and anti-gun campaigners have engaged in a fight, it is not expected to reach the top echelons of American public life. Romney is unlikely to speak out on gun laws in any way that Bloomberg would appreciate. Though he – like Obama – cancelled campaign appearances on Friday as news of the shooting rippled out across America, he is hardly going to take an anti-gun stance. The freedom to bear arms is a cause dear to many conservatives, especially in a party fired up by its right-wing Tea Party base. ""We expect that the person responsible for this terrible crime will be quickly brought to justice,"" Romney said. He tip-toed around any political element of the shooting. But so too did Obama. Even the Denver mayor, Michael Hancock, who belongs to an anti-illegal weapons group, has refused to be drawn on the subject. Very few politicians appear willing to pick up the fight that Bloomberg has offered. Obama's more than two minute-long speech contained only thoughts and prayers for the victims and generalised musings on the nature of evil. It made not a single mention of the word ""gun"" or promised any tightening of regulations for firearms. ""We may never understand what leads anyone to terrorise their fellow human beings. Such evil is senseless – beyond reason,"" he said. As the killings, like so many previous mass shootings, provoke the latest bout of soul-searching over gun laws, the city must learn to cope with the unfolding tragedy. Aurora is a sleepy slice of suburbia, stretching off to the east of Denver across flat, former prairie. It is now a place divided into those who got lucky and those who did not. It is a city where the simple decision whether to go to a midnight showing of a film proved life-changing. Brooke Singer was one of the lucky ones. The 22-year-old actor was going to go to the Century 16 theater after a rehearsal for a musical. But the rehearsal was cancelled, so she stayed at home. Six friends did not. They were in the theater next to the one that Holmes attacked. But they still saw the bullets rip through the walls, still got caught up in the bloodied, panicky mass of people fleeing Holmes's arsenal of powerful weapons. ""I was supposed to be there,"" Singer said. ""It is, like, one decision you make and that decides everything."" Marcus Weaver was not so lucky. There was no last-minute reprieve or act of good fortune for him. Instead he went to see The Dark Knight Rises, sitting with his friend Rebecca, just a few rows from the front. He was shot. Speaking while still holding his bloodied T-shirt, Weaver described a theater packed with people eagerly awaiting the film. ""It was exciting,"" he said. The crowd was loud, boisterous and then, about 15 to 20 minutes in, Weaver saw something ""shoom"" across the darkened theatre. It exploded and the shooting began. ""There was a man in the corner. You could pick out his silhouette. It was like the fourth of July,"" he said. Weaver, 41, a shop manager, described how he dived on his friend Rebecca and found that she was covered in blood. He managed to carry her for a little but then decided to run for help amid the panicking and frenzied mob trying to escape. ""He was reloading but I could hear the screaming of children… I could not get that sound out of my head today,"" Weaver said. He lifted his sleeves, with his right arm in a sling, to show two round holes where pellets from Holmes's shotgun had hit him. He had not heard yet if Rebecca made it out alive. That lack of belief was a common emotion in Aurora as it digested the idea that once more this region — site of the 1999 Columbine school massacre — would become synonymous with a mass shooting. Despite being a part of Denver's suburban sprawl, Aurora has a small town feel. Almost everyone seemed to know someone who was there. Nate Rice, 21, works at Starbucks and one of his co-workers had a call about her sister, who had been at the screening. ""It's insane,"" he said, saying that he broke down and wept several times during the day. Eventually he came to the police cordon around the theater to lay some flowers below a sign that said simply: ""Gone but not forgotten."" Tom Mauser's son, Daniel, died at the hands of the Columbine killers. Now he is a committed Christian and an advocate for gun control. Mauser came down to a prayer vigil, on a small rise above the theater. Just 500 yards or so from where Holmes had wreaked havoc Mauser urged a group of about 300 locals to seek help or reach out to victims. ""Just simply being in that theatre is trauma. Reach out to these people and tell them that you are praying for them,"" he said. The vigil was marked by prayers and people holding candles aloft. Many wept and held hands. At one stage a pastor urged everyone to hug each other and the entire crowd broke out in a mass of embraces. The Rev Acen Phillips, the head of a nearby church, told the crowd that his granddaughter had been in the theater. She had been with seven friends, one of whom was shot in the leg. ""The violence has got to stop,"" he said. For many in Aurora, coming to terms with the sort of senseless tragedy that defies logic or explanation, such a reaction seemed entirely understandable. Mary Millens, 43, who works at the local airport, had come to the vigil looking for comfort. But it was a struggle. ""It helped a little,"" she said. ""But no one understands it. No one has the answers."""

Audiences gave The Watch, a comedy starring Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn and Jonah Hill, a C+ CinemaScore which does not bode well for the film attracting a wider audience. Step-Up does better with audiences earning a B+. Next weekend Total Recall will have to show that it's more than just a redo of the 1990 sci-fi classic that starred Arnold Schwarzenegger.

We've received your submission. AURORA, Colo. — Despair all around him, President Barack Obama on Sunday offered hugs, tears and the nation’s sympathy to survivors of the Colorado shooting rampage and to families whose loved ones were shot dead. He looked for hope in the heartbreak, insisting a brighter day will come for the grieving and declaring that “much of the world is thinking about them.” In dramatic detail, Obama offered a glimpse inside the horror that took place in the Denver-area movie theater early Friday, relaying a story he said spoke to the courage of young Americans. With two fingers pressed to his own neck, Obama recalled how one woman saved the life of a friend who had been shot by keeping pressure on a vein that had “started spurting blood” and by later helping carry her to safety. In private, Obama visited one by one with anguished families gathered at a hospital and wounded patients recovering in intensive care. He emerged before the TV cameras and kept his focus on the lives and dreams of the fallen and the survivors, not the sole shooting suspect or his “evil act.” “I come to them not so much as president as I do as a father and as a husband,” said Obama, addressing reporters from a hospital hallway after his visits. “The reason stories like this have such an impact on us is because we can all understand what it would be to have somebody we love taken from us in this fashion.” For a president nearing the end of his term and seeking a second one, it was another grim occasion for him to serve as national consoler in chief, a role that has become a crucial facet of the job. National tragedies compel presidents to show leadership and a comforting touch — or risk a plummeting public standing if they cannot match the moment. The massacre in the Aurora movie theater left 12 dead and 58 wounded. It also temporarily silenced a bitter campaign fight for the White House between Obama and Republican Mitt Romney. Both men were searching for the right time and manner to re-enter the political debate. Obama’s stop in Colorado — which happens to be a key electoral state in the race — came as he was about to shift into a mix of campaign fundraisers and official travel across the West starting Monday. Romney resumed political activities Sunday in California, where he courted Republican donors in three fundraisers in the San Francisco area. “I know the president is in Colorado today,” Romney told supporters while keeping a subdued tone. “He’s visiting with families and friends of the victims, which is the right thing for the president to be doing on this day — appreciate that.” Obama said his conversations with family members were filled with memories of brothers, sons and daughters who had left their mark on others. He said there were laughs as well as tears. Jordan Ghawi, brother of shooting victim Jessica Ghawi, tweeted that Obama was already familiar with his sister’s story before sitting down with him but wanted to learn more. “My main task was to serve as a representative of the entire country and let them know that we are thinking about them at this moment and will continue to think about them each and every day,” Obama said. “The awareness that not only all of America but much of the world is thinking about them might serve as some comfort.” A single suspect, James Holmes, is being held without bond on suspicion of multiple counts of first-degree murder after the shooting rampage, which occurred minutes into a premiere of “The Dark Knight Rises” Batman movie early Friday in this suburb outside Denver. Obama said he assured the families that even though the suspect behind “this evil act has received a lot of attention over the last couple of days, that attention will fade away. And in the end, after he has felt the full force of our justice system, what will be remembered are the good people who were impacted by this tragedy.” The president’s most vivid lines came in describing the story of two friends, 19-year-old Allie Young and her best friend, 21-year-old Stephanie Davies. Both were in Young’s hospital room when Obama visited. Obama recounted that when the gunman entered the movie theater and threw canisters of gas at the start of his killing spree, Allie stood up to warn people. “And she was shot in the neck, and it punctured a vein, and immediately she started spurting blood,” Obama said. “And apparently, as she dropped down on the floor, Stephanie — 21 years old — had the presence of mind to drop down on the ground with her, pull her out of the aisle, place her fingers over where Allie had been wounded, and applied pressure the entire time while the gunman was still shooting,” Obama said. The president said Davies eventually joined others in carrying her friend to an ambulance. He said Young was going to be fine. “As tragic as the circumstances of what we’ve seen today are, as heartbreaking as it is for the families, it’s worth us spending most of our time reflecting on young Americans like Allie and Stephanie,” Obama said. “They represent what’s best in us, and they assure us that out of this darkness a brighter day is going to come.” The task of articulating sorrow and loss has become a familiar one for Obama. In November 2009, he led mourners at a service for victims of the mass shooting at Texas’ Fort Hood. In January 2011, he spoke at a memorial for the six victims killed in Tucson, Ariz., when a gunman attacked Rep. Gabrielle Giffords as she met with constituents. The following April, when some 300 people were killed in a multistate series of tornadoes, Obama flew to Tuscaloosa, Ala., to commiserate with residents whose homes were in ruins. A month later, Obama went to Joplin, Mo., after a monster twister claimed 161 lives. Share Selection"

86440186,2012-07-23 23:21:33,Lawyer for Holmes’s mother: ABC took my quote about having “the right person” completely out of context; Update: ABC responds,http://hotair.com/archives/2012/07/23/lawyer-for-holmess-mother-abc-took-my-quote-about-having-the-right-person-completely-out-of-context-update-abc-responds/,en,False,,117,Hot Air  ,http://hotair.com,"Via Politico, I’m tempted to say “unbelievable” but the original ABC story came from The Blotter, which is Brian Ross’s team. (He’s one of five reporters with a byline on the article, in fact.) If a guy’s so jacked to get a Big Scoop that he’d smear the tea party to do it, why wouldn’t he “finesse” a quote from the suspect’s mother to make it sound like a sensational admission to foreknowledge of his violent tendencies? Or is this less a case of a reporter behaving unethically than a mother trying to protect her son by walking back a hugely damning, yet accurate, quotation? Here’s how the Blotter story began: A California woman who identified herself as the mother of James Holmes, the 24-year-old man federal authorities said is the suspect in a mass shooting in an Aurora, Colorado movie theater, told ABC News her son was likely the alleged culprit, saying, “You have the right person.” The woman, contacted at her home in San Diego, spoke briefly with ABC News and immediately expressed concern her son may be involved in the shooting death of at least 12 people overnight. “You have the right person,” she said, apparently speaking on gut instinct. “I need to call the police… I need to fly out to Colorado.” Now here’s what the lawyer said this afternoon: To clarify a statement made by ABC media, I was awakened by a call from a reporter on ABC on July 20, about 5:45 in the morning. I did not know anything about a shooting in Aurora at that time. He asked if I was Arlene Holmes, and if my son was James Holmes, who lives in Aurora, Colorado. I answered, ‘yes, you have the right person.’ I was referring to myself. I asked him to tell me why he was calling, and he told me about a shooting in Aurora. He asked for a comment. I told him I could not comment because I did not know if the person he was talking about was my son, and I would need to find out. Hard to imagine an innocent explanation for ABC’s account of the conversation if Holmes is telling the truth. If she said “you have the right person” in response to nothing more than a question about her identity, without the shooting having been mentioned yet, then there’s no way they could honestly take that as some sort of admission on her part as to his guilt. Either she’s misremembering the exact exchange (or lying, I guess) or else they did something egregious here. The best-case scenario is that the reporter assumed that she’d already heard about the shooting and took her “right person” comment in that context — but even then, there’d be no reason to think she was talking about his guilt rather than simply identifying herself. And needless to say, the reporter would have had a duty to follow up and press her to clarify so that there was no ambiguity on a quote that explosive. Did he/she? Did ABC record the conversation? I’m eager to hear how it really went down. Exit quotation via Politico: “Sources tell POLITICO that on an editorial conference call this morning, ABC News SVP James Goldston said the network is taking steps to ensure that incorrect reports such as Ross’s do not happen again.” Update: ABC says it didn’t happen the way Holmes says it did — and no, there’s no recording of the conversation: ABC News phoned Arlene Holmes at 5am PST, at her home in San Diego, Calif., according to notes and email records by ABC News producer Matthew Mosk, who placed the call… Mosk said today that he awoke Arlene Holmes and informed her that a man, he believed was her son had been arrested in Aurora and asked to confirm their relationship. “You have to tell me what happened… You have to tell me what happened,” the woman on the phone said, according to Mosk. Mosk said he told her that ABC News had learned the 24-year-old had been identified by police as the lone suspect in the mass killing in Aurora, Colo and that the details of the events were still taking shape. “You have the right person,” was her response, he said. “I need to call the police. I need to fly to Colorado.” That contradicts Holmes’s claim that she didn’t know anything about the shooting before her “right person” comment — but even here, according to ABC’s own account, the quote is totally ambiguous. Was she saying that James Holmes was the “right person,” i.e. the shooter, or merely that she was his mother? Why did ABC leap to assume the former instead of the latter?

Online,http://www.eonline.com/,"A clearer picture is starting to emerge of the gunman behind the largest mass shooting in U.S. history. Local police have identified James Holmes, 24, as the suspected trigger man who left 12 dead and 59 others injured after allegedly opening fire at a Colorado screening of The Dark Knight Rises early Friday morning. Holmes was arrested at a parking lot outside the theater shortly afterward. Here's what we know about Holmes so far, and his alleged shooting rampage that has left a nation in deep shock... MORE: The Dark Knight Rises Horror—Gunman Kills 12, Injures 59 at Colorado Screening • Local police confirm that the shooting began at approximately 12:39 a.m. at the Century 16 movie theater in Aurora, and Holmes was apprehended shortly thereafter outside the rear of the multiplex, next to his parked white Hyundai vehicle. • Police recovered an AR-15 assault rifle and two .40 caliber Glock handguns on Holmes; a fourth weapon, a Remington shotgun, was retrieved from the theater. All the firearms were obtained legally. Holmes didn't resist arrest, and no other suspects were believed to be involved. • Holmes was reportedly wearing all-black ballistics gear, including a helmet, bulletproof vest, leggings, throat protector, groin protector, tactical gloves and gas mask. Police believe he set off two smoke or tear-gas devices to distract the crowd before opening fire. His car was said to be stockpiled with additional ammunition. • Various reports have surfaced claiming that Holmes supposedly told police that he was the Joker and sported red hair, but Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates refused to comment on the claims. However, at a press conference in New York City, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly told reporters, ""It clearly looks like a deranged individual. He has his hair painted red. He said he was the Joker, obviously the enemy of Batman."" MORE: Dark Knight Rises Shooting—Police Identify Suspect, Paris Premiere Canceled • Holmes was an Aurora resident who lived about four miles from the theater. Chief Oates confirms that when police investigated his home, they discovered that the apartment had been ""booby-trapped with wires,"" prompting authorities to immediately evacuate residents from five nearby buildings. Bomb technicians were reportedly dispatched to disarm explosive materials that were found on the scene. • Police confirm that Holmes had no criminal history, and had only been cited for speeding in October 2011 • Early Friday, a San Diego woman who identified herself as Holmes' mother spoke with ABC News and, when informed that her son had been named a suspect in the shootings, reportedly said, ""You have the right person...I need to call the police. I need to fly out to Colorado."" MORE: Batbrained? Debunking Dark Knight Rises Bane-Bain Conspiracy Theory • In statement obtained by E! News, Holmes' family said: ""Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved. We ask that the media respect our privacy during this difficult time. Our family is cooperating with authorities in both San Diego and Aurora, Colo. We are still trying to process this information and we appreciate that people will respect our privacy."" •  A spokesman for the San Diego Police Department confirmed to reporters that Holmes attended high school in San Diego and then packed up for Colorado to continue his studies. • A former schoolmate of Holmes at Westview high school in San Diego tells E! News exclusively that Holmes was a ""really smart"" student who kept to himself. ""He was really smart, kinda nerdy and not too talkative with people he wasn't friends with."" The source adds that Holmes, who reportedly went by the nickname Jimmy and wasn't involved in extracurricular sports or clubs, ""didn't really have any long-term girlfriends, but I do remember him having dates to dances."" MORE: Is The Dark Knight Rises Gaining on The Avengers? • According to published reports, Holmes' neighbors characterized the 24-year-old as a loner who sometimes greeted fellow tenants but often appeared shy. He also purportedly had trouble landing a job after completing his studies in California. • Contrary to earlier reports, Holmes was not a medical student. Dan Meyers, communications director for the University of Colorado School of Medicine, tells E! News: ""He was in a graduate program in neuroscience. That's different from being in the School of Medicine. The graduate program is part of the University of Colorado Denver. The neuro program is located on the Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, Colo."" • In a statement, the school's Anschutz Medical Campus confirms that Holmes ""was in the process of withdrawing from the University of Colorado Denver's graduate program in neurosciences,"" where he had enrolled in June 2011."" • E! News has confirmed that Holmes is scheduled to appear in an Arapahoe County courtroom on Monday in Centennial, Colo., where the district attorney is expected to bring the charges against him.

But mainly it was a day for remembering those who died early Friday during a theater's première showing of 'The Dark Knight Rises,' the latest in the Batman series. Loading... July 22, 2012 As more news emerged about the mass shooting early Friday morning in a Colorado theater showing the latest ""Batman"" movie, Sunday became a day of remembering the victims in prayerful memorials, a visit by President Obama to thank first responders and the families of those lost and wounded, and a continuing discussion of gun violence in America. Aurora, Colo., police report that all of the hazardous material in alleged shooter James Holmes’s booby-trapped apartment had been removed and transported to a disposal site. Meanwhile, an FBI Evidence Response Team (ERT) remains on scene processing the apartment for evidence. Mr. Holmes is scheduled to be arraigned Monday morning. He is reported to be in solitary confinement for his own protection from other inmates who threatened his life upon hearing that his alleged victims included young children. Officials report that Holmes was able to buy two handguns, a shotgun, an assault rifle, and about 6,000 rounds of ammunition in recent months – all of it legally. While Mr. Obama and the Republican presidential candidate (and most elected officials, for that matter) have largely stayed clear of the politically toxic subject of gun control, that is not true of all officials. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, (D) of New York, is calling for a ban on large-capacity ammunition magazines used on the kind of assault rifle that was part of Holmes’s deadly arsenal. “As things stand right now, there is absolutely nothing to stop another madman – or even someone on the terror watch list – from walking into a gun store and buying all the large-capacity bullet magazines he could carry,” she said Saturday. Cosponsoring the legislation is Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, also a New York Democrat, whose husband was killed and son severely wounded by a man who randomly shot 25 passengers on a Long Island Rail Road commuter train in 1993. As he has in the past, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg spoke out Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “It’s up to these two presidential candidates,” Mr. Bloomberg said, referring to Obama and Mitt Romney. “They want to lead this country, and they’ve said things before that they’re in favor of banning things like assault weapons. Where are they now, and why don’t they stand up? And if they want our votes, they better.” Because it happened not far away in Colorado, the moments of terrifying shooting in Aurora brought to mind the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School. Tom Mauser, whose 16-year-old son Daniel was killed that day, has become a strong gun control advocate. ""We’ve seen mass shootings in just about any place you can imagine: movie theaters, bars, nursing homes, schools,"" he told the Huffington Post, noting that more people die in gun violence every day than the death toll in Aurora. ""People see cases like this and say 'it's really terrible but let's not change our gun laws,' "" he said. “I think Americans have simply come to learn to accept this level of violence, and many don’t realize that most other developed nations don’t have this kind of problem. It's easy to say this is the price you pay for our freedoms when it's not your child or your neighbor or your friend."" Based on the years he spent studying the mass shooting in Littleton, Colo., 13 years ago, Dave Cullen – author of the book “Columbine” – cautions the public, the media, and even those considered experts not to rush to conclusions about Holmes’s character, personality, and motivation. To his regret, he joined others in doing just that with Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the students at Columbine High School who killed 12 classmates and a teacher, wounding 26 others before killing themselves. What he found was a far more complicated and in some ways surprising story than had been portrayed about the killers. “Over the next several days, you will be hit with all sorts of evidence fragments suggesting one motive or another. Don’t believe any one detail,” he wrote in a New York Times op-ed column Sunday. “Resist the temptation to extrapolate details prematurely into a whole…. The killer is rarely who he seems.” As has been the case with other mass shootings (Columbine, Virginia Tech, and Tucson, Ariz., where Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was severely wounded), there’s a fear that too much media attention and speculation – poring over details without adding much understanding – could trigger copycat attacks. ""The media has a real dilemma that I don't know the answer to,"" Kenneth Lanning, a former FBI behavioral scientist, told ABC News. ""I'm not going to suggest they don't cover it, but this will be all over the place, and that fuels the problem of this happening again. It guarantees that one guy with problems will say that's what I want."" A prayer vigil is to be held in Aurora Sunday evening, and Obama was scheduled to spend several hours there late Sunday afternoon. ""These families need that kind of contact by our elected leader,"" Aurora police chief Dan Oates said on ""Face the Nation."" ""It will be very powerful and it will help them. As awful as what they've been through and what they're going through has been, having the president here is very, very powerful, it means a great deal to them and all of Aurora.” The Associated Press reports the following: Aurora shooting suspect James Holmes applied to join a Colorado gun range but never became a member after the owner became concerned over his ""bizarre"" message and behavior. Owner Glenn Rotkovich says Mr. Holmes e-mailed an application to join the Lead Valley Range in Byers on June 25 and there were no overt warning signs in that form. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Holmes said he was not a user of illegal drugs or a convicted felon, so Mr. Rotkovich followed up by calling Holmes's apartment to invite him to a mandatory orientation the following week. Rotkovich got Holmes's answering machine and says ""it was bizarre – guttural, freakish at best."" Rotkovich left two other messages but eventually told his staff to watch for Holmes at the July 1 orientation and not to accept him into the club. Already a subscriber?

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Dee Dee Benkie & Brian Benjamin discuss if possession of assault weapons should be against the law The call for federal lawmakers to tighten gun laws has intensified following the mass shooting  in Colorado, with New Jersey Democratic Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg urging Congress on Saturday to swiftly address a ban on certain weapons. “Let's stop wasting time and start saving lives,” Lautenberg, D-N.J. said on his Twitter account. “Congress must prioritize a ban on high-capacity gun magazines.” At least one other lawmaker has already called on President Obama and GOP challenger Mitt Romney to address the issue. ""Soothing words are nice,"" New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a radio interview, ""but maybe it's time that the two people who want to be president of the United States stand up and tell us what they are going to do about it, because this is obviously a problem across the country."" Lautenberg was also among the first on Capitol Hill to comment on the shooting massacre early Friday at a suburban Colorado movie theatre that left 12 people dead and dozens wounded. The alleged shooter, James Holmes, was armed with an AR-15 assault rifle and three other weapons. “The shooting in Aurora is a horrific act of violence, and our thoughts go out to the innocent victims and their families,” he said Friday. “Our hearts are filled with sadness for the 12 people killed and the dozens wounded in this senseless act. We have to face the reality that these types of tragedies will continue to occur unless we do something about our nation’s lax gun laws.” A Lautenberg aide has told the Huffington Post, “If reports are correct and a high-capacity gun magazine was used to commit these awful murders, Senator Lautenberg will absolutely renew his effort to limit the availability of this dangerous firearm attachment."" Last year, Lautenberg introduced legislation to ban high-capacity ammunition magazines. He also has authored other gun-related bills including one that would close so-called loopholes on background checks for buyers at gun shows. Once, every highly publicized outbreak of gun violence produced strong calls from Democrats and a few Republicans for tougher controls on firearms. Now those pleas are muted, a political paradox that's grown more pronounced in an era scarred by Columbine, Virginia Tech, the wounding of a congresswoman and now the shooting in a suburban movie theater where carnage is expected on-screen only. ""We don't want sympathy. We want action,"" Dan Gross, president of the Brady campaign said Friday as Obama and Romney mourned the dead. Ed Rendell, the former Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, was more emphatic than many in the early hours after the shooting. ""Everyone is scared of the NRA,"" he said on MSNBC. ""Number one, there are some things worth losing for in politics and to be able to prevent carnage like this is worth losing for."" Yet it's been more than a decade since gun control advocates had a realistic hope of getting the type of legislation they seek, despite predictions that each shocking outburst of violence would lead to action. In 1994, Congress approved a 10-year ban on 19 types of military-style assault weapons. Some Democrats quickly came to believe the legislation contributed to their loss of the House a few months later. Five years later, Vice President Al Gore cast a tie-breaking Senate vote on legislation to restrict sales at gun shows. The two events turned out to be the high-water mark of recent Democratic drives to enact federal legislation aimed at reducing gun violence, and some Republicans said they could see the shift coming. ""The news media in its lather to distort this whole issue may be wrong in their estimation that this will help Al Gore,"" then-Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said in an Associated Press interview a few weeks after the tie-breaking vote. ""As a matter of fact, it may already have hurt him, and it may hurt him a lot more."" By 2004, when the assault weapon ban lapsed, congressional Democrats made no serious attempt to pass an extension. President George W. Bush was content to let it fade into history. Public sentiment had swung. According to a Gallup poll in 1990, 78 percent of those surveyed said laws covering the sale of firearms should be stricter, while 19 percent said they should remain the same or be loosened. By the fall of 2004 support for tougher laws had dropped to 54 percent. In last year's sounding, 43 percent said they should be stricter, and 55 percent said they should stay the same or be made more lenient. In terms of electoral politics, Harry Wilson, a Roanoke College professor and author of a book on gun politics, said violent crime has been declining in recent years and, ""It becomes increasingly difficult to make the argument that we need stricter gun control laws."" Additionally, he said in some regions, gun control ""can be a winning issue for Democrats. But nationally, it's a loser ... and they have figured that out."" Attempts to emphasize the issue will ""really motivate the opposition. And in a political campaign, nobody wants to do that,"" he said. At its core, Wilson said, the issue divides rural voters from urban voters. Often, that means Republicans on one side, Democrats on the other. But not always. In the current election cycle, the National Rifle Association has made 88 percent of its political donations to Republicans, and 12 percent to Democrats, according to OpenSecrets.org. The disparity obscures that the organization consistently supports some Democrats, a strategy that allows it to retain influence in both parties. It also reported spending $2.9 million on lobbying last year. Its clout was vividly on display in 2010 when majority Democrats in the House sidetracked legislation giving the District of Columbia a voting representative in the House of Representatives. Republicans had vowed to add an NRA-backed provision invalidating a city ban on handgun possession as the price for passage, and there was little doubt it had the votes to prevail. Later in the year, the NRA objected to legislation to require groups airing political advertising to disclose donors. Fearing the fallout, enough rank and file Democrats demanded changes that the leadership had to revise the bill. A revised bill, granting the NRA and other large organizations an exemption, eventually passed. Gross, head of the Brady Campaign, says Democrats have drawn the wrong lessons for years. ""The cultural narrative exists because of the assessment of Al Gore's loss in 2000 and the mid-terms in 1994, and in both cases I think the gun issue was scapegoated,"" he said. ""Those who didn't vote for Al Gore weren't going to vote for him anyway."" At the same time, Gross readily conceded the lingering hold of the issue. ""Look at Kerry when he felt he needed to dress up in hunting gear,"" he said, referring to the Democratic presidential candidate's well-photographed excursion into a duck blind in camouflage clothing in swing-state Ohio a few weeks before the 2004 election. Four years later, Obama won the White House despite strong opposition from the NRA. As a senator from Illinois and state lawmaker before that, he was a strong supporter of gun control. Following last year's killing of six people and the wounding of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson, Ariz., Obama called for steps to ""keep those irresponsible, law-breaking few from getting their hands on a gun in the first place."" He advanced no legislative proposals then, and on Friday, spokesman Jay Carney said, ""The president believes that we need to take common-sense measures that protect Second Amendment rights of Americans, while ensuring that those who should not have guns under existing law do not get them."" Obama isn't the only 2012 White House candidate to adjust his views on gun control. In a losing Senate campaign in Massachusetts in 1994, Romney said, ""I don't line up with the NRA."" A decade later, as governor, he signed legislation making a state assault weapons ban permanent. This year, bidding for support at the NRA convention, he said: ""We need a president who will enforce current laws, not create new ones that only serve to burden lawful gun owners.""

86420530,2012-07-23 10:53:04,Colorado shooting suspect not cooperating as he heads to court,http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2012/07/colorado_shooting_suspect_not.html,en,True,,1641,cleveland.com,http://www.cleveland.com/,"AURORA, Colo. -- As the suspected gunman in the Colorado theater massacre heads to his first court appearance, authorities have disclosed that he is refusing to cooperate and that it could take months to learn what prompted the horrific attack on midnight moviegoers at a Batman film premiere. James Holmes has been held in solitary confinement at an Arapahoe County detention facility but will be moved Monday to a next-door courtroom for a 9:30 a.m. MDT hearing, where the charges against him of suspicion of first degree murder will be read. Holmes has been assigned a public defender and Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates said that the 24-year-old former doctoral student has ""lawyered up"" since his arrest early Friday, following the shooting at an Aurora theater that left 12 dead and 58 wounded, some critically. ""He's not talking to us,"" the chief said. Holmes has been held without bond at the lockup in Centennial, Colo., about 13 miles from the Aurora theater. He will be advised of the charges against him, and he could also face additional counts of aggravated assault and weapons violations. On Sunday, officials at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus were looking into whether Holmes used his position in a graduate program to collect hazardous materials, but school officials weren't saying whether they knew he was anything more than a hard-working student. Police have said that Holmes began buying guns at Denver-area stores nearly two months before Friday's shooting and that he received at least 50 packages in four months at his home and at school. While the university disclosed that it was cooperating with police in the case, that disclosure was one of the few it has made three days after the massacre. It remained unclear whether Holmes' professors and other students at his 35-student doctorate program noticed anything unusual about his behavior. His reasons for quitting the program in June, just a year into the five- to seven-year program, also remained a mystery. Holmes recently took an intense, three-part oral exam that marks the end of the first year. Those who do well continue with their studies and shift to full-time research, while those who don't do well meet with advisers and discuss their options, including retaking the exam. University officials would not say if he passed, citing privacy concerns. The university said Holmes gave no reason for his withdrawal, a decision he made in June. Holmes was not allowed access from the institution after his withdrawal, which was ""standard operating procedure"" because he was no longer affiliated with the school, said Jacque Montgomery, a spokeswoman for the medical school. Holmes had no contact with university police, she said. The university declined to release any details of his academic record, citing privacy concerns, and at least two dozen professors and other staff declined to speak with The Associated Press. Some said they were instructed not to talk publicly about Holmes in a blanket email sent to university employees. Montgomery said police have told the school to not talk about Holmes. The university took down the website for its graduate neuroscience program on Saturday. Amid the continuing investigation of Holmes and his background, Sunday was a day for healing and remembrance in Aurora, with the community holding a prayer vigil and with President Barack Obama arriving to visit with families of the victims. Obama said he told the families that ""all of America and much of the world is thinking about them."" He met with them at the University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora, which treated 23 of the people injured in the mass shooting; 10 remain there, seven hurt critically. Congregations across Colorado prayed for the shooting victims and their relatives. Elderly churchgoers at an aging Presbyterian church within walking distance near Holmes' apartment joined in prayer, though none had ever met him. Several thousand gathered for healing at the vigil Sunday night, where a banner said, ""Angels Walk With Those Who Grieve."" ""You're not alone, and you will get through it,"" said the Rev. Kenneth Berve, pastor at Grant Avenue United Methodist Church and a witness to Friday's horrors. ""We can't let fear and anger take control of us."" Meanwhile, the owner of a gun range told the AP that Holmes applied to join the club last month but never became a member because of his behavior and a ""bizarre"" message on his voice mail. He emailed an application to join the Lead Valley Range in Byers on June 25 in which he said he was not a user of illegal drugs or a convicted felon, said owner Glenn Rotkovich. When Rotkovich called to invite him to a mandatory orientation the following week, he said he heard a message on Holmes' voice mail that was ""bizarre -- guttural, freakish at best."" He left two other messages but eventually told his staff to watch out for Holmes at the July 1 orientation and not to accept him into the club, Rotkovich said. Ritchie Duong, a friend who has known Holmes for more than a decade, told the Los Angeles Times that in high school he liked to play cards and video games. They both attended undergraduate school at the University of California, Riverside, where they saw each other weekly to watch the TV show ""Lost."" Duong last saw Holmes in December when they met for dinner in Los Angeles and saw a movie. His friend seemed fine, he told the newspaper. Academics came easily to Holmes both at high school and in college, Duong said. ""I had one college class with him, and he didn't even have to take notes or anything. He would just show up to class, sit there, and around test time he would always get an 'A,' "" said Duong, 24. The pastor for the family of the suspect also recalled a shy boy who was driven to succeed academically. ""He wasn't an extrovert at all. If there was any conversation, it would be because I initiated it, not because he did,"" said Jerald Borgie, senior pastor of Penasquitos Lutheran Church. Borgie said he never saw the suspect mingle with others his age at church. He last spoke with Holmes about six years ago. ""He had some goals. He wanted to succeed, he wanted to go out, and he wanted to be the best,"" Borgie said. ""He took pride in his academic abilities. A good student. He didn't brag about it."" During the attack early Friday, Holmes allegedly set off gas canisters and used a semiautomatic rifle, a shotgun and a pistol to open fire on theater-goers, Oates said. Holmes had bought the weapons at local gun stores in the past two months. He recently purchased 6,000 rounds of ammunition over the Internet, the chief said. The gunman's semiautomatic assault rifle jammed during the attack, forcing him to switch to another gun with less firepower, a federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press. That malfunction and weapons switch might have saved some lives. Oates said a 100-round ammunition drum was found in the theater but said he did not know whether it jammed or emptied. Investigators found a Batman mask inside Holmes' apartment after they finished clearing the home of booby traps and ammunition, a law enforcement official close to the investigation said Sunday on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media. The shooting was the worst in the United States since the Nov. 5, 2009, attack at Fort Hood, Texas. An Army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 soldiers and civilians and wounding more than two dozen others. Across the street from the movie theater, Greg Zanis, of Aurora, Ill., who placed 15 crosses near Columbine High School after a 1999 massacre there, returned to Colorado with 12 crosses for the victims of Friday's shooting. By Gillian Flaccus and Nicholas Riccardi, Associated Press Associated Press contributors to this report include Kristen Wyatt, Thomas Peipert and P. Solomon Banda in Aurora; Dan Elliott, Colleen Slevin in Denver; and Alicia A. Caldwell, Eileen Sullivan and Julie Pace in Washington.

The National Rifle Association is politically ascendant. And Barack Obama's White House pledges to safeguard the Second Amendment in its first official response to the deaths of at least 12 people in a mass shooting at a movie theater in suburban Denver.

July 25, 2012 After the horrific mass shooting at a Friday night screening of The Dark Knight Rises in Aurora, Colorado, Warner Bros. opted to cancel the film’s Paris premiere, as well as several other events around the world. That was fine for actor Christian Bale though, who spent his time away from the red carpet doing something more constructive: visiting the hospital where seven victims of the tragedy were recovering from their injuries. According to a report in the Denver Post, the Batman star visited with victims for two and a half hours on Tuesday afternoon and also spent time with several doctors, nursing staff, police officers, and emergency medical technicians. While a cynic might try and dismiss Bale’s visit as an act of vanity, that couldn’t be further from the truth. In fact, Bale specifically requested that the media not be notified of his visit so that he could spend his time talking with the injured. Over the weekend, Bale released an official statement about the shooting, saying, “I cannot begin to truly understand the pain and grief of the victims and their loved ones, but my heart goes out to them.” With his visit, Bale put actions behind his words, hopefully providing a moment of enjoyment for seven people who sorely needed it. The perpetrator of the theater massacre – 24-year-old James Holmes – made his first appearance in court yesterday and is expected to be formally charged next Monday. While there is no doubt that Holmes is guilty of the crimes, the case will still likely take some time to make its way through the court system. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. However, that is nothing compared to the time it will take many of the victims to recover from their wounds – both mentally and physically. Perhaps Bale’s visit, while modest in its scope, can help some of the victims accelerate that process. Rob Frappier blogs at Screen Rant. Already a subscriber?

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives.

86348828,2012-07-20 12:49:57,"Police: At least 12 dead, 50 injured in Colorado theater shooting",http://www.mercurynews.com/nation-world/ci_21118873/police-14-dead-50-injured-colorado-theater-shooting?source=rss,en,True,,35,San Jose Mercury News,http://www.mercurynews.com/,"Trending: AURORA, Colo. — A gunman wearing a gas mask set off an unknown gas and fired into a crowded movie theater in suburban Denver at a midnight opening of the Batman movie “The Dark Knight Rises,” killing 12 people and injuring at least 50 others, authorities said. Moviegoers didn’t know what was happening and some thought the attack was part of the show. Then they saw a silhouette of a person in the smoke at the front of the theater near the screen, pointing a gun at the crowd. “I told my friend ‘we’ve got to get out of here,’ but then he shot people trying to go out the exits,” Jennifer Seeger told NBC’s “Today.” She said the shooter made his way up the aisle, firing as he went, saying nothing. Federal law enforcement officials identified the suspect as James Holmes, a 24-year-old American. Holmes is in police custody, and the FBI says there is no indication that incident is tied to any terrorist groups. The federal law enforcement officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation Some of those injured are children, including a 3-month-old infant who was shot. Police earlier said 14 people were dead, but later revised the number to at least 12. It was not immediately clear for the reason for the revision. Witness Shayla Roeder said she saw a young teenage girl on the ground bleeding outside the theater. “She just had this horrible look in her eyes …. We made eye contact and I could tell she was not all right,” Roeder said. Victims are being treated for chemical exposure apparently related to canisters thrown by the gunman. The shooter was arrested shortly after the attack at 12:30 a.m. MDT at the multiplex theater at a mall in Aurora. It was the worst mass shooting in Colorado since the Columbine High School massacre on April 20, 1999. Students Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, opened fire at the school in the Denver suburb of Littleton, about 15 miles west of Aurora, killing 12 classmates and a teacher and wounding 26 others before killing themselves in the school’s library. Aurora police spokesman Frank Fania on ABC’s “Good Morning America” said he didn’t know yet if all the injuries were gunshot wounds. He said some might have been caused by other things such as shrapnel. Police, ambulances and emergency crews swarmed on the scene after frantic calls started flooding the 911 switchboard, officials said. Officers came running in and telling people to leave the theater, Salina Jordan told the Denver Post. She said some police were carrying and dragging bodies. Officers later found the gunman near a car behind the theater. “A gas mask, rifle, handgun at least one additional weapon (were) found inside,” he said. The suspect was taken into custody, but no name was released. Oates said there’s no evidence of any other attackers. There was also no immediate word of any motive. The suspect spoke of “possible explosives in his residence. We are dealing with that potential threat,” Oates said. A large truck lettered “bomb squad” arrived near an Aurora apartment complex where the suspect is believed to have lived, about four miles from the theater. Dozens of police squad cars, vans and other vehicles were already at the scene, along with black-clad officers carrying automatic weapons. Police evacuated residents of the building. Oates did not say whether any explosives had been found. He said police also checked for explosives in the parking lot and at the Century 16 theater and secured those areas. President Barack Obama said he was saddened by the “horrific and tragic shooting,” pledging that his administration was “committed to bringing whoever was responsible to justice, ensuring the safety of our people, and caring for those who have been wounded.” Moviegoers spoke of their terror as violence erupted and people around them fell victim. Benjamin Fernandez, 30, told the Post that he heard a series of explosions. He said that people ran from the theater and there were gunshots as police shouted “get down!” Fernandez said he saw people falling, including one young girl. Jordan told the paper that one girl was struck in cheek, others in stomach including a girl who looked to be around 9-years-old. Jordan said it sounded like firecrackers until someone ran into Theater 8 yelling “they’re shooting out here!” Hayden Miller told KUSA-TV that he heard several shots. “Like little explosions going on and shortly after that we heard people screaming,” he told the station. Hayden said at first he thought it was part of a louder movie next door. But then he saw “people hunched over leaving theater.” The police chief said 10 victims died at the theater and four at area hospitals. At least 24 people were being treated at Denver area hospitals. KUSA reported that some hospitalized victims were being treated for chemical exposure, related apparently to canister thrown by gunman. Eleven people were being treated at the Medical Center of Aurora for gunshots and ranged from minor to critical condition. Two others walked in to be treated for tear gas contamination. Denver Health had seven victims — one in critical and the rest in fair condition. The youngest victim reported was a 6-year-old being treated at Children’s Hospital Colorado, where a total of six victims were taken. Their condition wasn’t known. Two people in critical condition were rushed to nearby Swedish Medical Center, spokeswoman Nicole Williams said. Aurora is on Denver’s east side and is Colorado’s third-largest city with 327,000 residents. It is home to a large Defense Department satellite intelligence operation at Buckley Air Force Base, as well as The Children’s Hospital, the University of Colorado Hospital and a future Veterans Affairs hospital.

While there’s no way anyone could prepare for a sudden mass shooting like the theater attack in Colorado, there are some things you can do in life to increase your chances of survival during times of danger, says Mary Ellen O’Toole, a former criminal profiler for the FBI. The key, she says: don’t trust your gut. “In a crisis situation, our gut instincts do not always serve us well,” says O’Toole, who worked for the FBI for 25 years, studying cases ranging from the Unabomber to Elizabeth Smart, then wrote a book called Dangerous Instincts: How Gut Feelings Betray Us. “We give ourselves so much credit for this inner voice that will tell us what to do. It’s almost magical thinking.” A more reliable way to go, she argues, is to always take note of your surroundings, especially the exits—at a ball game, in a bar, at a restaurant or hotel—from the instant you enter the venue. “Look around. Know how you got in, how to get out. Know who’s around you. When danger strikes, you become emotional; you lose your ability to think critically,” she says. “You don’t want to wait until then to start looking for an exit.” O’Toole, now an instructor at the FBI National Academy, where she teaches a course to police called “Interviewing of Psychopaths,” is quick to note that there is simply no way people could have trained themselves to be ready for the sudden deadly attack in the dark movie theater in Colorado. “I would look foolish if I said people could have prepared,” she says. “It was completely shocking—no one expected someone to come in there and try to kill them. Some people thought the gunshots were part of the movie, which is totally understandable. And there are limited exits in a theater. But you do want to be able to size up the situation as fast as you can and increase your chances of getting out.” In general, she says, people are often not in tune with their environment. For instance, employees in office buildings don’t necessarily know the fire exits. Concertgoers don’t pay attention to the doors. Air travelers zone out or read magazines while the flight attendants point out the escape routes. Another important thing to know, she says, is that people often go into a confused sort of stupor, or delayed reaction, when danger strikes. They don’t necessarily get up and move immediately, as their brains are trying to digest the unexpected things happening around them. This is what reportedly happened in the 9/11 attacks; many people sat at their computers for a few minutes when their building was hit, stunned. “We all react at a different speed—we all don’t have the same response rate to a crisis,” says O’Toole. “It takes people different amounts of time to realize that they need to get out.” Still, she says, no matter where you fall on the spectrum of reaction time, just knowing that your body’s natural response might be to go into a slow-motion state can help you fight that response and act quickly in times of crisis. O’Toole says there are steps people can take to protect themselves in everyday life as well. For starters, she says, when it comes to strangers, people often consider themselves a good judge of character, again trusting their gut, or “mystical thinking,” as she calls it. They let people into their lives and into their homes based on superficial factors. For example, she says, “when people have a certain status in life, we give them a lot of leeway and the benefit of the doubt. If somebody has an important position, they have a status that we think gives them immunity from committing a crime. People’s tendency is to explain away behavior from these people that might otherwise seem questionable.” O’Toole says that in many criminal cases she investigated, people who knew the perpetrator would first say they were surprised by the person’s evil deeds—and then later admit that there were warning signs all along; they simply rationalized them away. O’Toole believes these warning signs will come out about the Colorado theater shooter, James Holmes, a student who was reportedly getting a Ph.D. in neuroscience at the University of Colorado Denver. “He planned this out carefully; he had to purchase the supplies. He lived in a building where there are other people. There may be friends or family members who saw other sides of his behavior,” she says. “Often these types of offenders do give people indicators—even if unintentionally—of what they’re planning, and people just don’t see it. People rationalize it, or think it’s a joke. They don’t take it seriously. But these offenders often post manifestos and leave signs.” She cites warning signs at Columbine, in which the young shooters created videos about their deadly plans and went to target practice before the shooting, and at Virginia Tech, in which the shooters in both attacks went to a firing range ahead of their killing sprees. In the Red Lake high-school massacre in Minnesota, she says, the shooter often talked about Columbine: “He was very interested in the Columbine shooting—and not in a way that was empathetic, but in a way that was more indicative of his wanting to outdo Columbine.” O’Toole says she’s “not trying to scare people, but to educate people.” By tuning in to your environment and paying attention to the red flags that pop up among people around you, she says, you could save your own life, or someone else’s. Case in point: it was a pair of observant campus-police officers at the University of California, Berkeley, who rescued Jaycee Dugard. The two female officers noticed that something looked slightly off-kilter about Dugard and her two daughters when they were distributing flyers with their captor, Phillip Garrido, on campus. The officers decided to look into it, discovering that Garrido was a convicted sex offender and that Dugard had been kidnapped 18 years earlier. “We don’t want to feel like we have to live our lives for some very rare and terrible event,” says O’Toole. “But you can put yourself in a safer position, in plenty of ways, even small ones. Have that door locked, close the garage, put down the shades. Pay attention to your environment, wherever you are. The reality is there are people who want to hurt us. Once it happens, it’s too late to go back and do anything about it.”"

""You think we're angry? We sure as hell are angry,"" Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates said. Authorities on Saturday were still working to clear dangerous explosive materials from inside James Holmes' suburban Denver apartment, which was booby trapped to kill ""whoever entered it,"" Oates said, noting it would have likely been one of his officers. Federal authorities detonated one small explosive and disarmed another inside Holmes' apartment with a device that emits a shock wave and water, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press. The official spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the ongoing investigation into the shooting rampage that killed 12 people and wounded 58. Holmes' apartment appears to have three types of explosives — jars filled with accelerants, chemicals that would explode when mixed together and more than 30 ""improvised grenades,"" the official said. Oates said Holmes has been preparing the attack for months. ""We've become aware that he had a high volume of deliveries to both his work and home address. We think this explains how he got his hands on the magazine, ammunition,"" he said. ""We also think it begins to explain how he got the materials he had in his apartment. ""What we're seeing here is evidence of some calculation and deliberation,"" Oates added. FBI Special agent James Yacone said that while most of the explosives had been rendered safe in Holmes' apartment, ""the threat has not been completely eliminated."" ""It was an extremely dangerous environment,"" Yacone said. Makeshift memorials sprang up for the victims, including a 6-year-old girl, an aspiring sportscaster and a man celebrating his 27th birthday, after police grimly went door to door with a list of those killed in the worst mass shooting in recent U.S. history. Holmes, 24, was arrested early Friday outside the Aurora theater after witnesses say he unleashed gunfire and gas canisters on a crowd of moviegoers watching the midnight showing of the new Batman film, ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Federal officials said in a bulletin obtained by The Associated Press that they still hadn't determined a motive for the suspect as families grieved and others waited at hospitals, where seven of the wounded remained in critical condition on Saturday. In his Saturday radio address, President Barack Obama urged Americans to pray ""for the victims of this terrible tragedy, for the people who knew them and loved them, for those who are still struggling to recover."" Details of the dead began to emerge Saturday, including the shootings' youngest victim, 6-year-old Veronica Moser. Veronica had gone to the movies with her mother, who was drifting in and out of consciousness in a hospital intensive care unit, bullets lodged in her throat and abdomen. ""Nobody can tell her about it,"" Annie Dalton said of her aunt, Ashley Moser. ""She is in critical condition, but all she's asking about is her daughter."" Veronica had just started swimming lessons on Tuesday, Dalton said. ""She was excited about life as she should be. She's a 6-year-old girl,"" her great aunt said. Another victim, 27-year-old Matt McQuinn, was killed after diving in front of his girlfriend and her older brother to shield them from the gunfire, said his family's attorney, Rob Scott of Dayton, Ohio. Alex Sullivan had planned a weekend of fun, to ring in his 27th birthday with friends at the special midnight showing of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and then celebrate his first wedding anniversary on Sunday. Late Friday, Sullivan's family confirmed that police told them he was among those killed. ""He was a very, very good young man,"" said Sullivan's uncle, Joe Loewenguth. ""He always had a smile, always made you laugh. He had a little bit of comic in him."" Oates said Holmes used a military-style semi-automatic rifle, a shotgun and a pistol to open fire on the unsuspecting theater-goers. He had bought the weapons at local gun stores within the last two months. He also recently purchased 6,000 rounds of ammunition over the Internet, the chief said. The suspect's stellar academic record, apparent shy demeanor and lack of a criminal background made the attack even more difficult to fathom. It also wasn't known why the suspect chose a movie theater to stage the assault, or whether he intended some twisted, symbolic link to the film's violent scenes. The Batman movie, the last in the trilogy starring Christian Bale, opened worldwide Friday with midnight showings in the U.S. The plot has the villain Bane facing Bale's Caped Crusader with a nuclear weapon that could destroy all of fictional Gotham. The Dark Knight Rises"" earned $30.6 million in Friday morning midnight screenings, and, according to industry estimates, roughly $75-77 million on the day. That put it on track for a weekend total of around $165 million, which would be the second highest opening weekend ever, following ""The Avengers."" Warner Bros. has announced it would forgo the usual revenue reports until Monday out of respect for the victims. Sony, Disney and Universal also said they would delay reporting box office receipts until Monday, a day later than the routine Sunday releases for Hollywood. Holmes had his hair painted red and ""he said he was the Joker, obviously the enemy of Batman,"" New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said on Friday. Oates would not confirm that information, although he said he had spoken to Kelly. Near the entrance to the theater's parking lot, a makeshift memorial of 12 candles sat in a row alongside piles of flowers. Up the hill from the theater, about 20 pastors led a vigil for 350 people, some hugging and crying. A sign read, ""7/20. Gone Not Forgotten."" A federal law enforcement official said Holmes bought a ticket to the movie, went into the theater as part of the crowd and propped open an exit door as the movie was playing. The suspect then donned protective ballistic gear and opened fire, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the investigation. Authorities said Holmes shot scores of people, picking off victims who tried to flee. At least one person was struck in an adjacent theater by gunfire that went through the wall. Adding to the terror and chaos were two gas canisters thrown by the suspect that filled the theater with smoke. Tanner Coon, a 17-year-old Aurora resident who was watching the film with two friends, said he first thought the gunshots were firecrackers. When he realized what was happening, he ducked between seats and waited for the shooter to bark demands. When the firing ended, Coon said he started running up the row but slipped in blood and fell on a woman who was lying on the ground. He tried shaking her, he said, but she didn't respond, so he left her behind and ran from the theater. The shooting was the worst in the U.S. since the Nov. 5, 2009, attack at Fort Hood, Texas. An Army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 soldiers and civilians and wounding more than two dozen others. It was the deadliest in Colorado since the 1999 attack at Columbine High School, where two students killed 12 classmates and a teacher and wounded 26 others before killing themselves. Holmes had enrolled last year in a neuroscience Ph.D. program at the University of Colorado-Denver, though he left last month for unknown reasons. In academic achievement, ""he was at the top of the top,"" recalled Timothy P. White, chancellor at the University of California, Riverside, where Holmes earned his undergraduate degree before attending the Denver school. Those who knew Holmes described him as a shy, intelligent person raised in California by parents who were active in their well-to-do suburban San Diego neighborhood. Holmes played soccer at Westview High School and ran cross-country before going to college. Copyright © 2021, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc. All rights reserved.

He fears the mass shooting at a midnight screening of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" in Aurora, Colo., will forever be associated with the legend of Batman. ""After mourning and feeling sympathy for the families, taking a step back as a Batman fan and historian, I'm concerned that this will taint what I consider to be an American treasure of not only popular culture but of mythology,"" he says. ""I don't want it to be the second line of the Wikipedia entry, like Watergate is to Nixon."" The role that Batman fiction might have played in motivating alleged attacker James Holmes in the theater shooting remains unclear nearly a week after the massacre that killed 12 and injured 58. Although investigators reportedly found a Batman mask inside Holmes' booby-trapped apartment, any connection to the storied comic character could be simple coincidence. Or it could be a chilling aspect of the murderous plot. Schumer and other Batman devotees caution against drawing premature parallels between the massacre and the ever-evolving history of Batman, a flawed human superhero who has been rooted in reality since his pulpy inception in 1939. ""There are so many things that we don't know about [Holmes],"" said Travis Langley, author of ""Batman and Psychology: A Dark and Stormy Knight"" and a professor of psychology at Henderson State University in Arkadelphia, Ark. ""The degree that he might be lost in fantasy, we don't know. I think it's safe to assume he had some kind of need for others to notice him."" Reports surfaced after the shooting that Holmes, his hair dyed a reddish-orange, had told arresting officers he was Batman's rival, the Joker. Authorities declined to confirm that, but fans were quick to note that the Joker's hair is actually green and that the dazed 24-year-old sitting in court Monday hardly recalled Batman's arch-nemesis. ""Clearly, we are influenced by popular culture,"" said Langley. ""The tricky part is quantifying it. There are millions upon millions of influences on us all the time. Our culture is one of those influences, but we don't know to what degree. Even if it turns out that Holmes is preoccupied with Batman and the Joker, there are so many other variables involved."" Still, questions persist about possible parallels. Why did the mass murderer target a midnight screening of director Christopher Nolan's final installment in his Batman trilogy? Why would anyone claim to be the Clown Prince of Crime? What's appealing about such an appalling villain? ""The Joker imposes his face on the world, so he can feel like it makes more sense to him,"" said Langely. ""He tries to show the world it's as ugly as he is -- and he's always been doing that to make himself feel bigger in the world. That could appeal to individuals who want the world to fit around them. For the majority of fans, they don't have that motivation."""" The Joker has been captivating audiences since he was established as the murderous yin to the Batman's yang in 1940 by DC Comics writers Bob Kane and Bill Finger, and artist Jerry Robinson. Langley believes the lack of motivation and a definitive back story for the Joker, whose schemes range from mutating smiley Joker fish to murdering Robin, makes him more interesting. A less severe Joker was pranking Batman in the comics of the '60s, while an over-the-top Cesar Romero was playing him on the ""Batman"" TV series starring Adam West. The comic book character returned to his homicidal roots in the '70s and has since been portrayed on film as an out-of-control terror by both Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger, who won a posthumous Oscar for the role in 2008. Bat-mania is about more than just fantasy, though. It's a big business spanning comics, film, TV, video games, merchandise and live events. Gene Del Vecchio, an entertainment research consultant and author of ""Creating Blockbusters: How to Generate and Market Hit Entertainment for TV, Movies, Video Games and Books,"" doubts the massacre will affect the brand, noting that it's a ""trivial issue in the face of such tragedy."" ""There is apt to be little or no monetary effect on the Batman franchise,"" said Del Vecchio. ""People go to movies, play with toys, buy soundtracks and read comics in order to escape. Escapism is such a powerful human desire that it won't be affected by the recent event."" However, the shooting might affect the tone of the franchise moving forward, especially considering Dark Knight tales have often mirrored what's happening in our world, whether Batman is taking down Nazi saboteurs in the comics or dealing with terrorism post-9/11 on film. ""I suspect the stories were heading in an even darker direction,"" said Langley. ""They are going to recognize that the public are looking at it differently now and might be ready for something brighter and more heroic.""

Special Correspondent Patricia Almazan lost her father in a mass shooting at a California library more than three decades ago and knows all too well the pain felt by those who lost loved ones in the movie theater massacre in Colorado. Almazan learned about that agony as she held her father’s hand in an Orange County hospital emergency room in July 1976. She squeezed and felt him squeeze back, and she was sure he was trying to tell her something, but in the next moment he succumbed to his wounds. Almazan still feels the hurt of that loss. She prays that the grieving souls in Aurora, Colo., at least are spared the added torment she faced after the custodian at the Cal State Fullerton library who killed her father and six others was found not guilty by reason of insanity. A case that began with cops and courts was passed to doctors and hospitals. “Doctors—whose job it is to get him well and get back in society,” Almazan says. “You don’t want that if you’re a victim.” By every indication, the only defense James Holmes can possibly mount in Colorado is an insanity plea. Some local attorneys believe he might even prevail, especially if he was diagnosed as schizophrenic before the massacre. A man named Bruco Eastwood, who shot two students outside a suburban Denver middle school in 2011, and might have perpetrated a massacre had he not been tackled by heroic teachers, was found not guilty by reason of insanity, in part because of a notebook filled with rantings. Nobody believes a gunman from a case as notorious as the movie theater massacre would ever be released, no matter what proves to be in James Holmes’s notebook, but anyone found not guilty by reason of insanity in Colorado is entitled to an annual release hearing just like those accorded in California. And Almazan has learned from the hearings granted her father’s killer that even the slightest possibility that the person who inflicted such hurt might walk free can translate into agony for the survivors. For Almazan, it has meant a quarter-century of fighting to make absolutely sure that the library custodian, Edward Charles Allaway, never just ambles back among us after calmly killing person after person with a semi-automatic rifle that he then neatly wrapped in a blanket and placed in the back of his car. Allaway pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity and the jury deadlocked. The retrial was before only a judge, who found Allaway had indeed been insane in the legal sense at the time of the killings. After a decade in the secure mental-health facility in Atascadero, Calif., Allaway announced that he was well enough to be released and treated as an outpatient. He told an Orange County court during two hours of testimony that he felt deeply sorry for his crimes. “It’s not fair to keep me locked up,” he said. “I am no longer mentally ill, in the sense I’m a danger to myself or to others.” Allaway noted that many people with mental illness function well in society. “Yes, but they don’t kill a bunch of people,” Almazan said loudly enough for the judge to chide her. Allaway’s case suffered a setback when a psychologist he called to testify on his behalf told the court that he was only in remission, had declined to take part in various treatment programs, and could still constitute a danger. “A psychotic episode could recur if he were released back into the community,” said the psychologist, Douglas Coggins. Almazan counted it as a victory when Allaway’s petition was denied. She then learned that he had been transferred to a less secure facility anyway. State mental-health officials said the move had been “inadvertent” and he was returned to Atascadero. In 1992, Allaway tried again. A psychiatrist testified at the release hearing that Allaway was in “full remission.” The judge said he was on the verge of freeing Allaway and ordered him transferred to Napa State Hospital, just 50 miles from Almazan’s home. Almazan made her outrage known. “I said, ‘He’s mass murderer!’” she recalled. The state mental-health officials said they had recommended that Allaway “be transferred for preparation for community placement” but insisted he had not yet been given a “grounds privilege card” that would have allowed him to roam the unfenced area unsupervised. He was again returned to Atascadero. In 2001, Allaway once more applied for release, announcing that he had been “completely cured.” He was by then in a secure wing at Patton State Hospital, whose administrators said in a letter to the court: “Mr. Allaway would benefit from a carefully developed and individualized discharge plan. The clinical staff are of the opinion that Mr. Allaway would no longer be a danger to the health and safety of others, including himself, while under supervision and treatment in the community.” The hearing lasted seven weeks. Almazan sat through it all, using her summer vacation. She says: “I made sure I was there and everybody knew why I was there. We couldn’t set a precedent of letting loose a mass murderer. You’d be surprised how hard a victim has to fight.” Allaway testified for nine hours. He said that during the shooting he had hallucinated that he was fleeing behind the woman he had shot in the back. He said that when he called the police after he fled the scene, he thought he was a victim. “I was beaten up and I wanted to press charges,” he said. ‘I didn’t know I did the shooting.” Allaway insisted that at present, “the last thing I want to do is hurt anybody.” He said he had prepared for release by taking a lesson in using an ATM machine. “You want to be normal,” he testified, adding, “I would like to have a good relationship with a woman.” The experts remained doubtful, noting that only between 10 and 20 percent of schizophrenics show any significant recovery over time. They deemed a cure was exceedingly rare, and they were all the more dubious in Allaway’s case, as he had long since stopped taking medication. In the end, the judge denied Allaway’s petition. Allaway appealed, but that was denied and he remained at Patton State Hospital. He continued to receive disability payments from the state though he insisted he was no longer disabled. Almazan says that a reporter from the Orange County Register had been urging her to sit down with Allaway, but she refused. “I didn’t think he would tell the truth,” she recalls. She then heard a rumor that the killer had cancer. She wondered if that might make him more forthcoming. “There was just a slight glimmer in my mind that maybe he would open up to me,” she says. She and her firefighter husband, Joe Almazan, met with Allaway and the reporter in what she calls “a tiny room in a very tiny trailer” at Patton State. “I really don’t have a whole lot of answers,” Allaway told her. “I was insane at the time, and when you’re insane, there’s just not a good reason or rhyme how things work out.” “Why did you shoot my dad three times in the back?” she asked. “I have no idea,” Allaway replied. “I don’t remember hurting those people—killing them.” She at one point showed him a photograph of her father, Frank Teplansky, a former Marine who served in World War II and Korea and was a talented graphic artist at Cal State, as well as a wonderful pianist and an amateur magician who delighted his grandsons by pulling quarters from their ears. The supposedly cured killer looked at the photo and appeared to have no reaction at all. “He didn’t respond to it,” Almazan recalls. “It didn’t mean anything to him. Nothing.” In 2010, Almazan learned that Patton State had written a letter to an outpatient program reporting that Allaway was “symptom free.” Prosecutors from the Orange County district attorney’s office joined her protest. The killer stayed where he was, keeping company with David Attias, who was found not guilty by reason of insanity after he killed four people in 2002 by driving his car into a crowd in Santa Barbara. He had leapt from the car announcing, “I am the angel of death.” Attias, the 30-year-old son of TV director Daniel Attias, is presently seeking release to a community outpatient program. A hearing was conducted earlier this year, and the judge’s decision is pending. In the meanwhile Attias spends his days with Allaway, who now 74 and not likely ever to be released, if Almazan can help it. She is as passionate as ever, though she is now 66. “He darn well knows I’m still alive,” she says of Allaway. “For the years I’ve been involved I could teach psychiatry now.” She allows she does not rank Allaway among the most cold-blooded of killers. “For some reason I don’t,” she says, then adding, “I’m so against what he did, I can’t personally forgive him. That’s God’s job.” The pain of her loss is still clear in her voice when she speaks of her father and his service to his country, his magic tricks, and that final squeeze of the hand he gave in answer to her own. She retains a belief in the power of prayer, and she is putting that to work with the hope the grieving folks in Colorado do not have to spend the years ahead going from one release hearing to another. She notes that the survivors of Columbine and Virginia Tech were spared that ordeal. “Fortunately, many mass murderers kill themselves,” she says. She suggests that our focus should be on finding ways to recognize the warning signals before a madman picks up a gun. “We need to do something as a nation,” she says. “To really train people to read the signs.”"
86443942,2012-07-23 19:30:11,"Hicks: 'Dark Knight Rises' has strong opening weekend, despite shootings",http://www.mercurynews.com/entertainment/ci_21138944/hicks-dark-knight-rises-has-strong-opening-weekend?source=rss,en,False,,35,San Jose Mercury News,http://www.mercurynews.com/,"Trending: The mass shooting at a Colorado movie theater on Friday may have dampened ticket sales for “The Dark Knight Rises,” but not by much.
The film, the third and final installment in Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy, took in about $162 million over the weekend in North America, according to the New York Times.
That total was below the predicted $190 million, an indication that some moviegoers were either not in the mood to watch a violent comic book caper or worried about theater safety after the carnage in Aurora, Colo. 
Still, “Dark Knight Rises” managed one of the best opening weekends in box office history. “Marvel’s The Avengers” took in $207.4 million over its first three days, and “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,” opened with $169.2 million in ticket sales. 


Hollywood was publicly silent about box-office results on Sunday. Studios, citing respect for the 12 people killed on Friday at a midnight viewing of “The Dark Knight Rises,” declined to report totals. Rentrak, which collects the data from theaters and provides them to studios, and other aggregators, like Hollywood.com, also declined to report figures. 
The movie’s distributor, Warner Bros., did have the benefit of strong advance ticket sales; many shows for Friday night sold out long before the killings, and there were reports of ticket scalpers, a rarity for the movies. 
“The Dark Knight Rises” also benefited from a bit of luck — well-behaved patrons and sensible theater managers. After the shootings, studio executives were concerned about potential copycats or sensitive theater managers evacuating auditoriums and prompting media coverage. Security was increased dramatically at many theaters, and there appeared to be no major incidents. 
Warner officials had no comment on Sunday. The studio and its production and financing partner, Legendary Entertainment, spent an estimated $250 million to make “The Dark Knight Rises,” with marketing costs pushing the total cost of this PG-13 movie over $400 million. 
It’s not unreasonable to expect record-breaking second and third weeks.  


The New York Times reported that the film’s sales total, which included exceptionally strong results at Imax theaters, came from 4,404 locations in North America, or about 80 percent of the available theaters. Second place for the weekend went to “Ice Age: Continental Drift” (20th Century Fox), which took in a solid $21 million, for a two-week total of about $90 million, according to multiple studio officials with access to box-office data. 
“The Amazing Spider-Man” (Sony Pictures Entertainment) was third, selling about $11 million in tickets and lifting its three-week total to about $229 million. The comedy “Ted” (Universal Pictures) finished in fourth place, with an estimated $10 million, for a four-week total of $180 million. Disney-Pixar’s “Brave” was fifth in its fifth week, selling about $6 million in tickets, for a new total of $209 million. 
“The Dark Knight Rises,” which stars Christian Bale in the title role and Anne Hathaway as Catwoman, inspired a sense of awe in many reviewers, who found its nearly three hours a worthy conclusion to this three-film cycle; Hathaway’s saucy performance in particular won rave reviews. (Bale released a statement on Saturday about the killings, reading, in part, “Words cannot express the horror that I feel.”) 
Exit polls indicated strong word-of-mouth may help ticket sales in the weeks ahead. But like many movies in this Hollywood age, the film’s ultimate fortunes rest with overseas audiences, and there was no information available on Sunday about how it was performing there. The Colorado shootings, which left more than 50 injured, generated global headlines, and Warner canceled a planned red carpet premiere in Paris for Friday night. 
About 47 percent of the $1 billion in global ticket sales for “The Dark Knight” in 2008 came from international theaters, but “Rises” was expected to do much better, partly because of interest in expanding markets like Russia.
Warner has already been working to reimagine Batman for another film series, although a reboot would not come before 2015 at the earliest, given the production cycle these kinds of effects-driven movies require. Nolan has said he would not be involved, and The Los Angeles Times recently reported that he declined a Warner overture to be involved with the studio’s “Avengers”-style “Justice League” project.
Next summer Warner will release “Man of Steel,” featuring an updated version of Superman and produced by Nolan. But beyond Batman the studio has been unable to figure out lately how to successfully bring its stable of DC Comics superheroes to theaters, even as the rival Marvel — now owned by the Walt Disney Co. — has scored over and over. 
That helps to explain why Warner — privately — was exhaling deeply on Sunday.

""Tragically, the extreme trauma she sustained also caused a miscarriage,"" the Moser family said in a statement Saturday. Funeral arrangements for 6-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan are still pending, according to the statement. The girl was the youngest person killed in the rampage, which authorities say was carried out by a 24-year-old recent dropout from a Ph.D. program in neuroscience at the University of Colorado-Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora. He is being held without bond in a Colorado prison. 4 victims remembered at memorials Veronica's mother, meanwhile, faces significant physical and emotional challenges, undergoing an additional surgery Saturday morning.

At first he was just a silhouette, taken by some in the audience for a stunt that was part of one of the summer's most highly anticipated films. But then, authorities said, he threw gas canisters that filled the packed suburban Denver theater with smoke, and, in the confusing haze between Hollywood fantasy and terrifying reality, opened fire as people screamed and dove for cover. At least 12 people were killed and 58 wounded -- 11 critically -- in one of the deadliest mass shootings in recent U.S. history. ""He looked like an assassin ready to go to war,"" said Jordan Crofter, a moviegoer who was unhurt in the attack early Friday, about a half-hour after the special midnight opening of ""The Dark Knight Rises."" The gunman, identified by police as 24-year-old James Holmes, used a military-style semi-automatic rifle, a shotgun and a pistol, stopping only to reload. The suspect marched up the aisle in the stadium-style theater, picking off those who tried to flee, witnesses said. Authorities said he hit scores of people, with a few of the 70 victims suffering their injuries not by gunfire but in the ensuing chaos. At least one person was struck in an adjacent theater by gunfire that went through the wall. ""He would reload and shoot and anyone who would try to leave would just get killed,"" said Jennifer Seeger, adding that bullet casings landed on her head and burned her forehead. Within minutes, frantic 911 calls brought some 200 police officers, ambulances and emergency crews to the theater. Holmes was captured in the parking lot. Police said they later found that his nearby apartment was booby-trapped. Authorities gave no motive for the attack. The FBI said there was no indication of ties to any terrorist groups. In New York City, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said: ""It clearly looks like a deranged individual. He has his hair painted red. He said he was the Joker, obviously the enemy of Batman."" Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates would not confirm that information, but did say he had spoken to Kelly. The two used to work together in New York. Asked whether Holmes had makeup to look like the Joker, Oates said: ""That to my knowledge is not true."" It was the worst mass shooting in the U.S. since the Nov. 5, 2009, attack at Fort Hood, Texas. An Army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 soldiers and civilians and wounding more than two dozen others. It was the deadliest in Colorado since the Columbine High School massacre in suburban Denver in 1999, when two students killed 12 classmates and a teacher and wounded 26 others before killing themselves. The latest shooting rocked this sprawling suburb of 325,000 east of Denver. A makeshift memorial with 12 candles in a row and piles of flowers sat at a corner near the entrance to the movie theater parking lot. Up the hill from there, about 20 pastors led a vigil for about 350 people, some hugging and crying At an emotional afternoon news conference, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper said the people of Aurora would rise above the spasm of violence and ultimately not be ""defined"" by the tragedy. The new Batman movie, the last in the trilogy starring Christian Bale, opened worldwide Friday with midnight showings in the U.S. The plot has the villain Bane facing Bale's Caped Crusader with a nuclear weapon that could destroy all of fictional Gotham. The shooting prompted officials to cancel the red-carpet premiere in Paris, and some U.S. movie theaters stepped up security for daytime showings. The film's director, Christopher Nolan, issued a statement on behalf of the cast and crew, expressing their ""profound sorrow at the senseless tragedy."" ""Nothing any of us can say could ever adequately express our feelings for the innocent victims of this appalling crime, but our thoughts are with them and their families,"" Nolan said. The attack began shortly after midnight at the multiplex in Aurora. Audience members said they thought it was part of the movie or a stunt associated with it. The film has several scenes of public mayhem -- a hallmark of superhero movies. In one scene, Bane leads an attack on a stock exchange, and in another he leads a shooting and bombing rampage on a packed football stadium. A federal law enforcement official said Holmes bought a ticket to the show, went into the theater as part of the crowd and propped open an exit door as the movie was playing. The suspect then donned protective ballistic gear and opened fire, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation. At some point, the gunman appeared to have stepped outside because several witnesses saw him come through the door. ""All I saw is the door swinging open and the street lights behind, and you could see a silhouette,"" said Crofter, who was sitting on the left side of the theater and toward the front. Sylvana Guillen said the gunman, clad in dark clothing, appeared at the front of the theater just as the character Catwoman appeared in the movie. Then they heard gunshots and smelled smoke from a canister he was carrying. As she and her friend, Misha Mostashiry, ran to the exit, Guillen said, they saw a man slip in the blood of a wounded woman he was trying to help. Oates said the gunman wore a gas mask and a ballistic helmet and vest, as well as leg, groin and throat protectors. He said he bought four guns from local gun shops in the last 60 days and 6,000 rounds of ammunition, including a drum magazine that could fire 50 to 60 rounds per minute. ""I thought it was showmanship. I didn't think it was real,"" Seeger said. She said she was in the second row, about four feet from the gunman, when he pointed a gun at her face. ""I was just a deer in headlights. I didn't know what to do,"" she said. Then she ducked to the ground as the gunman shot people seated behind her. Seeger said she began crawling toward an exit when she saw a girl of about 14 ""lying lifeless on the stairs."" She saw a man with a bullet wound in his back and tried to check his pulse, but ""I had to go. I was going to get shot."" Later, police began entering the theater, asking people to hold their hands up as they evacuated the building. Some of the victims were treated for chemical exposure apparently related to canisters thrown by the gunman. Those hurt included a 4-month-old baby, who was treated at a hospital and released. Authorities removed the bodies from the theater on Friday afternoon. Officials wheeled a black bag on a stretcher out of the front entrance, placing it in the back of a minivan. Ten people died in the theater, while two others died from their injuries later. Officers with a list of those confirmed dead met with the family members of the deceased Friday night to tell them the fate of their loved ones. The identities of some emerged late Friday as relatives confirmed the deaths of 23-year-old Micayla Medek, 27-year-old Alex Sullivan and 24-year-old Jessica Ghawi. Those who knew Holmes described him as a shy, intelligent person raised in California by parents who were active in their well-to-do suburban neighborhood in San Diego. Holmes played soccer at Westview High School and ran cross-country before going to college. On Friday morning, police escorted Holmes' father, a manager of a software company, from their home while his mother, a nurse, stayed inside, receiving visitors who came to offer support. Holmes also has a younger sister. ""As you can understand, the Holmes family is very upset about all of this,"" Lt. Andra Brown, the San Diego police spokeswoman, told reporters in the driveway of the family home. ""It's a tragic event and it's taken everyone by surprise. They are definitely trying to work through this."" Police released a statement from his family that said: ""Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved."" There have been no indications so far that Holmes had any run-ins with the law before Friday. Tom Mai, a retired electrical engineer, said Holmes was a ""shy guy"" who came from a ""very, very nice family."" Holmes graduated from University of California, Riverside, in the spring of 2010 with a bachelor's degree in neuroscience, a school spokesman said. Mai said the mother told him Holmes couldn't find a job after earning a master's degree and returned to school. He enrolled in the Ph.D. neuroscience program at the University of Colorado-Denver in June 2011 but left the program last month, according to the university. Holmes lived in an apartment in Aurora, and FBI agents and police who went there discovered it was booby-trapped when they used a camera at the end of a 12-foot pole to look inside. Authorities evacuated surrounding residences, and about two dozen people headed to a shelter set up by the Red Cross at a local school. Police were not able to enter the apartment Friday night and Oates said they will again on Saturday. ""It is a very vexing problem how to enter that apartment safely,"" he said.

Trakel had gone to the midnight showing of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" with 11 friends from a conference she was attending. Trakel said they heard some pops and saw smoke before realizing a bullet had penetrated the wall and hit her friend seated two rows behind her.

The expected plea comes as psychiatric experts are set to testify that Loughner was sane back in January 2011 when he opened fire, the Times reported. While his mental capacity varies, he comprehends what he did and the charges he faces, the report added. Many of the victims and their families are expected at the courthouse Tuesday. They will be invited to speak at a separate hearing when he is sentenced. Loughner may still face state charges. Giffords, who was shot in the head, still sometimes uses a wheelchair — but recently climbed the French Alps with her husband, ¬astronaut Mark Kelly. The youngest person killed was 9-year-old Christina Taylor-Green, who was said to be interested in politics and was there to meet the congresswoman. Share Selection"

The red carpet will not roll out Friday on the Champs-Élysées after a mass shooting left 12 dead and 40 wounded in suburban Denver at a screening of The Dark Knight Rises. After a fatal mass shooting early Friday left 12 dead and 40 wounded in suburban Denver at a screening of The Dark Knight Rises, promotional activities for the film in France have been suspended. The red carpet will not roll out Friday evening on the Champs-Élysées, where the latest installment in the Batman franchise was due to premiere in Paris. Warner Bros., the studio behind the movie, quickly canceled a press junket scheduled for Friday morning at the luxury Bristol hotel, steps from the Élysée Palace—even while cast members prepared for interview sessions and dozens of film critics waited their turn—as word spread of the multiplex massacre some 5,000 miles away. The Colorado killings took place shortly before 9 a.m. Paris time. The film, featuring France’s own Marion Cotillard, among other cast members, is due to open on 900 French screens Wednesday. On an otherwise quiet summer Friday in France, coverage of the killings has dominated the media, heading top news sites throughout the day and leading 24-hour-news-channel loops. In the afternoon a crew was shown dismantling the premiere setup on the vast sidewalk in front of the Gaumont Champs-Élysées Marignan cinema. The TF1 TV network told Agence France-Presse that a late-morning taping of interviews with Cotillard and Morgan Freeman, scheduled to appear on the national 8 p.m. newscast just as the premiere was scheduled to begin, had also been canceled. Fellow stars Christian Bale and Anne Hathaway and director Christopher Nolan, all expected this evening on the “most beautiful avenue in the world” for the superhero blockbuster’s French debut, were also reportedly waiting in the wings at the Bristol as reporters were asked to leave. “We waited an hour and 45 minutes,” Sophie Grassin, a film critic for Le Nouvel Observateur present at the Bristol, told the French weekly’s website. “Then, around 11:30 a.m., we saw Marion Cotillard arrive, made up, well dressed. The Warner folks led her into a room where they evidently told her the terrible news. The Warner team was in tears.” Visiting the Tour de France on Friday, French President François Hollande said in a statement: “The President of the Republic has learned with very deep emotion of the shooting in a cinéma near Denver which, according to estimates that remain provisional, cost the lives of 12 people and injured about 40. He understands how much this drama deeply upsets America’s youth and bereaves all of America. In these tragic circumstances, he would like to impart all of his solidarity to American authorities and to the American people and to express, in the name of France, his condolences to the families and friends of the victims.”"

86372291,2012-07-21 08:45:00,The Town Shaken by Tragedy,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thedailybeast/articles/~3/kddTifSD8eI/aurora-colorado-small-town-shaken-by-dark-knight-shooting.html,en,False,,1707,Daily Beast,http://www.thedailybeast.com/,"SEARCH What is Aurora really like? Kevin Fallon reports on the city that was once one of the safest in America. Senior Entertainment Reporter Aurora, Colo., is a city of superlatives. It’s appeared on Men’s Health magazine’s list of best cities for men five years in a row. U.S. News and World Report recently ranked five of the specialties at the University of Colorado Hospital as among the best in the nation. Sports Illustrated named it Colorado’s best “Sportstown” in 2003. In December 2011, Forbes declared it the ninth-safest city in America. Just seven months later, Aurora adds another superlative to its list: the site of the worst mass shooting in the U.S. since the 2009 attack at Fort Hood, Texas, and the deadliest in Colorado since Columbine. A 24-year-old gunman named James Holmes, a former University of Colorado graduate student, reportedly opened fire at the audience attending a packed midnight screening of the hotly anticipated summer blockbuster The Dark Knight Rises Thursday night, killing 12 people and leaving at least 50 injured. It’s a particularly startling turn of events for a city that, according to FBI crime statistics, had only six killings in all of 2011, making Aurora the cruelest of clichés: the quiet town rocked by unspeakable tragedy. “People are in shock,” says Melanie Zeitler, director of development and marketing at the Plains Conservation Center in Aurora. “It’s such a horrific crime that it’s just kind of unfathomable to hear of it happening anywhere, let alone five or seven miles from where you work.” To hear people describe Aurora as a sort of suburban utopia, it’s easy to believe their surprise. It’s the third-largest city in Colorado—population just over 325,000—and the quintessential All-American city. It’s less than 10 miles from the urban sprawl of Denver, yet it’s a High Plains city with picturesque views of the Rocky Mountains. It’s home to the Buckley Air Force Base, populating the city with more than 12,000 military personnel and their families. Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman both have large outposts there. Smack dab in the middle of town is the Plains Conservation Center, a 1,100-acre prairie reserve where one of the largest herds of pronghorns in North America roam free as if on the Serengeti—yet just six miles away is the bustling Town Center at Aurora mall, with its Macy’s, Sears, and Century 16 movie theater, where the deadly shooting took place. “Aurora blends a rural setting with an urban feel,” says Gary Wheat, president and CEO of Visit Aurora, the city’s tourism board. “You feel like you know everyone, but again it’s a city of almost 330,000 people and has all the services that demands.” By some respects, the town is ubiquitously suburban. Just across the street from Century 16 is a Target. The parking lot for Sears has a T.G.I. Friday’s restaurant in it. Strip malls and shopping plazas dot the center of the city. The housing, largely, is in pop-up communities, “cookie-cutter things that are typical of suburbia,” says Zeitler. There are a “plethora” of megachurches and 10 golf courses. No proper Auroran would be caught out on a winter Sunday without their navy and orange on, prepping for the Denver Broncos football game. Want to take advantage of the dozens of hiking trails? Feel free—Aurora averages 300 days of sunshine a year. Now? The town included on U.S. News and World Report’s list of 10 Winter Wonderlands for Retirement, America’s Promise Alliance’s roster of Best Communities for Young People, and—it bears mentioning again—the Forbes list of safest cities has been invaded by a circus of media reporters and gawkers. The busy intersections surrounding the Town Center mall and Holmes’s apartment building have been cordoned off by police tape, shut down completely. “This obviously takes the breath away of everyone in the city,” Wheat says. Tonight, less than 24 hours since tragedy struck, between 400 and 500 people—an extremely large gathering by Aurora’s standard—are expected to attend the Eighth Annual Hops for Habitat Festival at the Plains Conservation Center, a beer festival with tastings from 16 microbreweries and two food trucks, and which will feature prairie wagon rides and a campfire marshmallow roast. The current mood in Aurora isn’t exactly what its organizers expected when they planned the supposed-to-be-jovial affair. “We’re sort of hoping that it’s a community galvanizing event,” says Zeitler, who helped plan the festival. “People need to come together and grieve as a community and also celebrate the fact that life is fragile.” But don’t expect Aurora to forget recent events any time soon. “I look back at Columbine, which also happened in Colorado,”  says Zeitler. “It was years of grieving and healing. You still hear the name Columbine and it elicits all kinds of things. People in Aurora are resilient, but while we can heal, we don’t forget. For a long time, there will be many stark reminders of how delicate life is.”"

Senator, I want to talk to you in depth at the end of this about guns and the role of guns in society. But I know because of the Tucson shooting and Gabby Giffords that this is something you want to first get off of your chest. MCCAIN: Well, just briefly, it's a terrible tragedy and that bears repeating. But I hope also that the folks in Colorado could look at what we did in Tucson. It was great healing. The president of the United States came and gave a great speech. It was really -- our community and our state united. And I hope that the people of Aurora, and the state of Colorado, will also begin on that. It is tough, but I think that we have emerged in Arizona where there has been significant improvement. And so I hope that everybody knows how tough it is as well. CROWLEY: I think Governor Hickenlooper sort of was headed in that direction, talking about the community coming together. Let me move you first overseas and talk to you about Syria, this has obviously been a subject you have been heavily involved in, pushing for more U.S. action, more U.S. leadership, not boots on the ground, but getting some help to these rebels. I want to play something that Leon Panetta said this week for you. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LEON PANETTA, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: The violence there has only gotten worse and the loss of lives has only increased, which tells us that this is a situation that is rapidly spinning out of control. (END VIDEO CLIP) MCCAIN: Really? Is that it? I hate to be sarcastic, but because of our failure to assist, because of our failure to lead other willing nations in the region, like Turkey and Saudi Arabia and Qatar and others, the situation has now deteriorated to a situation which is really, really very dangerous. We now have... CROWLEY: It is irretrievable? MCCAIN: Well, I think it is retrievable, but I think it is far, far more complicated and difficult than if we had weighed in a long time ago. More al Qaeda fighters, media reports that chemical weapons are being moved around, Israel being very concerned about some of those chemical weapons reaching Hezbollah, the -- not to mention the massacre of 17,000, 18,000 people, while this administration has relied on the goodwill of Russia -- and the United Nations Security Council, relied on Russia for a long period of time that they would take Bashar al-Assad to Russia. It has been shameful. It is shameful. And we need to -- and now the latest reports are that they are going to help, but they are not going to provide weapons. They want other countries to do that. These are helicopter gunships, tanks, artillery that are slaughtering people, and now there is a risk, and I'm not saying it is going to happen, a risk that in his desperation, Bashar al-Assad might use those chemical weapons, and -- but clearly the Israelis see this as a serious threat, because the situation has gone on and on and on. More extremists have come into the fight, the more difficulty there will be after this is over. CROWLEY: But, you know, we kind of are where we are where we are. So like as of right now, we are still sort of working through the U.N. or trying to work through the U.N., and you laugh, I mean, is... MCCAIN: How many times... CROWLEY: Do you just consider... MCCAIN: How many times do we have to try that? Kofi Annan's plan has been an abject failure, we keep supporting that. We keep hoping -- pushing this reset button with Russia that somehow they and China will -- we are now bound by the decisions of the U.N. Security Council which are dictated by Russia and China. What do we need to do? We need to get arms and equipment to them. We need to establish a buffer zone and... (CROSSTALK) CROWLEY: U.S. arms, you want to get U.S. arms to them. You don't... MCCAIN: Sure, why not? Why not? Russian arms are coming in. Iranians are on the ground. Meanwhile, the Iranians are helping Bashar al-Assad and they are committing acts of -- they are committing terrorist acts around the world -- they are planning on terrorist acts. The talks with Iran on their nuclear development have broken down and where is the United States of America? The president has not yet in my memory in recent times spoken up for the people who are being slaughtered in the streets of Aleppo, Homs, Damascus, and others today. CROWLEY: Let me ask you quickly about another area of the world, and that is Israel. I want to play you something that President Obama was down in West Palm Beach, something that he said recently. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I want everybody here to know under my administration we haven't just preserved the unbreakable bond with Israel, we have strengthened it. We have stood by Israel's side in the face of criticism. Our military and intelligence cooperation has never been closer. (END VIDEO CLIP) CROWLEY: Do you think that is true? MCCAIN: Everybody knows that relations with Israel have never been worse, beginning with the demands for a freeze settlement back at the beginning of the Obama administration. The president sends his national security adviser and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to Israel to tell them not to attack Iran, thereby weakening Israel. The relations have never been worse. And, again, it is a lack of trust on the part of the Israelis about what the United States of America will or will not do. CROWLEY: Let me turn you back now to the situation in Colorado, and remind our viewers of what has happened. This is dating back to 1999, Littleton, Colorado, otherwise known as Columbine, 13 killed in a mass shooting. 2007, Virginia Tech, 32 killed. CROWLEY: 2009, Fort Hood, Texas, 13 killed; 2012, Aurora, Colorado, 12 killed. Different circumstances, different people, but people look at this and say, can't we do anything to stop this? MCCAIN: I don't know to tell you the truth what we can do. And this immediately leads to the issue of gun control. The killer in Norway was in a country that had very strict gun control laws and yet he was still able to acquire the necessary means to initiate and carry out a mass slaughter. I think that we need to look at everything, if everything should be looked at, but to think that somehow gun control is -- or increased gun control is the answer, in my view, that has to be proved. CROWLEY: But you would be open to the discussion. And I think part of what people are looking at are these magazines and these automatic weapons where you can shoot down 100 people. As I understand it, this suspect's gun jammed and he had to go to ones that didn't fire so rapidly, but he was able to buy and had on him a 100- round cartridge. He was able to buy over three months four weapons, 6,000 ammo cartridges over the Internet. If we had put that all together, someone would have said, oh, we need to go check on Apartment 3B or whatever it was, because this guy is gathering up an arsenal, which also includes tear gas. So then you get to this point where you don't want the government spying on what people are buying. On the other hand, what is the price? The price is all of these things that we have just read off? MCCAIN: Well, first of all, let's remember it is a constitutional right. Second of all, I think that if so -- if you could prove the case that that indeed that has a positive effect -- we had a ban on assault weapons that expired some years ago. It didn't change the situation at all, in my view. So, look, I think that the strongest 2nd Amendment rights people would be glad to have a conversation, but to somehow leap to the conclusion that this was somehow caused by the fact that we don't have more gun control legislation, I don't think, has been proved. CROWLEY: Senator John McCain, it's good to have you. MCCAIN: Thank you for having me on.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Our Campaign Insiders weigh in President Obama is now claiming Mitt Romney ""twisted"" his words by focusing on the now-infamous ""you didn't build that"" quote from earlier this month, telling a California crowd Monday that the line was taken out of context. Speaking in Oakland Monday night, he said Romney knowingly ""twisted my words around"" to imply he didn't care about small business. The fundraiser comments marked the latest effort by the Obama campaign to claim Romney pulled his quote out of context. The president is trying to douse the still-simmering controversy over his ill-phrased remarks on business in America, after taking a short hiatus from campaigning out of respect for the victims of the Colorado mass shooting, as did Romney. The Obama campaign released a web video titled ""Tampered"" on Monday that made the same point. However, the campaign did not initially mount this argument. In the days immediately following the comments, in which the president suggested businesses owe their success in large part to government, the campaign defended the president's remarks -- without claiming they were taken out of context. The Republican National Committee continued to hammer the quote on Tuesday, releasing a web video that included that and other recent Obama remarks on the economy. The video said: ""These aren't gaffes. This is what Obama believes."" Here's what the president originally said in Roanoke, Va.: ""If you've been successful, you didn't get there on your own. You didn't get there on your own. I'm always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. There are a lot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else. Let me tell you something -- there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there. ""If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didn't get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet."" Obama and his team are claiming the ""that"" was in reference to roads and bridges. Republicans have claimed he was talking about the businesses themselves. Regardless, Republicans have also taken issue with the entire arc of the speech, not just the ""you didn't build that line."" ""The context is worse than the quote,"" Romney told CNBC, in an interview that was tweeted out by the Republican National Committee. ""The context, he says, you know, you think you've been successful because you're smart, but he says a lot of people are smart. You think you've been successful because you work hard, a lot of people work hard. This is an ideology which says hey, we're all the same here, we ought to take from all and give to one another and that achievement, individual initiative and risk-taking and success are not to be rewarded as they have in the past,"" Romney said. ""It's a very strange and, in some respects, foreign to the American experience type of philosophy.""

86530709,2012-07-26 13:31:28,Aurora shooting like reliving the Virginia Tech ordeal,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_latest/~3/HfzitbdLFAg/index.html,en,False,,1095,CNN,http://www.cnn.com/,"When I first heard about the shooting rampage in a Colorado theater, I was shocked and horrified. It was like reliving the Virginia Tech shooting all over again. News: Remembering the Colorado shooting victims On April 16, 2007, Virginia Tech experienced the largest mass shooting on a college campus, with 32 students killed and 17 wounded. Our typical serene spring morning was bombarded with continuous screeching of rescue and police sirens alerting everyone that a terrible situation was at hand. As news spread, our community responded swiftly, but with a sense of bewilderment, grief and anger. There was no doubt that this was a life changing experience for the survivors as well as families of the victims. Timeline: Worst mass shootings in U.S. The campus disaster response network immediately sprung into action to assist families directly affected by the shooting. The day after the incident, a network of professionals met to begin the task of planning an ongoing mental health response to the tragedy. This group included university personnel, counselors, clinical psychologists, community agencies and the local mental health association. On the day after the attack, a candlelight vigil was held for the entire university. It was quite moving to observe the thousands of candles burning, signifying the great loss. That night, 6-foot walls of plywood and paper provided the opportunity to record Bible verses, sentiments and vows to remember those who died. This proved quite cathartic. A website, Hokie United, encouraged people to bring mementos to the drill field as an expression of love and support. Convocation took place in Cassell Coliseum and Lane Stadium. This event was well attended by about 35,000 students, faculty and staff. The service was a major step in communal healing. The attendance of President George W. Bush, first lady Laura Bush and Gov. Tim Kaine was an important source of support. The resolve to engender hope was eloquently voiced by the final words of professor and poet Nikki Giovanni, ""...We are the Hokies, We will prevail, We will prevail, We will prevail ....We are Virginia Tech."" By all indications, it appears that Aurora, Colorado, engaged in many similar steps to meet the immediate demands of the traumatized victims. The SWAT team, police and rescue personnel reacted quickly. It appears that the clergy, mental health professionals and the Red Cross were all responsive in timely and meaningful ways. As the days pass, people in the community have been offering condolences to the families with flowers, candles and mementos. News: Colorado shooting: Stories of survival The memorial service demonstrates the community's show of genuine care. President Obama meeting with the families as a group and as individuals was a powerful acknowledgment of their pain and hopefully served as a tremendous sign that the nation stands behind them. Perhaps the most unfortunate consequences of both the Virginia Tech and Aurora tragedies is that the families of the deceased, the injured and others most exposed to the shooting (including first responders) often do not seek help. The stigma associated with mental health interventions prevents individuals from obtaining much needed assistance. It is too frequently the case that individuals wait for years to take advantage of the effective mental health treatments targeting traumatic experiences. Months and years of pain, anxiety, confusion as well as loss of relationships and lack of effectiveness in the classroom or workplace is tolerated until ""breaking points"" are reached. Those affected by the shooting should not be afraid to ask for help; they should not wait and suffer silently and alone. News: How to help the victims It is my hope that the resilience and communal strength displayed by the Hokie Nation in the days, months and years after the Virginia Tech shooting will serve as a model for everyone affected in that Aurora movie theater. The adage ""out of darkness comes light"" is a reminder for those who endure tragedy that there is always hope. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion"

Senator, I want to talk to you in depth at the end of this about guns and the role of guns in society. But I know because of the Tucson shooting and Gabby Giffords that this is something you want to first get off of your chest. MCCAIN: Well, just briefly, it's a terrible tragedy and that bears repeating. But I hope also that the folks in Colorado could look at what we did in Tucson. It was great healing. The president of the United States came and gave a great speech. It was really -- our community and our state united. And I hope that the people of Aurora, and the state of Colorado, will also begin on that. It is tough, but I think that we have emerged in Arizona where there has been significant improvement. And so I hope that everybody knows how tough it is as well. CROWLEY: I think Governor Hickenlooper sort of was headed in that direction, talking about the community coming together. Let me move you first overseas and talk to you about Syria, this has obviously been a subject you have been heavily involved in, pushing for more U.S. action, more U.S. leadership, not boots on the ground, but getting some help to these rebels. I want to play something that Leon Panetta said this week for you. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LEON PANETTA, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: The violence there has only gotten worse and the loss of lives has only increased, which tells us that this is a situation that is rapidly spinning out of control. (END VIDEO CLIP) MCCAIN: Really? Is that it? I hate to be sarcastic, but because of our failure to assist, because of our failure to lead other willing nations in the region, like Turkey and Saudi Arabia and Qatar and others, the situation has now deteriorated to a situation which is really, really very dangerous. We now have... CROWLEY: It is irretrievable? MCCAIN: Well, I think it is retrievable, but I think it is far, far more complicated and difficult than if we had weighed in a long time ago. More al Qaeda fighters, media reports that chemical weapons are being moved around, Israel being very concerned about some of those chemical weapons reaching Hezbollah, the -- not to mention the massacre of 17,000, 18,000 people, while this administration has relied on the goodwill of Russia -- and the United Nations Security Council, relied on Russia for a long period of time that they would take Bashar al-Assad to Russia. It has been shameful. It is shameful. And we need to -- and now the latest reports are that they are going to help, but they are not going to provide weapons. They want other countries to do that. These are helicopter gunships, tanks, artillery that are slaughtering people, and now there is a risk, and I'm not saying it is going to happen, a risk that in his desperation, Bashar al-Assad might use those chemical weapons, and -- but clearly the Israelis see this as a serious threat, because the situation has gone on and on and on. More extremists have come into the fight, the more difficulty there will be after this is over. CROWLEY: But, you know, we kind of are where we are where we are. So like as of right now, we are still sort of working through the U.N. or trying to work through the U.N., and you laugh, I mean, is... MCCAIN: How many times... CROWLEY: Do you just consider... MCCAIN: How many times do we have to try that? Kofi Annan's plan has been an abject failure, we keep supporting that. We keep hoping -- pushing this reset button with Russia that somehow they and China will -- we are now bound by the decisions of the U.N. Security Council which are dictated by Russia and China. What do we need to do? We need to get arms and equipment to them. We need to establish a buffer zone and... (CROSSTALK) CROWLEY: U.S. arms, you want to get U.S. arms to them. You don't... MCCAIN: Sure, why not? Why not? Russian arms are coming in. Iranians are on the ground. Meanwhile, the Iranians are helping Bashar al-Assad and they are committing acts of -- they are committing terrorist acts around the world -- they are planning on terrorist acts. The talks with Iran on their nuclear development have broken down and where is the United States of America? The president has not yet in my memory in recent times spoken up for the people who are being slaughtered in the streets of Aleppo, Homs, Damascus, and others today. CROWLEY: Let me ask you quickly about another area of the world, and that is Israel. I want to play you something that President Obama was down in West Palm Beach, something that he said recently. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I want everybody here to know under my administration we haven't just preserved the unbreakable bond with Israel, we have strengthened it. We have stood by Israel's side in the face of criticism. Our military and intelligence cooperation has never been closer. (END VIDEO CLIP) CROWLEY: Do you think that is true? MCCAIN: Everybody knows that relations with Israel have never been worse, beginning with the demands for a freeze settlement back at the beginning of the Obama administration. The president sends his national security adviser and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to Israel to tell them not to attack Iran, thereby weakening Israel. The relations have never been worse. And, again, it is a lack of trust on the part of the Israelis about what the United States of America will or will not do. CROWLEY: Let me turn you back now to the situation in Colorado, and remind our viewers of what has happened. This is dating back to 1999, Littleton, Colorado, otherwise known as Columbine, 13 killed in a mass shooting. 2007, Virginia Tech, 32 killed. CROWLEY: 2009, Fort Hood, Texas, 13 killed; 2012, Aurora, Colorado, 12 killed. Different circumstances, different people, but people look at this and say, can't we do anything to stop this? MCCAIN: I don't know to tell you the truth what we can do. And this immediately leads to the issue of gun control. The killer in Norway was in a country that had very strict gun control laws and yet he was still able to acquire the necessary means to initiate and carry out a mass slaughter. I think that we need to look at everything, if everything should be looked at, but to think that somehow gun control is -- or increased gun control is the answer, in my view, that has to be proved. CROWLEY: But you would be open to the discussion. And I think part of what people are looking at are these magazines and these automatic weapons where you can shoot down 100 people. As I understand it, this suspect's gun jammed and he had to go to ones that didn't fire so rapidly, but he was able to buy and had on him a 100- round cartridge. He was able to buy over three months four weapons, 6,000 ammo cartridges over the Internet. If we had put that all together, someone would have said, oh, we need to go check on Apartment 3B or whatever it was, because this guy is gathering up an arsenal, which also includes tear gas. So then you get to this point where you don't want the government spying on what people are buying. On the other hand, what is the price? The price is all of these things that we have just read off? MCCAIN: Well, first of all, let's remember it is a constitutional right. Second of all, I think that if so -- if you could prove the case that that indeed that has a positive effect -- we had a ban on assault weapons that expired some years ago. It didn't change the situation at all, in my view. So, look, I think that the strongest 2nd Amendment rights people would be glad to have a conversation, but to somehow leap to the conclusion that this was somehow caused by the fact that we don't have more gun control legislation, I don't think, has been proved. CROWLEY: Senator John McCain, it's good to have you. MCCAIN: Thank you for having me on.

Two others came from Swedish Medical Center to meet Bale, who stars as Batman/Bruce Wayne. “The patients were really happy to meet Bale,” Voloch said. ”They are obviously big fans of his movies. They wanted to see Batman and were really pleased to see Bale.” Bale and his wife, Sibi Blazic, also met with a number of doctors, Aurora police officers and emergency medical technicians who were first responders when James Eagan Holmes allegedly killed 12 people and injured 58 others at Century Aurora 16 theater early Friday. Bale spent about 10 minutes with each person. “It was good for the patients,” Voloch said. ”We hope it was therapeutic for them, and all the staff really appreciated him coming.” Nurse Crystal Flateland said she definitely did. Flateland and 18 other staff members from Swedish were taken to Medical Center of Aurora on Tuesday for an appreciation buffet and — to their surprise — a meet and greet with Bale. “I am probably one of the biggest Batman fans ever,” Flateland said. ”It was amazing, actually, to get to meet him. I think it’s really great he came out here. It was touching.” Flateland was called in to work after the shooting. During that morning, she was part of a medical team transferred to Medical Center of Aurora, where more help was needed. Flateland said she ended up working about 40 hours straight. “It was kind of exhausting,” Flateland said. ”But I’ve now caught up on sleep and recovered.” Bale also spent some time with Gov. John Hickenlooper. Medical Center of Aurora received 18 patients from the movie theater shooting, and seven were admitted. Four patients went to Swedish Medical Center. Voloch said Bale notified hospital officials that he wanted to visit the injured but asked that media not be notified. ”He just wanted to meet with victims and police.” Among the people Bale visited was Carey Rottman of Denver. Friends quickly tweeted out a photo of their visit. Bale and Bazic also visited a growing memorial to victims near the movie theater. Officials from Warner Bros. Pictures, maker of ”The Dark Knight Rises,” said Bale came to Aurora on his own. “Mr. Bale is there as himself, not representing Warner Brothers,” said an assistant for Susan Fleishman, executive vice president for Warner Bros.’ corporate communications.

In the wake of the largest mass shooting in U.S. history at a midnight Friday screening of the film in Aurora, Colo., the studio behind the Batman franchise did not release box-office estimates for what was expected tobe, and still appears to have been, a huge debut. Deadline.com cited sources as saying The Dark Knight Rises grossed $77.2 million on Friday. The box-office tracking firm Exhibitor Relations was guesstimating $75 million to $80 million based on advance sales. MORE: All the latest on Dark Knight Rises tragedy The new three-day, Friday-Sunday projection, as noted by Deadline.com and TheWrap.com, was $170 million. But Exhibitor Relations' Jeff Bock said in an email, ""We still have no idea, nor does anyone, what it will make on Sunday."" Sunday, less driven by presales, is expected to be the first box-office test for the now-tragedy-marked Dark Knight Rises. Theater owners nationwide tried to reassure the moviegoing public by beefing up security and, in some cases, adding police presence and barring admittance to people in costume. Still, some major chains' stock prices fell in trading Friday, while Dark Knight Rises fans gave mixed reports, via Twitter, on turnout. ""This theater is kinda empty,"" noted one supposed Friday-night audience member from North Carolina. ""The Dark Knight Rises is not even close to sold out in Plainfield. The theater has a bunch of open seats,"" noted another, apparently from Indiana. But some, especially those claiming to be at IMAX theaters, reported lines and filled seats. ""Still a packed theater,"" read one tweet. PHOTOS: Bad Timing Alert! Movies With PR Nightmares In New York City on Saturday afternoon, Cesar Neciosupe of MovieWorld-Douglaston said his multiplex's Dark Knight Rises' opening-night numbers were strong, even if ""it looked like the later shows were a little less than expected."" He said concession sales were good, too, a sign that the movie played to actual people, and not just advance-ticket-buying no-shows. ""We'll see happens today,"" Neciosupe said, before being briefly interrupted to sell tickets to a customer—a customer buying tickets to The Dark Knight Rises. Prior to the Colorado shooting, which left 12 dead and 58 injured, the Christopher Nolan superhero movie was expected to make a run at The Avengers' unprecented $207.4 million opening-weekend record, or at least come close. A $170 million debut for The Dark Knight Rises, which is not available in 3-D and IMAX 3-D like The Avengers, would still put the film as the second-biggest three-day start in Hollywood history. Its opening day, less than half of which came from midnight Friday screenings, may be the third-biggest ever. The official silence from Warner Bros. on grosses will last all weekend. No official numbers will be reported until Monday, the studio said Friday. Other studios will follow suit, as will some box-office sites, such as BoxOffice.com, which, per editor Phil Contrino, will wait to report the studio-released numbers. BoxOfficeMojo.com, another leading box-office info site, hasn't noted any Dark Knight Rises numbers or published any tweets since the Colorado shooting. An email seeking comment was not returned.

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: DENVER—In a world where Amazon can track your next book purchase and you must show ID to buy some allergy medicine, James Holmes spent months stockpiling thousands of bullets and head-to-toe ballistic gear without raising any red flags with authorities. The suspect in the mass theater shooting availed himself of an unregulated online marketplace that allows consumers to acquire some of the tools of modern warfare as if they were pieces of a new wardrobe. The Internet is awash in sites ranging from BulkAmmo.com, which this weekend listed a sale on a thousand rifle rounds for $335, to eBay, where bidding on one armored special forces helmet has risen to $799. “We’re different than other cultures,” said Dudley Brown, executive director of Rocky Mountain Gun Owners, which advocates for firearms owners’ rights. “We do allow Americans to possess the accoutrements that our military generally has.” Gun rights activists like Brown celebrate that freedom, but even some involved in the trade are troubled by how easily Holmes stocked up for his alleged rampage. Chad Weinman runs TacticalGear.com, which caters to police officers looking to augment their equipment, members of the military who don’t want to wait on permission from the bureaucracy for new combat gear, and hobbyists like survivalists and paintballers. The site receives “thousands” of orders daily, sometimes from entire platoons that are about to deploy to war zones. On July 2, Holmes placed a $306 order with the site for a combat vest, magazine holders and a knife, paying extra for expedited two-day shipping to his Aurora apartment. The order, Weinman said, didn’t stand out. “There’s a whole range of consumers who have an appetite for these products, and 99.9 percent of them are law-abiding citizens,” Weinman said. But he said that “it makes me sick” that Holmes bought material from him. He added that he doesn’t sell guns or ammunition and that he was “shocked” at the amount of bullets that Holmes allegedly bought online. Authorities say all of Holmes’ purchases were legal—and there is no official system to track whether people are stockpiling vast amounts of firepower. During a news conference in Philadelphia on Monday, Attorney General Eric Holder said the government has to think about the issues raised by Holmes’ alleged arsenal. “We have tried to come up with a better system with our instant background checks so that we have the ability to make sure that people who have emotional problems, people who have felony records, other people cannot get access to these kinds of weapons,” Holder said. There is no restriction on the sale of bullets in the United States, except for armor-piercing rounds, which can only be bought by law enforcement, said Ginger Colbrun, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Hence the proliferation of websites offering Amazon.com-style wish-lists for hollow-point rifle rounds or tracer bullets. There is a federal law that bars selling body armor to violent felons — which Holmes was not — but it is rarely used because there are is no requirement to check whether purchasers of the material have criminal records, according to Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign Against Gun Violence. Over four months, authorities said, Holmes received more than 50 packages at his Aurora apartment and the University of Colorado medical school, where he was studying neuroscience. As the boxes piled up, he began to shop for guns at sporting goods stores — because of the need to pass a background check to buy a firearm, they are still generally bought at brick-and-mortar locations. On May 22, law enforcement officials said Holmes bought a Glock pistol. Less than a week later, he upgraded to a shotgun. The following week he bought an AR-15 rifle, versions of which had been outlawed under the assault weapon ban in 1994. But that prohibition expired in 2004 and Congress, in a nod to the political clout of gun enthusiasts, did not renew it. Holmes also acquired explosive materials and equipment to rig his entire apartment with a complex series of booby traps that took authorities days to dismantle. Officials have not said how he obtained the material for the devices. Holmes capped off his gun purchases with another pistol on July 7. Authorities say that, 12 days later, Holmes bought a ticket to the midnight premiere of the Batman movie “The Dark Knight Rises” and entered the theater with the crowd, then slipped out the side door and returned dressed for battle. Oates said the shooter wore a ballistic helmet, gas mask, throat-protector, tactical vest and pants — such complete protective gear that responding officers almost mistook him for a member of the SWAT team. He lobbed gas canisters at the crowd, then opened fire. By the time police arrived, 90 seconds later, Holmes had shot dozens of people because his rifle was modified with a high-powered drum magazine that allowed him to fire immense amounts of bullets without reloading. “It was a pretty rapid pace of fire in that theater,” Oates said. The high-capacity magazine had also been prohibited under the assault weapon ban, and even though the federal law expired a few states outlaw the devices. Colorado, which has relatively permissive gun laws, does not. Colorado State Senator John Morse, a Democrat, said he wished the state barred large-capacity magazines and guns like the AR-15, but he does not expect the attack to make that likely. “The NRA has managed to convince the country that this has to happen to protect our Second Amendment rights,” Morse said. “As long as we let people buy these guns, we will bury our children.” Rep Carolyn McCarthy (D-NY), whose husband was killed in a mass shooting on the Long Island Railroad in 1993, has proposed a ban on high-capacity magazines in Congress but acknowledges it has little chance of passage. She said she was horrified by the shooting but most shocked by the other material that Holmes allegedly accumulated — the bullets and combat gear. “It befuddles me to think those things should be sold to the general public,” she said. Colorado State Rep. Mark Waller cautioned against trying to limit purchases of ammunition. He noted that Holmes reportedly bought 300 rounds for his shotgun. “My 13-year-old son and I go out to the shooting range all the time,” said Waller, a Republican. “I buy more than 300 rounds of shotgun shells when I do that.” He said there may be discussion of limiting the sale of the sort of protective clothing that Holmes allegedly donned. “Is that what the right to bear arms means, that you can purchase tactical gear to stop law enforcement from preventing you from perpetrating a crime?” Waller asked. “In the days and weeks to come, this is going to be a significant conversation.” But gun enthusiasts caution against over-reacting to the massacre. Brown, of Rocky Mountain Gun Owners, said he thinks citizen’s access to weaponry has made the United States “a stronger country.” And he doesn’t see anything unusual about many of Holmes’ alleged purchases. “If I only had 6,000 rounds for my AR-15s, I’d literally feel naked,” Brown said. Then he totaled up Holmes’ firearms purchases: “Two handguns, a shotgun and a rifle. That’s the average male in Colorado.” Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts As you comment, please be respectful of other commenters and other viewpoints.

More of the scores wounded in last Friday morning's shooting left hospitals in and around metropolitan Denver, though 12 remained. The last two patients of six that were at Children's Hospital Colorado were released on Thursday, according to the hospital. The final person being treated at Denver Health Hospital also went home Thursday, said spokesman Tony Encinias. One patient was discharged Thursday from the University of Colorado Hospital; four of the five who remain there are in critical condition, officials said. Five more shooting victims are being cared for at Aurora Medical Center, and two are in fair condition at Swedish Medical Center in Denver, the hospital said. For others, Thursday was time to mourn. That included scores who packed New Hope Baptist Church in Denver to remember Micayla Medek, a 23-year-old woman who had been working toward her college degree. Speakers at the service reflected on Medek's love of the color pink and Hello Kitty, her vibrant and positive spirit, and her belief that life and people, in fact, are a ""little weird."" ""I will push myself forward, and I will carry her with me every step of the way,"" said Thomas Luong, her roommate and friend since high school. Aurora Mayor Steve Hogan told Medek's parents, brother and sister that they had the support of thousands, if not millions. He said he had gotten messages from people on all seven continents, expressing their sympathy and solidarity. ""The world knows. The world will remember,"" said Hogan. ""We are all part of your family today. We will stay part of your family."" Aurora heroes: Three who gave their lives The man who authorities say opened fire in the theater during the midnight premiere of the Batman movie ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" killing Medek and 11 others, is in custody after being ordered held without bond. James Holmes, who identified himself to police as ""the Joker,"" made his first court appearance on Monday and will be formally charged July 30. Two court orders, signed by Arapahoe County District Judge William Sylvester, were posted on a court website Thursday noting restrictions on information the University of Colorado could release about Holmes. The 24-year-old had recently dropped out of a Ph.D program in neuroscience out of the school's campus in Aurora. Prosecutor in shootings has courted controversy The orders, in addition to a previous one issued Wednesday aimed at ""limiting pre-trial publicity"" at the defendant's request, endeavor to restrict the amount of publicly available information in order to assure ""the fairness of a trial."" Meanwhile, Holmes' former neighbors are being allowed back home for the first time since the shooting, Sgt. Cassidee Carlson of the Aurora Police Department said Wednesday evening. The tenants of the apartment building where Holmes had lived were rousted out of their apartments by police in the early hours of Friday shortly after the shooting. Warning signs of violence: What to do Holmes had booby-trapped his sparsely furnished third-floor, one-bedroom unit apartment with more than 30 homemade grenades and 10 gallons of gasoline, a law enforcement official who viewed video showing the apartment's interior has told CNN. The sophisticated setup was meant to harm, or possibly kill, anyone who entered -- and tested the skills of bomb squad members charged with clearing it, the official said. Stories of survival: Newborn a 'silver lining' Authorities on Monday also discovered a package in a mailroom at the University of Colorado -- Anschutz Medical Campus apparently sent by Holmes, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation said Wednesday. CBS News reported that the package was addressed to a psychologist at the university, which Holmes had attended. ""Sources say the letter was from a pent-up Holmes to one of his professors,"" the news organization reported. ""In it, he talked about shooting people and even included crude drawings of a gunman and his victims."" Some of his victims, both in and out of hospitals, faced a difficult recovery process and the prospect of daunting medical bills. How to help victims They include Caleb Medley, who lost an eye and suffered brain damage. His wife gave birth to their son Hugo Jackson Medley on Tuesday morning, and the University of Colorado Hospital said both baby and mother are doing well. Medley, who had been doing standup comedy routines in Denver and was working full-time at Target, had no health insurance, his brother Seth said. ""The surgeon came and talked to us and said he'd be in ICU at least a week,"" said Medley's friend, Michael West, who set up a website to help take care of medical bills and the needs of Medley's family. By Thursday evening, it had raised more than $313,000. Chloe Anderson has set up a similar fund for her sister, Petra Anderson, an aspiring musician who was also shot in the head. In a video posted Sunday asking for funds, Chloe Anderson notes that her mother was preparing to undergo cancer treatment later this month when Friday's shooting occurred. ""My sister's hospital bills on top of that are making the financial reality look pretty daunting,"" she says. ""So that's why we are reaching out to you -- the people who have already asked us what they can do to help."" By Wednesday evening, that fund had received more than $184,000 with a goal of $250,000. Money is also streaming in to GivingFirst.org, which is accepting donations for the shooting victims and their relatives.  By Tuesday, the amount had reached almost $2 million, Gov. John Hickenlooper said. Victims remembered through poignant stories ""The needs will be great and we look forward to seeing the fund grow exponentially,"" he said. ""This money will help those impacted by this tragedy begin to recover and rebuild their lives."" Hickenlooper said donors include Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures, co-producers of ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Sources at Warner Bros. studios told CNN the company made a ""substantial"" donation. Warner Bros., a subsidiary of CNN's parent company Time Warner, would not divulge how much money it was giving out of respect for the victims, the sources said. Dispatch: We need rescue in theater 9 Several hospitals were also making efforts to minimize the financial burden. Children's Hospital Colorado said in a statement it will use its charity program and donations to cover medical expenses for victims who don't have insurance, as well as waive co-pays and deductible-related expenses for those with insurance. HealthOne, the health care system that includes the Medical Center of Aurora and Swedish Medical Center, pledged to ""eliminate personal financial responsibility for hospital charges as appropriate."" And Denver Health said it will evaluate each patient ""on a case-by-case basis"" and discount bills by 70% for those unable to pay. Focusing on the victims, not the shooter"

New evidence: Holmes received 50 packages in the four months prior to the shooting at a Colorado movie theater. Loading... July 23, 2012 As the suspected gunman in the Colorado theater massacre heads to his first court appearance, authorities have disclosed that he is refusing to cooperate and that it could take months to learn what prompted the horrific attack on midnight moviegoers at a Batman film premiere. James Holmes has been held in solitary confinement at an Arapahoe County detention facility but will be moved Monday to a next-door courtroom for a 9:30 a.m. MDT (11:30 am EDT) hearing, where the charges against him of suspicion of first degree murder will be read. Holmes has been assigned a public defender and Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates said that the 24-year-old former doctoral student has ""lawyered up"" since his arrest early Friday, following the shooting at an Aurora theater that left 12 dead and 58 wounded, some critically. ""He's not talking to us,"" the chief said. Holmes has been held without bond at the lockup in Centennial, Colo., about 13 miles from the Aurora theater. He will be advised of the charges against him, and he could also face additional counts of aggravated assault and weapons violations. On Sunday, officials at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus were looking into whether Holmes used his position in a graduate program to collect hazardous materials, but school officials weren't saying whether they knew he was anything more than a hard-working student. Police have said that Holmes began buying guns at Denver-area stores nearly two months before Friday's shooting and that he received at least 50 packages in four months at his home and at school. While the university disclosed that it was cooperating with police in the case, that disclosure was one of the few it has made three days after the massacre. It remained unclear whether Holmes' professors and other students at his 35-student Ph.D. program noticed anything unusual about his behavior. His reasons for quitting the program in June, just a year into the five- to seven-year program, also remained a mystery. Holmes recently took an intense, three-part oral exam that marks the end of the first year. Those who do well continue with their studies and shift to full-time research, while those who don't do well meet with advisers and discuss their options, including retaking the exam. University officials would not say if he passed, citing privacy concerns. The university said Holmes gave no reason for his withdrawal, a decision he made in June. Holmes was not allowed access from the institution after his withdrawal, which was ""standard operating procedure"" because he was no longer affiliated with the school, said Jacque Montgomery, a spokeswoman for the medical school. Holmes had no contact with university police, she said. The university declined to release any details of his academic record, citing privacy concerns, and at least two dozen professors and other staff declined to speak with The Associated Press. Some said they were instructed not to talk publicly about Holmes in a blanket email sent to university employees. Montgomery said police have told the school to not talk about Holmes. The university took down the website for its graduate neuroscience program on Saturday. Amid the continuing investigation of Holmes and his background, Sunday was a day for healing and remembrance in Aurora, with the community holding a prayer vigil and with President Barack Obama arriving to visit with families of the victims. Obama said he told the families that ""all of America and much of the world is thinking about them."" He met with them at the University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora, which treated 23 of the people injured in the mass shooting; 10 remain there, seven hurt critically. Congregations across Colorado prayed for the shooting victims and their relatives. Elderly churchgoers at an aging Presbyterian church within walking distance near Holmes' apartment joined in prayer, though none had ever met him. Several thousand gathered for healing at the vigil Sunday night, where a banner said, ""Angels Walk With Those Who Grieve."" ""You're not alone, and you will get through it,"" said the Rev. Kenneth Berve, pastor at Grant Avenue United Methodist Church and a witness to Friday's horrors. ""We can't let fear and anger take control of us."" Meanwhile, the owner of a gun range told the AP that Holmes applied to join the club last month but never became a member because of his behavior and a ""bizarre"" message on his voice mail. He emailed an application to join the Lead Valley Range in Byers on June 25 in which he said he was not a user of illegal drugs or a convicted felon, said owner Glenn Rotkovich. When Rotkovich called to invite him to a mandatory orientation the following week, he said he heard a message on Holmes' voice mail that was ""bizarre — guttural, freakish at best."" He left two other messages but eventually told his staff to watch out for Holmes at the July 1 orientation and not to accept him into the club, Rotkovich said. Ritchie Duong, a friend who has known Holmes for more than a decade, told the Los Angeles Times that in high school he liked to play cards and video games. They both attended undergraduate school at the University of California, Riverside, where they saw each other weekly to watch the TV show ""Lost."" Duong last saw Holmes in December when they met for dinner in Los Angeles and saw a movie. His friend seemed fine, he told the newspaper. Academics came easily to Holmes both at high school and in college, Duong said. ""I had one college class with him, and he didn't even have to take notes or anything. He would just show up to class, sit there, and around test time he would always get an 'A,'"" said Duong, 24. The pastor for the family of the suspect also recalled a shy boy who was driven to succeed academically. ""He wasn't an extrovert at all. If there was any conversation, it would be because I initiated it, not because he did,"" said Jerald Borgie, senior pastor of Penasquitos Lutheran Church. Borgie said he never saw the suspect mingle with others his age at church. He last spoke with Holmes about six years ago. ""He had some goals. He wanted to succeed, he wanted to go out, and he wanted to be the best,"" Borgie said. ""He took pride in his academic abilities. A good student. He didn't brag about it."" During the attack early Friday, Holmes allegedly set off gas canisters and used a semiautomatic rifle, a shotgun and a pistol to open fire on theater-goers, Oates said. Holmes had bought the weapons at local gun stores in the past two months. He recently purchased 6,000 rounds of ammunition over the Internet, the chief said. The gunman's semiautomatic assault rifle jammed during the attack, forcing him to switch to another gun with less firepower, a federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press. That malfunction and weapons switch might have saved some lives. Oates said a 100-round ammunition drum was found in the theater but said he did not know whether it jammed or emptied. Investigators found a Batman mask inside Holmes' apartment after they finished clearing the home of booby traps and ammunition, a law enforcement official close to the investigation said Sunday on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media. The shooting was the worst in the U.S. since the Nov. 5, 2009, attack at Fort Hood, Texas. An Army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 soldiers and civilians and wounding more than two dozen others. Across the street from the movie theater, Greg Zanis, of Aurora, Ill., who placed 15 crosses near Columbine High School after a 1999 massacre there, returned to Colorado with 12 crosses for the victims of Friday's shooting.

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in.

By
      
        Rosie Gray Posted on July 20, 2012, at 4:06 p.m. ET President Obama leaves the stage after addressing the Aurora shootings. National leaders have released statement after statement today expressing condolences for the victims of last night's mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado. But no politicians — apart from, notably, New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg — has called for an increase in focus on gun laws. That silence is a relatively recent product of decades of heated gun debates, and of gun rights' activists largely winning an argument over whether such massacres should be reflexively blamed on the weapons. There hasn't been major new gun control legislation since 1994, and Bill Clinton's efforts to expand gun control in the aftermath of the 1999 Columbine High School shootings fizzled. In interviews, even gun control advocates said such discussion can seem exploitative; it can also be premature in the midst of developing news about the identity of the shooter, the victims, and the motive. ""I know in the past when I worked in [Senator Chuck] Schumer’s office, when there would be a crime such as this, our first questions would be what kind of guns, how did the person get the gun, did the person get it at a gun market,"" said Jim Kessler, formerly of Americans for Gun Safety. ""Not every one of these crimes has a nexus with a gun law that needs to be corrected."" Kessler said crimes like these often ""take on unique personalities"" in the days and weeks after the event, and politicians don't want to make a bad call on what that personality will be. ""The Giffords shooting was about the dialogue in America,"" Kessler said, referring to last year's attack on Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. ""Virginia Tech became about mental health. Some previous ones were about assault weapons."" ""It’s hard to predict on the first day exactly the personality it’s going to take, and a lot of times it has to do with who the victims are and who the perpetrator is,"" Kessler said. The gun control movement is, in fact, split on this question. During his weekly radio address, the blunt New York mayor said, ""You know, soothing words are nice, but maybe it’s time that the two people who want to be President of the United States stand up and tell us what they are going to do about it, because this is obviously a problem across the country."" ""No matter where you stand on the Second Amendment, no matter where you stand on guns, we have a right to hear from both of them concretely, not just in generalities – specifically what are they going to do about guns?"" Bloomberg said. Most other politicians have been more reticent. President Obama didn't refer to gun laws during his address in Florida this morning, nor did Mitt Romney in New Hampshire. And some gun control advocates, this is a source of frustration. ""I don’t know if there’s any tragedy, no matter how horrific, that could make the house act on gun laws,"" said Ladd Everitt, communications director for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. He criticized Obama for not addressing the issue. ""The sad thing is that Obama knows better,"" Everitt said. ""When he was campaigning he did support reinstituting the assault weapons ban. Among the four guns was an AK-47 style rifle."" Dan Gross, president of The Brady Campaign, released a statement this morning dismissing politicians' words of condolence and demanding action. ""This tragedy is another grim reminder that guns are the enablers of mass killers and that our nation pays an unacceptable price for our failure to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people,"" Gross said. ""As someone who has suffered the lasting impact of gun violence, and President of Brady, I can tell you that we don’t want sympathy. We want action."" On the other side of the gun control debate, there's been either a resistance to talking about gun laws, just like on the left, or support of concealed carry laws. Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert this morning: ""It does make me wonder, with all those people in the theater, was there nobody that was carrying a gun that could have stopped this guy more quickly?"" ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families and the community,"" said NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam. ""NRA will not have any further comment until all the facts are known.""

But several lawmakers have demanded that the government not shy about tackling the legislative issue. Mayor Michael Bloomberg set the tone when he urged the two presidential candidates to outline their policies with respect to federal gun laws. And now, Sen. Frank Lautenberg's (D-N.J.) office is saying that he plans to reintroduce legislation that would curtail the ability of a shooter to fire at length without reloading. ""If reports are correct and a high-capacity gun magazine was used to commit these awful murders, Senator Lautenberg will absolutely renew his effort to limit the availability of this dangerous firearm attachment,"" Lautenberg's communications director Caley Gray told The Huffington Post. Lautenberg, one of the most vocal gun control advocates in the Senate, introduced a bill to limit high-capacity magazines following the shooting of former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. The shooter in that instance fired his gun more than 30 times without having to reload. The bill went nowhere. Early reports have suggested that the accused shooter in Aurora, James Holmes, also used a high-capacity magazine on his assault rifle.

Holmes' public defender, in a hearing on media access to court files in the case, repeatedly made references to his client's unspecified mental illness, giving the first clear sign that Holmes' lawyers might be considering an insanity defense. ""He tried to get help with his mental illness,"" said of his client, a 24-year-old former neuroscience graduate student at the University of Colorado who faces 12 counts of first-degree murder and 116 counts of attempted murder. Holmes is accused of bursting into a midnight screening of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" in the Denver suburb of Aurora and opening fire in the crowded theater, killing 12 people and wounding 58 others. Holmes, who seemed to have not shaved for days, appeared in court on Thursday wearing maroon prison garb and shackled at his hands and ankles, with his dyed hair fading to pink in some places from its original reddish-orange. He seemed alert but disinterested in his third appearance in a Colorado courtroom since the July 20 mass shooting. He mostly stared straight ahead and did not talk to his lawyers. ""Mental illness is the only possible defense available in this case. It is hardly a whodunit,"" Craig Silverman, a former chief deputy district attorney in Denver who now practices law privately, told Reuters. ""By saying it repeatedly in open court, Holmes' lawyers provide the sound bite that will be the basis of the defense,"" he said. ""It wasn't just for the court to hear but it was for the people in the courtroom and for people in the press to report."" Court papers filed by defense attorneys two weeks ago said Holmes had been a patient of the medical director for student mental health services on campus before he filed paperwork to drop out of the competitive graduate program. That psychiatrist, Dr. Lynne Fenton, reported Holmes to a campus threat assessment team and a campus police officer over concerns about her patient, according to media reports. Lawyers for Fenton and the campus police officer declined to comment to Reuters on those reports. The university has also declined to comment on the reports but said it had hired a former federal prosecutor to probe its dealings with Holmes. As in many states, mental health care providers in Colorado must warn authorities of potential violent behavior only when a patient has communicated a serious threat of imminent physical violence against a specific target. PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY Judge William Sylvester said he would consider a request by 20 media organizations to unseal and make public documents detailing the murder case against Holmes, and would issue a written ruling later. Lawyers representing news organizations sought the release of the papers in a written motion that said sealing them ""undermines our nation's firm commitment to the transparency and public accountability of the criminal justice system."" In the motion, lawyers for the media outlets, including The New York Times Co., The Associated Press, The Denver Post, and CBS News, argued that the U.S. Constitution and state case law requires a presumption of openness. Thomson Reuters is not a party to the motion. In most court cases, documents are available to the public. Both prosecutors and defense lawyers objected, saying that it was too early to open the file because the investigation was still ongoing. ""The harm, judge, is very real with the release of the file at this point,"" defense attorney King said. Media lawyer Steven Zansberg argued that the decision to close the bulk of the file made it difficult for the public to understand what happened during the shooting, and why. The media has recently been successful in getting some documents unsealed in the case of Jared Loughner, who was charged last year in a deadly shooting spree that killed six people and gravely wounded Representative Gabrielle Giffords. As the Holmes case gets further along, there may be other parties who express concerns over what is sealed. Attorneys representing families of the victims may insist that certain photographs from the crime scene not be released, for example. Holmes is being held without bond and in solitary confinement at the Arapahoe County jail.

More often than not, ""evil"" was made mention of; or similarly malevolent imagery invoked. President Barack Obama lamented that, ""[s]uch violence, such evil is senseless. It's beyond reason."" Mitt Romney called the shooting ""a few moments of evil"" in Colorado. Of course, this type of language is tempting, and understandable, in the wake of a senseless tragedy. (What kind of person does what James Holmes stands accused of doing, except for an evil one?) It's also, however, problematic if you're trying to have a conversation about mass violence, as was made clear when a number of anti-gun control politicians added their own wrinkle to the rhetoric. Governor John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), for example, opined that ""[i]f it was not one weapon, it would have been another, and [Holmes] was diabolical."" Senator Ron Johnson (R- Wisc.) emphasized that ""[t]his isn't an issue about guns. This is really just an issue about sick, demented individuals."" Romney, in rejecting the idea that stricter regulations would have helped, insisted that ""[o]ur challenge is not the laws. Our challenge is people who, obviously, are distracted from reality and do unthinkable, unimaginable, inexplicable things."" What's interesting about each of these three statements is how completely they manage to sidestep the issue of gun control. In focusing on the nefarious dimensions of the crime, they've each managed to downplay the importance of guns in one of the worst individual acts of gun violence in U.S. history. By treating the shooter as though he's simply an evil man -- and evil, of course, is irreducible, irrational, operates not on reason but perversions of morality -- they've also reduced the actual shooting to a force of nature, beyond our capacity to understand. The rhetorical acrobatics are on full display in a Daily News column this morning from conservative columnist (and avowed gun owner) S.E. Cupp: ""Evil is difficult to deconstruct. It's unpredictable and manifests in unimaginable ways, often more horrifying than anything fiction could invent. And evil acts are nearly impossible to prevent."" ""The debate over gun control that inevitably stirs after a tragedy like Aurora is just as ineffective at dealing with unmitigated evil,"" Cupp writes. ""That's because evil will find a way."" She then goes on to call for ""targeted responses,"" rather than ""broad and indiscriminate ones,"" but gives no indication as to what those targeted responses might be, or why more institutional approaches have, as she claims, failed. That's because the argument Cupp, et al., are employing is less about judging the validity of gun control arguments -- that is, considering their merits and rendering a conclusion based on facts -- than they are about setting a mood, and driving home a point about ""evil."" In embracing this view of the Colorado shooting, Cupp and co. are endorsing, explicitly or otherwise, the notion that the best response to violence is violence. (As an aside, it's worth noting here that Colorado gun sales are up ""sharply"" since Friday's events.) At the same time, such an attitude totally ignores the shooter's motivations for mass violence, and the means by which he was able to achieve it; renders them, in fact, secondary and insignificant when compared with his twisted, nigh demonic, character. It ascribes to the shooter power he never actually had. It does all of these things while explicating barely any of them, and it disregards counter-arguments without having to address their merits, because no matter what we do, ""evil will find a way."" On the whole, positions like this are fatalistic and counterproductive -- but even more than that, they're intellectually lazy. They evince a much cleaner, and much wronger, notion of the world than we might come to from engaging with the full set of information we have about the shooter. As Gawker's Max Read put it on Friday: ""James Holmes did not materialize in a movie theater in Aurora this morning, free of any relationship to law and authority and the structures of power in this country."" The shooter was, in part, a product of his environment -- an incredibly complex, knotty, multivalent environment -- that ultimately drove him to shoot 70 people in a movie theater. The more we're able to understand the root causes of these types of events, the better we'll be able to prepare for the possibility of such a disaster in the future. On the one hand, this means trying understand how the shooter ended up in the position he was in; whether the institutions around him could have done more to alleviate whatever dangerous tendencies were roiling inside of him. It also means examining the role that existing gun laws and gun culture played in facilitating the massacre. To do that, we'll have to dispatch with retrograde notions of good and evil in favor of a more nuanced approach. That means we have to allow for the possibility that evil isn't indefatigable; and that stricter regulations might possibly have saved the lives of the 12 people killed in Aurora last Friday -- or the thousands more killed by guns every year in the United States. Perhaps, as gun-rights advocates would suggest, the second amendment actually is our best defense against people like the Aurora theater shooter. They should prove it. If we're going to have a national conversation about the Aurora shootings, we have to have an actual conversation. To ignore salient details about the event -- to argue that it's ""too soon"" or ""ineffective"" to burden ourselves with such discussions (evil being what it is) -- betrays a willing and contemptible ignorance.

The trade group has also cut checks to her campaign — contributing $15,000 to her reelection efforts, including $5,000 this cycle. But nobody is talking about the contributions today. Asked about it, Biggert's office told PI that NAMIC will be among other voices from the insurance sector that are testifying. ""NAMIC’s testimony will offer insight into the perspective of its 1,400 member companies with employees and customers in communities across the country,"" Biggert spokesman Zachary Cikanek emailed. For its part, NAMIC SVP of federal and political affairs Jimi Grande also tells PI that Biggert has been a proponent of their issues as a leader on the National Flood Insurance Program reform. ""On this and many other issues, she has been a model of bipartisanship and common sense, and we appreciate her continued thoughtful oversight of Dodd-Frank Act implementation,"" Grande said. NAMIC has contributed $168,000 this cycle to House Republicans and $32,500 to House Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. PI SCOOPLET … NRSC, K STREET POWWOW AT ST.

CAMPAIGN SPENDING FREE-FOR-ALL BUT FULL TRANSPARENCY, SAYS GARY JOHNSON: Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson is one of the few White House seekers of any note to accept public presidential campaign finance matching funds this year from a system that most others, including Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, have completely written off. But that’s not stopping the former New Mexico governor, who also ran for president this cycle as a Republican, from advocating for a radically revamped campaign finance system that’s devoid of current contribution limits. “Make contributions unlimited but make them completely transparent,” Johnson told PI Monday afternoon during a visit to the POLITICO mothership in Arlington, Va. Johnson also said that his own campaign shouldn’t be underestimated. “We think we can win this race with $50 million.” He did note, however, that his fundraising overtures have been rebuffed by perhaps the nation’s most prominent (small “l”) libertarians of all — brothers David and Charles Koch — who have generally funded Republican political causes. “We reached out to them a bunch … never met with them,” Johnson acknowledged, saying the brothers have not returned the campaign’s messages. Still, Johnson said, “I’m a Koch brothers fan,” calling them the “most giving of any libertarians.” WATCHDOG GROUP FILES FEC COMPLAINT AGAINST CROSSROADS GPS: Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington says the conservative nonprofit organization Crossroads GPS — the affiliate of Karl Rove-backed super PAC American Crossroads — is committing “direct and serious violations” of the Federal Election Campaign Act. In a complaint filed with the Federal Election Commission, CREW focuses on Crossroads GPS ads aired last month in North Dakota, Nebraska and Virginia. Specifically, CREW argues the spots are not issue ads but independent political expenditures that expressly advocate for the defeat of Democratic political candidates, and, therefore, Crossroads GPS should be required to reveal information to the FEC about its finances. Crossroads GPS spokesman Jonathan Collegio, however, fired back in an email to PI: “This is a baseless complaint from a group run by partisans, which serves partisan causes under the dubious guise of charity.” Read the full CREW complaint here: http://bit.ly/OWIR0T ** A message from the National Chamber Foundation: Canada has seen an economic transformation in the last 20 years.

84346802,2012-07-25 21:27:29,What Do We Mean By &#8220;Evil&#8221;?,http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2012/07/james-holmes-aurora-and-the-meaning-of-evil.html,en,False,,1101,New Yorker,http://www.newyorker.com/,"To revisit this article, select My Account, then View saved stories To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories By Rollo Romig In the hours after the mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, last week, one word cut through the partisan responses to the massacre, and that word was “evil.” “Such evil is senseless, beyond reason,” President Obama said. Mitt Romney spoke of the lives “shattered in a few moments—a few moments of evil.” John Boehner described the killer’s act as “evil we cannot comprehend.” What does it mean, in the twenty-first century, to call a person like James Holmes “evil”? In centuries past, “evil” was used to describe all manner of ills, from natural disasters to the impulse to do wrong. Today it’s used mostly to emphasize the gravity of a crime, trading on the term’s aura of religious finality. The meaning of “evil” has become increasingly unsettled even as it has narrowed, yet the word has proven to be an unshakable unit in our moral lexicon. Why does “evil” persist? In the book “Evil in Modern Thought,” from 2002, Susan Neiman traces philosophy’s struggles with evil over several hundred years. The book is structured around two events that Neiman considers the “central poles” of the modern era, both of which threw philosophers’ understanding of evil into confusion: Lisbon and Auschwitz. In 1755, at the dawn of the Enlightenment, an earthquake destroyed Lisbon, then one of the major cities of Europe. In the era before that disaster, evil was thought to come in three varieties—natural, metaphysical, or moral—and inquiry into the concept of evil was dominated by theodicy, which is the attempt to reconcile a good and omnipotent deity with evil in the world. As Neiman shows, theodicy never really recovered from the tremors. Such vast, meaningless destruction made it much more difficult to think of natural and metaphysical calamities as acts of God. Few but religious fundamentalists would continue to use the morally inflected word “evil” to describe natural disasters. The problem of evil became a secular one, and the philosophy of evil came to focus on the moral category: the evil that men do. In the post-theodicy years that followed Lisbon, Neiman writes, attempts to understand evil fell into three main strains: Hegel tried to explain evils as necessary steps in the march of history; Nietzsche argued that evil is a problem we brought on ourselves, by inventing moral categories that don’t reflect the ways of the natural world; while a third view insisted that evil was a clear moral category of its own, defined by acts of intentional malevolence. But just like the old theodicies, these three ways of thinking, Neiman argues, were devastated by the second main event of her study: Auschwitz, a word she uses as shorthand for the collective horrors of the Second World War. Since Auschwitz, Evil Studies is a discipline in tatters, particularly the school of thought that argues that all evil is born of malevolence. As Neiman writes, “Precisely the belief that evil actions require evil intentions allowed totalitarian regimes to convince people to override moral objections that might otherwise have functioned”—heinous acts are all too easily rationalized by loyalty to supposedly higher values, and personal feelings of guilt are all too unreliable. The rise of brain science and genetics has thrown further doubt on what intention and will even mean. Few philosophers of any school wish to confront the problem of evil directly anymore; it’s a concept too confused by old arguments that have been overtaken by events. Despite the confusion of the philosophers, the word “evil” is still in common use. Neiman herself is understandably reluctant to offer a single, narrow definition of her own for what “evil” means today, but what she does suggest is a useful description of what effect evil has: calling something “evil,” she writes, “is a way of marking the fact that it shatters our trust in the world.” Evil is both harmful and inexplicable, but not just that; what defines an evil act is that it is permanently disorienting for all those touched by it. However it is used, the word “evil” continues to have a “potent, frequently dangerous, emotional charge,” the philosopher Peter Dews writes, in his 2007 study “The Idea of Evil.” “It hints at dark forces, at the obscure, unfathomable depths of human motivation.” This vestigial metaphysical tinge, he admits, gives the word an antiquated feel: “It suggests a vision of the universe as the stage for a battle of supernatural powers, which human beings may ally themselves with, but which they cannot ultimately control. It threatens the modern, enlightened conception of the world as moving towards a just and peaceable future, one which can be shaped by human will and intention.” But that’s not to say that “evil” is outmoded. The appeal of “evil,” Dews argues, “is that it offers an experience of moral depth which otherwise so often seems lacking in our lives”—a solid ballast in the fog of moral relativism. The word “evil” no longer suggests possession by a satanic or any other kind of supernatural force. Evil requires agency; one can’t be born with it. Terry Eagleton writes in “On Evil,” his rather flippant 2010 consideration of the dark side, “If some people really are born evil … they are no more responsible for this condition than being born with cystic fibrosis.” Evil is sometimes used as a synonym for sociopathy or psychopathy, but as Jon Ronson showed in his recent book “The Psychopath Test,” those terms are nearly as uncertain and subjective as “evil” is. (See the case of Anders Breivik: an initial psychiatric assessment found him insane, but that finding was reversed after complaints, including from Breivik himself, that insanity would annul his culpability.) And in one sense, sociopathy and evil are opposites. Calling someone a sociopath is a way of explaining his or her actions, if not justifying them. We might recommend hospitalization rather than imprisonment for a sociopath who committed terrible crimes. Evil doesn’t get therapy—it gets locked away as far and for as long as possible. To call the Aurora killer evil is to insist that he was able to choose between inflicting tremendous harm or not doing so, and chose harm. But while an evil act can’t be involuntary, evil doesn’t have to be the explicit objective of the one who commits it. Think of Jerry Sandusky, the shock of whose crimes had more to with the aggressive persistence he brought to satisfying his terrible desires than with any sense that he was motivated primarily by malevolence; Jeffrey Toobin was not alone in calling him “an evil, evil man.” But if evil is not always the product of an intention to destroy, it is always the product of a failure of intent: it’s the lack of an attempt to restrain oneself from inflicting what one knows will be great harm. The danger of a word like “evil” is that it is absolute. The “intense semantic charge” of the word “evil,” Peter Dews writes, “lends itself to exploitation” by whoever uses it. To play the “evil” card is to cut off all debate, and to say that any effort toward rehabilitation or reintegration wouldn’t be worth the risk or heartache. The mark of “evil” demands permanent banishment or death, and we call perpetrators “evil” to relieve the guilt we might feel in applying such sanctions. And yet to try to explain evil, as with brain scans or social conditions, smacks intolerably of absolving it. It suggests that evil is part of the natural order of things, a conclusion that our sense of trust in the world yearns to reject. “Evil” has become the word we apply to perpetrators who we’re both unable and unwilling to do anything to repair, and for whom all of our mechanisms of justice seem unequal: it describes the limits of what malevolence we’re able to bear. In the end, it’s a word that says more about the helplessness of the accuser than it does the transgressor. As Dews writes, “Basic notions of offence and punishment, of transgression and forgiveness, seem to lose their grip in the face of profound, far reaching desecrations of the human.” For those kinds of crimes, “evil” is still the only word we’ve got.

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: For the legal team defending the suspect in a deadly Tucson mass shooting, reaching a plea deal was just one step. Convincing a judge that Jared Lee Loughner is competent enough to enter a plea depends on how he behaves in court Tuesday, Aug. 7.
The 23-year-old college dropout is scheduled to attend a hearing during which his attorneys and prosecutors will try to persuade U.S. District Court Judge Larry A. Burns that Loughner is no longer mentally unfit for trial.
Experts had concluded that Loughner suffers from schizophrenia, and officials at a federal prison have forcibly medicated him with psychotropic drugs for more than a year.
A court-appointed psychiatrist is expected to testify Tuesday that he is competent to enter a plea.
If Burns agrees, as legal experts expect, a formal change-of-plea hearing will follow. That’s when those in the court will hear from Loughner at length for the first time, as the judge questions him about the agreement and changing his plea to guilty.
Burns may ask Loughner to recite his actions in his own words, but either his lawyer or the federal prosecutor could just read the facts of the January 2011 shooting spree at a Tucson supermarket, where then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was holding a meet-and-greet with constituents.
Either way, Loughner will be asked to acknowledge that he shot and killed six people, including the top federal judge in Arizona, and wounded 13 others, including Giffords. He’ll need to convince Burns he understands what is going on, what he’s doing and what he did.
Mark Kelly, Giffords’ husband, released a statement early Tuesday indicating they have been in contact with prosecutors and support the deal.
“We don’t speak for all of the victims or their families, but Gabby and I are satisfied with this plea agreement. The pain and loss caused by the events of January 8, 2011, are incalculable. Avoiding a trial will allow us — and we hope the whole Southern Arizona community — to continue with our recovery and move forward with our lives,” Kelly wrote.
Still, Loughner could break down, change his mind about pleading guilty or show so little understanding of what he’s doing that Burns rejects the plea, lawyers not involved in the case said Monday.
“The fact that there is this planned change of plea is no guarantee that it will go forward,” said Paul Charlton, a former U.S. attorney for Arizona. “There are any number of things that would happen that would either cause it to be removed from the calendar or not go forward at all.”
The plea agreement that is expected to be made public on Tuesday would see Loughner sentenced to life in prison, taking the possibility of the death penalty off the table in the federal case, a person familiar with the case told the Associated Press on Saturday. The person was not authorized to discuss the case publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.
An agreement that would spare Loughner the death penalty offers something for both sides, said Quin Denvir, a California defense attorney who has worked with Loughner attorney Judy Clarke on the case against Ted Kaczynski.
Prosecutors would avoid a potentially lengthy and costly trial and appeal, knowing that the defendant will be locked up for life. Clarke managed to avoid the death penalty for other high-profile clients such as Kaczynski and Eric Rudolph, who bombed abortion clinics in the late 1990s and Atlanta’s Olympic park in 1996.
News of an agreement hasn’t brought negative reaction from victims’ families, and some said they support the government’s decision.
The top prosecutor in southern Arizona’s Pima County said last year that she may file state charges in the case that could carry the death penalty. An official in the prosecutor’s office, Amelia Craig Cramer, declined to comment, saying the office did not have an active prosecution against Loughner.
Denvir said it was possible that the plea agreement calls for the state to avoid pursuing criminal charges against Loughner, though that’s not a given.
“Ideally (as a defense attorney) you’d like to have it resolved all at once, but sometimes you have to take one at a time,” he said.
The decision to spare Loughner a federal death sentence makes sense, said Dale Baich, a federal public defender in Phoenix who handles capital case appeals and isn’t involved in the case.
“As time went on and there were numerous evaluations, I think everybody had a better understanding of Mr. Loughner’s mental illness,” Baich said.
He added: “It appears that he will need to be treated for the rest of his life in order to remain competent.”

By ANNA PALMER and DAVE LEVINTHAL 08/07/2012 02:14 PM EDT Presented by HCA Healthcare With Tarini Parti and William Bergstrom PI SCOOPLET … ROW OVER CAMPAIGN FINANCE DISCLOSURE GETS LITIGIOUS: The  Federal Election Commission wants to know why  Dan Eichenbaum, a North Carolina doctor who earlier this year dropped plans to run for Congress as a Republican, hasn’t filed mandatory campaign finance disclosures needed to shut down his campaign committee. Simple, the campaign wrote the FEC this week: The D.C.-based consulting firm Base Connect is holding hostage needed information about campaign mailings and subcontractor services over a contract dispute. “We have contacted an attorney in Virginia, but as of this date he has had no results in obtaining the information. Our records have been reported to the best of our ability,” Eichenbaum’s campaign told the FEC, adding that Base Connect at one point held nearly $22,000 in an escrow account and “will not give us the disbursement record in order to report these expenses and clear this account.” But Base Connect Chief Operating Officer  Michael Centanni tells PI that Eichenbaum’s campaign breached its contract with the firm by not paying for work that had already been done. “We told him we would not do any work for him, including the FEC filings, until we get paid,” Centanni explained. “We never heard from him again.” Is Centanni’s firm going to take legal action against Eichenbaum’s campaign in an attempt to recoup the money? “Yes we are,” he said. “That he seems disinterested in any arrangement has forced our hand.” HOUSE LEADERS HELP CRAVAACK: Freshman Rep. Chip Cravaack (R-Minn.) is getting some fundraising help from some big ticket GOP names, including  House  Speaker John Boehner  and National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Pete Sessions of Texas. Boehner is heading to the Land of 10,000 Lakes Saturday for a roundtable and brunch at Hotel Sofitel in Bloomington, Minn. Cost to attend: $5,000 per person and $10,000 per couple for the roundtable; the brunch is just $1,000 per person and $2,000 per couple. Sessions is doing a breakfast and briefing at the Minneapolis Club. Cost to attend: $1,000 individual and political action committee. CONVENTIONS AREN’T COMPLETELY ABOUT POLITICAL FUNDRAISING: There are actually some charitable events on the party circuit, too, even if they’re chocked with political overtones. Exhibit A: The “ Salute to the House and Senate Energy and Commerce Committees” the week of the Republican National Convention at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Fla. “Take the field for batting, fielding and socializing … meet baseball legends and enjoy a day at the air-conditioned ballpark,” an invitation states. The proceeds don’t benefit a political candidate or committee, but rather, the Rays Baseball Foundation, which “awards grants to various community groups, including the Boys and Girls Club of Plant City and Big Brothers and Big Sisters of the Sun Coast.” Packages range from $2,500 to $50,000.

A hearty Tuesday to you, PI Nation, as 230 years ago today, then-Gen. George Washington created the “ Badge of Military Merit” — a heart-shaped swatch of silk bordered with a silver binding that honored “any singularly meritorious action.” Although largely unused throughout the 1800s, what would come to be known as the Purple Heart became regularly awarded beginning in the 1930s and today is one of the most recognizable military medals in the United States.

Michael Daly reports. Special Correspondent Anybody who watched Seinfeld would recognize Tom’s Restaurant in upper Manhattan as one of the hit show’s landmarks. Almost nobody knows that during all the time Seinfeld was aired, and to this very day, the scientists of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies led by Dr. James Hansen, were laboring directly upstairs from Tom’s, pursuing what may prove to be one of the most important investigations of our time. Jerry Seinfeld’s TV comedy was famously called a show about nothing, yet millions still watch the reruns 14 years after its final episode. Hansen’s continuing work is about something as important as global warming, but the public barely seemed to notice the new study he and his co-author released this week regarding the recent extremes in temperature. Never mind that the study, “Perception of Climate Change,” links global warming—and therefore human activity—to the record-breaking droughts and wildfires of late, along with the unusually intense thunderstorms and tornadoes. Never mind that global warming appears to be triggering a kind of global derangement. Forests burn, crops die, roads buckle, trees topple, power grids strain. One nuclear power plant nearly shut down because its cooling water is too hot to cool. Another discovers that the river level is falling to where there will be no water. Greenland’s ice melts at more than twice the usual rate, causing an iceberg the size of Manhattan to break off and drift into the sea. And when an eminent scientist presents a convincing case that we are complicit in it all, we pay less attention than to a Seinfeld episode that has aired so many times that fans can speak the lines along with the characters. The latest paper from the 71-year-old Hansen was presented Monday in a conference room at Columbia University’s Earth Institute, two blocks up Broadway from the little known Goddard Center and the world-famous Tom’s. Some press outlets that might have paid more attention were busy covering the latest mass shooting, this one by a white supremacist in a Sikh temple outside Milwaukee. Hansen brought along a pair of oversized dice he made almost a quarter-century ago, right after he testified before the U.S. Senate and introduced the country to a concept called global warming. He realized after he left the Capitol that summer day in 1988 that he would need a way to explain why his thesis was not disproved by the occasional season that was cooler than usual. Hansen colored the sides of the dice, some white to represent normal temperatures, others blue to represent cooler than normal, others red to represent unusually warm. Dice representing the period prior to 1980, when global warming did not yet have a significant effect, would have two white sides, two blue and two red. Rolling them over time would have produced an average variation in temperatures. That has changed even more rapidly than Hansen predicted so long ago that Seinfeld was still a year from premiering. “Four and a half sides of the dice are now red,” he said Monday. There still remained a chance of a cooler-than-normal season, but the odds were significantly greater that it would be warmer. “The dice are loaded,” Hansen said. And, with that also came an increased chance of extreme heat. Prior to 1980, between 0.1 and 0.2 percent of the planet suffered extreme heat. That has now risen to 10 percent. So, while the average temperature has risen a seemingly unalarming 1.5 degrees over the past century, the average area of the globe hit by extremes has increased some 100-fold in three decades. Here is the math by which what we once might have called the storm of the century or the flood of the century or the fire of the century now seems to come every year. The incidence of extreme heat has grown to where Hansen has covered one of the red sides of the climate dice with a photo of a wildfire. “I just put this on here this week,” he said Monday about the new die configuration whose significance is known only too well in this year in Colorado and Arizona and Oklahoma. This happened to be the same day that another division of NASA landed a rover, dubbed Curiosity, on Mars. Hansen had started out in science studying planetary atmospheres, Venus in particular. He then came to realize that he would do better to concentrate on his own native Earth. He told the Senate 24 years ago that effects induced by increased levels of greenhouse gases would lead to climate changes that eventually would become apparent to everybody. “As we now see, it has,” he said Monday, sounding as if he took no pleasure at all in being so right. A siren could be heard from the street outside—the sort you hear when you call in an emergency such as a heart attack or a house fire—or a maybe a mass shooting. None were wailing in response to Hansen’s warning that the well-being of the entire planet is at stake. “This is change occurring in a decadal times scale,” Hansen said. The siren faded into the sounds of the passing cars and buses that were themselves part of the emergency that Hansen’s paper described. Each passing vehicle was burning fossil fuel and adding to the blanket of carbon dioxide that is throwing our planet out of balance. Hansen noted that instead of significantly curtailing fossil-fuel use, we are seeking new sources in oil sands and hydrofracking—efforts whose environmental impact extend significantly beyond their extraction to their use. He suggested that what we need to do is make the companies pay the true cost of these fuels. “An honest price,” he said. That price is now coming to include multibillion-dollar droughts, wildfires, floods, and storms—“costs borne entirely by the public,” Hansen noted. He suggested that if the public were reimbursed, citizens could use that money to defray the added cost of alternate sources of energy that could become more economical over time. Sadly, there seems as much chance of that happening as Hansen getting a response if he called 911 to report an emergency that will be happening over the next decade, or two of three. Whatever happens, however it goes, it seems almost certain that many decades from now, history will remember the building that housed Tom’s Restaurant less for Seinfeld and his show about nothing than as the place where Hansen presented the study that was about more than we fully realized. Meanwhile, the day after Hansen’s study was released, word came of torrential rain in Manila and the worst flood in years. Maybe there should be a Climate Dice board game, where all the players lose unless they acknowledge the science and work together for the genuine good of everybody."

Two candlelight vigils are scheduled from 7 to 8 p.m. Friday — one outside Union City’s City Hall at 34009 Alvarado-Niles Road, and another outside Fremont City Hall at 3300 Capitol Ave. The events are two of a number of ceremonies to be held simultaneously around the globe to advocate against hate and violence, said Harpal Mann, an alternate member of the Union City Planning Commission and co-planner of the Union City vigil. Victims shot and killed last month in a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., also will be honored, Mann said. “We’ve moved past the point of emotional outpour and grief and now we want to channel our energies against senseless violence, whether it’s in a temple or a theater,” he said. Another vigil is scheduled to begin at 1:30 p.m. Sunday at Bill Ball Plaza at the Fremont-Centerville Rail Station, at 37260 Fremont Blvd. A Fremont Sikh temple, known as a gurdwara, is inviting the public to a special prayer service this weekend in memory of the Wisconsin victims. The Gurdwara Sahib of Fremont, at 300 Gurdwara Road near Mission Boulevard, has scheduled the service from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Sunday. Religious and community leaders from southern Alameda County are expected to attend the ceremonies, which are open to people of all faiths, Mann said. “We want the public to send a message: we need security and peace and something needs to be done about it,” he said. Police said Wade Michael Page, an Army veteran, was the gunman responsible for the Wisconsin mass shooting last weekend. Page, 40, was a known white supremacist who committed suicide Sunday after he was wounded by police gunfire. In Contra Costa County, a vigil is also scheduled from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. Wednesday at the Sikh Temple, 3550 Hillcrest Road in El Sobrante. Contact Chris De Benedetti at 510-353-7011.

But members of the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin left a single bullet hole to mark the memory of a white supremacist's deadly rampage. On Friday, thousands mourned the six victims gunned down before a prayer service on Sunday. The temple's members worked late Thursday to remove all but the one trace of the shooting. The waist-high bullet hole in a door jamb near the main prayer room was left as a memorial to the six slain worshippers. ""We will put a plaque here,"" Harpreet Singh, nephew of one of the victims, said Friday. ""We will make sure they are never forgotten."" Members showed The Associated Press the dime-size hole during a tour of the temple. While most other physical reminders of the horror have been scrubbed or painted over, temple members said they could still feel the spirits of those who died. As Singh showed the AP the bedrooms where his uncle and a priest were killed, he frequently paused with his hands on his hips and looked around in silence. Army veteran Wade Michael Page used a 9 mm pistol Sunday to kill five men and one woman and to wound three other people, including a police officer, in the ambush on the temple. He took his own life after exchanging gunfire with officers, including one he shot nine times. The carnage could have been much worse, Singh said. At the first sound of gunfire outside, two children raced into the kitchen and warned people to take cover. Thirteen women were there preparing meals for the day, crammed into a pantry with a man and the two children. The pantry, off the main kitchen, has only enough room for three or four people to stand comfortably. But the 16 waited in petrified silence for almost two hours, doing their best to ignore the smoke wafting throughout the room from food burning on the stove. Page's view of the pantry was probably blocked by the large refrigerator near its entrance, Singh said. ""Otherwise who knows what would have happened,"" he said. At Oak Creek High School on Friday, lines of mourners wound deep into the parking lot for the service in the gymnasium, where the six victims' bodies lay in open wooden caskets adorned with red and white flowers. Musicians sang religious hymns in front of a large video screen flashing photos of those killed and injured, as mourners, wearing head scarves in the Sikh tradition, greeted relatives with hugs. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder told mourners the rampage was an attack not only on Sikhs but on American values. He also applauded the Sikh community for not responding to the attack with violence. ""You've inspired the best of who we are,"" Holder said. Children of victims also spoke, saying the one comfort they drew from their parents' deaths was that the killing happened in a temple, where God was near to accept them. Mourners came from as far as California and New York, from Chicago and Vancouver Kuldeep Chahal, 35, a Sikh teacher, drove 12 hours from Toronto to attend the ceremony Friday, bringing banners and cards that members of his local temple had signed for victims' families.

(Associated Press: Dinesh Ramde)  More than 100 people gathered in suburban Milwaukee for the first Sunday prayer service at a Sikh temple since a white supremacist shot and killed six people there before fatally shooting himself.
Women sang hymns as a group lowered a flag pole outside the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in Oak Creek. About 50 men and boys unwrapped the orange cloth covering the pole, washed the pole with water and milk and then rewrapped it with a fresh cloth.

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS:  President Barack Obama talks abut taxes, Friday, August 3, 2012, in Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House campus in Washington.   (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)  WASHINGTON — To say that President Barack Obama and Paul Ryan have a history may be an understatement.
In the 31/2 years of Obama’s term, he and the Wisconsin Republican — tapped Saturday, Aug. 11, by Mitt Romney to be his running mate in the fall election — have had a number of significant policy clashes that often played out publicly.
Those face-offs should suit Ryan well as he is set to perform the traditional role of a presidential candidate’s running mate: attack dog, particularly on the Republicans’ focus issue of deficits and debts.
The depth of the Obama-Ryan relationship is a contrast to the one the president has with Romney. Unlike four years ago, when he was running against Senate colleague John McCain, Obama has few personal interactions with the former Massachusetts governor, a factor that has made it all the easier for him to wage a hard-hitting campaign against the all-but-official Republican nominee. 


It’s unclear how often Obama and Ryan crossed paths when both served in Congress, at opposite ends of the Capitol. But Ryan emerged as a lead voice for the GOP on fiscal policy once Obama moved to the White House.
The first public confrontation came in January 2010, when the president traveled to Baltimore to speak at the House GOP’s policy retreat. In a rare moment, Obama fielded a number of questions from members on specific policy areas, including one from Ryan, who raised concern about what he described as an 84 percent increase in the rate of federal spending after Obama’s first year.
With Obama at the time proposing a freeze in domestic spending in his new budget, Ryan said: “I would simply submit that we can do more and start now.”
Obama’s response began by disputing Ryan’s contention that he had increased spending by 84 percent, pointing out that the federal outlays largely jumped automatically, a consequence of “automatic stabilizers that kick in because of this enormous recession.”
“Whoever was in there, Paul — and I don’t think you’ll dispute that — whoever was in there would have seen those same increases,” he said. 


He thanked Ryan for his proposal, along with then-Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold, for a constitutional version of the line-item veto, saying there isn’t a president who wouldn’t love to have that tool, which could be used to limit discretionary spending.
“I would love for Congress itself to show discipline on both sides of the aisle. I think one thing that you have to acknowledge, Paul, because you study this stuff and take it pretty seriously, that the earmarks problem is not unique to one party,” he said.
That encounter was a largely polite affair, in which Ryan was one of a handful of House Republicans who posed questions to the president. The event was seen as a public win for the president for how he deftly handled the questions and spurred calls for further such “prime minister’s questions”-type events.
A month later, Ryan clashed with Obama on the details of the president’s health care reform plan, which was within weeks of final passage. Ryan actually targeted Obama on the issue the Democrats likely will focus their campaign against Ryan in coming months: Medicare.
“What this bill essentially does is treat Medicare like a piggy bank. It raids a half a trillion dollars out of Medicare not to shore up Medicare’s solvency but to spend on this new government program,” he said.
He also warned that, stripped of accounting “gimmicks,” the full long-term costs of reform were far beyond what Democrats claimed.
“There really is a difference between us,” he said at a bipartisan discussion at Blair House, across the street from the White House. “We don’t think the government should be in control of all of this. We want people to be in control. And that, at the end of the day, is the big difference.”
But the major clashes between Obama and Ryan would remain focused on deficit reduction.
Ryan was one of 18 members of the president’s deficit commission, which became known as the Simpson-Bowles panel. It issued a report, called a “Moment of Truth,” that recommended a cap on discretionary spending through 2020, an overhaul of the tax code and reforms to Social Security and Medicare. It would have lowered tax rates overall by simplifying the tax code and eliminating many deductions, which the panel’s leaders called “tax earmarks.”
Eleven of 18 members voted to endorse the plan, but Ryan led the three-member contingent of House Republicans in casting “no” votes that prevented it from advancing for consideration in the full Congress. Ryan raised concerns that implementation of the plan would lead to a public option on health care and ultimately leave Americans paying more in taxes.
In 2011, after Republicans took control of the House and gained seats in the Senate, the GOP tasked Ryan with delivering the party’s response to Obama’s second State of the Union address.
“There’s no doubt the president came into office facing a severe fiscal and economic situation. Unfortunately, instead of restoring the fundamentals of economic growth, he engaged in a stimulus spending spree that not only failed to deliver on his promise to create jobs but also plunged us even deeper into debt,” Ryan told a national television audience.
Three months later, as lawmakers faced a debate over if and how to raise the nation’s debt limit, the president outlined his own proposal for deficit reduction, detailing a plan to reduce the shortfall by $4 trillion over a decade.
In that speech, with Ryan seated in the crowd, he sharply rebuked the Republican plan.
“This vision is less about reducing the deficit than it is about changing the basic social compact in America,” he said in April at George Washington University. “There’s nothing serious about a plan that claims to reduce the deficit by spending a trillion dollars on tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires. And I don’t think there’s anything courageous about asking for sacrifice from those who can least afford it and don’t have any clout on Capitol Hill. That’s not a vision of the America I know.”
It was a moment that likely ended any real hope of the two working together in a significant way, despite earlier hopes that they could do so.

And police Sgt. Chris Bolton quickly fired off a flurry of text alerts to thousands of nearby residents through a social media tool for law enforcement agencies. “Stay out of area,” said one alert. “Multiple shooting victims reported. Medical on-scene. Police are evacuating a nearby, affected business.” Officers would eventually discover a grisly scene inside a tiny Christian college on that spring day. Seven people were killed, three others wounded and dozens terrified in the deadliest mass shooting in the city’s history. Bolton later gave those on edge an update: “Possible suspect in custody. No imminent public safety threat appears to exist in immediate area.” Across the country, law officers are adding a new form of social media to their arsenal of crime fighting tools. Almost 6,000 law enforcement agencies are now using Nixle to provide residents with real-time alerts on crimes in progress, traffic messes and missing children. With the San Francisco-based service approaching 1 million subscribers, with police departments participating in major cities such as Chicago, Los Angeles, Baltimore and Dallas, it is part of what one expert calls a new “blue wave” of electronic community policing that lets cops reach out directly to the public. The International Association of Chiefs of Police recently found in a survey of 800 law enforcement agencies that nearly nine out of 10 use some form of social media and more than half reported that social media have helped solve crimes. Many of those agencies have boosted their social media presence significantly within the last two to three years, said Nancy Kolb, a senior program manager for the IACP. While many law enforcement agencies use Twitter and Facebook, and there are other public safety notification systems such as CodeRED, Nixle has become increasingly popular with law enforcement, said Lauri Stevens, a Massachusetts-based law enforcement social media strategist. Police officials say they particularly like Nixle security features that make it less susceptible to hacking than some social media. Also, the company has a partnership with the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (NLETS), which allows local, state, federal and international public safety agencies to exchange sensitive information. A private messaging system Nixle created has allowed authorities to use it at major events including the G-20 Summit, May Day immigration protests and even the Academy Awards. However, Nixle is not as interactive as some of the other social media networks, Stevens said. “The company has taken off like crazy and it helps law enforcement send information out, but it can’t get any answers back, so I don’t consider them social media in the true sense,” she said. “What Nixle has done right, though, is that they’ve got good buzz and are still building a huge customer base.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters"

California Attorney General Kamala Harris and the Democratic state Senate leader back a bill that would make it more difficult and time-consuming to reload assault weapons.' The suspect in the July 20 Colorado shooting, James Holmes, legally bought 6,000 rounds of ammunition online without raising authorities' attention. He had four weapons, including an assault rifle, on him after the rampage that killed 12 people and injured 58 at a midnight movie screening. ""California sets the pace for the country. If there's no action in Congress, we better do something here and hope it catches fire in other states,"" said state Sen. Leland Yee, a San Francisco Democrat who wrote the legislation that would slow down the process of reloading an assault weapon with a new magazine. With strong support from Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, New York lawmakers have offered a similar rationale for proposing a series of bills that together would give their state the nation's toughest gun control laws. ""I think there is appetite for reform,"" Cuomo told reporters this week. ""I think that's a good thing, and I think that's one of the issues I'm going to have at the top of the list next January."" The prospects for the proposals are uncertain, but Democratic political strength in each state provides momentum that would be largely absent in Republican-dominated states. California, for example, has some of the toughest gun laws in the country and last year enacted a ban on the open carrying of unloaded handguns. Democrats control the statehouse and governor's office in California and Illinois and all but the state Senate in New York. Even with half the legislature in Republican hands, Cuomo said he believes Republican lawmakers will work with him on gun-control legislation. --''The push in some of the nation's most populous and liberal-leaning states illustrates a national divide, often along party lines, over whether the public should have unfettered access to military-style weaponry and ammunition. ""It's time for the people to band together in our state . . . and do something about these weapons. We should remember those who lost their lives,"" Quinn said last month after he added his gun control proposal onto a bill that had dealt with ammunition sales.

The gunman was a white supremacist. But Singh, a Union City small business owner, said his firm belief that tolerance will overcome racial violence is one of many reasons he is excited for the eighth annual Union City Sister City Festival, scheduled to begin 5 p.m. Sunday. “We are all here, we are all American, we’re all part of the same community, and we’re not leaving,” he said. “So, we have to educate people about different cultures.” Singh — a member of the Union City Friends of Sister Cities commission, which is sponsoring the event — said those types of cultural exchanges are the best way to prevent racial violence. “When kids see and learn about people who are different from them, they become more accepting,” he said. The upcoming festival will celebrate Asadabad, Afghanistan — the sixth and newest sister city with which Union City has established a cultural partnership, Councilwoman Pat Gacoscos said. Abdullah Aimaque, the consul general of Afghanistan in Los Angeles, and Mohammad Qayoumi, president of San Jose State and the first person of Afghan descent to head a major U.S. university, are among the event’s scheduled speakers. Other participating sister cities include: Chiang Rai, Thailand; Liyang, China; Jalandar, India; Pasay City, Philippines; and Santa Rosalia, Mexico. Nearly all of those nations’ cultures will be represented with festival performances, including those by local dance troupes and a Sikh martial arts organization. “The composition of our sister cities is like a microcosm of our city and the nation,” Gacoscos said. Union City — like many East Bay cities — is very diverse, according to 2010 census figures. About 24 percent of the city is white, 23 percent is Latino, 20 percent is Filipino, more than 11 percent is Indo-American and nearly 11 percent is Chinese. Adding Asadabad — whose residents are predominantly Muslim — to its list of sister cities presents Union City with another faith to celebrate, Gacoscos said. “We have so many different religions here — Catholics from the Philippines, Buddhists from Thailand, Sikhs from India and now Muslims from Asadabad, Afghanistan,” she said. “Having sister cities helps ease tensions among many different groups in the entire Tri-City area, not just in Union City.” Contact Chris De Benedetti at 510-353-7011.

The star of the superhero franchise visited the Medical Center of Aurora on Tuesday afternoon and met with seven people recovering from Thursday night’s tragedy, as well as doctors, emergency medical technicians and city police officers. He was joined by wife Sibi Blazic and requested that the media not be notified of the event; he appeared as himself and did not represent Warner Brothers, the studio that released Dark Knight. “The patients were really happy to meet  Bale,” Bill Voloch, interim president of Medical Center of Aurora, told the Post. “They are obviously big fans of his movies. They  wanted to see Batman and were really pleased to see Bale.” The Medical Center of Aurora admitted seven patients on Thursday night after the shooting at the film screening, where James Holmes allegedly killed 12 people and injured 58 others. Bale released a statement on Saturday that said, “Words cannot express the horror that I feel. I cannot  begin to truly understand the pain and grief of the victims and their  loved ones, but my heart goes out to them.”  In This Article:

84393571,2012-07-30 14:25:09,Too soon to talk gun control?,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_crime/~3/phJwHKX8scw/index.html,en,False,,1095,CNN,http://www.cnn.com/,"The bodies of the victims are being buried. The court case will continue, without cameras.  The horror in Aurora has faded from the front page in favor of Olympic coverage. So it is worth asking, 10 days after the largest mass shooting in American history, whether it is still too soon to start a conversation about reasonable gun restrictions.  What actions could we take to make such slaughters more difficult to perpetrate? Because if it is true, as the National Rifle Association says, that ""guns don't kill people; people kill people,"" then it's equally irrefutable that people with guns kill people. Here is the toll, beyond the 12 dead and 59 wounded in Aurora.  More than 180 people killed in mass shootings in the past five years, including the 32 people who died in the April, 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech.  And dwarfing that total are the 10,000 Americans murdered by gunshots every year. Fareed Zakaria: Time to face facts on gun control No one is suggesting that insane actions such as the Colorado shootings can ever be legislated out of existence. And there is no doubt that the Second Amendment is enshrined in our Constitution.  But part of life in a civil society is about having civic conversations about problems -- not aiming for the illusion of perfectibility but for improvement. Circa 2012, however, it has become politically incorrect to talk about restricting the ability of unstable individuals to get AR-15 rifles, or 6,000 rounds of ammunition.  When people say ""it's too soon"" to talk about the role of guns in mass shootings, what too many of them really mean is that we should never have the conversation. Gun violence is not inevitable. It does not reflect the human condition. Navarrette: Guns endanger cops' safety America leads the world in gun violence by many multiples.  It reflects our culture -- and guns are a core part of American culture, for better or worse.  It is a fact rooted in the conquest of the West, where guns were used primarily for hunting and self-defense. And Americans' divergent views about guns are reflected in something more fundamental than politics.  In a larger sense, America's political divides are not rooted in questions of left versus right as much as urban versus rural. These basic cultural differences have been the drivers of political debates since Alexander Hamilton squared off against Thomas Jefferson in George Washington's Cabinet.  They were reflected in debates over the Civil War and Prohibition and today's red state versus blue state divides.  And they underscore the different opinions that exist about guns. We use guns differently in rural and urban areas of the United States. And because Democrats need to expand their base beyond urban areas to win statewide or national elections, they have ceded this ground to Republicans. This new status quo is enforced on Capitol Hill by the fact that the NRA outspends anti-gun advocacy groups such as the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence by a factor of 10-to-1, making it all too easy for members of Congress to calculate that taking on -- or even talking about -- this issue isn't worth the cost. And it is even more true at the presidential level.  President Barack Obama was eloquent and empathetic after meeting with victims and their families, but he backed off making any proposals for new gun control laws. Mitt Romney also was quick to cite scripture and communicate his sorrow in the hours after the attacks, but he was firm in his insistence that no new guns laws were needed.  Gun violence and gun laws seem oddly and unrealistically disconnected when it comes to political discussion. Frum: Fear drives opposition to gun control What's particularly hypocritical about these stands is that both men backed assault weapons bans in the past. As governor of Massachusetts, Romney signed an assault weapons ban into law. As a candidate for president, Obama said he would push for a restoration of the assault weapons ban achieved by President Bill Clinton but which expired in 2004. Now?  Crickets. Presumably, what's changed is not their personal beliefs but the politics.  Mitt Romney did a signature flip-flop on this social issue because no Republican believes they can win their party's nomination without full genuflection at the altar of the NRA. Obama's position can also be ascribed to presidential politics -- the Obama campaign can't afford to lose a single persuadable vote in swing states such as Colorado, Nevada and Ohio. Moreover, Obama's stance on guns is complicated by the typical competition between fear-mongering and facts. Despite the fact that Obama has in some cases loosened gun laws -- such as signing legislation allowing people to carry firearms into national parks -- the far right has been pushing the fright-wing fantasy that he is hell-bent on banning all guns via a U.N. small-arms treaty or some other nefarious plot. But the conventional wisdom in Washington -- that this is a settled debate -- is a fiction. A new poll by the Republican pollster Frank Luntz for Mayors Against Illegal Guns found that: -- 74% of NRA members and 87% of non-NRA gun owners support criminal background checks for anyone purchasing a gun. -- 74% of NRA members think that concealed carry permits should be granted only to applicants who have completed gun safety training and 75% believe that such permits should be granted to people who have not committed violent misdemeanors, including assault. -- In addition, 71% of NRA members back the idea that people on terror watch lists should be barred from buying guns (duh), and 65% believe that gun owners should be required to alert police in the event of lost and stolen guns. Opinion: Gun control or carry permits won't stop mass murder The point is that there is plenty of room for discussion on gun policy post-Aurora and plenty of room for defining the common ground around  reasonable restrictions that gun-owners and advocates can agree on. This is not settled policy and not the third-rail politicians pretend it is.  That narrative is unrelated to the facts. There is no reason we can't increase background checks, ban people on a terrorist watch list from buying guns and make it more difficult for people to buy 100-drum magazines that have no function except to kill as many people as possible as fast as possible. This all falls under common sense and the kind of reasonable restrictions set out by the Supreme Court in their Heller decision.  Having this civic conversation is a rational response to a mass killing -- it can be done respectfully and thoughtfully and well within the realm of ""reasonable restrictions"" that do not impede on the Second Amendment. All that is required is political courage -- and that can be encouraged by speaking up. Follow @CNNOpinion on Twitter Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion"

84408050,2012-08-06 15:21:00,Wisconsin temple gunman identified as army veteran Wade Michael Page,http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/06/wisconsin-temple-gunman-army-veteran,en,False,,1751,Guardian US,https://www.theguardian.com/us,"A gunman who killed six people at a Sikh place of worship in Wisconsin has been identified as a 40-year-old former soldier with alleged links to racist groups. The white, heavy-set shooter – who some witnesses suggested carried tattoos marking the 9/11 terrorist attacks – was named as Wade Michael Page, an former serviceman once stationed at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. Officials have yet to confirm the killer's identity.  Meanwhile, the Southern Poverty Law Center – an organisation that monitors the activity of extremist groups – claimed on its website that the shooter was a ""frustrated neo-Nazi who had been the leader of a racist white-power band"". Forensic experts spent Monday searching the gunman's home in Cudahy, just a few miles from Oak Creek, where the Sikh gurdwara is located. Oak Creek police chief John Edwards has already confirmed that the suspect had a military background. It is thought Page was dismissed from the US army in 1998 for ""patterns of misconduct"", including being drunk on duty. Edwards told CNN that the gunman ""lived in a community neighbouring ours"", and said authorities were ""doing a 24-hour back-check, just to get any idea what he was up to, what he was doing"". ""Right now there is no indication that there were any red flags,"" he said. Sunday's attack is being investigated as an act of ""domestic terrorism"", police have said. The suspect began shooting shortly before 10.30am local time as dozens gathered at the gurdwara. After killing people inside the building, the gunman fought with officers outside, critically injuring one. A second officer was able to ""put down"" the suspect, police said. The killer was pronounced dead at the scene. The wounded officer, named on Monday as lieutenant Brian Murphy, 51, a 21-year veteran of the force, was taken to hospital for surgery. He was in a critical condition on Monday. Emergency response teams found the bodies of four victims inside the gurdwara. Three more bodies lay outside the building, including that of the suspect. Three others – including the policeman – were injured and taken to a nearby hospital. All were said to be in a ""critical condition"". At a press conference on Sunday, Oak Creek police chief John Edwards said the ""heroic actions"" of the two officers ""stopped this from being worse than it could have been"". Authorities said the gunman had used a 9mm semi-automatic pistol. The weapon, recovered at the scene, is thought to have been obtained legally, but police are still trying to track its origin. Among those shot in the attack were prominent members of the local Sikh community. Jatin Der Mangat, 38, of Racine, said his uncle Satwant Singh Kaleka was one of those wounded, but he didn't know how serious his injuries were. ""It was like the heart just sat down,"" he said. ""This shouldn't happen anywhere."" Sukhwindar Nagr, also of Racine, said he called his brother-in-law's phone. A granthi at the temple answered and told him that his brother-in-law had been shot, along with three granthi. It is thought that around 50 people were in the gurdwara at the time of the attack. The identification of the gunman has increased concerns that the attacker had a racist motive. The SPLC reported that Page was a known member of the white power music scene, and some witnesses said the suspect had a tattoo marking September 11. Some Sikhs had been targeted after 9/11, apparently mistaken for Muslims by people carrying out revenge attacks. Authorities confirmed the dead suspect had tattoos, but said they were not sure exactly what they illustrated. Police said it was too early to suggest a motive. But some Sikh members of the community told media that they feared that it was a hate crime. Others, however, have cautioned against jumping to conclusions. Sapreet Kaur, executive director of the Sikh Coalition, the largest Sikh American civil rights organisation in the US, said: ""There have been multiple hate crime shootings within the Sikh community in recent years and the natural impulse of our community is to unfortunately assume the same in this case."" ""Let's let law enforcement investigate the case and as new facts emerge the dialogue can change."" One woman, aged 41, and five men, including an 84-year-old, were killed in the attack, authorities said during a press conference on Monday. Police chief Edwards commended lieutenant Brian Murphy on his heroism as it emerged that he urged colleague to help others despite being seriously injured himself. Murphy was ambushed by the shooter as he went to tend to a wounded person. He was then shot eight or nine times at close range. But after the gunman was taken down buy a colleague, Murphy waved them away as they attempted to help him. ""He [Murphy] had been shot nine times, including very seriously in the neck area, and he waved them off and told them to go into the the temple to assist those in there,"" Edwards said. Meanwhile, some details about Wade were released by authorities. They confirmed his identity, and said: ""We can say he was in the military between 1992 and 1998, and had a general discharge and he was ineligible for re-enlistment."" The FBI said that links to white supremacist groups were being looked into, but added that Wade had not been the subject of an investigation. But they were looking at references to him in other files, and he did have a police record, it emerged. The shooting came just 16 days after 12 people were killed and nearly 60 injured in a mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, during a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises. Wisconsin, like Colorado, has some of the most permissive gun laws in the country. Last year it passed a law allowing citizens to carry a concealed weapon. The second mass shooting in two weeks will likely intensify pressure on US lawmakers to address the issue gun controls. President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have been largely silent on guns. However, in a statement delivered after Sunday's shooting, Obama said he was ""deeply saddened"" by the incident. Words of condolences also came from leaders overseas, with Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh, a Sikh, expressing his shock and sadness. Singh said: ""That this senseless act of violence should be targeted at a place of religious worship is particularly painful."""

Loading... August 6, 2012 Witnesses said the shooter who attacked a Sikh temple in the U.S. looked like he had a purpose and knew where he was going. Authorities on Monday scrambled to find a motive for the attack that left seven people, including the gunman, dead and three critically wounded. Police called it an act of domestic terrorism. Terrified congregants ran for cover Sunday morning when the shooting began at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin. The gunfire finally ended in a shootout between the gunman and police outside. Satpal Kaleka, wife of the temple's president, Satwant Singh Kaleka, saw the gunman enter, according to Harpreet Singh, their nephew. ""He did not speak, he just began shooting,"" said Singh, relaying her description. Worshippers said they had never seen the 6-foot (1.83-meter)-tall bald man at the temple before. Federal authorities described the suspect as a white man in his 40s, but neither provided further details nor suggested a possible motive. ""We never thought this could happen to our community,"" said Devendar Nagra, 48, whose sister escaped injury by hiding as the gunman fired in the temple's kitchen. ""We never did anything wrong to anyone."" Late Sunday, the investigation appeared to move beyond the temple as police, federal agents and the county sheriff's bomb squad swarmed a nearby neighborhood, evacuated several homes and searched a duplex. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent Tom Ahern said warrants were being served at the gunman's home. Residents were allowed to return Monday. Oak Creek Police Chief John Edwards said police expected to release more information Monday. He said the FBI will lead the investigation because the shootings are being treated as domestic terrorism, or an attack that originated inside the U.S. ""While the FBI is investigating whether this matter might be an act of domestic terrorism, no motive has been determined at this time,"" Teresa Carlson, Special Agent in Charge with the agency's Milwaukee division, said in a statement Sunday night. During a chaotic few hours after the first shots were fired around 10:30 a.m. (1430 GMT), police in tactical gear and carrying assault rifles surrounded the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin with armored vehicles and ambulances. Witnesses struggled with unrealized fears that several shooters were holding women and children hostage inside. Edwards said the gunman ""ambushed"" one of the first officers to arrive at the temple as the officer tended to a victim outside. A second officer then exchanged gunfire with the suspect, who was fatally shot. Police had earlier said the officer who was shot killed the suspected shooter. The wounded officer was in critical condition along with two other victims Sunday night, authorities said. Police said the officer was expected to survive. Tactical units went through the temple and found four people dead inside and two outside, in addition to the shooter. The Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's Office has received the bodies of the seven dead and autopsies will be conducted Monday morning, Medical Examiner spokeswoman Karen Domaglski. Jatinder Mangat, 38, another nephew of the temple's president, said his uncle was among those shot, but he didn't know the extent of his injuries. When Mangat later learned people had died, he said ""it was like the heart just sat down."" Gurpreet Kaur, 24, said her mother was among a group of about 14 other women preparing a meal in the temple kitchen when the gunman entered and started firing. Kaur said her mother felt two bullets fly by her as the group fled to the pantry. Her mother suffered what Kaur thought was shrapnel wound in her foot. ""These are people I've grown up with,"" she said. ""They're like aunts and uncles to me. To see our community to go through something like this is numbing."" Many Sikhs in the U.S. worship on Sundays at a temple, or gurdwara, and a typical service consists of meditation and singing in a prayer room where worshippers remove their shoes and sit on the floor. Worshippers gather afterward for a meal that is open to the entire community. Sikhism is a monotheistic faith founded more than 500 years ago in South Asia. It has roughly 27 million followers worldwide. Observant Sikhs do not cut their hair; male followers often cover their heads with turbans — which are considered sacred — and refrain from shaving their beards. There are roughly 500,000 Sikhs in the U.S., according to estimates. The majority worldwide live in India. The Sikh Temple of Wisconsin started in 1997 with about 25 families. Construction on the current temple in Oak Creek began in 2006, according to the temple's website. Sikh rights groups have reported a rise in bias attacks since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The Washington-based Sikh Coalition has reported more than 700 incidents in the U.S. since 9/11, which advocates blame on anti-Islamic sentiment. Sikhs are not Muslims, but their long beards and turbans often cause them to be mistaken for Muslims, advocates say. Police in New York and Chicago issued statements saying they were giving Sikh temples in those cities additional attention as a precaution.

Valarie Kaur, who chronicled violence against Sikh Americans in the 2006 documentary ""Divided We Fall,"" said the shootings reopened wounds in a community whose members have found themselves frequent targets of hate-based attacks since Sept. 11.

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in.

84453774,2012-08-05 04:35:08,Reports: Loughner to plead guilty in Arizona shooting rampage,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_crime/~3/f5mPENovSwI/index.html,en,False,,1095,CNN,http://www.cnn.com/,"The U.S. Attorney's Office said it is not confirming or denying reports that Jared Loughner will plead guilty in last year's shooting rampage outside a Tucson, Arizona, supermarket. The attack killed six people and wounded 13 others, including then-U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. On Saturday night, the Los Angeles Times and the Wall Street Journal reported that Loughner, 23, is now mentally competent to understand the charges against him and that a status hearing on his competency, scheduled for Tuesday morning, will now be a change-of-plea hearing. The Los Angeles Times attributed the information to ""knowledgeable sources,"" while the Wall Street Journal said its source was an ""official familiar with the case."" ""I can neither confirm or deny the reports in the L.A. Times and other media about the Loughner case,"" Bill Solomon, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona, told CNN when asked about the reports late Saturday night. Asked if his office planned to issue a comment Monday,  Solomon said, there was ""nothing planned at this time."" The attack took place during a January 8, 2011, meet-and-greet event for Giffords. Among those killed was Arizona's chief federal judge, John Roll. Giffords, who was shot in the head, stepped down from her position in Congress in January 2012 in order to focus on her recovery. Ron Barber, an aide also wounded in the attack, now holds the seat. Loughner was facing the possibility of a death sentence if convicted. However, a plea deal -- if one is in the works -- may mean that he would admit guilt in exchange for a lengthy prison sentence. Prosecutors have said that Loughner, who spent time on suicide watch, suffers from schizophrenia. His mental condition has been central to much of the related court proceedings since the mass shooting. In February, a federal judge ruled Loughner could receive medical treatment for another four months. A psychologist found ""measurable progress"" in the suspect's condition. The medical treatment plan for Loughner was aimed at improving his mental state so he will be competent to stand trial. Loughner was declared incompetent to stand trial in May 2011 after an initial evaluation term at a federal mental hospital in Springfield, Missouri. In July 2011, bizarre and suicidal actions by Loughner while in custody pushed a federal appeals panel to allow authorities to force the defendant to take anti-psychotic medication. Prosecutors said then that Loughner had been deteriorating: He displayed screaming and crying fits that lasted hours, harmed himself and made claims that the radio was inserting thoughts into his head. His attorneys consistently fought court rulings that Loughner continue his treatment at the hospital. In November, defense attorney Ellis Johnston argued before a different federal judge that the side effects of the psychotropic drugs his client had been receiving during his court-ordered treatment may interfere with Loughner's ability to work with his attorneys. But Assistant U.S. Attorney Christina Cabanillas said that Loughner ""could revert to being a danger to himself"" if the medication were halted. Court documents released a few days after the shooting showed that investigators found a letter from Giffords in a safe at the house where Loughner lived with his parents,  thanking him for attending a 2007 event. ""Also recovered in the safe was an envelope with handwriting on the envelope stating 'I planned ahead,' and 'my assassination' and the name 'Giffords,' along with what appears to be Loughner's signature,"" the affidavit stated."

President Obama and Mitt Romney on Sunday each expressed sorrow over the shootings in Wisconsin and said their families are praying for the victims and their families. At least seven people were killed when a gunman opened fire Sunday morning at a Sikh temple in the Milwaukee suburb of Oak Creek, authorities said. Several dozen people were gathering for a service at the Sikh Temple. The suspected shooter later died in an exchange of gunfire with police. “Michelle and I were deeply saddened to learn of the shooting that tragically took so many lives in Wisconsin,” the president in a statement. “At this difficult time, the people of Oak Creek must know that the American people have them in our thoughts and prayers, and our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who were killed and wounded. … As we mourn this loss which took place at a house of worship, we are reminded how much our country has been enriched by Sikhs, who are a part of our broader American family.” Romney, the GOP presidential candidate, said he and wife Ann were praying and called the mass shooting “a senseless act of violence.” “Ann and I extend our thoughts and prayers to the victims,” Romney said. “This was a senseless act of violence and a tragedy that should never befall any house of worship. Our hearts are with the victims, their families and the entire Oak Creek Sikh community. We join Americans everywhere in mourning those who lost their lives and in prayer for healing in the difficult days ahead.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.

An order from the court indicating the planned change of pleas was released Monday. Loughner had earlier pleaded not guilty to the charges against him, including murder and attempted murder. Both the Los Angeles Times and The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday that Loughner, 23, has been found mentally competent to understand the charges against him, citing unidentified sources. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona has declined to comment on those reports to CNN. Warning signs of violence: What to do Court records show a psychologist is scheduled to testify at the hearing as to Loughner's current mental condition. Federal Judge Larry Alan Burns indicated he would then rule from the bench on the competency issue. ""Assuming the court finds the defendant competent, it will also consider whether to accept the defendant's proffered pleas"" at that hearing, said the judge in his scheduling order.

Gabrielle Giffords, pleaded guilty Tuesday to 19 charges in exchange for the government not seeking the death penalty. Under the plea deal, Loughner will be sentenced to life in prison with no eligibility for parole, federal prosecutors said. His sentencing is scheduled for November 15, prosecutors said. In court, Loughner also waived his right to pursue an insanity defense. ""My name is Jared Lee Loughner,"" the defendant told the court when he held up his right hand under oath. Loughner calmly told the court he understood his guilty plea. ""Yes, that is correct,"" he said. ""I'm 23 years old,"" he told the court. ""I attended college for five years at a community college."" Earlier Tuesday, Judge Larry Alan Burns found Loughner competent to stand trial in a federal court in Tucson. Warning signs of violence: What to do ""He's a different person in appearance and affect,"" the judge said about Loughner, who was present in the courtroom. ""He's tracking today. He appears to assist his lawyers. Court's own observations are that there's no question he understands what's happening today."" Loughner had been facing more than 50 federal charges, and the remaining offenses will be dropped in exchange for the guilty pleas if Loughner is sentenced within the terms of the plea agreement, according to the written agreement filed in court. Under the pleas, Loughner admitted guilt in the attempted assassination of Giffords and the murders of federal employees U.S. District Court Chief Judge John M. Roll, 63, and congressional aide Gabriel M. Zimmerman, 30, prosecutors said. Loughner also pleaded guilty to the attempted murders of federal employees and congressional aides Ronald S. Barber, 65, and Pamela K. Simon, 63, prosecutors said. Loughner also admitted causing the deaths of Christina-Taylor Green, age 9; Dorothy ""Dot"" J. Morris, 76; Phyllis C. Schneck, 79; and Dorwan C. Stoddard, 76, prosecutors said. Loughner admitted injuring with a Glock pistol 10 persons participating at an activity provided by the U.S. government and creating a grave risk of death to 13 more persons, prosecutors said. Prosecutors agreed to a plea deal -- and not to seek the death penalty -- after taking into account Loughner's history of mental illness and the views of victims and their families. ""It is my hope that this decision will allow the Tucson community, and the nation, to continue the healing process free of what would likely be extended trial and pre-trial proceedings that would not have a certain outcome,"" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement. Fast facts: The Tuscon shooting U.S. Attorney John S. Leonardo in Arizona added: ""Given the defendant's history of significant mental illness, this plea agreement, which requires the defendant to spend the remainder of his natural life in prison, with no possibility of parole, is a just and appropriate resolution of this case."" Walking with a bit of a slouch, Loughner cast a sneer at the packed gallery when he entered the courtroom. During the guilty plea proceedings, the gallery was quiet, with some people sniffing and wiping away tears. An order from the court indicating the planned change of pleas was released Monday. Loughner earlier had pleaded not guilty to the charges against him, including murder and attempted murder. The January 8, 2011, attack killed six people and wounded 13 others, including Giffords, who was holding a meet-and-greet event with constituents. Giffords, who was shot in the head, stepped down from her position in Congress in January 2012 to focus on her recovery. Ron Barber, an aide also wounded in the attack, now holds the seat. Giffords' husband, Mark Kelly, said in a statement Tuesday that he and his wife are satisfied with the agreement. ""The pain and loss caused by the events of January 8, 2011 are incalculable,"" Kelly said. ""Avoiding a trial will allow us -- and we hope the whole Southern Arizona community -- to continue with our recovery and move forward with our lives."" Susan Hileman, 58, who was wounded, said after the court proceedings that she was proud to be an American. ""This is the system doing its best. It's not a perfect solution,"" Hileman told reporters. ""This is the best that can be expected."" Loughner was facing the possibility of a death sentence if convicted. Dr. Christina Pietz, a forensic psychologist, told the judge Tuesday that Loughner is ""one of the worst"" mentally ill patients she's ever seen. But she continued, adding that Loughner has shown improvement and he's no longer in restraints. ""He is competent to proceed,"" Pietz told the court. He's no longer hearing voices, and he has no difficulty in understanding, Pietz said. Loughner is rational and able to consult with his attorneys, she said. Loughner also understands that he will never leave prison and has told Pietz: ""I'm 23 years old, this is it. This is my life."" Loughner is worried that he will be harmed by other inmates, but Pietz said she thinks Loughner would be all right in the general prison population. Loughner, however, is still on suicide watch, Pietz said. Pietz met Loughner in March 2011 and determined he had schizophrenia and wasn't competent to participate in court proceedings. She was the first doctor to diagnose him with a psychotic disease, Pietz said. Loughner was disappointed and upset upon hearing the diagnosis, Pietz said. Loughner said he wished he would have taken medication and that things might have been different. He started taking medication for the first time on June 21, 2011, and over time, he expressed remorse about what he did, Pietz testified. By July 9, 2011, Loughner expressed regret and ""assassination remorse,"" Pietz said. Loughner told Pietz that he was especially sad about the child killed in the shooting -- Christina Taylor Green, age 9, who was remembered nationally because she was born on September 11, 2001. Loughner also spoke with Pietz about Giffords. Pietz testified that Loughner told her: ""I know she's alive"" and ""there's no way she survived a shot to the head."" Loughner said he feels like he set out to do the shooting and failed, Pietz said. Loughner said if this is true, ""Jared is a failure,"" according to Pietz. In discussion with prison officials, Loughner has said, ""I'll never get out,"" Pietz testified. Loughner likes his prison jobs and he gets paid for them, which is important for him, Pietz said. The work makes him feel proud to do well in something, Pietz said. Pietz recounted Loughner's teenage years, saying that he appeared normal until age 16. Then he showed symptoms of depression in 2006, and his girlfriend broke up with him and a friend died, Pietz said. Loughner sought treatment and was diagnosed with depression, Pietz said. He saw a psychiatrist again after he was caught drunk at school, Pietz said. According to records, he didn't take his anti-depression medication, Pietz said. In high school, he began hearing voices and yelling out things in the classroom -- behaviors that are symptoms of schizophrenia, Pietz said. He wrote nonsensical things on the chalkboard, showed a disorganized thought process, and became obsessed with the Constitution, Pietz said. Friends feared he would commit suicide, Pietz said. Loughner became ostracized in high school, but at that point, there were no signs he would hurt anyone, Pietz said. Loughner's mental condition has been central to much of the related court proceedings since the shooting. In February, a federal judge ruled Loughner could receive medical treatment for another four months. A psychologist found ""measurable progress"" in the suspect's condition.

The guilty plea was part of an agreement that prevents him from facing the death penalty. With defense attorney Judy Clarke at his side, Loughner, wearing a khaki jail uniform, calmly answered questions from U.S. District Court Judge Larry A. Burns, saying that he understood the court rules and that he would plead guilty to 19 of the counts against him, with the other 30 counts to be dropped. Asked if he understood each charge as they were read, Loughner simply replied, “Yes, sir.” (MORE: The Real Lesson of the Tucson Tragedy) The verdict came on Tuesday after Burns was convinced that Loughner, 23, was competent to enter a plea and could understand the court proceedings, what he was accused of and the ramifications of his actions. The plea, following Loughner’s long-anticipated competency hearing, forgoes what was expected to be a lengthy trial that would have been draining on survivors and victims’ family members, many of whom attended the proceedings. While Loughner’s sentencing won’t be held until Nov. 15, he will likely spend the rest of his life behind bars, serving multiple life sentences with no possibility of parole. In court, he admitted to murdering a federal employee, attempted murder and causing death at a federally protected activity. “There’s no question in my mind Loughner understands what’s going on today,” Burns told the court. (PHOTOS: Gabby Giffords Bids Farewell to Congress) Loughner, who dropped out of a community college he attended for five years, has been held in a medical facility in Missouri since the shooting and was flown on Monday to Tucson to appear at the hearing. Experts have concluded that he suffers from schizophrenia, and they’ve kept him on psychotropic drugs for more than a year. The hearing, which began at 11 a.m. local time, started with testimony from Dr. Christina Pietz — a forensic psychologist who has been treating Loughner — who told the court that she felt Loughner was competent to stand trial. If he were sent to the general population in prison, she said, she has no concern that he would harm anyone else as long as he is given his medication. (PHOTOS: The World of Jared Lee Loughner) “My concern is someone will harm him,” she said. Pietz also testified that Loughner has a rational understanding of the proceedings and that he knows he will never leave prison. On Jan. 8, 2011, Loughner opened fire with a legally purchased semiautomatic pistol on a crowd gathered to hear Giffords speak at a “Congress on Your Corner” event in the parking lot of a Tucson supermarket. Before bystanders tackled and disarmed him, he managed to kill six people — among them U.S. District Judge John Roll and Giffords staffer Gabe Zimmerman — and wound 13 others, including Giffords, who suffered a serious brain injury. Loughner was later charged with 49 counts of murder and attempted murder. The shooting deaths of Roll and Zimmerman would have made him eligible for the death penalty, had he not entered the plea deal. In a statement released on Tuesday, Giffords supported the plea deal. “The pain and loss caused by the events of Jan. 8, 2011, are incalculable,” Giffords said in a joint statement with her husband Mark Kelly. “Avoiding a trial will allow us — and we hope the whole southern Arizona community — to continue with our recovery.” MORE: Messages for the Tucson Victims"

We've received your submission. The FBI last night arrested a Queens man who’s described as an adherent of the “sovereign citizen movement” after he threatened to launch an armed attack on a bank facility in Pennsylvania, The Post has learned. The FBI’s New York office is investigating the reported plan as a possible domestic terrorism threat, although the incident is linked to a business dispute. Michael Chung was arrested by agents at his home in Bayside, Queens, after he faxed a threat to a bank facility in Pottsville, Pa. – which lies roughly 100 miles northwest of Philadelphia. Chung “threatened to kill employees of Sovereign Bank,” including an attorney and a loss prevention officer, according to a federal complaint filed by an FBI agent. “The 2nd Amendment to the National Constitution authorizes the use of force to protect my interests as a national citizen. I believe I have a basis to act in that manner,” the fax said, according to the federal complaint. A source noted that authorities believe that Chung owns a legally registered shotgun. Law enforcement officials were particularly concerned about the threat in the wake of mass shooting incidents at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, and a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wis. The FBI believes that Chung belongs to a self-styled movement centering on the philosophy that members are only answerable to common law – and not subject to the jurisdiction of the US federal government. “He claims to be a ‘sovereign citizen,'” the person told The Post. Authorities believe that Chung focused on the bank because he’s was engaged in a business dispute with the institution regarding a loan had a taken out and was also linked to his efforts to sell his home, the person said. Chung was trying to sell his house, which he still owed $179,000 to the bank on. Authorities say that Chung was attempting to force the bank to cancel the oustanding balance on the home. He is scheduled to be arraigned later today in Brooklyn federal court. Adherents of the sovereign citizen movement – sometimes loosely referred to as “constitutionals” or “freeman” – occasionally challenge government authority in symbolic acts of defiance, experts say. “The FBI considers sovereign-citizen extremists as comprising a domestic terrorist movement, which, scattered across the United States, has existed for decades,” a report by the agency published last year said. Among those notable adherents were Terry Nichols, who helped plan the 1995 bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City, Okla. “Since 2000, lone-offender sovereign-citizen extremists have killed six law enforcement officers,” said the report, which was prepared by the FBI’s Counterterrorism Analysis Section. Movement adherents have been involved in past disputes with financial institutions and the Internal Revenue Service over issues of authority and beliefs connected to the historical linking of US currency to the “gold standard,” experts say. mmaddux@nypost.com Share Selection"

We've received your submission. PHOENIX — A psychological report released Thursday warned that while Jared Lee Loughner was competent to plead guilty in the Tucson mass shooting, he remained severely mentally ill and his mental condition could deteriorate under the stress of a trial. The report was prepared in late April by a federal Bureau of Prisons psychologist who testified in court Tuesday before a judge allowed Loughner to plead guilty in the January 2011 mass shooting. Psychologist Christina Pietz’s report said Loughner’s improved condition was due to medication. But because his condition could “wax and wane, I recommend the court expeditiously address issues related to his situation,” Pietz wrote. “Mr. Loughner is currently competent to proceed. However, because of his fragile mental state, there is no guarantee he will remain competent for an extended time.” Loughner pleaded guilty to 19 counts under a plea agreement that guarantees he will spend the rest of his life in prison. He is to be sentenced in November in the mass shooting that left six people dead and former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 12 others wounded. The report covering a period from late January to late April said Loughner generally was kept separate from other inmates at the Springfield, Mo., federal prison where he has been held nearly the entire time since the shooting. However, the report said Loughner participated in three separate competency restoration and recreational groups with small numbers of fellow mentally ill inmates. He also met several times a week with members of his legal defense team, the report said. Share Selection"

85411859,2012-08-13 00:13:00,"19 months after mass shooting, ex-Rep. Giffords moves back to Tucson",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_latest/~3/GgMkUzO_gUo/index.html,en,False,,1095,CNN,http://www.cnn.com/,"Nineteen months after she and 18 others were shot at a political event -- six of them fatally -- former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords returned home Sunday to her native southern Arizona, her husband said. Giffords has spent most of the time since the January 8, 2011, attack at medical facilities in Houston recovering from being shot in the head at a ""Congress On Your Corner"" event outside a Safeway supermarket in Tucson. She has returned to her hometown several times since that shooting, though not permanently until now. ""Moving back to Tucson today,"" her husband Mark Kelly, a retired Navy captain and astronaut, wrote Sunday on his Twitter feed. ""Gabby has been waiting for this day for a long time."" Records from the Pima County Assessor's Office posted online indicate that Kelly and Giffords bought a 10-room, single family residence in June in central Tucson. The couple paid $1.495 million in cash for the property, which sold for half that price in November 2007, the records show. Then in her third term, Giffords stepped down from her position in Congress in January 2012 to focus on her recovery. Ron Barber, a Giffords aide also wounded in the attack, now holds the seat. On Tuesday, Jared Lee Loughner pleaded guilty to 19 charges related to the incident. That included admitting to killing federal employees U.S. District Court Chief Judge John M. Roll and congressional aide Gabriel M. Zimmerman, as well as Dorothy Morris, Phyllis Schneck, Dorwan Stoddard and 9-year-old Christina Taylor Green. Federal prosecutors said that, under the plea deal, Loughner will be sentenced to life in prison with no eligibility for parole -- meaning he will not get the death penalty, as might have happened with a conviction. His sentencing is set for November 15, prosecutors said. The 23-year-old, whose legal proceedings had been complicated by questions about his mental health, waived his right to seek an insanity defense as part of his plea agreement. Court documents released a few days after the shooting showed that investigators found a letter from Giffords in a safe at the house where Loughner lived with his parents, thanking him for attending a 2007 event. ""Also recovered in the safe was an envelope with handwriting on the envelope stating 'I planned ahead,' and 'my assassination' and the name 'Giffords,' along with what appears to be Loughner's signature,"" the affidavit stated. Giffords worked at PricewaterhouseCoopers and as CEO of El Campo Tire, her family's business, before being elected to the Arizona House of Representatives in 2000. Two years later, she became the youngest woman elected to the Arizona State Senate. In an online video announcing her retirement from Congress earlier this year, Giffords vowed her public service career was not over. ""I will return, and we will work together for Arizona and this great country,"" she said."

And police Sgt. Chris Bolton quickly fired off a flurry of text alerts to thousands of nearby residents through a social media tool for law enforcement agencies. “Stay out of area,” said one alert. “Multiple shooting victims reported. Medical on-scene. Police are evacuating a nearby, affected business.” Officers would eventually discover a grisly scene inside a tiny Christian college on that spring day. Seven people were killed, three others wounded and dozens terrified in the deadliest mass shooting in the city’s history. Bolton later gave those on edge an update: “Possible suspect in custody. No imminent public safety threat appears to exist in immediate area.” Across the country, law officers are adding a new form of social media to their arsenal of crime fighting tools. Almost 6,000 law enforcement agencies are now using Nixle to provide residents with real-time alerts on crimes in progress, traffic messes and missing children. With the San Francisco-based service approaching 1 million subscribers, with police departments participating in major cities such as Chicago, Los Angeles, Baltimore and Dallas, it is part of what one expert calls a new “blue wave” of electronic community policing that lets cops reach out directly to the public. The International Association of Chiefs of Police recently found in a survey of 800 law enforcement agencies that nearly nine out of 10 use some form of social media and more than half reported that social media have helped solve crimes. Many of those agencies have boosted their social media presence significantly within the last two to three years, said Nancy Kolb, a senior program manager for the IACP. While many law enforcement agencies use Twitter and Facebook, and there are other public safety notification systems such as CodeRED, Nixle has become increasingly popular with law enforcement, said Lauri Stevens, a Massachusetts-based law enforcement social media strategist. Police officials say they particularly like Nixle security features that make it less susceptible to hacking than some social media. Also, the company has a partnership with the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (NLETS), which allows local, state, federal and international public safety agencies to exchange sensitive information. A private messaging system Nixle created has allowed authorities to use it at major events including the G-20 Summit, May Day immigration protests and even the Academy Awards. However, Nixle is not as interactive as some of the other social media networks, Stevens said. “The company has taken off like crazy and it helps law enforcement send information out, but it can’t get any answers back, so I don’t consider them social media in the true sense,” she said. “What Nixle has done right, though, is that they’ve got good buzz and are still building a huge customer base.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters"

85526200,2012-08-13 14:34:00,Mexican drug war's innocent victims: 'They tried to kill me with my kids',http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/13/mexican-drug-war-innocent-victims,en,False,,1751,Guardian US,https://www.theguardian.com/us,"Claims that 90% of Mexican drug war victims are criminals is a statistic far removed from Cristina Roman’s experience in a country where police and military have fallen into corruption Cristina Roman didn't know where to begin. When asked how the epic violence and criminal impunity in her native Ciudad Juarez invaded her own life, she paused, then asked: ""How far should I go back?"" She decided to begin from May 2010. It was then at the height of the bloodletting there in Mexico's deadliest city when, one night at 4am, she, her husband and three sons awoke to a terrible pounding at their front door. ""My husband went to see who they were. Then he said: 'Go hide with the kids. They have guns,'"" she recalled.  ""By the time I had my baby in my arms, the gunmen were already in the house."" Roman, 28, is a member of Mexicanos En Exilio – or ""Mexicans In Exile"" – a network of Mexican activists, journalists, politicos and ordinary working-class families like hers, who arrived in the United States seeking asylum from criminal assassins in Mexico. These are innocent victims of the Mexican drug war. In the words of their immigration lawyer, Carlos Spector, an immigration lawyer in El Paso, Texas, where most of these exiles end up, they ""risked their lives for truth and justice in Mexico"" and were ""forced to leave because of the Mexican government's failure or unwillingness to protect them"". Cristina's case is different, however. She didn't protest against corruption or document violence, but fell victim for a rather banal reason: being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The incident that put her in a drug cartel's crosshairs was a mass shooting she escaped as one of few surviving witnesses. From a small home in New Mexico, where she now lives in hiding, Cristina reflected on that event, but noted it wasn't her first brush with violence in Juarez. That's how she began describing the night three gunmen broke through her front door. Personal accounts like hers, while isolated, provide shocking glimpses of the trauma and tragedy that exist for people living amidst Mexico's brutal drug war. These stories also reveal a state of lawlessness that experts say is unlikely to stop any time soon. As gunman entered her home, Cristina told her sons, aged eight and six, to stay calm. The men soon called for her to come out. She did, and was immediately grabbed and thrown to the floor. The men then pistol-whipped her husband, who collapsed next to her. ""They asked for money, jewelry, car keys, everything they wanted,"" she recalled. ""I said: 'I don't know what you're looking for, but you can take whatever you want. I only want my children.'"" One man – ""El Vato"" – hovered over her saying he would execute them all. Another gunman then said: ""What are you doing? We came for him. Don't get out of control."" He said: ""Go to your kids' room, close the door, and no matter what you hear, don't leave, don't speak."" Cristina did as told. And for the next half hour heard them beating her husband. He groaned and wept through the assault as she huddled with their sons in silence. After 30 minutes, when the noise finally ceased, Cristina came out to the awful realization that her husband had been kidnapped. Two hours later, her brother-in-law received a phone call with ransom instructions. Cristina's husband owned a small used-car dealership, and over the next two days, she and her brother-in-law hustled to sell his lot, liquidate assets, raise funds, withdraw savings. ""We did everything we could to get all the money together and paid half the ransom the first day, the other half the second day,"" she said, her voice quivering. ""The third day they were supposed to return him and they didn't. The fourth day they threw his dead body in the street."" Mexican president Felipe Calderon often claims that 90% of the drug war victims are criminals. That vague sentencing of 60,000 people naturally enrages victims' families. Nik Steinberg, a Mexico researcher for Human Rights Watch, also disputes its validity. ""The government has not produced empirical evidence to back up this claim,"" he said. ""Instead what we have found in the overwhelming majority of killings in Mexico is that the government has not even opened a criminal investigation, let alone charged or sentenced someone."" The men who killed Cristina's husband were never brought to justice. There is no way to know whether they worked for the Zetas or Sinoloa cartels, which are active in Juarez Valley. That is a strong possibility, however. According to Ben West, an analyst for geopolitical intelligence firm Stratfor, the cartels have increasingly diversified their criminal activity to include extortion, kidnapping and human trafficking, in response to losses incurred in the drug trade. Ironically, this means that Mexican civilians are becoming victims of their government's success. West added: ""You have criminal groups taking advantage of the overall security situation and basically pulling people at gunpoint and saying give me your money. With the police all caught up in this, there is no rule of law."" Cristina took a job at a Juarez nightclub after her husband's murder. She went from stay-at-home mother to single breadwinner for three overnight, and moved in with her parents so they could help. And for almost a year, they managed. Then the cartel violence found her again. On 31 March, 2011, at about 8.30pm, a group of federal police officers entered the bar telling everyone to line up against the wall. Searching for weapons, they padded men between the legs, looked up women's skirts, emptied handbags and checked bathroom stalls. That level of scrutiny was unprecedented, Cristina said. At one point an officer even began groping a colleague of hers. She intervened, saying: ""Hey – we respect you and your work, you should respect us. You can't treat us like that."" The man backed off, but not before delivering an ominous message. ""You haven't seen anything yet,"" he said. ""The worst is yet to come."" And truly, it was. A few minutes after the police left, two men entered the bar carrying automatic weapons. A man near entrance lunged for the doorway and they shot him. ""That was the first person to go down,"" Cristina recalled. ""I dropped to the floor. Everyone was screaming with fear."" With ruthless abandon, the assassins opened fire in every direction, killing all they could, shooting everyone in sight. ""I could see people around me in pain, some people dead,"" Cristina recalled. At some point the men lit the bar on fire. A waitress next to Cristina ran as soon as they left, saying: ""I'd rather be shot to death than burn."" ""When it sounded like all the shooting had stopped, and you could smell the place was starting to burn, I had to go too,"" Cristina said. She ran outside, where several cars were on fire. She ran to the parking lot and suddenly froze when four pairs of headlights turned on. They were four federal police trucks. They had never left. ""The only thing I thought at that moment was: Sin Madre,"" she said – a phrase that literally means ""motherless"" but is also slang for ""goddammit."" Incredibly, municipal police pulled up just then. They jumped from their cars, hurling curses at their rivals. ""They turned their attention to them,"" Cristina said, referring to the federal police, who refused to let the responding officers through. ""That's the only reason I got away."" Despite serious efforts to purge corruption from their ranks, reports of Mexican law enforcement engaged in criminal activity are rampant. ""What mostly happens is police officers work by day for the city, then as a side job also do security for the cartels,"" said West, of Strator. ""And that obviously creates all sorts of conflicts of interest."" ""All levels of police are implicated,"" he added. ""But what is probably most alarming is that the military is also falling into corruption. The government is running out of tools to fight this problem."" Cristina showed great poise escaping the El Castillo bar massacre; she fell into a daze, however, immediately afterward. ""I was just wandering,"" she said, ""lost, till 4am when I finally got back to the house."" The following day, three survivors gave statements to police about the event. Too intimidated, Cristina refused. She had no plans to talk, but that wouldn't make a difference, unfortunately. About a week later, a friend from the bar – another survivor – called Cristina to warn her that ""sicarios"" – assassins – were asking for them at nightclubs downtown. Cristina had no intention of going to work at a nightclub again. ""I just couldn't,"" she said. Nevertheless, they found her one afternoon driving on a highway. They drove a Dodge Ram, and tried to bully her toward the shoulder. They wore masks, her son said, and tried to run her off the road but somehow she pulled away. ""I'm still not sure how I managed to keep control of the car,"" she said. ""They tried to kill me with my kids."" She stayed up that night thinking about what to do. ""It had gotten to the point where I was very scared, always worried that people were looking for me,"" she said. ""I was terrified for my children."" ""I talked to my oldest son Raul about the possibility of coming to the US,"" she recalled. ""I thought about it all night, and then on the 13 April I took my boys and what I could pack and went to the bridge."" According to the department of homeland security, 4,400 Mexican nationals have applied for US asylum in 2012. That number already exceeds the 4,000 requests filed in 2011, and is more than three times the 1,200 made in 2005, before the drug war began. These people represent a fraction of the displaced, of course. And only a fraction of them will see their requests granted. Over the past six years, only 11% of asylum cases from Mexican nationals were granted. And that average is trending downward. As Crystal Massey, an activist in Spector's office, explained: ""Unless you can show that you belong to a particular social group that is not the whole country right now, you don't qualify for asylum."" Cristina's first hearing is this fall. With federal police implicated in the massacre she witnessed, she hopes a immigration judge will find her government complicit in her persecution. Her mother, sister, brother-in-law and nephews will go through asylum hearings too. They followed Cristina across the border after their own tragic run in with ""sicarios"". Gunman showed up at their door recently demanding to know Cristina's US address. Her father refused to reveal it, and for his loyalty he was taken with the promise that the rest of the family was next. Her father was never seen again and is assumed killed. When asked for her full name and age – ""Cristina Roman Dozal, 28"" – Cristina offered his name too: ""Manuel Roman."" And it's deaths like his, and her husband's, and the ruthless killings of innocents at the El Castillo bar that cause Cristina to grow upset when confronted by the claim that 90% of Mexican drug war victims are criminals. ""In their crossfire they're getting innocent people. In the bar where I worked, maybe they were going after one bad person, but they killed innocent people too. And then there is more bloodshed when they pursue the witnesses,"" she said, her voice quivering. ""They go for a person, kill their mother, kill their brother. They kill lots of innocent people. They killed my father. It just keeps spreading out and it's mostly innocent people."""

Arapahoe County District Judge William Sylvester denied the request by KUSA-TV, The Denver Post and Colorado Public Radio for expanded coverage. KUSA is owned by Gannett, the publisher of USA TODAY. Sylvester said he considered objections by Holmes' court-appointed attorneys but did not specifically state why he would not allow cameras in the courtroom next week, the Post notes. One still camera and one video camera were allowed Monday during his initial court appearance, giving the public its first pictures of the 24-year-old San Diego native and former graduate student accused of killing 12 and wounding 58 early Friday at an Aurora multiplex. Holmes' defense team had also objected to having cameras in the court Monday. Sylvester said he weighed Colorado court rules that consider whether ""there is a reasonable likelihood that expanded media coverage would interfere with the rights of the parties to a fair trial; whether there is a reasonable likelihood that expanded media coverage would unduly detract from the solemnity, decorum and dignity of the court; and whether expanded media coverage would create adverse effects which would be greater than those caused by traditional media coverage.""  Beyond the courtroom today, some of those wounded while watching The Dark Knight Rises got a surprise visit from another VIP: Christian Bale. The Batman star spent 2½ hours with seven patients at the Medical Center of Aurora, including two who came from the affiliated Swedish Medical Center, the Post writes. He and his wife also met with doctors, Aurora police officers and emergency medical technicians who responded to the shootings. ""It was good for the patients,"" said Bill Voloch, the medical center's interim president. ""We hope it was therapeutic for them, and all the staff really appreciated him coming.""

Though he supports the Second Amendment right to bear arms, Obama told members of the National Urban League last night, ""I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals."" ""I believe the majority of gun owners would agree that we should do everything possible to prevent criminals and fugitives from purchasing weapons,"" Obama said less than a week after the shooting at a theater in Aurora, Colo. ""That we should check someone's criminal record before they can check out a gun seller; that a mentally unbalanced individual should not be able to get his hands on a gun so easily. ""These steps shouldn't be controversial,"" Obama said at the Urban League convention in New Orleans. ""They should be common sense."" Obama and aides have signaled they do not plan to unveil a package of gun control legislation in the wake of the Aurora attack. They emphasize improvements to the background check system that the president pitched after the mass shooting in Tucson in early 2011. It would be difficult to get new gun legislation through a divided Congress. Leaders in the Republican-run House have said they will oppose any such measures. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney says new gun laws are not the answer to what happened in Colorado. ""A lot of what this young man did was clearly against the law,"" Romney told NBC News. ""The fact that it was against the law did not prevent it from happening."" Citing the opposition in Congress, Obama told the National Urban League audience, ""I'm going to continue to work with members of both parties, and with religious groups and with civic organizations, to arrive at a consensus around violence reduction -- not just of gun violence, but violence at every level, on every step, looking at everything we can do to reduce violence and keep our children safe.""

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. KINGS POINT, N.Y. – A professor at the United States Merchant Marine Academy faces dismissal for joking about the Colorado movie theater shootings in front of his students, including one whose father was among the victims. According to an internal personnel document obtained by The New York Times (http://nyti.ms/NCVm4f ), Gregory F. Sullivan was suspended from his tenured position as humanities instructor for telling his classroom before showing a documentary: ""If someone with orange hair appears in the corner of the room, run for the exit."" James Holmes, the suspect in the Aurora, Colo., mass shooting, has dyed his hair bright orange. The professor had just turned down the lights to show the documentary and was preparing to step out for a few minutes when he made the remark. Shashi Kumar, the institution's academic dean, called the joke ""notoriously disgraceful conduct"" and recommended that Sullivan be fired. The internal document said Sullivan was informed on Aug. 10 that he had 10 days to contest his dismissal. The document also said Sullivan had been unaware that the father of one of his students was killed in the shootings. It said he immediately apologized to the student after being told of his loss. He also offered apologies to the entire class and the administration. But the notice also said the professor should have been aware of the student's loss because the school had sent an email about it on July 25 and the student had been absent for a few days. It said Sullivan also had given two other students permission to miss class to attend a funeral in Colorado. Sullivan declined to comment to the Times, saying faculty were not allowed to comment to the media without the school's permission. B. Robert Kreiser, a senior program officer in the department of academic freedom, tenure and governance at the American Association of University Professors, told the Times that a tenured professor would generally receive a faculty committee hearing before charges would be brought. ""Given that it was single remark — an indefensible remark, but nonetheless a single remark for which he has apologized — it's hard to imagine why the administration decided he should be suspended"" in the interim, he said. The civilian academy, which is on Long Island and is run by the U.S. Transportation Department, has about 1,000 students who are trained for careers in the marine trade. Its faculty members are federal employees. ___ Information from: The New York Times, http://www.nytimes.com ___ Information from: The New York Times, http://www.nytimes.com Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox Subscribed You've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!

Loughner's plea Tuesday allows him to avoid the death penalty in a mass shooting that gained worldwide attention in January 2011 because his intended target was the congresswoman. Among the dead were Arizona's chief federal judge and a Giffords' aide. Federal Judge Larry A. Burns had found that Loughner was mentally unfit to stand trial. He ruled on Tuesday that months of forcibly medicating him to treat his schizophrenia made him competent to understand the gravity of the charges against him and assist in his own defense. Loughner is expected to be sentenced to life in prison without parole. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below. Former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords is satisfied with Tuesday's expected plea agreement from the man accused of shooting her and many others in a deadly rampage at one of her political events, and she hopes it will allow victims of the mass shooting to move on with their lives. Jared Lee Loughner is expected to plead guilty in federal court in Tucson, Ariz., as part of an agreement that will allow him to avoid the death penalty in the shooting that left six people dead, including a federal judge, and wounded Giffords and 12 others. ""The pain and loss caused by the events of Jan. 8, 2011, are incalculable,"" Giffords said in a joint statement with her husband, Mark Kelly. ""Avoiding a trial will allow us - and we hope the whole Southern Arizona community - to continue with our recovery."" Later Tuesday, the legal team defending Loughner will have to convince a judge that he is competent enough to enter a plea. The 23-year-old college dropout is scheduled to attend a hearing during which his attorneys and prosecutors will try to persuade U.S. District Court Judge Larry A. Burns that Loughner is no longer mentally unfit for trial. Experts had concluded that Loughner suffers from schizophrenia, and officials at a federal prison have forcibly medicated him with psychotropic drugs for more than a year. A court-appointed psychiatrist is expected to testify Tuesday that he is competent to enter a plea. If Burns agrees, as legal experts expect, a formal change-of-plea hearing will follow. That's when those in the court will hear from Loughner at length for the first time, as the judge questions him about the agreement and changing his plea to guilty. Burns may ask Loughner to recite his actions in his own words, but either his lawyer or the federal prosecutor could just read the facts of the January 2011 shooting spree at a Tucson supermarket, where Giffords was holding a meet-and-greet with constituents. Either way, Loughner will be asked to acknowledge that he shot and killed six people, including the top federal judge in Arizona, and wounded 13 others, including Giffords. He'll need to convince Burns he understands what is going on, what he's doing and what he did. Loughner could break down, change his mind about pleading guilty or show so little understanding of what he's doing that Burns rejects the plea, lawyers not involved in the case said Monday. ""The fact that there is this planned change of plea is no guarantee that it will go forward,"" said Paul Charlton, a former U.S. attorney for Arizona. ""There are any number of things that would happen that would either cause it to be removed from the calendar or not go forward at all."" The plea agreement that is expected to be made public on Tuesday would see Loughner sentenced to life in prison, taking the possibility of the death penalty off the table in the federal case, a person familiar with the case told The Associated Press on Saturday. The person was not authorized to discuss the case publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. An agreement that would spare Loughner the death penalty offers something for both sides, said Quin Denvir, a California defense attorney who has worked with Loughner attorney Judy Clarke on the case against unabomber Ted Kaczynski. Prosecutors would avoid a potentially lengthy and costly trial and appeal, knowing that the defendant will be locked up for life. Clarke managed to avoid the death penalty for other high-profile clients such as Kaczynski and Eric Rudolph, who bombed abortion clinics in the late 1990s and Atlanta's Olympic park in 1996. The top prosecutor in southern Arizona's Pima County said last year that she may file state charges in the case that could carry the death penalty. An official in the prosecutor's office, Amelia Craig Cramer, declined to comment, saying the office did not have an active prosecution against Loughner. Denvir said it was possible that the plea agreement calls for the state to avoid pursuing criminal charges against Loughner, though that's not a given. ""Ideally (as a defense attorney) you'd like to have it resolved all at once, but sometimes you have to take one at a time,"" he said. The decision to spare Loughner a federal death sentence makes sense, said Dale Baich, a federal public defender in Phoenix who handles capital case appeals and isn't involved in the case. ""As time went on and there were numerous evaluations, I think everybody had a better understanding of Mr. Loughner's mental illness."" Baich said. He added: ""It appears that he will need to be treated for the rest of his life in order to remain competent."" ___ Christie reported from Phoenix.

The first, most natural and most important emotion felt is intense grief. The victims and families affected by the unexplainable violence are the ultimate priority. There is little to reconcile their losses, but prayers, donations and comforting words have been offered in attempts from those all over the country. In a continuing attempt to comfort, many then look for answers. The ""how?"" and ""why?"" behind the massacre are scrutinized, resulting in theories, debates and more questions. James Holmes was arrested on the scene, leading to more pinpointed questions about his motive. His race, intellectual experience and lack of criminal history are circumscribed with speculations, and his recent appearance in court has seemed to create even more confusion to onlookers. The logistics behind the attack, involving assault rifles and toxic gases, then sparked a new debate as to how he attained these. And the gun control debate has been reenergized just in time for the upcoming election. But the argument has more than likely reached a standstill because, while access to weapons like guns is seemingly easy in America, the right to bear arms is an amendment -- a sticky situation both parties will purposefully skirt around. Yet amidst the horror of innocent deaths, crazy killers and gun violence, many still sidled into the movie theaters to watch the Hollywood flick, one that coincidently was filled with innocent deaths, crazy killers and guns, bombs and violence. And ""Batman"" is not alone. A new Bourne Identity movie is on its way, along with action flicks like The Expendables and Assassins Bullet, all filled with intense scenes of gun-induced deaths. The violence in these films and others, as well as TV shows and video games, has reached a state of normalcy for many of us, even classified as ""entertainment."" I myself enjoy the Bourne series, and I'm planning on seeing The Dark Knight Rises this coming weekend. But when the violence we see on the screen breaks the fourth wall and turns into reality, there is a stark difference, void of any entertainment. Before we start to blame the guns (rather than the people behind them) and the free choice to own them (which is in the Constitution), we should consider what images of guns are most common to Americans. Most will probably revert to the images on the screen in front of us, rather than the ranch or skeet range miles away. The correlation between the violence on the screen and the violence of James Holmes does not justify his actions. The victims were innocent and unarmed, and the suspect's actions were beyond horrendous. My prayers continue to reside with the community of Aurora. Yet Americans must realize we are becoming an increasingly violent country. Consistently surrounding ourselves with images of death and destruction threatens to desensitize us even further. Unfortunately, it's only until instances like that of Aurora, and Tuscaloosa earlier last week, that make us realize what a gunshot actually means. University of Alabama student newspaper"

89194588,2012-07-27 13:39:05,Jonathan Kim:  ReThink Review:  The Watch ,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jonathan-kim/the-watch-review_b_1710631.html,en,False,,27502,HuffPost,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/#,"Movie Critic for ReThink Reviews Most people probably hadn't heard of the comedy The Watch until the Trayvon Martin shooting in Florida on February 26. That's because the comedy about a group of flawed men unexpectedly fighting off an alien invasion in their quiet, suburban enclave was originally called Neighborhood Watch, but 20th Century Fox decided to change the name after it was revealed that Martin's killer, George Zimmerman, was the coordinator of his community's neighborhood watch. Zimmerman saw confronting and ultimately killing Martin as part of his watch duties and continues to claim that he's done nothing wrong. This was a cautious, probably smart move by 20th Century Fox, even though the fact that Zimmerman was in a neighborhood watch has probably faded from most memories. And The Watch, which obviously has nothing to do with the Martin murder, ultimately succeeds as a good, silly comedy about a group of misfits getting more than they bargained for as they attempt to fill what's missing in their lives through supposedly manly pursuits. However, there's a scene in The Watch -- which stars Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill, and Richard Ayoade -- that did make me think of the Martin shooting, as well as a more recent tragedy that, in many ways, is still playing out. Watch the trailer for The Watch below. Hill's character, Franklin, is a young man who lives with his mother and is described as the group's ""wild card."" Franklin -- who wears an army jacket, has a military-style haircut and has a habit of playing with and brandishing a butterfly knife -- has been deemed unfit (both physically and mentally) to join the police or any other law enforcement agency. And he clearly has a chip on his shoulder about it, evidenced by his testy exchanges with a smug local policeman played by Will Forte. At one point, as the group prepares to confront the aliens, Franklin reveals that he has an arsenal of weaponry hidden under his bed. Like Franklin, Zimmerman was interested in joining law enforcement and was also known to be a hothead who'd been arrested for shoving a cop, had a restraining order taken out against him by his ex-fiancée and lost his job as a security guard due to his unpredictable temper. In that sense, it's easy to imagine Franklin acting a lot like Zimmerman, a guy who would bring a gun on a neighborhood watch patrol, aggressively confront someone he deemed suspicious and be willing to escalate a situation with deadly force. And of course, it's hard to see Franklin's arsenal of ostensibly legally-obtained guns without thinking of the recent mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, where a young man named James Holmes legally bought military-grade weapons, tactical gear and 6,000 rounds of ammunition and used them to kill 12 people and wound 58 in a crowded movie theater. In The Watch, Franklin's guns are used to try to prevent an alien invasion, but if there were no aliens, isn't it natural to wonder, especially after the Aurora massacre, if we'd really want someone like Franklin to have an arsenal like that? I enjoyed The Watch and expect it to do well, both for the quality of its humor and the fact that it's the only comedy being released this week. I don't believe that violent entertainment causes violent behavior, and I actually believe that, like sports, they can be a safe and healthy outlet for aggressive behavior. After all, the world was plenty violent (probably more so) before violent movies and first person shooters were ever invented. But no one can deny that America is a country uniquely obsessed with guns, to the point that one of our two political parties feels that one of America's most important freedoms is being able to own as many of whatever kind of gun you want with few or no restrictions on who can own them and where they can carry them. If American entertainment is seen as too violent, I see that as a reflection of our gun- and military-worshipping culture, not the cause of it. And if people copy the violence they see in movies, the problem is not the movies, but people who can't tell fantasy from reality, and the ease with which our gun laws allow those people to arm themselves to the teeth. The Watch is obviously fiction, but sadly, when unstable people can buy such powerful weapons, we need to do more than just hope that they'll only be aimed at bad guys and aliens. I don't think 20th Century Fox was insensitive or remiss, and The Watch really is a lot of fun. It's just that, after recent events, the idea of angry, heavily-armed young men who stockpile weapons just isn't as funny as it used to be. Follow ReThink Reviews on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.

Kaleka pointed out there were no homes nearby with flags, and he wanted to show that the United States was a land of opportunity, said his son, Amardeep Kaleka. The elder Kaleka, 65, served as president of the Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Milwaukee, scene of Sunday morning's mass shooting.  He was one of six community members killed. Sikhs react to the Wisconsin temple shooting ""He lived the American dream,"" Amardeep Kaleka told CNN. His father brought his family to the United States with little money but a strong work ethic in the early 1980s. The flag also was a form of protection for the family, Satwant Kaleka told them. It stood at half-staff Monday evening as the family grieved. The six killed in Sunday's attack were identified by police as five men -- Kaleka; Sita Singh, 41; Ranjit Singh, 49; Prakash Singh, 39, and Suveg Singh, 84 -- and a woman, 41-year-old Paramjit Kaur. ""She was a good woman.  She was a great mom,"" said Kaur's son, Harpreet Saini, 18. Kaur and her family immigrated to the United States eight years ago. ""She lived for us.  She worked for us.  Anything she did, it was for us,"" said her older son Kamal Saini, 20.  ""If there wasn't enough to eat it was always us before she ate."" When Kaur was in the temple praying on Sunday, ""My aunt told her that there was a shooting going on outside, we need to get up and leave,"" said Kamal Saini.  ""Rather than just getting up and leaving, she wanted to just bow down and pray for the last time and then get up and leave.  She was just getting up.  She was shot in the back."" Her dream was for her sons to be educated.  ""She told us education is everything here,"" said Kamal Saini. His mother's death ""took my world away,"" he said. Both young men plan to pursue careers in law enforcement.  ""I wanted her to see me in uniform,"" Kamal Saini said. Another victim, Suveg Singh, spent every day at the temple, said his granddaughter, Sandeep Khattra. ""He is always there, and he's with the community and anybody who is willing to listen,"" said Khattra. ""He educated them about our religion."" Belief blog: Who are Sikhs? The victim's family told CNN they will return to their temple. His son, Baljander Singh Khattra, said Suveg Singh was friendly and a ""very strong person."" Prakash Singh was a priest who recently immigrated to the United States with his wife and two young children, said Justice Singh Khalsa, a temple member since the 1990s. Amardeep Kaleka said people called to tell him that his father saved many lives Sunday. The son said he was not surprised his father tried to stop the gunman at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin. ""It's an amazing act of heroism, but it's also exactly who he was,"" Amardeep Kaleka told CNN Milwaukee affiliate WTMJ. ""There was no way in God's green Earth that he would allow somebody to come in and do that without trying his best to stop it."" Remembering the victims Amardeep Kaleka said the FBI told him his father attacked the shooter in the lobby, resulting in a ""blood struggle."" A knife close to the victim's body showed blood on it, he said. ""From what we understand, he basically fought to the very end and suffered gunshot wounds while trying to take down the gunman,"" said Kanwardeep Singh Kaleka, Satwant's nephew. Satwant Kaleka's wife, Satpal, hid with several other women, telling them to remain quiet during the horrific incident. The gunman came into the kitchen and shot and wounded two women, she told CNN. ""I grabbed everybody and said run, run to the pantry."" Amardeep Kaleka said his father worked hard and was an honest man. ""I would love for them (the public) to know that he lived his life with the principles that he knew and he was taught at a young age. It made him highly successful in America."" President Barack Obama signed a proclamation honoring the victims, ordering that U.S. flags be flown at half-staff at federal facilities and buildings. Vigils were held Monday night, and one is set for Tuesday. The Sikh temple in Brookfield, northwest of Oak Creek, was to hold a candlelight vigil late Monday. The Rev. Paul Armstrong of Oak Creek Community United Methodist Church, site of a Monday evening prayer vigil, said the diverse array of faiths in the community have an opportunity to further deepen bonds. ""There's a few of us who will be calling folks together to organize some more interfaith services,"" he told CNN. Opinion: An American tradition of bigotry ""Being in mission to the world is something we share,"" Armstrong said of his faith and the Sikh community. ""Their hospitality is wonderful. That is something the Christian community is called to do."" The vigil was held outdoors, and a survivor of the temple shooting spoke, according to Armstrong. ""The focus was to express our sorrow and that all of us can be lights of the world,"" he said. Navdeep Singh, a policy adviser to the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund, says Sikhs believe in freedom of religion, community service and inclusiveness. At temples, or gurdwaras, where Sikhs hold services, everyone is welcome. ""You can come and be equal,"" he says. Opinion: Sikh temple shooting is act of terrorism"

Gov. David Dewhurst and former state Solicitor General Ted Cruz, who accused each other of lying about their respective records and waging a media war marked by untruth and insult. Sponsored by the King Street Patriots, a Houston-based tea party organization, the hourlong debate before an audience of more than 300 offered mostly nuanced differences on the issues. The conversation grew heated when Cruz accused Dewhurst of running a dirty campaign. Each is seeking to be the GOP choice to succeed the retiring U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison. “You know, I think you can tell a lot about a candidate by how they conduct their campaign,” Cruz said. “From day one my campaign has kept the focus on the issues. ... Unfortunately, the lieutenant governor has not reciprocated. He has spent over $10 million of his vast personal fortune flooding the airwaves with false, personal attack ads maligning my character.” Cruz said his father, a Cuban immigrant, received a Dewhurst mailer this week that accused his opponent of being unpatriotic. “You know, one of the worst things you can say in politics is to malign someone's patriotism, and yet what the lieutenant governor sent to my father was a mailer that said, quote, ‘Ted Cruz worked against our country.' “I have to say, Mr. Lieutenant Governor, you're better than that,” Cruz added. “I have been running FOR the United States Senate,” Dewhurst responded, “telling people why I'm running and why they ought to vote for me. Since day one my opponent has been running against me. I talk about policy, I talk about solutions, I talk about answers.” Although the audience had been told in advance not to applaud or audibly respond to the candidates' remarks, an audience member shouted “Not true” as Dewhurst spoke. Later in the debate, an audience member yelled “Liar.” The candidates ignored the outbursts. On the issues, each candidate sought to portray himself as the most conservative. Dewhurst said his first act as a U.S. senator would be to vote to repeal what he called Obamacare. “Throw it in the trash heap of history, bad history,” he said. “I would keep not a single word of Obamacare,” Cruz said. “The Supreme Court's decision upholding it was a tragic day for liberty.” Asked about illegal immigration, Dewhurst called for tripling the size of the Border Patrol. Cruz agreed. “We need to do everything humanly possible to secure the border,” he said. “That means fences, that means walls, that means technology like helicopters and drones with infrared and that means boots on the ground, securing the border and tripling the U.S. Border Patrol.” Asked about gun control in light of Friday's mass shooting at an Aurora, Colo., theater, both men expressed their fealty to gun rights. “Sadly,” Cruz said, “when there is an evil act by a deranged individual, you see those with political agendas try to capitalize on it by violating our rights. I am a passionate believer in the Second Amendment.” “There's no question that what happened in Aurora is terrible,” Dewhurst said, “but this deranged individual should not be a catalyst for changing our fundamental rights. I am a strong believer in the Second Amendment.” Although the lieutenant governor received a polite reception, most of the audience seemed to favor Cruz, a tea party favorite who has pulled ahead in recent polls. “I think he articulates very well what he believes,” said Brent Johnson, a Houston investment counselor. “As he said, we need someone who will go up there and fight.” Olivia Pelech, a stay-at-home mom, said she supports Cruz because he will keep the nation from going the way of Europe, “where liberties are being stripped away every day. If we don't elect strong, principled leaders, we're going to suffer the same fate.” Early voting for the July 31 GOP runoff began Monday and ends Friday.  joe.holley@chron.com twitter.com/holleynews"

Twelve people died in the shooting at a showing of the new Batman film ""The Dark Knight Rises"" in Aurora, Colo., early Friday morning. A law enforcement source told Orr the shooting appears to have been carried out by a lone gunman. One federal official told CBS News that at this time Holmes appears to have been ""under the radar."" CBS News reports Holmes doesn't appear to have a criminal record in Colorado or in San Diego, Calif., where he graduated from high school in 2006. Pentagon officials said there is no record of Holmes having served in any branch of the military. San Diego police read a statement from Holmes' California family saying that their hearts go out to those involved. They say they're cooperating with authorities in San Diego and Aurora and are trying to process everything. San Diego police spokeswoman Andra Brown said there's nothing to suggest the family had any involvement. Tom Mai, a retired electrical engineer who lives next door to Holmes' family, told The Associated Press that Holmes was a loner. Mai said he said hello to Holmes once in a while, but he seemed to be shy. The mother told Mai that Holmes couldn't find a job after graduating from a public university in California. The University of California, Riverside, confirmed to CBS News that Holmes graduated in 2010 with a bachelor's degree in neuroscience. The family lives on a quiet, well-to-do San Diego street of two-story homes with red tile roofs. Mai said the family lived there about 10 years. The mother is a nurse and the father is a manager at a software company. The suspect has a younger sister. According to the University of Colorado, Denver, Holmes was in the process of dropping out of the school's graduate program in neurosciences. School spokeswoman Jacque Montgomery said in a statement that Holmes enrolled at the school in June 2011. She didn't say why he was withdrawing. Aurora shooting witnesses describe panic, chaosMass shooting at Batman premiere near DenverBloomberg calls on Obama, Romney to talk gun control There was no immediate word of any motive for the attack. Federal law enforcement officials were briefed on the attack, but at this point there is no indication it is terrorism-related, CBS News senior correspondent John Miller reports.    CBS News has learned that some loud music blaring from Holmes' apartment around the time of the attack was designed to draw a noise complaint from a neighbor, thus luring police into his residence, sparking a firebomb and diverting resources from the movie theater. Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates said it could take hours or days to safely enter the apartment. Police recovered four guns at the theater, including two pistols, a shotgun and an assault rifle, Oates told reporters at a news conference. All four guns were purchased legally at three Colorado gun stores between May 22 and July 6, Orr reports. Authorities also recovered a ballistic helmet and a gas mask. A law enforcement source told CBS News investigative producer Pat Milton that the attack appears to have been planned well in advance. Holmes parked his vehicle at the rear of the Century 16 theaters at the Aurora Mall and entered the theater through an emergency door in the back. He exited through the same door and was apprehended without incident. The violent and chaotic scene erupted about 12:30 a.m. local time as the gunman stood at the front of the theater. Witnesses reported that the gunman threw a gas canister before opening fire. ""Witnesses tell us he released some sort of canister. They heard a hissing sound and some gas emerged and the gunman opened fire,"" Oates said. Police, ambulances and emergency crews swarmed on the scene after frantic calls started flooding the 911 switchboard, officials said. Officers found Holmes near a car behind the theater. It was the worst mass shooting in the United States since 32 people were killed on the Virginia Tech campus in 2007. It was the worst in Colorado since the Columbine High School massacre on April 20, 1999. Students Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, opened fire at the school in the Denver suburb of Littleton, about 15 miles west of Aurora, killing 12 classmates and a teacher and wounding 26 others before killing themselves in the school's library. The shooting occurred in Theater 9, which has a capacity of around 300 people, according to CBS Denver station KCNC-TV. Victims were rushed to six area hospitals. Sixteen of the wounded were listed in critical condition, CBS News correspondent Barry Petersen reports. The youngest reported victim is a 4-month-old, who was treated and released from University Hospital. Another victim is a 6-year-old being treated at Children's Hospital, where a total of six victims were taken. Their condition wasn't known. Victims were being treated for chemical exposure apparently related to canisters thrown by the gunman.Corbin Dates told Petersen he saw a man take a phone call by the emergency exit and possibly try to signal or look for somebody during the movie's opening credits. After the movie started, the emergency exit door swung open. ""Somebody walks in dressed all in black, helmet, gas mask, black outfit, you cannot see anything but the person's eyes,"" said Dates, ""and there was a gas can that was thrown into the audience behind me. It went off. I thought it was a stunt of the movie, so I didn't think anything serious of it once it went off."" When gunshots went off, Dates and his friend dropped to the floor and started to crawl through the theater, he said. ""I felt the caps from the bullets burn my leg,"" Dates said. William Kent, who was in an adjacent theater, said bullets came through the wall but with the action on screen, people didn't realize what was happening. ""And they started the fire alarm or the emergency alarm, said that there had been something that happened in the building and evacuated everybody. There was a huge commotion to get out of the theater. When I exited, there were police officers with assault rifles running in,"" Kent told CBS News. (Watch at left) ""From what I saw, she had two bullet wounds in her leg and just blood all over her stomach. Her friends were all just yelling, crying. ... We were just all pretty much in shock,"" he said on ""CBS This Morning."" The police said 10 victims died at the theater and two at area hospitals. Aurora is located on the southeast outskirts of Denver, about 10 miles from downtown. President Obama addressed the shooting from Fort Myers, Fla., calling for a moment of silence. ""There are going to be other days for politics,"" Mr. Obama said. ""This, I think, is a day for prayer and reflection."" The president thanked the gathered crowd and told them he was grateful for their support. ""I was looking forward to having a fun conversation with you about some really important matters we face as a country ... the differences between myself and my opponent in this election,"" he said. ""But this morning we woke up to news of a tragedy that reminds us of all the ways we are united as one American family."" Republican challenger Mitt Romney embraced the same sentiment of unity in Bow, N.H., where he had been scheduled to campaign. ""We'll all spend a little less time thinking about the worries of our day and more time wondering about how to help those who are in need of compassion most,"" he said in brief remarks to a subdued audience. ""The answer is that we can come together. We will show our fellow citizens the good heart of the America we know and love. Mr. Obama canceled a second appearance scheduled near Orlando, Fla., and was returning to Washington. Romney, too, canceled some media interviews. And both candidates moved to pull ads against each other airing in Colorado. Warner Bros., which produced ""The Dark Knight Rises"" said the company was ""deeply saddened to learn about this shocking incident. We extend our sincere sympathies to the families and loved ones of the victims at this tragic time.""

573482089,2012-08-01 04:21:10,Josh Horwitz:  Aurora's Hard Truth: Mental Health Screening for Gun Buyers Is Nearly Non-Existent,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/josh-horwitz/auroras-hard-truth-mental_b_1727695.html,en,False,,27502,HuffPost,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/#,"Executive Director, Coalition to Stop Gun Violence If you learn only one new thing about America's gun laws after the gruesome mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, learn this: Even when individuals do undergo a background check when buying a gun in this country, the screening for mental health history is cursory at best. You don't need to submit to a background check to buy a gun, of course. Currently, Americans can buy firearms through ""private sales"" in more than 40 states without undergoing any type of screening at all. The law requires background checks only for guns sold by federally licensed firearm dealers (FFLs), allowing those not ""engaged in the business"" of dealing firearms to do so without conducting background checks or maintaining any records of sale. How do we know who is ""engaged in the business""? We don't (the IRS isn't looking at anyone's tax returns to find out), at least until guns start turning up at crime scenes and an investigation is opened by law enforcement. One study estimated that private sales account for 40% of all gun sales in the United States. When an individual purchases a firearm from an FFL, however, he must undergo a criminal background check. First, the buyer fills out a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) Form 4473 by hand, providing simple yes or no answers to a series of questions about criminal, mental health and substance abuse history. The dealer then queries the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) database maintained by the FBI via a toll-free telephone number or through the NICS E-Check System online (in a handful of states the dealer contacts the state police who in turn contact NICS). This instant computer check searches the NICS database for any disqualifying records that would prohibit that individual from buying a gun. During the check, the system does not disclose to gun dealers any actual information about these records. Dealers are simply seeing one of three responses from NICS on their computer screen: proceed, denied or delayed. If a potential gun buyer is denied, the FFL is never informed of the reason. The specific disqualifications related to mental health are quite narrow. Under federal law, an individual is prohibited from buying or possessing firearms if they have been ""adjudicated as a mental defective"" or ""committed to a mental institution."" A person is ""adjudicated as a mental defective"" if a court -- or other entity having legal authority to make adjudications -- has made a determination that an individual, as a result of mental illness: 1) Is a danger to himself or to others; 2) Lacks the mental capacity to contract or manage his own affairs; 3) Is found insane by a court in a criminal case, or incompetent to stand trial, or not guilty by reason of lack of mental responsibility pursuant to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. A person is ""committed to a mental institution"" if that person has been involuntarily committed to a mental institution by a court or other lawful authority. This expressly excludes voluntary commitment. If a person falls under one of these two categories, they are prohibited from purchasing and possessing firearms for life -- although federal law now allows states to establish procedures for such individuals to restore their right to purchase or possess firearms. Many states have done so at the behest of the National Rifle Association, with questionable results. There is no guarantee, however, that a formal record of adjudication or involuntary commitment will find its way into the NICS database. Often disqualifying mental health records go unreported by the states. In Colorado, for example, only about 1% of people who have disqualifying mental health histories have been reported to NICS. Another problem is that few Americans suffering from serious mental illness ever come into contact with the ""system"" or receive treatment for their condition(s). According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), approximately 10% of children and adolescents suffer from mental illnesses. Yet only 20% of this group have been diagnosed and are receiving services. Looking at adults, approximately 1 in 17 live with a serious mental disorder such as schizophrenia, major depression, or bipolar disorder. Yet less than one third receive mental health services. James Holmes, the gunman who allegedly killed 12 people and injured 58 others in just two minutes at a crowded midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises in Aurora, appears to possibly be one of those Americans suffering from serious mental illness. Holmes was seeing Dr. Lynne Fenton, a psychiatrist at the University of Colorado who specializes in schizophrenia. Prior to the shooting, he sent her a notebook detailing his plans for the massacre. In June, Holmes applied to join a gun range but was rejected because the range's owner was disturbed by the ""weird and bizarre"" behavior Holmes exhibited on his voicemail recording. Immediately after the shooting on July 20th, Holmes told police officers that he was The Joker, a villain from Batman comic books and movies. We will undoubtedly learn many additional details about Holmes' mental health history in the months ahead. Almost all Americans would agree that dangerously mentally ill individuals, possibly like James Holmes, and like Tucson shooter Jared Loughner (who was found incompetent to stand trial because of paranoid schizophrenia) should not be able to legally purchase firearms. And it's not like this is a problem without a solution -- there is no other high-income nation on the face of the earth in which Holmes and Loughner could have legally purchased such weapons. So how can we provide for the public's safety while at the same refraining from the stigmatization of those suffering with mental illness (because, to be fair, research has made it clear that the vast majority of the mentally ill will never be violent)? Several states have enacted laws that could serve as models for federal legislators. California, for example, takes a graduated approach to the problem, prohibiting the purchase and possession of firearms by individuals who:  • Have been voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric facility and are receiving inpatient treatment for a mental illness and the attending mental health professional states that the individual is a danger to self or others. Once an individual has been discharged from the facility, the prohibition no longer applies.  • Have communicated to a licensed psychotherapist a serious threat of physical violence against a reasonably identifiable victim or victims. This prohibition applies for six months after the report of a threat is made. The subject of the prohibition may petition to have it removed. • Are currently under a court-ordered conservatorship because they are ""gravely disabled"" as a result of a mental disorder. The prohibition expires when the conservatorship ends, though the subject of a conservatorship may ask the court for a hearing to contest the prohibition. • Are receiving involuntary mental health treatment as part of a 72-hour hold (also known as a 5150) because they are a danger to themselves or others. The individual is prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms while they are in the facility and for five years from the date of admission to the facility. The subject of the prohibition may go before a state court to petition for the restoration of their right to purchase and possess firearms. New Jersey has created a model where any person seeking to purchase or possess a firearm must obtain either a permit to purchase a handgun or a Firearms Purchaser Identification Card (FPIC) to purchase a long gun. Applicants for a permit to purchase a handgun or FPIC are required to provide two character references and must agree to waive confidentiality and disclose their mental health records. No permits to purchase a handgun or FPICs are issued to individuals who: • Have been confined for a mental disorder to a hospital, mental institution or sanitarium. • Refuses to waive confidentiality and agree to disclosure of their mental health records. In addition, the New Jersey state police can deny the issuance of handgun permits and FPICs when they feel it would not be ""in the interest of the public health, safety or welfare."" Individuals can appeal to a state court if they feel the state has abused its discretion in denying a permit or FPIC. It's not difficult to see how such processes might have thwarted severely mentally ill individuals like Loughner and possibly Holmes. Would either have been able to provide character references? What would a careful and confidential analysis of their mental health records have uncovered? The bottom line is that it's been almost 45 years since federal legislators defined mental health disqualifications for gun buyers in the Gun Control Act of 1968. It's time to see what else we can do to save lives. Providing law enforcement and mental health professionals with more tools won't stop every shooting, but -- combined with a policy of universal background checks on all gun sales -- could certainly lead to a future where grotesque acts of gun violence are not a daily feature of American life.

Xinhua/ZUMA Press A mass shooting at a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises in Aurora, Colorado, has left at least twelve people dead and 58 wounded. The massacre occurred at the Century 16 cineplex at the Aurora Town Center Mall. The suspected shooter is a local resident named James Eagan Holmes who is in police custody, along with the weapons used in the shooting. There is no clear motive for the attack known at this time. This story will be updated throughout the day as we receive more information. Click here to jump to the latest update. How Holmes Was Armed Holmes carried an assault rifle, a shotgun, and two pistols, the Associated Press reports. Holmes reportedly entered the theater from the emergency exit wearing a gas mask and a bullet proof vest. Witness Accounts According to two witnesses whose interview was flagged by the Huffington Post, he entered the theater, tossed canisters of some kind of gas, and then started shooting. “He looked so calm when he did it, it looked scary,” the witness says.  One of the witnesses says he “thought it was part of the show.” Here’s another interview with a witness to the shooting, conducted by a local NBC affiliate in Colorado:   The witness says “we thought special effects, midnight showing, that’s awesome—what theater does that anymore?” After a few moments, the witness continues, he saw “holes in the walls” and realized that the smoke wasn’t part of the show. Poynter, a journalism news site, has collected tweets from people who were at the movie theater in Aurora when the shooting started. More About the Shooter Holmes, the suspected shooter, was a former graduate student in neuroscience at the University of Colorado-Denver School of Medicine. He withdrew from the college last month. He attended Westview High School in San Diego, California, graduating in 2006. He has no previous criminal record. The city of Aurora police chief says that Holmes’ apartment contains “very sophisticated” explosives, and that police could be at the scene “for hours or days.” According to a federal law enforcement source, Holmes had colored his hair red and told local police that he was “The Joker,” the villain in The Dark Knight (2008). Official Response In the wake of the mass killing, other police departments across the country are now stepping up security measures at area theaters. The Paris gala premiere of the film was cancelled. President Barack Obama was reportedly briefed on the incident early Friday morning. In light of the tragedy, the president has cancelled a campaign event in Winter Park, Florida. The White House released a statement early Friday morning, and Obama will address the shooting at 11:20 a.m. in Fort Myers, Florida. It’s common for presidents and other top national politicians to release statements in the wake of big national tragedies, and both Obama and rival Mitt Romney have already expressed “shock and sorrow” at the incident. The Obama and Romney campaigns have both suspended running political advertisements on Colorado television stations, said spokespeople for the campaigns. Bill Burton, cofounder of the pro-Obama Priorities USA Action super-PAC, tweeted that his group was suspending its Colorado ads as well. President Obama remarked on the shooting Friday morning at a campaign stop in Fort Myers, in southwestern Florida. He said he’d spoken with Aurora Mayor Steve Hogan and Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper to express his and First Lady Michelle Obama’s sadness at the shooting. “The federal government stands ready to do whatever’s necessary to bring whomever’s responsible for this heinous crime to justice,” Obama said. “We will take every step possible to ensure the safety of all of our people. We’re going to stand by our neighbors in Colorado during this extraordinarily difficult time.” During a press briefing Friday morning aboard Air Force One, White House press secretary Jay Carney was asked if President Obama believes that the Aurora massacre warrants a review of gun safety laws. Carney told reporters the following: The president believes that we need to take common-sense measures that protect Second Amendment rights of Americans, while ensuring that those who should not have guns under existing law do not get them…But I have nothing new—nothing additional on that for you. UPDATE, Friday, 11:45 a.m. EST: Suspected gunman’s landlord won’t talk publicly In a brief conversation with Mother Jones, Joan Holley, the manager of Holley Realty who rents out units at the Aurora, Colorado, apartment building where suspected gunman James E. Holmes lived, said she is not yet speaking publicly about Holmes. “Out of respect to the victims and other people involved, I am declining to answer any questions at this time,” Holley said. Holley would not confirm whether she knew Holmes. Asked if she had yet talked to the local police, she said, “I’m going to say goodbye now. I cannot answer at this time.” According to a former resident of that building (who did not know Holmes), the building is mostly rented to college students. Holmes reportedly attended an area medical school but withdrew last month. UPDATE 2, Friday, 12:25 p.m. EST: Photo of suspected gunman Multiple news sources say this is a photo of suspected shooter James E. Holmes:  The image was sent to a local ABC affiliate by the University of Colorado, where Holmes was reportedly a student. UPDATE 3, Friday, 12:35 p.m. EST: Suspected gunman’s yearbook photo Here’s Holmes’ high school yearbook photo, according to San Diego 6 News:   UPDATE 4, Friday, 1:22 p.m. EST: Organizations respond with calls for gun control Dan Gross of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the largest group in the United States of its kind, issued a statement this morning expressing sympathies to the victims’ families and survivors, and also called for action on gun laws: This tragedy is another grim reminder that guns are the enablers of mass killers and that our nation pays an unacceptable price for our failure to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. We are outraged. We understand that President Obama has just spoken and so might Mitt Romney. As someone who has suffered the lasting impact of gun violence, and President of Brady, I can tell you that we don’t want sympathy.  We want action…We are insistent that our elected leaders take action to prevent future tragedies. Political cowardice is not an excuse for evasion and inaction on this life-and-death issue. The United States Conference of Mayors responded similarly: The nation’s mayors express their shock at a mass shooting and send their condolences to the victims, their families, and their community…While we don’t yet have all of the facts in the case, we do know that all evidence this morning points to a heavily armed assailant now in police custody. While questions about his motives and about how he obtained his weapons will be answered in the hours and days ahead, the fact remains that once again guns have been used in a mass killing of innocent people. The U.S. Conference of Mayors is repeating its call for reasonable changes in our gun laws and regulations that could help to prevent senseless tragedies such as the one that has rocked Aurora and the nation this morning.  UPDATE 5, Friday, 2:05 p.m. EST: “Not speculating on motive.” During a joint press conference, Aurora police chief Dan Oates told reporters that his department is “not speculating on motive” at this time. He also mentioned that the explosives for boobytrap found in alleged gunman Holmes’s apartment were “linked together with all sorts of wire.” Oates stated that the police are “not prepared to release [Holmes’] booking photo” today, and that he didn’t yet know whether or not the weapons used were possessed legally. UPDATE 6, Friday, 3:27 p.m. EST: Stars of The Dark Knight Rises cancel promotional events Dark Knight Rises stars Morgan Freeman and Marion Cotillard have pulled out of major press and promotional events scheduled for today and and this evening in France. “The whole team decided out of respect for the families to cancel the premiere,” Cotillard representative said. Warner Bros., which is distributing the film, has not announced whether or not they will cancel future promotional events.  UPDATE 7, Friday, 3:35 p.m. EST: Firearms bought legally, “drum-style” ammo clip used ABC News has confirmed that the three firearms used in the theater shooting—a AR-15 assault rifle, a Remington twelve-gauge shot gun, and a .40 Glock handgun—were purchased legally. ATF agents are currently tracing the weapons. A high-capacity, drum-style ammo clip for the AR-15 was also used in the massacre, according to the Associated Press. (Click here, here, and here for Mother Jones‘ past coverage of these kinds of large gun clips.) Here’s a photo of a precision built, ultra-high capacity, drum-style magazine for an AR-15: Brownells.comUPDATE 8, Friday, 3:59 p.m. EST: Defense Department statement US Navy and Air Force service members were among the injured. The Department of Defense released the following statement: The Department of Defense is deeply saddened by the news of the tragic incident at the Aurora Mall Movie Theater in Aurora, Colo. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and the families of those impacted by this event. One sailor was injured and one, known to have been at the theatre that evening, is currently unaccounted for. Two airmen were injured in the incident. The Navy and the Air Force are working with the families of these service members to ensure they have the care and attention they need. We can also confirm that the alleged gunman in this incident, James Holmes, is not a past or current member of any branch or component of the U.S. Armed Forces. UPDATE 9, Friday, 5:49 p.m. EST: Patients at University of Colorado Hospital Physicians at University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora treated 23 of the most critically wounded victims.  UPDATE 10, Friday, 8:09 p.m. EST: The Dark Knight Rises director Christopher Nolan weighs in Christopher Nolan, the director of The Dark Knight Rises, issued a statement on the mass shooting: Speaking on behalf of the cast and crew of The Dark Knight Rises, I would like to express our profound sorrow at the senseless tragedy that has befallen the entire Aurora community. I would not presume to know anything about the victims of the shooting but that they were there last night to watch a movie. I believe movies are one of the great American art forms and the shared experience of watching a story unfold on screen is an important and joyful pastime. The movie theatre is my home, and the idea that someone would violate that innocent and hopeful place in such an unbearably savage way is devastating to me. Nothing any of us can say could ever adequately express our feelings for the innocent victims of this appalling crime, but our thoughts are with them and their families.

662000514,2012-08-05 08:00:00,"At Sikh temple in Wisconsin, gunman kills 6; suspect is shot dead by police",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/7-killed-including-gunman-in-shooting-at-wisconsin-sikh-temple/2012/08/05/70692158-df2b-11e1-a19c-fcfa365396c8_story.html?tid=a_inl&utm_term=.168814bb8d1d,en,False,,2,Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,"OAK CREEK, Wis. — Federal authorities are investigating the fatal shooting of six people Sunday at a Sikh temple south of Milwaukee, an incident that shocked members of the nation’s close-knit Sikh community. During a religious service, police said, a man entered the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in Oak Creek and sprayed automatic-weapon fire, killing four people inside the building and two more outside. He then wounded one police officer before being shot to death by another officer. Three people were injured, including the temple president. The shootings, which happened about 10:30 a.m. Central time, caused chaos at the 15-year-old temple, with reports of multiple gunmen and of police, in tactical gear and carrying assault rifles, surrounding the building. Police said later that they think the man killed was the only shooter. Authorities would not identify him, but law enforcement officials described him as a Caucasian man in his late 30s or early 40s who lived in this area of Wisconsin. Federal and state agents are examining his background, including whether he had posted anything on the Internet, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is unfolding. A semiautomatic pistol was recovered at the scene, officials said. The FBI is leading the investigation, with help from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and local police. Oak Creek Police Chief John Edwards said the shootings are being “treated as a domestic terrorist-type incident.” But federal law enforcement officials said it was too early to tell what happened and why. “Right now, it’s just a mass shooting,” said a federal official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not an authorized spokesman. “What you have is somebody who went into a Sikh temple and opened fire. Who knows what his motivation was.’’ Teresa Carlson, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Milwaukee Division, said that “while the FBI is investigating whether this matter might be an act of domestic terrorism, no motive has been determined at this time.” The carnage came as the nation is still reeling from a mass shooting two weeks ago in which a gunman killed 12 people and injured 58 at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo. James Holmes, 24, has been charged. President Obama and his Republican rival in the fall election, Mitt Romney, issued statements Sunday expressing condolences to the victims in Oak Creek and the Sikh community, and Obama met with top federal officials and pledged federal assistance to Wisconsin. “At this difficult time, the people of Oak Creek must know that the American people have them in our thoughts and prayers,” he said. The pain was especially felt among the nation’s more than 500,000 adherents of the Sikh faith, most of whom are first- or second-generation immigrants from India, where Sikhism was founded several centuries ago. Sikh men tend to stand out because of their beards and colorful turbans, which are ritually wrapped around uncut hair, and leaders in the community say they are sometimes confused with Muslims and viewed with suspicion. After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, there were scattered reports nationwide of harassment or attacks on Indian Sikhs, including the killing of an unarmed man in Phoenix. Temple members said that a day they hoped would begin with prayer quickly turned to tragedy. Neal Gill, who owns a gas station, was driving to the temple when a friend called his cellphone and told him about the shootings. He spent the day across the street from the temple waiting with worried friends. By evening, some still did not know the fate of their loved ones. “This guy, he’s still crying about he can’t find his wife,” Gill said. “The Sikh community is a very peaceful community. I don’t know why he did it.” Gill said he did not know whether to call the perpetrator a terrorist. But he knows this: “Sick person, sick person, I can say.” Gill’s father-in-law, J.S. Brar, was visiting from India and was with the family. “No reason,” Brar said. “These poor people that lost their lives, there’s no reason for it. Just a crazy man. Otherwise there was no cause at all.” Head priest Gurmel Singh was inside the building during the shootings. He was hobbled by grief and had to be supported as he walked. His brother-in-law, Parkash Singh, who was also a priest, was among those killed. He had only recently brought his family to the United States from India, Gurmel Singh said. “He’s dead,” Singh said. “Two children and a wife here.” He added: “I’m here for 15 or 16 years in the USA. And at this temple, maybe five years. There are no problems. First time problem.” Members of the Sikh community gathered near the temple Sunday evening, rushing from around the Milwaukee area and beyond to come to the aid of family and friends and to seek information, which was scarce. “People are scared. They want to know what’s happening,” said Balbir Singh, a restaurateur who drove from nearby Brookfield. “We are the same community. . . . It’s never happened, something like that before, in the church especially.” Charan Bedi rushed to the temple from Chicago, about 80 miles south, when he heard about the shootings. Family members who attend the temple were safe, but family friends were harmed. “It’s a small community, so we know all of them,” Bedi said. “A loss between any family is a loss for all of us. The main question is, why? We are a peace-loving community. There is no crime. We’re not sure if they mistook us for someone else or what.” About 50,000 Sikhs live in the Baltimore-Washington region. Bhai Gurdarshan Singh, the high priest of a Sikh temple in Gaithersburg, was about to begin services Sunday morning when he was pulled aside and told of the shootings. He immediately informed his congregants and led them in a prayer for the victims. “We are literally hurt, and we pray for the families,” he said. Other congregants stepped out into the lobby to learn more on their smartphones, and some were particularly alarmed that the shootings took place while Sunday-school classes were going on. “It makes you question your own safety as an American in your own country,” said Daman Kaur, 26, of Frederick. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the first Sikh temple in the United States. The Sikh Temple of Wisconsin was established in 1997 with 20 to 25 families. There are now 350 to 400 people in the congregation, according to the temple’s Web site. Law enforcement officials released few details about Sunday’s shootings and would not say how many people were inside the temple at the time. Edwards said the officer who was injured, a 20-year veteran, was helping a victim outside when he was “ambushed” and shot multiple times. Another officer then shot and killed the gunman, he said, adding that the officers’ actions were “heroic.’’ “It stopped a tragic event that could have been a lot worse,” Edwards said.

As police and the FBI investigate the massacre at a Wisconsin Sikh temple that left seven dead, residents say the alleged gunman they called ‘Rob’ lived blocks away from the site of the shootings, but was not originally from the area. Plus, Eliza Shapiro on how the shooting has rattled Sikhs. “He wasn’t from Cudahy.” That was the one unanimous verdict in this close-knit, heavily Polish industrial town on the edge of Milwaukee on Sunday night, as police searched the residence of the apparent gunman in the shootings at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin earlier in the day that left seven people dead, including the shooter and temple president Satwant Kaleka. As the FBI, assisted by local police, spent hours searching a house on the north side of 3700 E. Holmes Avenue, the assembled gawkers were watching what was described by some as the biggest excitement to happen in years in the town. Among the gawkers were neighbors and acquaintances of the alleged gunman—who provided new information about him. The alleged shooter, whom they could only identify as “Rob,” was relatively new to the neighborhood, according to 16-year-old Catarina Johnson, who lives a block away. She was confident that he didn’t come from Wisconsin, and thought he may have been from North Carolina. This contrasts with a statement that the apparent gunman’s landlord, Kurt Weins, gave to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that he thought the man had moved up from Chicago. Johnson’s mother, Jenny Czarnacki, said that until recently, he had shared an apartment with his girlfriend living on the north side of E. Holmes Avenue. Then, in the past few weeks, he broke up with the girlfriend and moved to a ground-floor apartment, also owned by Weins, directly across the street. Nick Reina and Amber Young, whose grandmother lived next to the shooter, said they often saw him walking his black Labrador, Shadow, up and down the block. They remember him as bald and big, with many colorful tattoos. The tattoo that stood out was one about 9/11, which incorporated what Young described as “an explanation beneath.” She said she couldn’t really elaborate on that description. Then again, big bald guys with tattoos don’t exactly stand out in Cudahy. Carlos, who works at a supermarket in the neighborhood, found the description of the shooter to be not very helpful. He said he sees plenty of people who look like that every day. By 11 p.m. Sunday, life was starting to return to normal on Holmes Avenue. The police, who at one point had cordoned off several blocks, now restricted access only to the block where the apparent shooter had lived. Residents who lived a block down the street, like Melanie Batz, were finally able to leave their homes after they spent hours stuck indoors with police refusing to let them out. Batz said she considered herself lucky compared with those who lived the 3700 block. There, residents were asked to leave at between 2 and 2:30 in the afternoon, and only given time to grab their pocketbooks and any necessary medications. She bemoaned the fate of a friend she said had been out when the police came, and was still unable to go back and get her dog. Batz was just happy to finally get out of her house and go out and see what was going on. She wasn’t the only one. Some residents said the shootings amounted to the biggest news in town since a big fire at the Patrick Cudahy meatpacking plant several years ago, and that a mass shooting goes far beyond the usual level of crime seen in the city. One teenaged girl named Becky Ktuznik said “there are a lot of fights.” That “commotions” often start where people “talk smack” and “then get hit.” In this blue-collar town, the main drag, Packard Avenue, is lined with bars that still advertise beers like Blatz and Andeker. Residents were still out in the street cracking self-deprecating Polish jokes, unfazed by the sound of a police helicopter overhead. In a neighborhood located next to Milwaukee’s airport, people are accustomed to the constant roar of jet engines."

84685287,2012-08-08 02:33:10,Wisconsin city holds prayer vigil for temple shooting victims,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_latest/~3/RoTWZtQ6NsY/index.html,en,False,,1095,CNN,http://www.cnn.com/,"People of all faiths lit candles and prayed Tuesday night in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, for those killed and wounded at Sunday's mass shooting at a Sikh temple. The prayer and remembrance vigil, which appeared to draw a large crowd, was held outdoors in the Milwaukee suburb. The step toward healing came as family and friends recalled the six killed by a gunman. The older son of one victim, Paramjit Kaur, 41, said his mother was shot just after completing prayers. When Kaur was in the temple praying, ""My aunt told her that there was a shooting going on outside, we need to get up and leave,"" said 20-year-old son Kamal Saini. ""Rather than just getting up and leaving, she wanted to just bow down and pray for the last time and then get up and leave. She was just getting up. She was shot in the back."" Remembering the victims Kaur and her family immigrated to the United States eight years ago. Last month, her family made its first visit to India since then. ""She was a good woman. She was a great mom,"" said a younger son, Harpreet Saini, 18. Every week, Kaur came to the temple to pray and prepare food for the shared meal. ""She lived for us. She worked for us.  Anything she did, it was for us,"" said Kamal Saini. ""If there wasn't enough to eat it was always us before she ate."" Her dream was for her sons to be educated. ""She told us education is everything here,"" said Kamal. Both young men plan to pursue careers in law enforcement. More vigils and services were expected over the next several days; the Sikh American community called for a national moment of silence on Sunday. A posting on the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund's website asked for the observance at churches, mosques, synagogues and other places of worship. It said the community hopes such a gesture ""will send the message of blessings for all, and that we stand united against hate and intolerance and as part of a common humanity."" The vicitims were identified by police as Kaur and five men -- temple president Satwant Singh Kaleka, 65; Sita Singh, 41; Ranjit Singh, 49; Prakash Singh, 39, and Suveg Singh, 84. A wake and visitation are scheduled for Friday morning at a nearby high school gymnasium, according to an online posting by the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin. Ranjit Singh had been working at the temple for 16 years and sent money back to his wife and three children in India. His younger brother, Sita, had moved from New York City to Wisconsin six months ago, with hopes of finding a better life for his family. Several years ago, Kaleka put a large American flag in the front of his yard, raising the eyebrows of his children, who thought it might be considered an eyesore. Kaleka pointed out there were no homes nearby with flags, and he wanted to show that the United States was a land of opportunity, said his son, Amardeep Kaleka. Belief: Who are Sikhs? ""He lived the American dream,"" Amardeep Kaleka told CNN. His father brought his family to the United States with little money but a strong work ethic in the early 1980s. The flag also was a form of protection for the family, Satwant Kaleka told them. It stood at half-staff Monday evening as the family grieved. Amardeep Kaleka said people called to tell him that his father saved many lives Sunday. The son said he was not surprised his father tried to stop the gunman at the temple. ""It's an amazing act of heroism, but it's also exactly who he was,"" Amardeep Kaleka told CNN Milwaukee affiliate WTMJ. ""There was no way in God's green Earth that he would allow somebody to come in and do that without trying his best to stop it."" Amardeep Kaleka said the FBI told him his father attacked the shooter in the lobby, resulting in a ""blood struggle."" A knife close to the victim's body showed blood on it, he said. Another victim, Suveg Singh, spent every day at the temple, said his granddaughter, Sandeep Kaur. ""He is always there, and he's with the community and anybody who is willing to listen,"" said Kaur. ""He educated them about our religion."" The victim's family told CNN they will return to their temple. His son, Baljander Singh Khattra, said Suveg Singh was friendly and a ""very strong person."" Suveg Singh used to tend a garden and cut the lawn until his health started to decline earlier this summer. His granddaughter said she had hoped her grandfather would be able to attend her wedding in fourth months. Belief: Inside a temple Prakash Singh was a priest who recently immigrated to the United States with his wife and two young children, said Justice Singh Khalsa, a temple member since the 1990s. Friends described him as ""a noble soul."" One temple member told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Prakash Singh, 39, had expressed concern about dying. His three brothers all died before turning 40. An Illinois man who has placed crosses and other memorials around the country erected posts and grapevine wreaths in honor of the six victims at a park just south of the Sikh temple. ""These people were there worshipping God, Greg Zanis told CNN. ""This is paramount in my thinking. It takes a godless person to do all of these killings."" Zanis erected 12 white crosses near an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater after the mass shooting there last month. The carpenter, who now builds electric cars, traveled to Tucson, Arizona, after the 2011 shooting of U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, ventured to Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts after John F. Kennedy Jr. died in a 1999 plane crash there and went to Colorado after the Columbine school shooting that same year. Complete coverage: Wisconsin Sikh temple shooting"

As Romney and Ryan planned a second day of joint appearances on Sunday in North Carolina, some of the layers of secrecy surrounding the most monumental decision the Republican candidate has made to date are being peeled back. The head of Romney's VP search process, longtime confidante Beth Myers, broke her silence on many details in a briefing with reporters inside a hangar at Dulles International Airport near Washington. Romney and Ryan themselves spoke to reporters briefly on their flight to North Carolina. The search was so confidential that background information on a short list of candidates, including several years of tax returns and other documents, were kept in a safe in a locked room at Romney's campaign headquarters and the few people allowed in were not permitted to make copies or take anything out. What began in April as a long list of candidates was winnowed down to a short list by May 1. By early July, the serious candidates had emerged. Romney knew Ryan was his man before Ryan knew. After extensive deliberations over his short list, Romney settled on the 42-year-old Wisconsin congressman who has built a conservative record as a budget hawk in Washington. Romney made up his mind on August 1, the day after he returned from a week-long trip to London, Jerusalem and Poland. A face-to-face meeting was required, and therein lies a tale. The meeting was arranged for Aug 5 at Myers' home in Brookline, Massachusetts. The challenge was to get both Ryan and Romney together in the same room without the news media or anyone else outside the inner circle knowing about it. Myers' home was chosen for the assignation. Romney had little problem eluding the news media camped out near his vacation home on Lake Winnepesaukee in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire. It was getting Ryan there that was the challenge. To avoid flying out of a Wisconsin airport where he could be easily recognized, he was driven to Chicago's O'Hare airport for a flight to Hartford's Bradley airport in Connecticut. TRAVELING INCOGNITO ""We gave a lot of thought on how to make this work undetected,"" Myers said. ""And we sent my 19-year-old son, Curt, to pick him up. Paul was wearing jeans, a casual shirt, baseball hat and sunglasses and passed unnoticed through both airports."" Romney and Ryan met privately more than an hour in Myers' dining room after lunch. ""We talked about the campaign, how it would be run,"" Romney said. ""We talked about how we'd work together if we get to the White house, what the relationship would be, how we would interact and be involved in important decisions."" Ryan said being chosen was like going ""from the surreal to the real, I guess."" ""By the time we met in person I kinda knew it was going to happen. And I was very humbled. It was the biggest honor I've ever been given in my life,"" he said. Then came the problem of getting Ryan to Norfolk for the rollout announcement without the news media sleuthing it out. Such movements have been detected before. They wanted to do the announcement on Friday in New Hampshire but Ryan needed to attend a memorial service in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, for victims of a mass shooting at a Sikh temple. After that ceremony, Ryan was driven to his home in Janesville, Wisconsin, by aide Andy Speth. He walked in the front door, through the house and out the back door, into a patch of woods familiar from his youth. On the other side was the house where he grew up. ""I know those woods like the back of my hand, so it wasn't too hard to walk through them,"" Ryan said. ""So I just went out my back door and went through the gully in the woods I grew up playing in. I walked by the tree that has the old tree fort that I built."" When he came out into the open, Speth was there to pick him up. Ryan flew from Waukegan to Elizabeth City, North Carolina, which is not far from Norfolk. He and his family and Myers and a Romney group stayed at a Fairfield Inn, ordered in food from Applebee's and went over Ryan's introductory speech. ""It's now two on two instead of two on one,"" said Romney. ""This is good."" (Reporting By Steve Holland; editing by Todd Eastham)"

We'll be bringing you updates as the details unfold. Here's a summary of where things stand: • At least six victims are dead and several wounded after a gunman opened fire this morning at the temple in Oak Creek, a Lake Michigan shore town outside Milwaukee. A responding officer is believed to have shot the gunman dead. The officer, described as a 20-year-veteran, was wounded and was being treated at hospital. His condition was unknown. • Four people were killed inside the temple and three, including the gunman, outside. The gunman was described by witnesses as a white male in his 30s. • In a news conference a police spokesman sought to correct early reports of multiple gunmen. ""At this time we have not identified any additional gunman,"" he said. He warned that the situation was ""extremely fluid."" ""We got multiple calls and multiple reports,"" he said. ""It's possible the multiple reports were of the same person."" • The shooting comes 16 days after 12 were killed and 58 wounded in a shooting in Colorado at a premiere of the latest Batman movie. The suspect, a 24-year-old former student, is in custody and undergoing preliminary court hearings. At the moment, the motives for the shooting are not clear. We will follow developments here as details emerge. Police are due to hold another press conference soon, and details will start to emerge of how the incident unfolded. Meanwhile here's our latest news story on the incident. 4.58pm: The FBI is on the scene of the temple shooting in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. The local Froedtert hospital told local station WISN they are treating 3 people injured in the shooting, all men, WISN's Tom Swigert reports. Children's classes were scheduled to begin at 11:30 am, according to WISN. The shooting started around 10:20am. 5.05pm: President Barack Obama has issued a statement on the shooting in Wisconsin. Here is the statement: Michelle and I were deeply saddened to learn of the shooting that tragically took so many lives in Wisconsin. At this difficult time, the people of Oak Creek must know that the American people have them in our thoughts and prayers, and our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who were killed and wounded. My Administration will provide whatever support is necessary to the officials who are responding to this tragic shooting and moving forward with an investigation. As we mourn this loss which took place at a house of worship, we are reminded how much our country has been enriched by Sikhs, who are a part of our broader American family.  Presidential candidate Mitt Romney has issued a statement too: Ann and I extend our thoughts and prayers to the victims of today's shooting in Wisconsin. This was a senseless act of violence and a tragedy that should never befall any house of worship. Our hearts are with the victims, their families, and the entire Oak Creek Sikh community. We join Americans everywhere in mourning those who lost their lives and in prayer for healing in the difficult days ahead. Is it offensive to suggest that both men must by now have a generic template document offering words of consolation and succor in the event of a mass shooting in the states? 5.10pm: The police in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, are holding a news conference on the shooting. Attending are:Brad Wentlandt, police chief of Greenfield, a neighboring community.Chief John Edwards of the Oak Creek PD.Oak Creek Mayor Steve ScaffidiOak Creek Fire Chief Tom RosandichRichard Schmidt of the Sherriff's OfficeJohn Chisholm, the Milwaukee County District AttorneySpecial Agent Thomas AhernTeresa Carlson, special agent in charge of FBI 5.20pm: Chief John Edwards of the Oak Creek PD is speaking to the press. He says: ""Because of the heroic action of our officers, they stopped this from being worse than it could have been."" Edwards says the officers responded to a 911 call, where they found a victim. Their officer, a 20-year-veteran, was ambushed and shot multiple times by the suspect. The officer is in surgery now. ""We expect him to recover,"" Edwards says. ""Another officer on the scene was engaged by the suspect,"" Edwards says. ""Our officer engaged that individual and that individual is deceased from actions our officer took. ... It could have been a lot worse."" ""It has taken all day to clear the area... we have numerous individuals that are deceased at this point."" Edwards says the FBI will be handling criminal incident. ""We're treating it as a domestic terrorist type incident."" Edwards said there were seven deceased and ""three injured including our officer."" The chief has no info on the suspect: ""I don't have any information for you on the suspect."" The chief takes questions: He's asked what he means by ""domestic terrorism"": ""Domestic terrorism is somebody who's doing some active terrorism within the US. Not from another country."" He's asked about the weapon: ""The weapon is not yet known. Not clear if multiple."" He's asked if the temple is clear: ""No one left in the temple. That is a crime scene."" Oak Creek Mayor Steve Scaffidi speaks briefly: The city is outraged. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims. We are thankful for the officers who responded. He pledges cooperation 5.26pm: The Oak Creek police chief described how the suspect in the shooting was killed. A 20-year veteran of the police force responded to a call of a shooting at the temple and found a victim outside. While treating the victim the officer was ambushed by the gunman and shot multiple times. A second officer then shot the gunman dead. The officer shot by the gunman is in surgery and is expected to recover. The chief, John Edwards, said he has no information on the suspect but described the incident as a ""domestic terrorist-type incident,"" meaning perpetrated by a US citizen within the United States. 5.34pm: Oak Creek Police Chief John Edwards said three were wounded in the shooting, including the veteran police officer who was among the first to respond. Among those who were shot was the president of the temple, Satwant Kaleka, who was taken to a hospital. The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinal has reported that the temple president, Satwant Kaleka, was shot and transported to the hospital. 5.36pm: Police Chief Edwards said he had no information on the suspect, who was killed at the scene, in what he called an act of ""domestic terrorism."" The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel quotes a temple member on the shooter's identity: One of the temple's committee members, Ven Boba Ri, said that based on communication with people inside the temple, the shooter was a white male in his 30s. 5.40pm: Oak Creek community members are organizing a vigil tonight for the victims of the shooting and their families and loved ones. A Facebook page for the vigil is here. A message on the page calls on community members to ""come together for a vigil and spread peace and show support for the victims and family members of the Sikh Temple Shootings."" The vigil is scheduled for 8pm at Cathedral Square Park in Milwaukee. 5.46pm: Local law enforcement met with leaders of the Sikh temple in Oak Creek last year following a series of disturbing crimes apparently targeting Sikhs in the area. The Oak Creek Patch reported last August: State Rep. Josh Zepnick and District Attorney John Chisholm visited the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin, 7512 S. Howell Ave., on Sunday to discuss public safety issues in the Sikh community. Satwant Singh Kaleka, president of the Sikh Temple, requested the meeting after the July 4 melee in Milwaukee's Riverwest neighborhood, according to a news release from Zepnick's office. Those incidents included the looting of at least one Sikh-owned business. Singh Kaleka told local officials that what was seen in Riverwest has become too common at gas stations and convenience stores owned by members of the Sikh community. Many businesses and workers have been the victims of robberies and vandalism, he said. (via @BuzzFeedAndrew) 6.00pm: A man interviewed outside the temple has told local WISN news that the shooting victims may have been members of the temple who came early to help prepare a large community lunch to be held after services.Two children were the first to see the shooter outside the temple and the first to warn temple members what was happening, the witness said. ""It was a boy and a girl who were sitting outside. The girl was from the family who was hosting the lunch today. The first shot that the shooter took was just like some firework [the children thought]. ""He shot the two people who actually came out of the cab and they were entering the church. These two kids [ran inside and alerted members]."" The witness said he spoke to the children and they described the gunman: ""One guy, blue pants, white shirt, white guy, little heavy, who was taking these shots."" ""People who got injured were mostly employees of the church"" who'd arrived early to prepare lunch, he said. The name of the interviewee was not supplied by WISN. 6.03pm: The man interviewed by WISN news who had been inside the temple said that after the shooting started ""it was chaos."" ""There are four sections to the church,"" the interviewee said. ""One for the shoes. One where we worship. One for community lunch where everybody sits and eats food."" ""There were some families who locked themselves in the bathroom. There were some who locked themselves in the kitchen area."" The man says he does not think the shooting was motivated by hatred of religion: ""I don't think this person has anything to do with religion. He just came out and started shooting like all other psychos we have heard about who have done other things in the past."" 6.10pm: Local news station WISN is at Froedtert hospital in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. A reporter says one victim was shot in the neck and is in surgery. One is shot in abdomen and chest. One is shot in face and arm. 6.14pm: Residents are being evacuated from the neighborhood of Cudahy, Wisconsin, WISN reports. Milwaukee police and the FBI are active in the area. Residents have not been told why they are being evacuated, WISN reported. Cudahy is near Milwaukee's General Mitchell International Airport. WISN speculated that police were investigating the suspect's residence. 6.21pm: Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker tweeted Sunday that he told President Obama that the FBI was ""part of an excellent team effort of local, state & federal authorities on site."" Appreciated the call from the President.It is a sad day for the Sikh community, Oak Creek, Wisconsin, and America. — Governor Walker (@GovWalker) August 5, 2012 Walker's office later released this statement: While the situation in Oak Creek continues to develop rapidly, we are working with the FBI and local law enforcement. I became aware of the situation late this morning and continue to receive updated briefings. Our hearts go out to the victims and their families, as we all struggle to comprehend the evil that begets this terrible violence. At the same time, we are filled with gratitude for our first responders, who show bravery and selflessness as they put aside their own safety to protect our neighbors and friends. Tonette and I ask everyone to join us in praying for the victims and their families, praying for the safety of our law enforcement and first responder professionals and praying for strength and healing for this entire community and our state. 6.36pm: The Sikh Coalition, the largest Sikh American civil rights organization in the U.S., has released a statement with background information about the temple, or Gudwara, in Oak Creek: The Gudwara in Oak Creek, Wisconsin was founded in 1997 and had over 400 peaceful worshipers that worked and lived in the greater Milwaukee area. The Gudwara, known as being a wonderful neighbor, had come to represent the valued contributions of the Sikh faith in a community where Sikhism was understood to be another contributing fabric in the cloth of American plurality. The impulse is to assume that the attack is a hate crime, coalition director Sapreet Kaur is quoted as saying: There have been multiple hate crime shootings within the Sikh community in recent years and the natural impulse of our community is to unfortunately assume the same in this case. Let's let law enforcement investigate the case and as new facts emerge the dialogue can change. Americans died today in a senseless act of violence and Americans of all faiths should stand in unified support with their Sikh brothers and sisters. The coalition statement supplies statistics on Sikhism: With over 25 million followers worldwide, Sikhism is the fifth largest religion in the world, with over 500,000 followers in the U.S. For more information on Sikhism please visit our website here. 6.41pm: Jaisal Noor has put together a report for Democracy Now! on violence and harassment against the Sikh community since 9/11. The violence began directly after the 9/11 attacks, on Sept. 15, 2001, when Balbir Singh Sodhi, a gas station owner, was murdered in Mesa, Arizona, by a man who apparently wanted revenge for the attacks and associated Sikhism, which originates in India, with the mutant Islam associated with the attacks, with its roots in Saudi Arabia.  6.47pm: The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel is reporting that law enforcement authorities have arrived outside of a home in Cudahy, Wisc., a town about 5 miles north of Oak Creek. Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are also reportedly outside the home. 7.00pm: We're going to wrap up our live blog coverage of the shooting at the Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. We have just published an updated news item here. Here's a summary of where things stand: • A gunman killed six victims and wounded three, including a police officer, at the temple before being shot dead by a second police officer. The three wounded were being treated at hospital and were expected to survive. • Authorities were at the scene of a home in the Milwaukee area believed to be connected with the shooter. • The gunman was described by a man who spoke to eye witnesses as white, in his 30s, ""a little heavy,"" wearing blue pants and a white shirt. He is believed to have acted alone. Police said ""weapons"" were recovered inside the temple but had no further information. • A man at the temple told local news station WISN that two children saw the suspect shoot two people exiting a taxi outside the temple. The children, who were unharmed, then ran inside to warn congregants about the shooter. • The Sikh Coalition noted an impulse to assume the act was a hate crime. Sikhs have regularly been singled out for hate crime attacks since 9/11. Please visit the Guardian US home page for further updates."

84393578,2012-07-23 16:37:09,Mass murder & powerful firearms,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_crime/~3/5lRkd55-Z6U/index.html,en,False,,1095,CNN,http://www.cnn.com/,"Scenes from the mass shooting in an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater are horrific, but are all too familiar in the United States. Some have argued that gun control is irrelevant to mass shootings because the perpetrators are typically so determined that they will overcome any legal hurdle to acquiring firearms. However, mass murderers often use assault weapons or guns with large ammunition capacity. Opinion: Gun control or carry permits won't stop mass murder One of the guns James Eagan Holmes allegedly used to shoot 70 people within minutes was an assault rifle with a 100-round drum magazine. This extraordinary firepower enables gunmen to kill and wound more victims than they otherwise could if they used weapons that held fewer bullets. There is obviously no need for any civilian to have such powerful weapons. Rational gun policy, one that puts public safety ahead of the interests of the gun industry and gun enthusiasts, would ban firearms and ammunition clips that hold more than 10 rounds. Such a policy might not prevent many of our mass shootings, but it should reduce the number of victims from these incidents. Skeptics might point to the federal assault weapons ban (a section of the 1994 Violent Crime Control Act) that Congress let expire in 2004 as a failure that did not affect overall homicide rates. However, the law's impact was limited by its narrowness that made it easy for gun manufacturers to evade. A broad ban on the sale and possession of high capacity (more than 10 rounds) ammunition magazines with stiff penalties would translate into saved lives. Between 9,000 and 10,000 people are murdered each year with guns in the U.S., most garnering little attention. Local news coverage of such events typically provides scant information or context to enable citizens to understand the role of guns in these incidents. Invariably, the only time that gun violence and gun policy are discussed in the national media is after a horrific shooting rampage. We should not brush aside discussions of gun policy as too politically difficult to expect meaningful change, or ""the price for our freedoms."" Instead, we should reflect on why the U.S. has a murder rate that is nearly seven times higher than the average murder rate in other high-income countries and a nearly 20 times higher murder rate with guns. And we should consider how flaws in current gun policies contribute to this disparity. Standards for legal ownership and permits to carry a concealed gun are relatively lax in the U.S. In most states, a person with a long history of arrests and convictions for misdemeanors (often pleaded down from felony charges), prior restraining orders for domestic violence and history of drug and alcohol abuse can own as many military-style weapons as he can afford to purchase, and can legally carry concealed guns almost anywhere. Opinion: When will America wake up to gun violence? Under federal law, anyone wanting to purchase a firearm from a licensed gun dealer must pass a background check. But in most states, the gun dealer who stands to profit from a gun sale, rather than a law enforcement agency, determines the authenticity of purchasers' identification cards. Gun dealers face little consequence if they fail to account for dozens of guns upon inspection. Data indicating which gun dealers sell the most guns linked to crimes are kept from public view and cannot be used in decisions about the dealer's license. Illogically, federal law and most state gun laws allow firearm purchases from private sellers with no background check or questions asked. As a result of these policies, it is far too easy for dangerous people to own, carry and ultimately use guns. Following mass shootings, gun control opponents have not been bashful about pushing for laws to remove restrictions on carrying guns in schools, bars and churches. Indeed, calls for removing restrictions on carrying concealed firearms will not stop mass shootings. Research indicates that so-called right-to-carry laws don't reduce violence, and may increase aggravated assaults. But studies I have conducted indicate that stricter regulations of gun sales, whether by retail dealers or by private sellers, are associated with fewer guns diverted to criminals. Moreover, national national surveys show that a large majority of citizens favor these reforms to our gun laws, including most gun owners. In addition, there is substantial research showing that law enforcement strategies that focus on deterring illegal gun possession reduce violent crime. Public health initiatives in Chicago and Baltimore, which use reformed ex-gang-members to reach out to youth, mediate disputes and promote alternatives to violence, have also been shown to significantly reduce homicides and shootings. More than 30,000 people die every year from guns in the U.S., and more than 400,000 are victims of nonfatal crime committed with guns. The economic costs are staggering -- an estimated $100 billion annually. Only a small fraction of these deaths are connected to mass shootings. But the mounting deaths and associated trauma from mass shootings should motivate us to take action to make needed reforms to our gun laws, focus law enforcement resources on combating illegal gun possession and invest in prevention initiatives proven to reduce gun violence. America's high rate of gun violence is shameful. When will we change? Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion"

Here, they are remembered by their loved ones A birthday card for Alex Sullivan, one of the 12 victims of the mass shooting at the Century 16 movie theater, is left at a makeshift memorial across from the theater July 22, 2012 in Aurora, Colorado. Sullivan turned 27 years old the day he was killed. Follow @TIMENewsfeed In one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history, 12 people were fatally shot, with another 58 injured, after a masked gunman opened fire at a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises early Friday. The shooter, identified as 24-year-old James Holmes, went on a rampage in Aurora, Colo., just 20 miles from Columbine High School, where another notorious shooting occurred in 1999. Ten victims in Friday’s massacre were killed in the theater, and another two were later pronounced dead from injuries. All victims’ names have been released, and their friends and families have shared memories and reflections. Jonathan Blunk, 26
Blunk, a Navy veteran, was also a certified firefighter and an emergency medical technician. He served three tours in the Middle East between 2004 and 2009 and hoped to one day become a Navy SEAL. He attended Friday’s movie with his friend, Jansen Young, who told TODAY that he took a bullet for her and saved her life. Another friend, James Gill, told the Associated Press that if Blunk were “going to choose a way to die, that’s how he wanted to go — defending someone from a (person) like that.” Blunk leaves behind his estranged wife and two young children. Alexander Boik, 18
Known as AJ, Boik graduated this year from Gateway High School in Aurora. He had plans to study art and design in college and eventually become an art teacher. Boik’s friend, Jordan Crofter, described him as “a ball of joy” who “wanted everybody to be happy.” He attended the movie with his girlfriend, who survived the attack but hasn’t been identified. “If he were still here, he’d try to make everyone have a positive outlook of the situation,” Crofter told the Associated Press, “and not allow it to affect their outlook of life.” Jesse Childress, 29
An Air Force cyber-systems operator, Childress was based at Colorado‘s Buckley Air Force Base. He suffered from gunshot wounds at the theater and died at the hospital Friday. Air Force Capt. Andrew Williams described the Air Force reservist as “knowledgeable, experienced and respectful.” A co-worker, Ashley Wassinger, said Childress “was a great person fun to be with, always positive and laughing.” (PHOTOS: Scenes from Aurora: Aftermath of the Theater Massacre) Gordon Cowden, 51
Cowden, who attended the film screening with his two teenage children, was the oldest of the 12 victims killed in the shooting. “A quick witted world traveler with a keen sense of humor, he will be remembered for his devotion to his children and for always trying his best to do the right thing, no matter the obstacle,” his family told the Associated Press. Though he lived in Aurora, his family described him as “a true Texas gentleman.” Jessica Ghawi, 24
A young sports broadcaster and blogger, Ghawi had narrowly escaped a mass shooting at a Toronto mall just last month. In a blog entry about that incident, she’d written, “I was reminded that we don’t know when or where our time on Earth will end. When or where we will breathe our last breath.” She was an avid social media user, and had posted enthusiastic tweets about The Dark Knight Rises just minutes before the shooting. Colleagues and friends described Ghawi, who also went by the surname Redfield, as ambitious, hardworking and witty. John Larimer, 27
Petty Officer Third Class John Larimer served as a cryptologic technician in the Navy after enlisting just over a year ago. The youngest of five siblings, Larimer grew up in suburban Chicago, where neighbors fondly recalled his sense of humor. He attended the movie with another sailor, who was injured but survived. “A valued member of our Navy team, he will be missed by all who knew him,” said Cmdr. Jeffrey Jakuboski, his commanding officer, in a statement. Matt McQuinn, 27
McQuinn died attempting to shield his girlfriend, Samantha Yowler, from the gunfire. She was shot in the knee but is recovering, her family attorney said. Also present at the theater was Yowler’s brother, Nick, who also attempted to shield her from the bullets, but was not injured. Both families thanked everyone for their love and prayers, but have declined talking to the media. (MORE: Who Is Suspect James Holmes?) Micayla Medek, 23
Medek lived in the Denver suburb of Westminster and had attended Aurora Community College. Family members said the news of her death was “heartbreaking.” Her aunt, Jenny Zakovich, said she was a huge Green Bay Packers fan. Medek graduated from William C. Hinkley High School in Aurora. Veronica Moser-Sullivan, 6
The youngest of the victims, Moser-Sullivan sat beside her mother, Ashley, who remains in critical condition with gunshot wounds to the neck and abdomen. Drifting in and out of consciousness, she has yet to learn the news about her daughter’s death, the Associated Press reports. The 6-year-old had just learned to swim and was a “great little girl, excited about life,” said her great aunt, Annie Dalton. Alex Sullivan, 27
Sullivan attended the midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises to celebrate his 27th birthday. “Alex was a gentle giant, known and loved by so many,” his family said in a statement. “He always had a glowing smile on his face and he made friends with everyone.” Sullivan was also gearing up to celebrate his first wedding anniversary. Shelly Fradkin, whose son was Sullivan’s close friend, said they spent an “excruciating day” trying to track him down before learning of his death. “Our hearts are broken, and we’re crushed,” she said. Alexander Teves, 24
A native of Phoenix, Teves earned a master’s in counseling psychology in June from the University of Denver. His grandfather, Carlo Iacovelli, described him as a lovable guy who had many friends. He said Teves had plans to become a psychiatrist in the future. Iacovelli also described him as the “ideal grandson” who was “a fun guy” and “had a lot to look forward to.” Rebecca Ann Wingo, 32
Originally from Texas, Wingo, a mother of two daughters, resided in Aurora. She attended Aurora Community College and worked at Joe’s Crab Shack, the Denver Post reported. “I lost my daughter yesterday to a mad man, my grief right now is inconsolable, I hear she died instantly, without pain, however the pain is unbearable,” wrote her father, Steve Hernandez, in a Facebook post. Wingo’s friend, Gail Riffle, described her as “a gentle, sweet, beautiful soul.” MORE: TIME’s Complete Coverage of the Aurora, Colorado Shooting"

A handful of funds have now been established to help the victims of what police are treating as a domestic terrorism incident, according to CBS. There's also speculation that it may be a hate crime, as the shooter, Wade Michael Page, had been part of the white-supremacist band called End Apathy. Page, a 40-year-old former U.S. Army member, was killed after killing six people and leaving three in critical condition, according to CBS. Lt. Brian Murphy, the first officer on the scene, is being hailed a hero after being shot at least nine times, yet instructing fellow officers to focus on other victims, ABC reports. A fund has been set up in his honor. As members begin mourning the loss of fellow worshippers, they're also trying to reconcile how a sacred space reserved for prayer could so quickly turn into a scene of an unspeakable crime. ""We don't think it's something that's going to happen to you, especially in a place of worship, a place where I go to talk to God and to find peace and to show my love and serve others,"" said Kanwardit Kaleka, the temple president's nephew.  Amardeep Kaleka told ABC they plan to reopen the temple, which his father would have wanted. See below for ways to support Murphy, honor Kaleka, and help others affected: Help Cover Funeral Costs Amardeep Kaleka, the son of Satwant Singh, the president of the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin, created an online fundraiser ""We Are Sikhs"" to help cover funeral costs for victims. Singh died along with five other members in the shooting Sunday. None of the money will go to the Kaleka family, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports. Donations accepted here. Support Victims An Indiegogo fund will benefit the temple shooting victims, their families and injured police offer Lt. Brian Murphy. Donors' contributions will be held in an escrow account until August 30, at which time the fundraiser's organizers will allocate the funds to those in need, Fox News reports. According to the Indiegogo site: ""It will take some time before the precise needs of the Milwaukee Sangat are enumerated. We plan to work closely with the local Sikh community and doctors to determine the best way to distribute funds."" Donations accepted here.

Kaleka pointed out there were no homes nearby with flags, and he wanted to show that the United States was a land of opportunity, said his son, Amardeep Kaleka. The elder Kaleka, 65, served as president of the Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Milwaukee, scene of Sunday morning's mass shooting.  He was one of six community members killed. Sikhs react to the Wisconsin temple shooting ""He lived the American dream,"" Amardeep Kaleka told CNN. His father brought his family to the United States with little money but a strong work ethic in the early 1980s. The flag also was a form of protection for the family, Satwant Kaleka told them. It stood at half-staff Monday evening as the family grieved. The six killed in Sunday's attack were identified by police as five men -- Kaleka; Sita Singh, 41; Ranjit Singh, 49; Prakash Singh, 39, and Suveg Singh, 84 -- and a woman, 41-year-old Paramjit Kaur. ""She was a good woman.  She was a great mom,"" said Kaur's son, Harpreet Saini, 18. Kaur and her family immigrated to the United States eight years ago. ""She lived for us.  She worked for us.  Anything she did, it was for us,"" said her older son Kamal Saini, 20.  ""If there wasn't enough to eat it was always us before she ate."" When Kaur was in the temple praying on Sunday, ""My aunt told her that there was a shooting going on outside, we need to get up and leave,"" said Kamal Saini.  ""Rather than just getting up and leaving, she wanted to just bow down and pray for the last time and then get up and leave.  She was just getting up.  She was shot in the back."" Her dream was for her sons to be educated.  ""She told us education is everything here,"" said Kamal Saini. His mother's death ""took my world away,"" he said. Both young men plan to pursue careers in law enforcement.  ""I wanted her to see me in uniform,"" Kamal Saini said. Another victim, Suveg Singh, spent every day at the temple, said his granddaughter, Sandeep Khattra. ""He is always there, and he's with the community and anybody who is willing to listen,"" said Khattra. ""He educated them about our religion."" Belief blog: Who are Sikhs? The victim's family told CNN they will return to their temple. His son, Baljander Singh Khattra, said Suveg Singh was friendly and a ""very strong person."" Prakash Singh was a priest who recently immigrated to the United States with his wife and two young children, said Justice Singh Khalsa, a temple member since the 1990s. Amardeep Kaleka said people called to tell him that his father saved many lives Sunday. The son said he was not surprised his father tried to stop the gunman at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin. ""It's an amazing act of heroism, but it's also exactly who he was,"" Amardeep Kaleka told CNN Milwaukee affiliate WTMJ. ""There was no way in God's green Earth that he would allow somebody to come in and do that without trying his best to stop it."" Remembering the victims Amardeep Kaleka said the FBI told him his father attacked the shooter in the lobby, resulting in a ""blood struggle."" A knife close to the victim's body showed blood on it, he said. ""From what we understand, he basically fought to the very end and suffered gunshot wounds while trying to take down the gunman,"" said Kanwardeep Singh Kaleka, Satwant's nephew. Satwant Kaleka's wife, Satpal, hid with several other women, telling them to remain quiet during the horrific incident. The gunman came into the kitchen and shot and wounded two women, she told CNN. ""I grabbed everybody and said run, run to the pantry."" Amardeep Kaleka said his father worked hard and was an honest man. ""I would love for them (the public) to know that he lived his life with the principles that he knew and he was taught at a young age. It made him highly successful in America."" President Barack Obama signed a proclamation honoring the victims, ordering that U.S. flags be flown at half-staff at federal facilities and buildings. Vigils were held Monday night, and one is set for Tuesday. The Sikh temple in Brookfield, northwest of Oak Creek, was to hold a candlelight vigil late Monday. The Rev. Paul Armstrong of Oak Creek Community United Methodist Church, site of a Monday evening prayer vigil, said the diverse array of faiths in the community have an opportunity to further deepen bonds. ""There's a few of us who will be calling folks together to organize some more interfaith services,"" he told CNN. Opinion: An American tradition of bigotry ""Being in mission to the world is something we share,"" Armstrong said of his faith and the Sikh community. ""Their hospitality is wonderful. That is something the Christian community is called to do."" The vigil was held outdoors, and a survivor of the temple shooting spoke, according to Armstrong. ""The focus was to express our sorrow and that all of us can be lights of the world,"" he said. Navdeep Singh, a policy adviser to the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund, says Sikhs believe in freedom of religion, community service and inclusiveness. At temples, or gurdwaras, where Sikhs hold services, everyone is welcome. ""You can come and be equal,"" he says. Opinion: Sikh temple shooting is act of terrorism"

The complications of covering a relatively small religious group (there are between 25 and 30 million Sikhs in the world) were clear on Sunday. Outlets like BuzzFeed and writers like Sunny Hundal compiled several examples of reporters struggling with the facts of the religion: a Fox News analyst asking if there had been any ""anti-Semitic acts"" in the past against Sikhs; CNN's Don Lemon wondering if Sikhs have ""traditional enemies,"" or if the shooter had ""beef with the Sikhs""; a local Wisconsin station saying that the religion is ""based in northern Italy."" Perhaps knowing that there was a knowledge gap, the Asian American Journalists' Association released guidelines for reporters to use in their coverage. Among the advice: -- The word ""Sikh"" is pronounced ""seek."" -- A Sikh temple is also called a ""gurdwara"" (pronounced GOORD-war-ah). -- The Sikh religion is an offshoot of the Hindu religion. It was founded around 1500. The level of coverage was also a grim reminder of the factors that can go into deciding how expansively to cover a story. Whereas the Aurora shootings led to days of special reports and wall-to-wall dispatches from the scene, the Wisconsin shootings were given much less space. Morning shows on Monday spent their first two segments on the shootings before moving on. There could be many reasons for this, among them the fact that the shootings took place on a weekend, when media coverage is lighter across the board, and had fewer victims than the Aurora massacre -- or even that the Olympics were happening at the same time. It could also be that the specter of a ""madman"" such as James Holmes, the alleged Aurora shooter, drew more attention than what investigators said was an attack by a possible white supremacist in Wisconsin.

284002403,2012-08-03 01:03:00,"Colorado shooting: It’s hard to spot threats, experts say",http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/colorado-shooting-its-hard-to-spot-threats-experts-say/2012/08/02/gJQA1fj1SX_story.html,en,False,,2,Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,"Aurora, Colo. — Three years after the 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech, the University of Colorado at Denver’s Anschutz Medical Campus created a team to spot and quickly confront students who might become dangerously violent. The school wanted to be prepared to head off a nightmare. Tragedy struck anyway. One of the university’s neuroscience graduate students, James Holmes, now sits in jail on charges that he murdered 12 people and wounded 58 more in the mass shooting July 20 at the Century 16 cinema. Holmes, who was in the process of withdrawing from the university at the time of the shooting, had at some point come under the care of university psychiatrist Lynne Fenton, according to a document filed in court. And Fenton was in a prime position to deal with a potentially dangerous student. According to university records, in 2010 Fenton helped establish the school’s Behavioral Evaluation and Threat Assessment, or BETA, team. The team has addressed “more than a dozen issues” since its founding, a university spokeswoman said this week. Citing a judge’s gag order, the spokeswoman would not say if one of those cases involved Holmes. But Denver television station KMGH reported Wednesday evening, citing unnamed sources, that Fenton had called members of the team with concerns about Holmes in early June. The team reportedly decided not to take action once Holmes began to withdraw on June 10. The university has declined to verify the report, but Wednesday the University of Colorado’s general counsel released a statement that said, in part: “The BETA team is not a law enforcement mechanism.” Fenton has not returned phone calls and messages and did not answer the door at her home. The university has become a fortress of silence since the theater shooting, but some members of the community here have expressed dismay that one of their own allegedly planned mass murder without detection. “The signs are there, people just have to look for them,” said Justin Beasley, 32, a fourth-generation Aurora resident as he sat at a park watching his two children play. “We live in a crazy world, and there are a lot of scary people out there who have access to such horrible weapons. It scares me, it scares my wife, it scares all of us.” One woman, 48, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the preliminary nature of what is known about Holmes, said, “It’s just like with Penn State. Universities are insular, and they tell each other things, but they don’t tell anyone else.” Experts on threat assessment say it’s an inherently tricky enterprise. They say the most dangerous people do not fit a simple profile. Some of the personality traits common among mass murderers are indistinguishable from the characteristics of harmless individuals who sit quietly in their room playing video games. Numerous universities have set up threat-assessment teams like the one in Colorado. These groups typically operate above the usual silos of command and protocols in their efforts to identify students, faculty or staff members who might try to harm themselves or others. “The minute I heard [about the Aurora shooting] I said, oh, a lot of people are going to know about this guy. They probably saw warning signs or red flags earlier, and a lot of people didn’t recognize what they saw,” said Anne Glavin, chief of police at California State University at Northridge and the president of the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators. “People don’t just snap. They don’t just go crazy. They don’t just ‘go postal.’ There’s no such thing,” she said. Case in point: Jared Loughner. Authorities have charged him with opening fire at a January 2011 event hosted by then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson, killing six. Before the shooting, Loughner, who has pleaded not guilty, was kicked out of Pima Community College after several run-ins with police and the posting of a bizarre video online. Loughner was told to get a psychological evaluation. Holmes, 24, doesn’t appear to have made many friends during his year in Colorado. He had also applied to the University of Arizona neurology program but was rejected because he had a lack of affect in his interview, showing no excitement or passion about the program he wanted to join, according to people familiar with his application. While fellow students described him as extremely reserved, no one has come forward to describe him as clearly dangerous. “I’ve heard a lot of people talking about him, and the only thing they say is that he was really quiet. That’s it,” said Karly Hudson, a professional research assistant in biochemistry who never met Holmes. “We’re researchers. That’s how we are.” The Anschutz Medical Campus is part of the University of Colorado at Denver and named for Philip Anschutz, the Denver multi-billionaire who has given more than $100 million to fuel the campus’s rapid growth. The campus has about 3,556 enrolled, nearly all of whom are graduate students. Fenton has been the director of student mental health services since 2009, a role in which she provides training sessions to faculty and staff members, oversees a small group of therapists and treats 15 to 20 graduate students each week, according to her online biography. Before coming to the university, Fenton was reprimanded by the Colorado State Board of Medical Examiners in 2004 for writing prescriptions for herself, her husband and an employee without proper documentation. Fenton agreed to stop and completed 50 hours of training. News organizations, citing unnamed sources, have reported that Holmes sent a package to Fenton with a notebook containing details of a planned attack, but the package wasn’t discovered in the mail room until the Monday after the shootings. Holmes’s lawyers argue that the package is protected communication between a doctor and patient. Although psychiatrists have an ethical responsibility to offer confidential treatment, there are situations in which a doctor can, and legally must, breach the confidentiality and alert authorities to an imminent threat. Every state has its own laws and guidelines about this “duty to warn.” Colorado’s law states that mental health professionals are protected from lawsuits if a patient turns violent “except where the patient has communicated to the mental health care provider a serious threat of imminent physical violence against a specific person or persons.” Students with mental health issues have rights under the Americans with Disability Act. This was something that Anschutz leaders, including Fenton, discussed as they created the BETA team, according to meeting notes on the university Web site: “Concern was expressed about students with behavior problems falling back on underlying ADA issues as an ‘excuse.’ Legal decisions often support the student at the expense of the institution.” There are also laws protecting student privacy, which federal officials clarified after the Virginia Tech shooting. In general, a serious safety threat will trump privacy. At the Anschutz campus, the BETA team usually convenes or communicates only when it receives a report from someone on campus, spokeswoman Jacque Montgomery said. She said the team has no systematic way of flagging students beyond those reports. Bill Woodward, a director of training at the University of Colorado at Boulder’s Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence, said threat assessment teams too often rely on gut instinct instead of collecting comprehensive data about a person. Research on the indicators of violence is still limited, he said. “We’re still in the dark ages of threat assessment, I’m sorry to say,” he said. Achenbach reported from Washington.

The attack began shortly before 10.30am local time on Sunday as dozens of people were gathering at a place of worship in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. After killing a number of people inside the temple, the gunman then fired on a police officer who was helping a wounded victim outside the building. A second officer fired on the suspect, who died at the scene. The wounded officer – who was shot multiple times – was taken to hospital for surgery. He is expected to survive. At a press conference held outside the temple on Sunday, Oak Creek police chief John Edwards said the ""heroic actions"" of the two officers ""stopped this from being worse than it could have been"", noting that many people had gathered for worship at the time of the attack. Edwards said that authorities were treating the killing as a ""domestic terrorism incident"", but added that it was too early to suggest a motive. Some Sikh members of the community told the media they feared that it was a hate crime. ""We are at the beginning stages of this investigation,"" Edwards said. The FBI has taken over the criminal inquiry. It is thought that around 50 people were in the temple as the shootings took place. Prominent members of the local Sikh community were among those thought to have been injured or killed by the gunman. Jatin Der Mangat, 38, of Racine, said his uncle, the temple's president Satwant Singh Kaleka, was one of those wounded, but he didn't know how serious his injuries were. ""It was like the heart just sat down,"" he said. ""This shouldn't happen anywhere."" Sukhwindar Nagr, also of Racine, said he called his brother-in-law's phone – a senior religous figure at the temple answered and told him that his brother-in-law had been shot, along with three other people. Children hid in closets in the temple amid fears that the suspect was still on the loose, Nagr was told. CNN reported that two handguns were recovered by forensic experts at the scene. But initial fears that the gunman may have had an accomplice appear to be unfounded. There are often reports of multiple gunmen at incidents of mass shootings, because of the confusion, large number of witnesses and different perspectives. Police said sweeps of the temple and the surrounding area suggested that the shooting was the act of a lone killer. Alongside the six people the suspect shot, three people were injured and taken to a nearby hospital. They were all in critical condition. The officer who was shot by the gunman is among those being treated. ""We expect him to recover"", Edwards said. Police said the unnamed officer was ""ambushed"" by the gunman as he and a colleague responded to a 911 call alerting authorities to the scene of the shootings. Emergency teams later found the bodies of four victims inside the temple. Three more corpses lay outside the building, including that of the suspect. For hours after the initial incident, a cordon was placed around the temple amid fears that a second armed man remained at large. Ambulances and police marksman surrounded the temple. The cordon was raised when police were sure that no other peope were involved. Bradley Wentlandt, police chief of the nearby town of Greenfield, confirmed later that there was only one suspect. ""There is no evidence of additional shooters at the temple,"" he said. Despite fears that the attack may have had a racist motive, some in the Sikh community cautioned against jumping to conclusions. Sapreet Kaur, executive director of the Sikh Coalition, the largest Sikh American civil rights organisation in the US, said: ""There have been multiple hate crime shootings within the Sikh community in recent years and the natural impulse of our community is to unfortunately assume the same in this case. ""Let's let law enforcement investigate the case and as new facts emerge the dialogue can change,"" he urged. Kaur added: ""Americans died today in a senseless act of violence and Americans of all faiths should stand in unified support with their Sikh brothers and sisters."" The incident in Wisconsin comes just 16 days after 12 people were killed and nearly 60 injured in a mass shooting at a movie theatre in Aurora, Colorado, during a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises. President Barack Obama was informed of the latest atrocity shortly before 1pm ET by homeland security adviser John Brennan. In a statement, the president said he was ""deeply saddened"". He added: ""At this difficult time, the people of Oak Creek must know that the American people have them in our thoughts and prayers, and our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who were killed and wounded."" Obama's Republican challenger for the White House, Mitt Romney, expressed his condolences to those caught up in America's latest mass shooting. This article was amended on 6 August 2012 to remove a reference to 'priests' in relation to the temple."

""He seemed to be a normal kid, I don't know what triggered it. This makes me very sad,"" said Tom Mai, a retired electrical engineer. Mai said Holmes' entire family was involved in the Presbyterian Church. PHOTOS: 'Dark Knight Rises' shooting ""I saw him as a normal guy, an every day guy, doing every day things,” said Mai's 16-year-old son, Anthony. San Diego police arrived Friday morning at a Rancho Peñasquitos neighborhood after the alleged shooter's mother called at around 6 a.m., officials said ""We're only here to preserve peace, not to conduct an investigation,"" Lt. Andra Brown said. ""Other agencies are here to investigate."" Arlene Holmes has identified herself to reporters as the mother of the suspected shooter. Her son went to high school in San Diego and then attended college in Colorado, Brown said. Authorities described him as a loner. Poway Unified School District in San Diego confirmed that Holmes was a 2006 graduate of Westview High School. Holmes,  24, was taken into custody early Friday in the parking lot outside the Century 16  movie theater after the post-midnight attack in Aurora, Colo. He allegedly entered the theater through an exit door about half  an hour into the local premiere of the Batman movie ""The Dark Knight Rises."" At least 12 people were killed in the attack. Witnesses described a chaotic scene, telling television reporters that  they were overcome by noxious gas unleashed by the suspect just before  he started shooting, and that they had to decide between staying on the  ground, helping wounded victims or running away before the gunman was  able to reload his weapon. Survivors said they were forced to run past  bodies in the aisles. The attack was smoky and surreal, witnesses reported, as moviegoers, some  wearing their own costumes, slowly realized that bullets were flying  from the weapon of the man in body armor whose face was hidden by a gas  mask. ""There were bullet [casings] just falling on my head. They  were burning my forehead,” Jennifer Seeger told reporters afterward.  “Every few seconds it was just: Boom, boom, boom,"" she said. ""He would  reload and shoot and anyone who would try to leave would just get  killed."" The shooter was armed with a  rifle, a shotgun and two handguns, police said. Cellphone videos from the scene show  panicked moviegoers running -- some screaming -- and others with blood  visible. One theory of the attack is that Holmes may be a disgruntled employee of the movie   theater, based on the fact that he allegedly was able to enter through an   exit, sources said. More than 20 SWAT team members were gingerly searching Holmes' apartment  on Paris Street, a process that could take hours or even days because the apartment  appeared to be booby-trapped with explosives, Aurora Police Chief Dan  Oates told reporters. The area  around the apartment, on the third floor of a housing complex, has been  evacuated.

Loughner's plea Tuesday allows him to avoid the death penalty in a mass shooting that gained worldwide attention in January 2011 because his intended target was the congresswoman. Among the dead were Arizona's chief federal judge and a Giffords' aide. Federal Judge Larry A. Burns had found that Loughner was mentally unfit to stand trial. He ruled on Tuesday that months of forcibly medicating him to treat his schizophrenia made him competent to understand the gravity of the charges against him and assist in his own defense. Loughner is expected to be sentenced to life in prison without parole. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below. Former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords is satisfied with Tuesday's expected plea agreement from the man accused of shooting her and many others in a deadly rampage at one of her political events, and she hopes it will allow victims of the mass shooting to move on with their lives. Jared Lee Loughner is expected to plead guilty in federal court in Tucson, Ariz., as part of an agreement that will allow him to avoid the death penalty in the shooting that left six people dead, including a federal judge, and wounded Giffords and 12 others. ""The pain and loss caused by the events of Jan. 8, 2011, are incalculable,"" Giffords said in a joint statement with her husband, Mark Kelly. ""Avoiding a trial will allow us - and we hope the whole Southern Arizona community - to continue with our recovery."" Later Tuesday, the legal team defending Loughner will have to convince a judge that he is competent enough to enter a plea. The 23-year-old college dropout is scheduled to attend a hearing during which his attorneys and prosecutors will try to persuade U.S. District Court Judge Larry A. Burns that Loughner is no longer mentally unfit for trial. Experts had concluded that Loughner suffers from schizophrenia, and officials at a federal prison have forcibly medicated him with psychotropic drugs for more than a year. A court-appointed psychiatrist is expected to testify Tuesday that he is competent to enter a plea. If Burns agrees, as legal experts expect, a formal change-of-plea hearing will follow. That's when those in the court will hear from Loughner at length for the first time, as the judge questions him about the agreement and changing his plea to guilty. Burns may ask Loughner to recite his actions in his own words, but either his lawyer or the federal prosecutor could just read the facts of the January 2011 shooting spree at a Tucson supermarket, where Giffords was holding a meet-and-greet with constituents. Either way, Loughner will be asked to acknowledge that he shot and killed six people, including the top federal judge in Arizona, and wounded 13 others, including Giffords. He'll need to convince Burns he understands what is going on, what he's doing and what he did. Loughner could break down, change his mind about pleading guilty or show so little understanding of what he's doing that Burns rejects the plea, lawyers not involved in the case said Monday. ""The fact that there is this planned change of plea is no guarantee that it will go forward,"" said Paul Charlton, a former U.S. attorney for Arizona. ""There are any number of things that would happen that would either cause it to be removed from the calendar or not go forward at all."" The plea agreement that is expected to be made public on Tuesday would see Loughner sentenced to life in prison, taking the possibility of the death penalty off the table in the federal case, a person familiar with the case told The Associated Press on Saturday. The person was not authorized to discuss the case publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. An agreement that would spare Loughner the death penalty offers something for both sides, said Quin Denvir, a California defense attorney who has worked with Loughner attorney Judy Clarke on the case against unabomber Ted Kaczynski. Prosecutors would avoid a potentially lengthy and costly trial and appeal, knowing that the defendant will be locked up for life. Clarke managed to avoid the death penalty for other high-profile clients such as Kaczynski and Eric Rudolph, who bombed abortion clinics in the late 1990s and Atlanta's Olympic park in 1996. The top prosecutor in southern Arizona's Pima County said last year that she may file state charges in the case that could carry the death penalty. An official in the prosecutor's office, Amelia Craig Cramer, declined to comment, saying the office did not have an active prosecution against Loughner. Denvir said it was possible that the plea agreement calls for the state to avoid pursuing criminal charges against Loughner, though that's not a given. ""Ideally (as a defense attorney) you'd like to have it resolved all at once, but sometimes you have to take one at a time,"" he said. The decision to spare Loughner a federal death sentence makes sense, said Dale Baich, a federal public defender in Phoenix who handles capital case appeals and isn't involved in the case. ""As time went on and there were numerous evaluations, I think everybody had a better understanding of Mr. Loughner's mental illness."" Baich said.

805658651,2012-08-01 08:21:10,Aurora's Hard Truth: Mental Health Screening for Gun Buyers Is Nearly Non-Existent,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/auroras-hard-truth-mental_b_1727695.html,en,False,,623375,Huffington Post - United States,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/?country=US,"Executive Director, Coalition to Stop Gun Violence If you learn only one new thing about America's gun laws after the gruesome mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, learn this: Even when individuals do undergo a background check when buying a gun in this country, the screening for mental health history is cursory at best. You don't need to submit to a background check to buy a gun, of course. Currently, Americans can buy firearms through ""private sales"" in more than 40 states without undergoing any type of screening at all. The law requires background checks only for guns sold by federally licensed firearm dealers (FFLs), allowing those not ""engaged in the business"" of dealing firearms to do so without conducting background checks or maintaining any records of sale. How do we know who is ""engaged in the business""? We don't (the IRS isn't looking at anyone's tax returns to find out), at least until guns start turning up at crime scenes and an investigation is opened by law enforcement. One study estimated that private sales account for 40% of all gun sales in the United States. When an individual purchases a firearm from an FFL, however, he must undergo a criminal background check. First, the buyer fills out a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) Form 4473 by hand, providing simple yes or no answers to a series of questions about criminal, mental health and substance abuse history. The dealer then queries the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) database maintained by the FBI via a toll-free telephone number or through the NICS E-Check System online (in a handful of states the dealer contacts the state police who in turn contact NICS). This instant computer check searches the NICS database for any disqualifying records that would prohibit that individual from buying a gun. During the check, the system does not disclose to gun dealers any actual information about these records. Dealers are simply seeing one of three responses from NICS on their computer screen: proceed, denied or delayed. If a potential gun buyer is denied, the FFL is never informed of the reason. The specific disqualifications related to mental health are quite narrow. Under federal law, an individual is prohibited from buying or possessing firearms if they have been ""adjudicated as a mental defective"" or ""committed to a mental institution."" A person is ""adjudicated as a mental defective"" if a court -- or other entity having legal authority to make adjudications -- has made a determination that an individual, as a result of mental illness: 1) Is a danger to himself or to others; 2) Lacks the mental capacity to contract or manage his own affairs; 3) Is found insane by a court in a criminal case, or incompetent to stand trial, or not guilty by reason of lack of mental responsibility pursuant to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. A person is ""committed to a mental institution"" if that person has been involuntarily committed to a mental institution by a court or other lawful authority. This expressly excludes voluntary commitment. If a person falls under one of these two categories, they are prohibited from purchasing and possessing firearms for life -- although federal law now allows states to establish procedures for such individuals to restore their right to purchase or possess firearms. Many states have done so at the behest of the National Rifle Association, with questionable results. There is no guarantee, however, that a formal record of adjudication or involuntary commitment will find its way into the NICS database. Often disqualifying mental health records go unreported by the states. In Colorado, for example, only about 1% of people who have disqualifying mental health histories have been reported to NICS. Another problem is that few Americans suffering from serious mental illness ever come into contact with the ""system"" or receive treatment for their condition(s). According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), approximately 10% of children and adolescents suffer from mental illnesses. Yet only 20% of this group have been diagnosed and are receiving services. Looking at adults, approximately 1 in 17 live with a serious mental disorder such as schizophrenia, major depression, or bipolar disorder. Yet less than one third receive mental health services. James Holmes, the gunman who allegedly killed 12 people and injured 58 others in just two minutes at a crowded midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises in Aurora, appears to possibly be one of those Americans suffering from serious mental illness. Holmes was seeing Dr. Lynne Fenton, a psychiatrist at the University of Colorado who specializes in schizophrenia. Prior to the shooting, he sent her a notebook detailing his plans for the massacre. In June, Holmes applied to join a gun range but was rejected because the range's owner was disturbed by the ""weird and bizarre"" behavior Holmes exhibited on his voicemail recording. Immediately after the shooting on July 20th, Holmes told police officers that he was The Joker, a villain from Batman comic books and movies. We will undoubtedly learn many additional details about Holmes' mental health history in the months ahead. Almost all Americans would agree that dangerously mentally ill individuals, possibly like James Holmes, and like Tucson shooter Jared Loughner (who was found incompetent to stand trial because of paranoid schizophrenia) should not be able to legally purchase firearms. And it's not like this is a problem without a solution -- there is no other high-income nation on the face of the earth in which Holmes and Loughner could have legally purchased such weapons. So how can we provide for the public's safety while at the same refraining from the stigmatization of those suffering with mental illness (because, to be fair, research has made it clear that the vast majority of the mentally ill will never be violent)? Several states have enacted laws that could serve as models for federal legislators. California, for example, takes a graduated approach to the problem, prohibiting the purchase and possession of firearms by individuals who:  • Have been voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric facility and are receiving inpatient treatment for a mental illness and the attending mental health professional states that the individual is a danger to self or others. Once an individual has been discharged from the facility, the prohibition no longer applies.  • Have communicated to a licensed psychotherapist a serious threat of physical violence against a reasonably identifiable victim or victims. This prohibition applies for six months after the report of a threat is made. The subject of the prohibition may petition to have it removed. • Are currently under a court-ordered conservatorship because they are ""gravely disabled"" as a result of a mental disorder. The prohibition expires when the conservatorship ends, though the subject of a conservatorship may ask the court for a hearing to contest the prohibition. • Are receiving involuntary mental health treatment as part of a 72-hour hold (also known as a 5150) because they are a danger to themselves or others. The individual is prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms while they are in the facility and for five years from the date of admission to the facility. The subject of the prohibition may go before a state court to petition for the restoration of their right to purchase and possess firearms. New Jersey has created a model where any person seeking to purchase or possess a firearm must obtain either a permit to purchase a handgun or a Firearms Purchaser Identification Card (FPIC) to purchase a long gun. Applicants for a permit to purchase a handgun or FPIC are required to provide two character references and must agree to waive confidentiality and disclose their mental health records. No permits to purchase a handgun or FPICs are issued to individuals who: • Have been confined for a mental disorder to a hospital, mental institution or sanitarium. • Refuses to waive confidentiality and agree to disclosure of their mental health records. In addition, the New Jersey state police can deny the issuance of handgun permits and FPICs when they feel it would not be ""in the interest of the public health, safety or welfare."" Individuals can appeal to a state court if they feel the state has abused its discretion in denying a permit or FPIC. It's not difficult to see how such processes might have thwarted severely mentally ill individuals like Loughner and possibly Holmes. Would either have been able to provide character references? What would a careful and confidential analysis of their mental health records have uncovered? The bottom line is that it's been almost 45 years since federal legislators defined mental health disqualifications for gun buyers in the Gun Control Act of 1968. It's time to see what else we can do to save lives. Providing law enforcement and mental health professionals with more tools won't stop every shooting, but -- combined with a policy of universal background checks on all gun sales -- could certainly lead to a future where grotesque acts of gun violence are not a daily feature of American life.

In fact, the high point for mass killings in the U.S. was 1929, according to criminologist Grant Duwe of the Minnesota Department of Corrections. Incidents of mass murder in the U.S. declined from 42 in the 1990s to 26 in the first decade of this century. The chances of being killed in a mass shooting are about what they are for being struck by lightning. Until the Newtown horror, the three worst K–12 school shootings ever had taken place in either Britain or Germany. Almost all of the public-policy discussion about Newtown has focused on a debate over the need for more gun control. In reality, gun control in a country that already has 200 million privately owned firearms is likely to do little to keep weapons out of the hands of criminals. We would be better off debating two taboo subjects — the laws that make it difficult to control people with mental illness and the growing body of evidence that “gun-free” zones, which ban the carrying of firearms by law-abiding individuals, don’t work. First, the mental-health issue. A lengthy study by Mother Jones magazine found that at least 38 of the 61 mass shooters in the past three decades “displayed signs of mental health problems prior to the killings.” New York Times columnist David Brooks and Cornell Law School professor William Jacobson have both suggested that the ACLU-inspired laws that make it so difficult to intervene and identify potentially dangerous people should be loosened. “Will we address mental-health and educational-privacy laws, which instill fear of legal liability for reporting potentially violent mentally ill people to law enforcement?” asks Professor Jacobson. “I doubt it.” Gun-free zones have been the most popular response to previous mass killings. But many law-enforcement officials say they are actually counterproductive. “Guns are already banned in schools. That is why the shootings happen in schools. A school is a ‘helpless-victim zone,’” says Richard Mack, a former Arizona sheriff. “Preventing any adult at a school from having access to a firearm eliminates any chance the killer can be stopped in time to prevent a rampage,” Jim Kouri, the public-information officer of the National Association of Chiefs of Police, told me earlier this year at the time of the Aurora, Colo., Batman-movie shooting. Indeed, there have been many instances — from the high-school shooting by Luke Woodham in Mississippi, to the New Life Church shooting in Colorado Springs, Colo. — where a killer has been stopped after someone got a gun from a parked car or elsewhere and confronted the shooter. Economists John Lott and William Landes conducted a groundbreaking study in 1999, and found that a common theme of mass shootings is that they occur in places where guns are banned and killers know everyone will be unarmed, such as shopping malls and schools. I spoke with Lott after the Newtown shooting, and he confirmed that nothing has changed to alter his findings. He noted that the Aurora shooter, who killed twelve people earlier this year, had a choice of seven movie theaters that were showing the Batman movie he was obsessed with. All were within a 20-minute drive of his home. The Cinemark Theater the killer ultimately chose wasn’t the closest, but it was the only one that posted signs saying it banned concealed handguns carried by law-abiding individuals. All of the other theaters allowed the approximately 4 percent of Colorado adults who have a concealed-handgun permit to enter with their weapons. “Disarming law-abiding citizens leaves them as sitting ducks,” Lott told me. “A couple hundred people were in the Cinemark Theater when the killer arrived. There is an extremely high probability that one or more of them would have had a legal concealed handgun with him if they had not been banned.” Lott offers a final damning statistic: “With just one single exception, the attack on congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson in 2011, every public shooting since at least 1950 in the U.S. in which more than three people have been killed has taken place where citizens are not allowed to carry guns.” There is no evidence that private holders of concealed-carry permits (which are either easy to obtain or not even required in more than 40 states) are any more irresponsible with firearms than the police. According to a 2005 to 2007 study by researchers at the University of Wisconsin and Bowling Green State University, police nationwide were convicted of firearms violations at least at a 0.002 percent annual rate. That’s about the same rate as holders of carry permits in the states with “shall issue” laws. Despite all of this evidence, the magical thinking behind gun-free zones is unlikely to be questioned in the wake of the Newtown killings. Having such zones gives people a false sense of security, and woe to the politician or business owner who now suggests that a “gun-free zone” revert back to what critics would characterize as “a wild, wild West” status. Indeed, shortly after the Cinemark attack in Colorado, the manager of the nearby Northfield Theaters changed its policy and began banning concealed handguns. In all of the fevered commentary over the Newtown killings, you will hear little discussion of the fact that we may be making our families and neighbors less safe by expanding the places where guns aren’t allowed. But that is precisely what we may be doing. Both criminals and the criminally insane have shown time and time again that those laws are the least of the problems they face as they carry out their evil deeds.  — John Fund is a national-affairs columnist for NRO.

169986497,2012-07-20 23:55:00,"Midnight movie massacre: Colorado Batman shooting leaves 12 dead, 59 wounded",http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/07/midnight_movie_massacre_colora.html,en,True,,20120,nj.com,http://www.nj.com," Gallery: Shooting at Colorado midnight showing of Batman movie AURORA, Colo. — As the new Batman movie played on the screen, a gunman dressed in black and wearing a helmet, body armor and a gas mask stepped through a side door. At first he was just a silhouette, taken by some in the audience for a stunt that was part of one of the summer's most highly anticipated films. But then, authorities said, he threw gas canisters that filled the packed suburban Denver theater with smoke, and, in the confusing haze between Hollywood fantasy and terrifying reality, opened fire as people screamed and dove for cover. At least 12 people were killed and 59 wounded in one of the deadliest mass shootings in recent U.S. history. ""He looked like an assassin ready to go to war,"" said Jordan Crofter, a moviegoer who was unhurt in the attack early Friday, about a half-hour after the special midnight opening of ""The Dark Knight Rises."" The gunman, identified by police as 24-year-old James Holmes, used a military-style semi-automatic rifle, a shotgun and a pistol, stopping only to reload. At least one of the wounded is from New Jersey. Jacci Fry, a 23-year-old Andover woman, was hit in the leg with shrapnel, according to a report by Ridgewod.Patch.com. Fry, who recently moved to Colorado, underwent surgery and was released from the hospital, the report said. The suspect marched up the aisle in the stadium-style theater, picking off those who tried to flee, witnesses said. Authorities said he hit 71 people. One of them was struck in an adjacent theater by gunfire that went through the wall. • Sussex County woman injured in Colorado Batman shooting, released from hospital after surgery • Suspect in Colorado Batman shooting was former PhD student, apartment rigged with explosives • Opinion: 'Batman' shooting is the end of an era for movie-going • Colorado Batman shooting: Complete coverage of theater massacre ""He would reload and shoot and anyone who would try to leave would just get killed,"" said Jennifer Seeger, adding that bullet casings landed on her head and burned her forehead. Within minutes, frantic 911 calls brought some 200 police officers, ambulances and emergency crews to the theater. Holmes was captured in the parking lot. Police said they later found that his nearby apartment was booby-trapped. Authorities gave no motive for the attack. The FBI said there was no indication of ties to any terrorist groups. In New York City, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said: ""It clearly looks like a deranged individual. He has his hair painted red. He said he was the Joker, obviously the enemy of Batman."" Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates would not confirm that information, but did say he had spoken to Kelly. The two used to work together in New York. Asked whether Holmes had makeup to look like the Joker, Oates said: ""That to my knowledge is not true."" It was the worst mass shooting in the U.S. since the Nov. 5, 2009, attack at Fort Hood, Texas. An Army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 soldiers and civilians and wounding more than two dozen others. It was the deadliest in Colorado since the Columbine High School massacre in suburban Denver in 1999, when two students killed 12 classmates and a teacher and wounded 26 others before killing themselves. The new Batman movie, the last in the trilogy starring Christian Bale, opened worldwide Friday with midnight showings in the U.S. The plot has the villain Bane facing Bale's Caped Crusader with a nuclear weapon that could destroy all of fictional Gotham. The shooting prompted officials to cancel the red-carpet premiere in Paris, and some U.S. movie theaters stepped up security for daytime showings. The attack began shortly after midnight at the multiplex in Aurora, an urban community on Denver's eastside. Audience members said they thought it was part of the movie, or some kind of stunt associated with it. The film has several scenes of public mayhem — a hallmark of superhero movies. In one scene, Bane leads an attack on a stock exchange, and in another he leads a shooting and bombing rampage on a packed football stadium. A federal law enforcement official said Holmes bought a ticket to the show, went into the theater as part of the crowd and propped open an exit door as the movie was playing. The suspect then donned protective ballistic gear and opened fire, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation. At some point, the gunman appeared to have stepped outside because several witnesses saw him come through the door. ""All I saw is the door swinging open and the street lights behind, and you could see a silhouette,"" said Crofter, who was sitting on the left side of the theater and toward the front. Sylvana Guillen said the gunman, clad in dark clothing, appeared at the front of the theater as the character Catwoman appeared in the movie. Then they heard gunshots and smelled smoke from a canister he was carrying. As she and her friend, Misha Mostashiry, ran to the exit, Guillen said, they saw a man slip in the blood of a wounded woman he was trying to help. Oates said the gunman wore a gas mask and a ballistic helmet and vest, as well as leg, groin and throat protectors. He said among the guns was an AR-15 rifle and that the gunman used two gas canisters. ""I thought it was showmanship. I didn't think it was real,"" Seeger said. She said she was in the second row, about four feet from the gunman, when he pointed a gun at her face. ""I was just a deer in headlights. I didn't know what to do,"" she said. Then she ducked to the ground as the gunman shot people seated behind her. Seeger said she began crawling toward an exit when she saw a girl of about 14 ""lying lifeless on the stairs."" She saw a man with a bullet wound in his back and tried to check his pulse, but ""I had to go. I was going to get shot."" Moviegoer Eric Hunter and his friends made their way to an exit. When he opened the door, he said, he saw two teenage girls — one shot in the mouth and the other one crying. He asked them if they were OK. ""Help us. Help us, please,"" he recalled them saying. Later, police began entering the theater, asking people to hold their hands up as they evacuated the building. Some of the victims were treated for chemical exposure apparently related to canisters thrown by the gunman. Those hurt included a 4-month-old baby, who was treated at a hospital and released. Those who knew Holmes described him as a shy, intelligent person raised in California by parents who were active in their well-to-do suburban neighborhood in San Diego. Holmes played soccer at Westview High School and ran cross-country before going to college. On Friday morning, police escorted Holmes' father, a manager of a software company, from their home while his mother, a nurse, stayed inside, receiving visitors who came to offer support. Holmes also has a younger sister. New York News | New York Breaking News | NYC Headlines ""As you can understand, the Holmes family is very upset about all of this,"" Lt. Andra Brown, the San Diego police spokeswoman, told reporters in the driveway of the family home. ""It's a tragic event and it's taken everyone by surprise. They are definitely trying to work through this."" Police released a statement from his famiily that said: ""Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved."" There have been no indications so far that Holmes had any run-ins with the law before Friday. Tom Mai, a retired electrical engineer, said Holmes was a ""shy guy"" who came from a ""very, very nice family."" Holmes graduated from University of California, Riverside, in the spring of 2010 a bachelor's degree in neuroscience, a school spokesman said. Mai said the mother told him Holmes couldn't find a job after earning a master's degree and returned to school. In 2011, he enrolled in the Ph.D. neuroscience program at the University of Colorado-Denver but was in the process of withdrawing, a university spokeswoman said. Holmes lived in an apartment in Aurora, and FBI agents and police who went there discovered it was booby-trapped when they used a camera at the end of a 12-foot pole to look inside.

              since  A horrific shooting at the Century Theater in Aurora, Colorado, early on Friday morning has stunned the United States. A figure in a gas mask set off what appear to have been tear gas bombs about 15 minutes into a midnight showing of The Dark Knight before opening fire on the crowd watching the movie. Police told reporters that 12 people have died and 58 more were injured in the attack. There were 70 casualties in total, making it the largest mass shooting in U.S. history by casualties. As of 3:30 PM local time (5:30 PM EDT), 30 patients remained in the hospital and 11 patients were still in critical condition. In a midday press conference, Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates named 24 year-old white male James Eagan Holmes as the sole suspect in the case. Police apprehended Holmes in the parking lot of the movie theater. 9News in Denver reports that the subject did not resist arrest.  Bomb squads still on the scene Oates said the shooter made statements to police about explosives at his apartment and car after being taken into custody. According to 9NEWS, a bomb robot found suspicious materials in Holmes's car. Upon further investigation, authorities determined that the subject's apartment had been booby-trapped with explosive or flammable devices. By that point, they had already evacuated the building at East 17th Street and Peoria in Aurora. The area--which includes five adjacent apartment buildings--remains surrounded by police. Authorities do not know how long it will take to secure the area. The police chief called Holmes's apartment a ""very vexing problem."" ""We don't know how we're going to handle that,"" Oates said. ""It's like nothing I've ever seen."" Aurora authorities sought help from the FBI and the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives). The task force had halted an operation to disarm the booby-traps for the day by Friday evening and planned to restart those efforts Saturday. University of Colorado—Denver police have evacuated two research buildings the suspect once worked in, according to CBS Denver.  Theater-goers experienced their own horror movie Witnesses say the perpetrator, allegedly wearing a bullet-proof vest, goggles, and a gas mask, entered Theater #9--one of three theaters showing The Dark Knight Rises around midnight--through a fire exit. He opened fire after blinding the audience with tear gas. At least one person in Theater #8 (also showing the Batman flick) was also hit by bullets coming through the wall. A witness also told reporters on the scene that the shooter eventually entered other theaters after they had been evacuated in an attempt to shoot stragglers. Some witnesses remarked in interviews after the massacre that Holmes appeared and even called himself the ""Joker,"" a character in the Batman saga. Journalists also pointed out that the shooting bears an uncanny resemblance to Frank Miller's graphic novel ""The Dark Knight Rises.""  A puzzling suspect Police have said that Holmes has no criminal history beyond a single traffic violation. They are ""confident"" that Holmes acted alone, and by midday were no longer exploring the possibility that he acted in concert with an accomplice. While witnesses speculated that the incident ""[felt] like"" a terrorist attack in TV interviews immediately after the event, police have said that the alleged gunman has no known connections to terrorist groups or activities. The New York Times reports that police consider Holmes ""somewhat of an enigma""  because they have been unable to find any solid indications of a motive nor any evidence of any past aberrant behavior. However, Oates told reporters at an evening press conference, ""If we had information about a motive, we would not share it with you.""  The victims We've seen two disturbing, graphic amateur videos so far that were taken during or in the direct aftermath of the tragedy. One shows theater-goers fleeing the movie theater, first at a walk and then at a run. The second shows victims being carried through the parking lot away from the site of the attack. The wounded were transported to various local hospitals, all of which remarked that the victims tended to be young, with most between 16 and 30. The youngest person hospitalized that news channels identified was a 3 month-old who was taken to University Hospital. According to 9News, the infant was not injured, and taken to the hospital as a precaution. A 6 year-old was also taken to the local children's hospital. Most of the victims were treated for gunshot wounds, though a few victims only sought treatment for chemical exposure. These latter injuries were caused by the tear gas--or another chemical irritant--that the gunman apparently used to confuse theater-goers. ""Nearly every one [of the victims] was shot,"" Oates told reporters. One victim posted images of his injuries to Reddit >  Gunman stockpiled weapons ahead of the attack Oates told reporters in a press conference Friday evening, ""In the last 60 days he purchased 4 guns at local metro gun shops."" He also purchased 6,000 rounds of ammunition online. The police currently believe that Holmes acquired all his weapons and ammunition legally.  Holmes's mother tells reporters, ""You have the right person"" before Holmes was publicly identified Before police had confirmed the identity of the suspected gunman, ABC News got in touch with Holmes's mother. In a conversation with journalists she said, ""You have the right person...I need to call the police...I need to fly out to Colorado,"" before ending the conversation. Later, San Diego police showed up outside her house. ""We're only here to preserve the peace; we're not here to conduct and investigation or do anything else,"" said Lt. Andrea Brown of the San Diego Police. She said their tasks included keeping the street open and making sure journalists did not disturb the residents. According to the Associated Press, the University of Colorado Medical School said that the suspect had been a student there. He withdrew last month. He appears to have taken a course titled the Biological Basis of Psychiatric and Neurological Disorders (via @BuzzFeedAndrew). The Associated Press reported at 4:20 PM EDT that Holmes is not cooperating with police officials, despite appearing to go quietly with police directly after the shooting and reveal the presence of explosives in his car and apartment. Holmes is currently being held in Araphoe County Jail. His first court appearance will take place on Monday at 8:30 AM local time (10:30 AM EDT), according to Chief Oates. Police have elected not to release a mugshot.  Politicians jump into the fray Both President Barack Obama and presidential candidate Mitt Romney released statements on the incident, expressing sympathy and sadness. Both men gave press conferences about the incident. Warner Brothers has also extended its ""sincere sympathies to the families and the loved ones of the victims"" of the attack, and has cancelled the Paris premiere of The Dark Knight Rises in the wake of the shooting. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg told WOR radio this morning that the incident should prompt candidates to come clean about their stance on gun policy. Pundits have already expressed concerns that the tragic social realities of the shooting will be overshadowed by the political debates it generates, particularly in an election year.  First full day following the massacre draws to a close In a press conference at 7 PM local time (9 PM EDT) Friday--their third of the day--both Police Chief Oates and Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper appeared saddened and exhausted. Chief Oates said that police had removed the last of the 10 bodies of victims pronounced dead in the theater a little after 5 PM local time. Hickenlooper told reporters, ""[We have] an anger that can't find purpose."" He continued, ""We're not just going to let [this] happen to us. We're going to push back."" The next press briefing will take place at 4 PM EDT Saturday. --- You can follow the story by watching 9 News's live coverage and at the Twitter handle #theatershooting.

899005859,2012-07-27 13:39:05,ReThink Review: The Watch,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-watch-review_b_1710631.html,en,False,,623375,Huffington Post - United States,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/?country=US,"Movie Critic for ReThink Reviews Most people probably hadn't heard of the comedy The Watch until the Trayvon Martin shooting in Florida on February 26. That's because the comedy about a group of flawed men unexpectedly fighting off an alien invasion in their quiet, suburban enclave was originally called Neighborhood Watch, but 20th Century Fox decided to change the name after it was revealed that Martin's killer, George Zimmerman, was the coordinator of his community's neighborhood watch. Zimmerman saw confronting and ultimately killing Martin as part of his watch duties and continues to claim that he's done nothing wrong. This was a cautious, probably smart move by 20th Century Fox, even though the fact that Zimmerman was in a neighborhood watch has probably faded from most memories. And The Watch, which obviously has nothing to do with the Martin murder, ultimately succeeds as a good, silly comedy about a group of misfits getting more than they bargained for as they attempt to fill what's missing in their lives through supposedly manly pursuits. However, there's a scene in The Watch -- which stars Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill, and Richard Ayoade -- that did make me think of the Martin shooting, as well as a more recent tragedy that, in many ways, is still playing out. Watch the trailer for The Watch below. Hill's character, Franklin, is a young man who lives with his mother and is described as the group's ""wild card."" Franklin -- who wears an army jacket, has a military-style haircut and has a habit of playing with and brandishing a butterfly knife -- has been deemed unfit (both physically and mentally) to join the police or any other law enforcement agency. And he clearly has a chip on his shoulder about it, evidenced by his testy exchanges with a smug local policeman played by Will Forte. At one point, as the group prepares to confront the aliens, Franklin reveals that he has an arsenal of weaponry hidden under his bed. Like Franklin, Zimmerman was interested in joining law enforcement and was also known to be a hothead who'd been arrested for shoving a cop, had a restraining order taken out against him by his ex-fiancée and lost his job as a security guard due to his unpredictable temper. In that sense, it's easy to imagine Franklin acting a lot like Zimmerman, a guy who would bring a gun on a neighborhood watch patrol, aggressively confront someone he deemed suspicious and be willing to escalate a situation with deadly force. And of course, it's hard to see Franklin's arsenal of ostensibly legally-obtained guns without thinking of the recent mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, where a young man named James Holmes legally bought military-grade weapons, tactical gear and 6,000 rounds of ammunition and used them to kill 12 people and wound 58 in a crowded movie theater. In The Watch, Franklin's guns are used to try to prevent an alien invasion, but if there were no aliens, isn't it natural to wonder, especially after the Aurora massacre, if we'd really want someone like Franklin to have an arsenal like that? I enjoyed The Watch and expect it to do well, both for the quality of its humor and the fact that it's the only comedy being released this week. I don't believe that violent entertainment causes violent behavior, and I actually believe that, like sports, they can be a safe and healthy outlet for aggressive behavior. After all, the world was plenty violent (probably more so) before violent movies and first person shooters were ever invented. But no one can deny that America is a country uniquely obsessed with guns, to the point that one of our two political parties feels that one of America's most important freedoms is being able to own as many of whatever kind of gun you want with few or no restrictions on who can own them and where they can carry them. If American entertainment is seen as too violent, I see that as a reflection of our gun- and military-worshipping culture, not the cause of it. And if people copy the violence they see in movies, the problem is not the movies, but people who can't tell fantasy from reality, and the ease with which our gun laws allow those people to arm themselves to the teeth. The Watch is obviously fiction, but sadly, when unstable people can buy such powerful weapons, we need to do more than just hope that they'll only be aimed at bad guys and aliens. I don't think 20th Century Fox was insensitive or remiss, and The Watch really is a lot of fun. It's just that, after recent events, the idea of angry, heavily-armed young men who stockpile weapons just isn't as funny as it used to be. Follow ReThink Reviews on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. July 22, 2012: President Obama talks to Aurora, Colo., Police Chief Dan Oates after making a statement from the University of Colorado Hospital. (AP) President Obama spoke Sunday to a grieving nation following his visit with survivors of the Colorado theater massacre and family members of the 12 dead, promising that their strength and courage will long outlive the infamy of the shooter. “The perpetrator of this evil act has received a lot of attention over the past couple of days,” the president said in a speech at the University of Colorado Hospital. “What will be remembered are the good people impacted by this tragedy.” The brief speech was both spiritual and presidential, with Obama quoting scripture, thanking doctors and first-responders, vowing the shooter would feel the “full force of the justice system” and calling for the country’s leaders to “do something about this senseless violence.” The gunman killed 12 people and wounded 58 others during a midnight showing of the Batman movie “The Dark Knight Rises” at the Century 16 multiplex in Aurora, Colo., a Denver suburb. Obama said that scripture states God “will wipe away every tear from their eyes and death shall be no more. Neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain.” The president said he journeyed to Colorado and to the bedsides of the victims as a representative of the entire country “to let them know we are thinking of them every day” and as a father and husband. “We can all understand what it would be like,” he said. The president arrived at about 3:30 p.m. local time, then went to the hospital, just a few miles from the crime scene and where 23 of the victims were taken. He was greeted by Gov. John Hickenlooper and Aurora Mayor Steve Hogan, whom he personally thanked along with Aurora Police Chief Daniel Oates. Obama said that during his roughly two-hour hospital visit he shared “hugs, laughs and tears,” but mostly memories. He told the story of two young women whom he met: Allie Young, a 19-year-old girl shot in the neck, and 21-year-old Stephanie Davis, who applied pressure to her friend’s spurting wound and called 911 amid the chaos, then helped carry her friend across two parking lots to an ambulance. “Folks are going to be OK,” Obama said. “I don’t know how many people at any age would have the presence of mind that Stephanie did or the courage that Allie had.” The president’s speech was on the same night as a large community vigil at Aurora City Hall that Hickenlooper and Hogan attended. The alleged shooter, 24-year-old James Holmes, is scheduled to make his first court appearance Monday. Witnesses say he entered the theater, then exited and re-entered through a side door before tossing smoke bombs or canisters of tear gas and firing several weapons, including an AR-15 rifle with a magazine that reportedly held as many as 100 rounds. The president did not mention Holmes’ name in his roughly five minutes of remarks. GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney at a San Francisco fundraiser said Obama’s visit “was the right thing to do.” The incident comes 12 years after a mass shooting at the Columbine High School on Colorado. Two seniors fatally shot 12 students and one teacher, injuring dozens of others. Sunday's trip was Obama's second time to Colorado in less than a month to comfort residents in a state that's critical to the November election. He made a quick visit in late June to Colorado Springs, where hundreds of homes were destroyed in the most devastating wildfire in the state's history. The trip to Colorado is the start of a scheduled three-day campaign trip that includes a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Reno, Nev., fundraisers in California, Oregon and Washington state, and a speech to the National Urban League convention in New Orleans. Romney is scheduled to address the VFW Tuesday. The Associated Press contributed to this story.

              since But doubters are citing official evidence to question that Holmes was the only shooter, or a shooter at all. The argument of the skeptics can be split into three categories: the discovery of Holmes, the real-time testimony on police radio transmissions and the extra evidence at the scene. During the press conference, Oates said that Holmes was ""apprehended outside his White Hyundai parked in the back of the theater"" and that he ""surrendered without any significant incident."" According to police radio transmissions (at 6:15), an officer found ""a suspect in a gas mask"" and another officer asked ""Is that the dude in the white car you're by?"" After a few transmissions, an officer asks (at 6:49) ""That white car in the rear of the lot – is that a suspect?"" The response is ""Yes! We've got rifles, gas mask, he's detained right now, I've got an open door going into the theater."" Skeptics cite this exchange as evidence that Holmes was found in his locked car with a gas mask on and heavily drugged – not outside the car as Oates said – which would have forced first responders to break the passenger side window and get a white stretcher board in preparation to transport him.  We've reported on the eye witness report from Corbin Dates, who said that it looked as if someone in the theater took a phone call by the emergency door and pried it open while ""looking for somebody to come his way."" Another witness told a reporter: ""From what we saw he wasn't alone ... because the second can of tear gas didn't come from his side."" Skeptics highlight that police radio transmissions seem to corroborate those accounts: Three minutes after Holmes was detained in/by his car, an officer says (at 9:58): ""One of the shooters might be wearing a white and blue plaid shirt"" and the dispatcher responds ""Copy, outstanding shooter possibly wearing a white and blue plaid shirt."" An officer says (at 11:43): ""The suspect is saying that he's the only one but I'm getting conflicting suspect descriptions from the witnesses out here."" Then, the dispatcher receives several updates (at 24:42) and says: ""Copy, all units ... male with a red backpack and another one possibly in black clothing headed toward Alameda"" Avenue. Subsequently an officer says (at 25:00): ""Suspect is going to be male, unknown race, black camo-type outfit, believed to be wearing a vest, gas mask and multiple long guns."" That update is reiterated by another officer at 31:15. Even after 45 more minutes pass – making it more than an hour after Holmes was detained – the officers still mention other potential shooters: 1:16:16: Officer: ""Talking to people making statements, sounds like we have possibly 2 shooters, one that was in Theater 8 seated, another one that came in from the outside into Theater 9. Sounds like it was a coordinated attack.""1:16:55: Dispatch: ""Every unit, possible 2nd shooter still at large... Keep the media away from them.""1:31:27: Dispatch: Again, no witnesses are to be released, even if they've been spoken to."" There has not yet been an official explanation of the orange duffel bag, gas can and ballistic gear found at a different part of the parking lot than the ballistic gear found near Holmes' car. And although authorities say they found a 100-round, drum-style ammo clip in the rifle used by Holmes, skeptics note that the rifle found outside of the Theater 9 emergency exit appears to have a normal clip. Another puzzling piece of evidence if Holmes was the only shooter is the second gas mask found at the far end of the parking lot, hundreds of feet from Theater 9's emergency exit and Holmes' car. (Holmes was found wearing a different gas mask.) On July 20 Oates said police ""immediately arrested the suspect at the back of the theater"" 90 seconds after the first 911 call was made, which would make it difficult for Holmes to account for all of the items. All that being said, the Arapahoe County Court judge has granted a request to seal the case against Holmes after the prosecutors argued that disclosing the court records would be ""contrary to public interest"" and ""could jeopardize the ongoing investigation."" So we won't be able to compare the skeptical line of thinking with the search warrants, affidavits, orders and case file anytime soon. For you For you"

86468469,2012-07-23 19:30:10,Why did Colorado shooting suspect avoid social media?,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_mostpopular/~3/KMLoNvlThTA/index.html,en,False,,1095,CNN,http://www.cnn.com/,"It's a truth of the digital age. When a person is plucked from obscurity, for good reasons or bad, the first thing curiosity-seekers do is turn to the Web. Facebook or Twitter. LinkedIn or Tumblr. We expect social media to shed light on a person's personality, especially when, as in the case of Colorado shooting suspect James Holmes, we're trying to explain the unexplainable. As it turns out, 24-year-old Holmes, who stands accused of killing 12 people and wounding dozens more during a shooting spree at a movie theater Friday, appears to have left virtually no digital footprint. Media and law enforcement investigating the shootings have found no traces of him online, aside from a possible account on Adult Friend Finder, a romantic meet-up site, according to police. Former colleague shocked that Holmes is theater shooting suspect It's impossible, of course, to draw broad conclusions about his mindset based on the fact that he didn't share online. But Holmes' lack of an online presence has emerged as a piece of the puzzle for people looking for answers. ""We could ask the same questions about the lack of Web presence that we could for anyone who isolates themselves. Was he socially isolated in all senses?"" asked Dr. Pamela Rutledge, director of the Media Psychology Research Center. ""We know that social isolation can amplify the negative consequences of stress and increase the risk of developing psychopathology. Some research has shown that social isolation actually delays the positive effects of activities found to be emotionally beneficial, such as exercise. ... What we don't know is what caused Holmes to have such a break with reality."" Whatever his reasons, the lack of an online presence puts Holmes squarely in the minority among his peers. About 81% of 18- to 29-year-olds in the United States use social media at least occasionally, said Lee Rainie, director of the Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project. And surveys show that college students like Holmes, who was a graduate neurosciences student at the University of Colorado, are even more likely to use the sites. But Rainie says it would be a mistake to draw a direct line between his decision to eschew social networking and a mindset that led to the alleged violence. ""It's not the norm for someone of this age to have such a limited presence, in any form: no blogs, no profile on a photo-sharing site and things like that,"" Rainie said. ""But it's also a mistake to think the everyone in this age cohort is living every minute of their lives with social media. That's not the case."" Massacre suspect spooked gun range manager The survey didn't ask respondents for specific reasons that they choose not to engage online. But Rainie said Pew has heard numerous reasons, from concerns about wasting time to privacy concerns to simply preferring face-to-face interaction. In a Pew survey from November, two-thirds of respondents (67%) said that staying in touch with current friends is a major reason they use social media, and half gave similar importance to connecting with old friends. Only 3% said that finding a romantic partner was a major reason for their of digital networking tools. ""It's certainly an interesting element of his life that (Holmes) had such a limited digital presence,"" Rainie said. ""But it's not necessarily the case that this means anything about the quality of his social world."" Dr. Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, a professor of business psychology at University College of London, has studied the impact of Internet use on mental health. He too says it's impossible to nail down its significance at this point but listed a set of possibilities, from a sense of isolation to distaste for Facebook as an emblem of ""the status quo"" to something perhaps even more sinister. ""He (possibly) did not want to have any reputation other than for what he was planning to do, like someone who saves himself for the big stage or a single lead role,"" Chamorro-Premuzic said. Similar attacks in the recent past have, in some cases, painted a different picture. Jared Lee Loughner, charged in the January 2011 shootings in Tucson, Arizona, that killed six people and wounded congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, was active on MySpace and YouTube, among other online networks. Anders Behring Breivik was 32 when he killed 69 people, mostly teenagers, at summer camp in Norway in July 2011. Breivik was a prolific blogger who was active on Facebook, Twitter and other sites. He posted a video to YouTube only hours before his shooting rampage. By contrast, reporters looking into the mindset of Seung-Hui Cho, the 23-year-old student who killed 32 people and wounded 25 others in an April 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech, found almost no traces of him online. Shooting survivors recount Colorado movie theater horror The lack of a digital footprint for Holmes has created some unpleasantness for an unexpected group: people who share his relatively common name, live in the area of the shooting and do have a Web presence. ""It amazes me how insensitive, heartless and just plain old IGNORANT some people are in this world,"" a different James Holmes, this one a fitness instructor who, like the suspect, lives in Aurora, wrote on his Facebook page. ""In the last 24 hours I have received hate mail, racist remarks, and sexual advances. I have over 400 friend requests in which a quarter of those are ppl mocking the real killer to gain attention and this was all AFTER the identity of the real killer was revealed ..."" James P. Holmes, who lives in the Denver area, left a similar note on Facebook, albeit in a more wry tone. ""I am not a 24-year-old gun-slinging killer from Aurora, I am a 22-year-old book-slinging mass eater from Littleton ... ,"" he wrote. ""James Holmes happens to be a pretty common name, surprisingly, so try not to jump the gun. Regards, A different guy named James Holmes."" With few, if any, conclusions to draw, Rutledge said the most interesting observation about society as a whole may be how surprised we are that the suspect did not use social media. ""It's a testimony to how normal participating in the social media world is when we look at the lack of presence as an anomaly,"" she said. ""(We wonder,) 'What's wrong with this guy that he's not at least on Facebook?'

Speaking Wednesday night at a National Urban League gathering in New Orleans, Obama said he has issued an executive order establishing the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African Americans, saying, ""A higher education in a 21st century cannot be a luxury. It is a vital necessity that every American should be able to afford,"" he said. He added that his administration is ""pushing all colleges and universities"" to cut their costs. The president focused the bulk of his comments on the economy, saying his tax policies and economic plans aim to boost the middle class. ""We also believe that every entrepreneur should have a chance to start a business, no matter who you are, no matter what you look like,"" he said. ""That's why we've helped African-American businesses and minority-owned businesses and women-owned businesses gain access to more than $7 billion in contracts and financing that allow them to grow and create jobs."" A spokeswoman for presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney responded to the speech, saying Obama has ""disappointed"" African-Americans with his performance on the economy. ""As black Americans, we all take pride in Barack Obama's historic election,"" said Tara Wall, senior communications and coalition adviser for the Romney campaign, ""but unfortunately his performance as president has not matched that enthusiasm. He's disappointed black small business owners, failed to address rising black unemployment -- which now stands at over 14%, and is double that among our youth -- and failed to address the widening economic disparity gap."" Obama's executive order comes in the wake of a new report by the National Urban League's Policy Institute that warned the president could lose three key battleground states -- Virginia, North Carolina and Ohio -- if African-American voters don't match their strong turnout of 2008 in this year's election. ""African-American voters tipped the outcome of the 2008 presidential election in several key states, and are poised to do so again in 2012,"" said the report, titled ""The Hidden Swing Voters: Impact of African-Americans in 2012"" by Madura Wijewardena and Valerie Wilson. ""How this will manifest will depend on many things, but one important factor will be whether the extraordinary growth in turnout by African-American voters in 2008 will be replicated in 2012,"" the report continued. ""The 2008 voter turnout rate was driven by historic factors that may not necessarily apply in 2012."" The ""historic factors"" reference was to Obama being the nation's first African-American nominee of a major party, with voters having the opportunity in 2008 to make him the nation's first African-American president. This time, an economy struggling to recover from a recession that hit African-Americans particularly hard has raised questions about whether Obama supporters will have the same fervor as they did four years ago. A recent Gallup Poll showed the president with overwhelming support among registered African-American voters, with backing of 89%, compared with 5% for certain Republican nominee Mitt Romney. In 2008, Obama won 95% of the African-American vote, with 4% voting for GOP candidate John McCain. About 2 million more African-Americans voted in the 2008 election than in 2004, according to U.S. Census Bureau figures. Voting by all minority groups accounted for nearly all the increase in turnout (5 million) between the two election cycles, as white non-Hispanic voting was virtually unchanged, the Census Bureau reported. A decline in African-American voter turnout to the 2004 level of 60% from the 2008 level of 64.7% would cause Obama to lose in North Carolina and possibly lose in Ohio and Virginia, according to the National Urban League Policy Institute report. Obama won all three states in 2008, and most scenarios for Obama's re-election depend on him winning at least two of them this time. Ohio has 18 electoral votes, while North Carolina has 15 and Virginia has 13. A fierce start to the election campaign, with the candidates and their supporting super PACs launching bitter attacks, has made ensuring enthusiastic backing from traditional support bases a key to victory in November. The president's speech Wednesday concluded a four-day, six-state swing that started earlier than planned Sunday so he could visit Aurora, Colorado, after last week's mass shooting at a movie theater. During the speech, Obama made some of the most forceful statements of his presidency on the issue of gun violence, saying that while he respects the nation's hunting and gun-owning traditions, ""We should leave no stone unturned and recognize that we have no greater mission as a country than keeping our young people safe."""
86361215,2012-07-21 01:25:34,Source: Colorado shooter had 100-round rifle magazine,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_latest/~3/4M_S_kQRGU4/index.html,en,False,,1095,CNN,http://www.cnn.com/,"Authorities in the Colorado movie theater massacre found an AR-15 rifle drum magazine Friday capable of carrying 100 rounds, and the police chief said thousands of rounds of ammunition for various weapons had been bought online in the weeks prior to the shooting. Police took suspect James Holmes, 24, into custody Friday after they say he set off two devices and sprayed the theater with bullets from an AR-15, a 12-gauge shotgun and at least one of two .40-caliber handguns police have recovered. Investigators are confident that Holmes acted alone, police said. Aurora, Colorado, Police Chief Dan Oates said Friday night that Holmes had purchased four guns at ""local metro gun shops,"" and bought over 6,000 rounds of ammunition through online transactions. Assessing what authorities have pieced together about the shooting and the weapons recovered, Oates told reporters, ""As far as we know, it was a pretty rapid pace of fire in that theater."" Life and death decisions within Aurora theater Chad Weinman, CEO of TacticalGear.com of Chesterfield, Missouri, told CNN earlier that his company had a receipt matching Holmes' name and his Aurora address. The receipt showed that Holmes bought an $106.99 Blackhawk urban assault vest, a $52.99 Blackhawk Omega Elite triple pistol magazine, a $52.99 Blackhawk Omega Elite M16 magazine pouch, and a $77.99 Blackhawk Be-Wharned silver knife. With shipping costs, the total bill came to $306.99, according to a copy of the receipt provided to CNN. The firm sells equipment to military and police personnel -- as well as weekend warriors, Weinman said. The gear that the firm believes it sold to Holmes is manufactured by a company called Blackhawk Company, a ""popular brand in tactical circles,"" Weinman said. ""We were pretty shocked to have discovered it,"" Weinman said. Families of victims receive tragic confirmation ""Oh, my God, we couldn't believe it"" was how one of the company's owners reacted, Weinman said. Holmes paid for a two-day air delivery when he placed the order on July 2, which would seem to indicate he wanted the materials in a hurry, Weinman said. Purchasing a 100-round magazine for an AR-15 is unusual, weapons experts said. The AR-15 is designed for easy reloading. ""Even without the grand-sized mags, many people who are practiced can reload in 1½ to 2 seconds,"" said Steven Howard, a Michigan attorney and security and firearms expert. Howard said a crowded theater offers an ideal location for a gunman -- particularly one armed with a shotgun -- to target dozens of victims. A large room such as a theater -- where people are seated in rows -- makes moviegoers easy targets, even for an inexperienced shooter, Howard said. Investigators focus on suspect's apartment Screaming, panicked moviegoers scrambled to escape from the gunman, who wore a gas mask and randomly shot as he walked up the theater's steps, witnesses said. ""The very nature of theaters makes them perfect killing zones,"" said Howard. A shotgun would do more damage among a tightly packed theater audience because its ammunition comes out of the weapon in a reverse funnel shape and would disperse across a wider area, according to Howard. In a theater scenario, he said, ""so many people's heads are lined up next to each other that if you fire down these rows of people ... one blast is going to kill or seriously injure 10 or 15 people, depending on a number of variables."" An AR-15 nonmilitary model, Howard said, shoots one bullet at a time and that bullet ""may go through two people."" Theater shooting unfolds in real time on social media No weapons expertise would be necessary to execute an attack such as the one in Aurora, said Howard, a former U.S. Border Patrol agent. ""Any idiot can do it."" Holmes was apprehended outside his white Hyundai parked in the back of the theater, police said. Three of the weapons were in the car and one was left at the scene inside the theater, said authorities. Howard offered these details about the weapons police say were used in the attack: -- AR-15 rifle: A rifle that commonly fires bullets .223 inches in diameter. Originally manufactured by Colt before its patent ran out, but now also made by others. Cost: around $900 and up. Its military version is a machine gun, which allows a shooter to fire continuously by holding the trigger down. The nonmilitary AR-15 is a semi-automatic which shoots one bullet at a time, with each squeeze of the trigger. Ammunition magazines for the AR-15 commonly hold five to 15 rounds. Aurora Police Chief Oates said Friday night that investigators had determined the suspect bought more than 3,000 rounds of ammunition for the rifle. As for the 100-round rifle drum and the weapon's firing capability, Oates said he did not know whether the rifle was fully automatic or sem-automatic but ""even if it was semi-automatic, I'm told by experts that with that drum magazine, he could've gotten off 50 to 60 rounds ... within one minute."" -- 870 Remington 12-gauge shotgun: One of the most popular shotguns in history. It can be modified to have a short or long barrel. Oates said the suspect had purchased 300 rounds for the shotgun. -- .40-caliber Glock handgun: Common weapon for police. Similar in size to other popular handguns. Oates said some 3,000 rounds of ammunition for the two Glocks had been bought through online purchases. Opinion: Can we feel safe in a crowd anymore? The attacker also used tear gas in the attack, according to police. Tear gas and smoke bombs would ""add to the panic"" and make victims less likely to be able to defend themselves against an attacker, Howard said. The dozens of wounded victims in the attack could well have been hit by ricocheting bullets. ""Once bullets hit a wall, they tend to ricochet down a wall, but they don't bounce like pool balls like a lot of people think and like the movies show. They follow the last surface they hit,"" Howard said. Carpeted walls, which are common in movie theaters would reduce the risk of ricochets, said ballistics expert Jon Nordsby. Bullets that have first passed through objects such as theater chairs might cause worse wounds. The bullets start tumbling after they first penetrate the object. A tumbling bullet will tear more flesh when it hits, he said. Gun debate renewed after shooting Crime scene investigators will likely pay close attention to the location of ammunition shell casings and bullets to learn more details about the attack. They also will likely document the locations where victims fell to determine the trajectory of the bullets. Share your tributes to the victims on CNN iReport."

          / CBS/AP Last Updated 10:45 a.m. EDT (CBS/AP) AURORA, Colo. - Investigators are preparing to detonate shooting suspect James Holmes' apartment building, perhaps as early as today, if they can't safely gain access, reports CBS News correspondent Jeff Glor. Holmes is being held in what is now the biggest mass shooting in U.S. history. Twelve people were shot and killed and 58 hurt, most by gunfire -- and some in the chaos as patrons rushed to flee the theater -- allegedly by the 24-year-old Holmes at a midnight premiere of the Batman movie ""The Dark Knight Rises"" Friday. He says he rigged his apartment with a complex system of booby traps and explosives, and police say they have found no way of safely diffusing them. ""It is a very vexing problem how to enter that apartment safely,"" Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates says. ""I personally haven't seen anything like what the pictures show us is in there. I'm a layman when it comes to bomb stuff, (but) I see an awful lot of wires, trip wires, jars full of ammunition ... jars full of liquids, mortar rounds. We have a lot of challenges to get in there safely."" After spending most of Friday evacuating and scouring the complex, investigators were planning for the possibility they would have to detonate the devices, using a robot, while trying to limit the damage and salvage as much evidence as possible. Complete coverage: Aurora massacre""48 Hours"" special: Tragedy in Aurora U.S. Navy officials confirmed a sailor was among those killed. Petty Officer Third Class John Larimer, 27, of Crystal Lake, Ill., died from injuries sustained in the incident. One other Sailor was treated for injuries and released at the scene. Both Sailors were from a unit that belongs to U.S. Fleet Cyber Command/U.S. Tenth Fleet, located at Buckley Air Force Base, Colo. The fatalities also included 23-year-old Micayla Medek, said Anita Busch, the cousin of Medek's father. The family took the news hard, but knowing her fate after waiting without word brought them some peace, Busch said.  ""I hope this evil act, that this evil man doesn't shake people's faith in God,"" she said. Besides Medek, relatives confirmed that Alex Sullivan and aspiring sports reporter Jessica Ghawi were among those killed, Sullivan on his 27th birthday. Police grimly went door to door late Friday with a list of the deceased victims,, notifying families who had held out anxious hope that their loved ones had been spared. A law enforcement source tells CBS News the plan is for bomb techs to move in to clear out Homles' 800-square foot apartment. Initially, they will be trying to remotely remove the booby trap's trip wire, then seeking to  remotely detonate the improvised devices to make the apartment safe. A water device near trip wire to help reduce the heat given off. Investigators believe there are some 30 aerial shells (fireworks), which can be bought legally. They are the size of softballs, black in color, and made of mostly rubber. Investigators suspect they may have been filled with smoke-less powder. Depending on how they were packaged and how adept Holmes was in setting them up, they could detonate or just burn. The devices will probably be put in sand-filled dump trucks and transported to a remote area where they can be counter-charged or burned. It's considered an enormously dangerous mission. Officers wearing with full bomb gear. Separately, security sources tell CBS News that, as expected, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security have issued a joint intelligence bulletin to state and local police urging them to be vigilant in light of the Colorado shootings. The advisory talks about potential tactics, techniques and indicators of malicious intent that could apply to copycats. The advisory also stresses authorities believe Holmes acted alone and that this attack is an isolated event and not part of some broader threat. Aurora residents are coming together to support each other, as well as the victims who remain in critical condition. Friday night, massacre turned into mourning at a private vigil in Aurora. ""That's how we move forward. We're there for each other,"" one mourner said. ""It's so sad,"" said one of two girls hugging each other and crying. Near the entrance to the Aurora theater's parking lot, a makeshift memorial of 12 candles sat in a row near piles of flowers. Up the hill, about 20 pastors led an emotional vigil for about 350 people, some hugging and crying. A sign read, ""7/20. Gone Not Forgotten.""  An emotional Gov. John Hickenlooper said earlier Friday that people would not be defined by the tragedy.  ""We are clear that we are going to rise back and lift ourselves above this,"" he said. ""They're saying somebody's shooting in the auditorium,"" one police officer is heard saying on a 9112 tape. "" ... They're saying there are hundreds of people just running around."" Speaking from his hospital bed, victim Stephen Barton said, ""I don't really remember people starting to scream until I got hit, and then it was mass mayhem. ... On one level, I thought, 'OK, there's a shooter in the theater and he's trying to kill people,' but on another level, Ii didn't really want to believe it. The first 911 calls came in at 12:39 a.m. Police responded within 90 seconds. An estimated 200 officers wound up at the scene. ""Everybody get on this, it's an assault rifle,"" one officer on a radio said. ""We got magazines down inside. Everybody watch out for the assault rifle."" Another officer can be heard saying, ""We see suspect in gas mask!"" Authorities say Holmes, the alleged assailant, had three guns on him and one in his car -- all legally purchased at Colorado gun stores. Officials say he also purchased over 6,000 rounds of ammunition on the Internet. And while Holmes surrendered without a fight, it's clear that he carefully staged his attack. ""Based on his behavior and based on planning that went into it, he very likely is sitting back enjoying the impact of the crime,"" observes former FBI profiler Mary Ellen O'toole. ""It's very unnerving when you think about that."" Holmes' motive remained unclear. The suspect's stellar academic record, apparent shy demeanor and lack of a criminal background made the attack even more difficult to fathom.  It also wasn't known why the suspect chose a movie theater to stage the assault, or whether he intended some twisted, intended symbolic link to the film itself. Holmes had enrolled last year in a neuroscience Ph.D. program at the University of Colorado-Denver, though he left the program last month for unknown reasons. In academic achievement, ""he was at the top of the top,"" recalled Timothy P. White, chancellor at the University of California, Riverside, where Holmes earned his undergraduate degree before attending the Denver school.  Those who knew Holmes described him as a shy, intelligent person raised in California by parents who were active in their well-to-do suburban neighborhood in San Diego. Holmes played soccer at Westview High School and ran cross-country before going to college.  Police released a statement from his family Friday that said, ""Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved."" The new Batman movie, the last in the trilogy starring Christian Bale, opened worldwide Friday with midnight showings in the U.S. The plot has the villain Bane facing Bale's Caped Crusader with a nuclear weapon that could destroy all of fictional Gotham.  In New York City, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said: ""It clearly looks like a deranged individual. He has his hair painted red. He said he was the Joker, obviously the enemy of Batman.""  Oates would not confirm that information, but did say he had spoken to Kelly. The two used to work together in New York. Asked whether Holmes had makeup to look like the Joker, Oates said: ""That to my knowledge is not true."" CBS News sources say Holmes' hair had been dyed red. A federal law enforcement official said Holmes bought a ticket to ""The Dark Knight Returns,"" went into the theater as part of the crowd and propped open an exit door as the movie was playing. The suspect then donned protective ballistic gear and opened fire, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation.  Authorities said he hit scores of people, picking off people who tried to flee. At least one person was struck in an adjacent theater by gunfire that went through the wall. Adding to the terror and chaos were gas canisters thrown by the suspect that filled the packed suburban Denver theater with smoke.  Tanner Coon, a 17-year-old Aurora resident who was watching the film with two friends, said he first thought the gunshots were firecrackers. When he realized what was happening, he ducked between the seats and waited for the shooter say what he wanted.  ""When is he going to start telling us what to do? When is this going to become a hostage situation?"" Coon said.  When the firing ended, Coon started running up the row, but slipped in blood and fell on top of a woman who was lying on the ground. He tried shaking her, he said, but she didn't respond, so he left her behind and ran out of the theater. After dealing with Holmes' apartment, says Oates, it will be time for his town -- and his officers -- to heal. ""Our cops went through a lot,"" he points out. "" ... They rushed people out of that theater into police cars. I've heard some compelling stories. ... When this has slowed down, one of our highest priorities is to deal with our own officers and how they cope with this event. Holmes remains in police custody, has a lawyer and, sources tell CBS News, is saying very little. His first court appearance is slated for Monday morning. The shooting was the worst in the U.S. since the Nov. 5, 2009, attack at Fort Hood, Texas. An Army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 soldiers and civilians and wounding more than two dozen others. It was the deadliest in Colorado since the 1999 attack at Columbine High School, where two students killed 12 classmates and a teacher and wounded 26 others before killing themselves.

Smith, who was arrested after attending the latest Batman movie armed with a gun, ammunition and knives, said the deadly shooting in Aurora, Colorado, last month prompted his client to bring the weapons for protection. ""He had a fear and wanted to protect himself,"" attorney Matthew Bruce said Friday. Smith, 37, made his first appearance in court Thursday and is currently being held on $250,000 bond. He was arrested Saturday and charged with two counts of carrying a concealed weapon and 19 counts related to carrying weapons ""under disability,"" charges that refer to the effects of prescription drugs Smith was taking, said Nicole DiSanto of the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor's Office. Police say Saturday night Smith went to the Regal Theater in Westlake, Ohio, to see the 10:30 p.m. showing of ""The Dark Knight Rises."" CNN poll: Gun control attitudes haven't changed after shootings According to DiSanto, Smith was the first to arrive, 30 minutes before the movie's start, and took a seat in the back row, directly in the middle, with his back to a wall. A manager at the theater and an off-duty police officer grew suspicious of where he sat, and they noticed the bag Smith was carrying. They asked to search the bag, DiSanto said, and inside found a loaded 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, two loaded magazine clips and three knives. Police said Smith was carrying another knife on his person. His attorney said he had arrived early to get the best seat in the theater. ""That's just the kind of person he is,"" said Bruce, who acknowledged that Smith was not carrying the gun legally. Smith told the off-duty officer he was carrying the gun and knives for protection, to protect himself and other moviegoers, said police, who took him into custody. A search of Smith's home turned up more weapons, including rifles, shotguns and survivalist gear. Analysis: Fewer U.S. gun owners own more guns Westlake police Lt. Ray Arcuri said police believe Smith's position in the movie theater was ""tactical:"" not only was he protected from the back, but he could have fired to his right, left and center on anyone in the theater in front of him. About 80 people attended the movie that night. In 1995, Smith enlisted in the U.S. Army but did not finish basic training, according to Army spokesman George Wright. The charges against Smith follow the mass shooting last month in Aurora, Colorado, where a gunman fired on a crowd of moviegoers watching a showing of ""The Dark Knight Rises."" The attack killed 12 people."

For some, it's because they want to buy a gun for self-protection. But there's a bigger reason, gun-shop owners say. Loading... July 25, 2012 As sure as summer follows spring, gun sales rise after a mass shooting. It happened after the shooting rampage at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999. It happened after the Tucson, Ariz., shootings last year that killed six. Now, after the killing of 12 people last week at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., gun sales are spiking again - not just in Colorado but around the country. “We were overwhelmed Saturday,” says Larry Hyatt, owner of Hyatt Guns in Charlotte, N.C., one of the biggest gun stores in the country. “We had to have 25 people on the counter to help customers. That’s very unusual for this time of year.” Self-protection is part of the reason. But a bigger factor, say gun dealers, is fear of something else:  politicians – specifically, their ability to enact restrictions on gun ownership and acquisition of ammunition. When a high-profile shooting takes place, invariably the airwaves are full of talk about gun control. “Once people start hearing about that, they say, ‘Wow I was planning on doing this. I better do it now,’” says Mr. Hyatt. A gun-store owner in Virginia reports the same phenomenon. ""Normally what happens - and I've been doing this for 30 years – is whenever they start talking about gun control on the news and they start pushing that, people have a tendency to think they're going to take away their right to buy the gun, and that usually spurs sales,” says Paul Decker, owner of Hunters Heaven in Hayes, Va. Never mind that few members of Congress, or the Obama administration, are willing to stick their necks out on gun control. With Election Day drawing near, and gun advocates on edge that President Obama will end up being “the most anti-gun president in American history,” as the National Rifle Association says, that may be one more impetus for those contemplating gun purchases. Gun dealers, in fact, owe a lot to Mr. Obama. Before his election in 2008, gun sales spiked in anticipation that he would promote a gun-control agenda – even though he did not campaign on the issue and the Supreme Court had just handed down its landmark Heller ruling, which asserted an individual right to keep and bear arms. Since the Aurora movie theater massacre July 20, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has not released national data on background checks for gun purchases. But anecdotal evidence from around the country shows that gun sales have spiked since Friday. In the four days since Aurora, dealers submitted 3,647 requests for state background checks for the purchase of a firearm, a spokesperson for the Colorado Bureau of Investigation told Bloomberg. That’s 41 percent more than the 2,583 requests during the same four-day period the previous week, and 38 percent more than the first Friday-to-Monday in July. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Florida’s Department of Law Enforcement reported a 10 percent increase in gun-related background checks from July 20 to July 23, Bloomberg reports. King County in Washington State, where Seattle is located, saw nearly twice as many requests for concealed pistol licenses in the three days after the Aurora massacre, compared with the same period a year ago, according to The Associated Press. Oregon and California also saw increases. • Monitor intern Kimberly Railey contributed to this report. Already a subscriber?

987471954,2012-07-20 00:00:00,Why the Aurora shooting won't likely change the gun control debate,https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/why-the-aurora-shooting-wont-likely-change-the-gun-control-debate/2012/07/20/gJQA6qWpxW_blog.html,en,False,,2,Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,"The shootings in Aurora, Colorado early Friday morning are almost certain to re-stoke the debate over whether more gun control laws are needed, a conversation that has lain near-dormant since early 2011 when former. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D) was shot in Arizona. A single chart from Gallup puts the movement in public opinion on guns in stark terms.  In 1990, almost eight in ten Americans said that the “laws covering the sales of firearms” should be made “more strict” while just 10 percent said they should be made “less strict” or “kept as they are now”. By 2010, those numbers had drastically shifted with 54 percent preferring less strict or no change in guns laws and 44 percent believing gun laws should be made more strict. Public opinion has also proven immune to past high profile tragedies involving guns. In 1999, when Gallup asked the question six times after the Columbine High School massacre in Colorado, the number of those in favor of stricter laws ranged from 60 to 66 percent. The “less strict” number ranged from 5 to 9 percent and the “stay the same” number ranged from 25 to 31 percent. The opinions were similar after the shootings at Virginia Tech in April 2007. By October of that year, 51 percent favored stricter gun laws, a 5 percent decline from a similar Gallup survey taken in the fall of 2006. (Here’s more on how Virginia Tech didn’t move the needle on gun control.) And, in the wake of the attempted assassination of Giffords, that pattern played out again — with little obvious change in how people view society’s relationship with guns. A Pew Research Center poll conducted in April of this year showed that 49 percent of people said the right to own guns was more important while 45 percent said it was more important to control gun ownership. Those numbers were unchanged from a Pew survey conducted Jan. 13-16, 2011 — just days after Giffords was shot in Tucson. That the numbers on gun control remain steady even in the aftermath of such high profile events like Columbine, Virginia Tech and the Giffords shooting suggests that people simply don’t equate these incidents of violence with the broader debate over the right role for guns in our society. They view them as entirely separate conversations — and that’s why the tragedy in Aurora isn’t likely to change the political conversation over guns either.

Xinhua/ZUMA Press A mass shooting at a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises in Aurora, Colorado, has left at least twelve people dead and 58 wounded. The massacre occurred at the Century 16 cineplex at the Aurora Town Center Mall. The suspected shooter is a local resident named James Eagan Holmes who is in police custody, along with the weapons used in the shooting. There is no clear motive for the attack known at this time. This story will be updated throughout the day as we receive more information. Click here to jump to the latest update. How Holmes Was Armed Holmes carried an assault rifle, a shotgun, and two pistols, the Associated Press reports. Holmes reportedly entered the theater from the emergency exit wearing a gas mask and a bullet proof vest. Witness Accounts According to two witnesses whose interview was flagged by the Huffington Post, he entered the theater, tossed canisters of some kind of gas, and then started shooting. “He looked so calm when he did it, it looked scary,” the witness says.  One of the witnesses says he “thought it was part of the show.” Here’s another interview with a witness to the shooting, conducted by a local NBC affiliate in Colorado:   The witness says “we thought special effects, midnight showing, that’s awesome—what theater does that anymore?” After a few moments, the witness continues, he saw “holes in the walls” and realized that the smoke wasn’t part of the show. Poynter, a journalism news site, has collected tweets from people who were at the movie theater in Aurora when the shooting started. More About the Shooter Holmes, the suspected shooter, was a former graduate student in neuroscience at the University of Colorado-Denver School of Medicine. He withdrew from the college last month. He attended Westview High School in San Diego, California, graduating in 2006. He has no previous criminal record. The city of Aurora police chief says that Holmes’ apartment contains “very sophisticated” explosives, and that police could be at the scene “for hours or days.” According to a federal law enforcement source, Holmes had colored his hair red and told local police that he was “The Joker,” the villain in The Dark Knight (2008). Official Response In the wake of the mass killing, other police departments across the country are now stepping up security measures at area theaters. The Paris gala premiere of the film was cancelled. President Barack Obama was reportedly briefed on the incident early Friday morning. In light of the tragedy, the president has cancelled a campaign event in Winter Park, Florida. The White House released a statement early Friday morning, and Obama will address the shooting at 11:20 a.m. in Fort Myers, Florida. It’s common for presidents and other top national politicians to release statements in the wake of big national tragedies, and both Obama and rival Mitt Romney have already expressed “shock and sorrow” at the incident. The Obama and Romney campaigns have both suspended running political advertisements on Colorado television stations, said spokespeople for the campaigns. Bill Burton, cofounder of the pro-Obama Priorities USA Action super-PAC, tweeted that his group was suspending its Colorado ads as well. President Obama remarked on the shooting Friday morning at a campaign stop in Fort Myers, in southwestern Florida. He said he’d spoken with Aurora Mayor Steve Hogan and Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper to express his and First Lady Michelle Obama’s sadness at the shooting. “The federal government stands ready to do whatever’s necessary to bring whomever’s responsible for this heinous crime to justice,” Obama said. “We will take every step possible to ensure the safety of all of our people. We’re going to stand by our neighbors in Colorado during this extraordinarily difficult time.” During a press briefing Friday morning aboard Air Force One, White House press secretary Jay Carney was asked if President Obama believes that the Aurora massacre warrants a review of gun safety laws. Carney told reporters the following: The president believes that we need to take common-sense measures that protect Second Amendment rights of Americans, while ensuring that those who should not have guns under existing law do not get them…But I have nothing new—nothing additional on that for you. UPDATE, Friday, 11:45 a.m. EST: Suspected gunman’s landlord won’t talk publicly In a brief conversation with Mother Jones, Joan Holley, the manager of Holley Realty who rents out units at the Aurora, Colorado, apartment building where suspected gunman James E. Holmes lived, said she is not yet speaking publicly about Holmes. “Out of respect to the victims and other people involved, I am declining to answer any questions at this time,” Holley said. Holley would not confirm whether she knew Holmes. Asked if she had yet talked to the local police, she said, “I’m going to say goodbye now. I cannot answer at this time.” According to a former resident of that building (who did not know Holmes), the building is mostly rented to college students. Holmes reportedly attended an area medical school but withdrew last month. UPDATE 2, Friday, 12:25 p.m. EST: Photo of suspected gunman Multiple news sources say this is a photo of suspected shooter James E. Holmes:  The image was sent to a local ABC affiliate by the University of Colorado, where Holmes was reportedly a student. UPDATE 3, Friday, 12:35 p.m. EST: Suspected gunman’s yearbook photo Here’s Holmes’ high school yearbook photo, according to San Diego 6 News:   UPDATE 4, Friday, 1:22 p.m. EST: Organizations respond with calls for gun control Dan Gross of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the largest group in the United States of its kind, issued a statement this morning expressing sympathies to the victims’ families and survivors, and also called for action on gun laws: This tragedy is another grim reminder that guns are the enablers of mass killers and that our nation pays an unacceptable price for our failure to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. We are outraged. We understand that President Obama has just spoken and so might Mitt Romney. As someone who has suffered the lasting impact of gun violence, and President of Brady, I can tell you that we don’t want sympathy.  We want action…We are insistent that our elected leaders take action to prevent future tragedies. Political cowardice is not an excuse for evasion and inaction on this life-and-death issue. The United States Conference of Mayors responded similarly: The nation’s mayors express their shock at a mass shooting and send their condolences to the victims, their families, and their community…While we don’t yet have all of the facts in the case, we do know that all evidence this morning points to a heavily armed assailant now in police custody. While questions about his motives and about how he obtained his weapons will be answered in the hours and days ahead, the fact remains that once again guns have been used in a mass killing of innocent people. The U.S. Conference of Mayors is repeating its call for reasonable changes in our gun laws and regulations that could help to prevent senseless tragedies such as the one that has rocked Aurora and the nation this morning.  UPDATE 5, Friday, 2:05 p.m. EST: “Not speculating on motive.” During a joint press conference, Aurora police chief Dan Oates told reporters that his department is “not speculating on motive” at this time. He also mentioned that the explosives for boobytrap found in alleged gunman Holmes’s apartment were “linked together with all sorts of wire.” Oates stated that the police are “not prepared to release [Holmes’] booking photo” today, and that he didn’t yet know whether or not the weapons used were possessed legally. UPDATE 6, Friday, 3:27 p.m. EST: Stars of The Dark Knight Rises cancel promotional events Dark Knight Rises stars Morgan Freeman and Marion Cotillard have pulled out of major press and promotional events scheduled for today and and this evening in France. “The whole team decided out of respect for the families to cancel the premiere,” Cotillard representative said. Warner Bros., which is distributing the film, has not announced whether or not they will cancel future promotional events.  UPDATE 7, Friday, 3:35 p.m. EST: Firearms bought legally, “drum-style” ammo clip used ABC News has confirmed that the three firearms used in the theater shooting—a AR-15 assault rifle, a Remington twelve-gauge shot gun, and a .40 Glock handgun—were purchased legally. ATF agents are currently tracing the weapons. A high-capacity, drum-style ammo clip for the AR-15 was also used in the massacre, according to the Associated Press. (Click here, here, and here for Mother Jones‘ past coverage of these kinds of large gun clips.) Here’s a photo of a precision built, ultra-high capacity, drum-style magazine for an AR-15: Brownells.comUPDATE 8, Friday, 3:59 p.m. EST: Defense Department statement US Navy and Air Force service members were among the injured. The Department of Defense released the following statement: The Department of Defense is deeply saddened by the news of the tragic incident at the Aurora Mall Movie Theater in Aurora, Colo. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and the families of those impacted by this event. One sailor was injured and one, known to have been at the theatre that evening, is currently unaccounted for. Two airmen were injured in the incident. The Navy and the Air Force are working with the families of these service members to ensure they have the care and attention they need. We can also confirm that the alleged gunman in this incident, James Holmes, is not a past or current member of any branch or component of the U.S. Armed Forces. UPDATE 9, Friday, 5:49 p.m. EST: Patients at University of Colorado Hospital Physicians at University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora treated 23 of the most critically wounded victims.  UPDATE 10, Friday, 8:09 p.m. EST: The Dark Knight Rises director Christopher Nolan weighs in Christopher Nolan, the director of The Dark Knight Rises, issued a statement on the mass shooting: Speaking on behalf of the cast and crew of The Dark Knight Rises, I would like to express our profound sorrow at the senseless tragedy that has befallen the entire Aurora community. I would not presume to know anything about the victims of the shooting but that they were there last night to watch a movie. I believe movies are one of the great American art forms and the shared experience of watching a story unfold on screen is an important and joyful pastime. The movie theatre is my home, and the idea that someone would violate that innocent and hopeful place in such an unbearably savage way is devastating to me. Nothing any of us can say could ever adequately express our feelings for the innocent victims of this appalling crime, but our thoughts are with them and their families.

The alleged gunman, James Holmes, 24, reportedly burst into the theater about 30 minutes into the midnight showing of ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" and began walking up and down the aisles, methodically shooting moviegoers as they sat trapped in their seats. His victims never had a chance. All indications are that Holmes acted alone, and he has been arrested, so the threat posed by this specific offender has been removed. However, as Americans face the prospect of leaving the security of their homes and going to public malls, schools, restaurants, and movie theaters, they may reasonably wonder about the risks they face. Are they in more danger today than they were in the past? And are these types of attacks getting worse--more frequent and more deadly? Some answers can be gleaned from the New York Police Department's recent study of ""active shooters""--perpetrators who killed or attempted to kill people in a confined and populated area, and who harmed random innocent victims beyond any specific, targeted individual. Its data show that from 1966-2010, there were 179 active shooter incidents in the United States that resulted in at least two casualties. Overall, the frequency of these incidents in the U.S. rose dramatically, with 18 attacks occurring from 1980-1989, 54 attacks from 1990-1999, and 87 attacks from 2000-2009. Worse yet, over this time span, the number of attacks resulting in at least five fatalities more than tripled, from 6 high-fatality shootings in the 1980s to 19 high-fatality shootings in the 2000s. Following Holmes' attack on the movie theater in Aurora, four of the ten most lethal mass shootings in U.S. history have now occurred in the past six years. The other three are Nidal Hasan's attack at the Fort Hood Army base in 2009, Jiverly Wong's attack at a Binghamton immigration center in 2009, and Seung-Hui Cho's attack on the Virginia Tech campus in 2007. The worst of these was the Virginia Tech massacre, which left 32 dead and 20 wounded, not included Cho, who committed suicide. However, if reports of at least 12 dead and 59 wounded in Aurora are accurate, that would mean that Holmes's attack resulted in more total casualties (fatalities plus injuries) than any prior shooting on U.S. soil. And the Aurora attack comes less than one year after Anders Behring Breivik set the international ""record,"" killing 77 and wounding more than 200 in his combined bombing/shooting attack in Norway. On a national scale, mass shooters pose a far lesser threat to human survival than many everyday activities, such as driving. Traffic fatalities kill more than 30,000 people per year in the U.S., while on average, mass shooters kill less than 100. However, that will come as little comfort to the victims in Aurora--or their families. The fact remains that mass shootings are increasingly common and increasingly deadly. And there's no clear end in sight. Criminal Justice Professor, Author of ""The Myth of Martyrdom: What Really Drives Suicide Bombers, Rampage Shooters, and Other Self-Destructive Killers"""
296457572,2012-07-27 12:00:00,We won’t know the cause of gun violence until we look for it,http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/we-wont-know-the-cause-of-gun-violence-until-we-look-for-it/2012/07/27/gJQAPfenEX_story.html,en,False,,2,Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,"Jay Dickey, a Republican and life member of the NRA, represented Arkansas in the House from 1993 to 2000. Mark Rosenberg, president and chief executive of the Task Force for Global Health, was director of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 1994 to 1999. A few years ago, one of us came across a young woman who had just been hit by a car. She was the mother of two young children and one of Atlanta’s star runners. I found her unconscious and bleeding profusely from a severe head injury. She died in my arms while I tried to resuscitate her. Her death was tragic, but it wasn’t “senseless.” In scientific terms, it was explicable. The runner, who had competed in 15 marathons and broken many records, wore no lights or reflective vest in the early-morning darkness; she crossed the street within crosswalk lines that had faded to near-invisibility; there were no speed bumps on this wide, flat street to slow cars down. Scientists don’t view traffic injuries as “senseless” or “accidental” but as events susceptible to understanding and prevention. Urban planners, elected officials and highway engineers approach such injuries by asking four questions: What is the problem? What are the causes? Have effective interventions been discovered? Can we install these interventions in our community? The federal government has invested billions to understand the causes of motor vehicle fatalities and, with that knowledge, has markedly reduced traffic deaths in the United States. Since the mid-1970s, research has inspired such interventions as child restraints, seat belts, frontal air bags, a minimum drinking age and motorcycle helmets. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that 366,000 lives were saved through such efforts from 1975 to 2009. Through the same scientific, evidence-based approach, our country has made progress understanding and preventing violence. Once upon a time, law-abiding citizens believed that violence generated by evil always had existed and always would exist. By the mid-20th century, that sense of fatalism was yielding to discoveries by social scientists, physicians and epidemiologists. Now a body of knowledge exists that makes it clear that an event such as the mass shooting in Aurora, Colo., was not a “senseless” occurrence as random as a hurricane or earthquake but, rather, has underlying causes that can be understood and used to prevent similar mass shootings. We also recognize different types of violence, including child abuse and neglect, sexual assault, elder abuse, suicide and economically and politically motivated violence. Like motor vehicle injuries, violence exists in a cause-and-effect world; things happen for predictable reasons. By studying the causes of a tragic — but not senseless — event, we can help prevent another. Recently, some have observed that no policies can reduce firearm fatalities, but that’s not quite true. Research-based observations are available. Childproof locks, safe-storage devices and waiting periods save lives. But it’s vital to understand why we know more and spend so much more on preventing traffic fatalities than on preventing gun violence, even though firearm deaths (31,347 in 2009, the most recent year for which statistics are available) approximate the number of motor vehicle deaths (32,885 in 2010). From 1986 to 1996, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sponsored high-quality, peer-reviewed research into the underlying causes of gun violence. People who kept guns in their homes did not — despite their hopes — gain protection, according to research published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Instead, residents in homes with a gun faced a 2.7-fold greater risk of homicide and a 4.8-fold greater risk of suicide. The National Rifle Association moved to suppress the dissemination of these results and to block funding of future government research into the causes of firearm injuries. One of us served as the NRA’s point person in Congress and submitted an amendment to an appropriations bill that removed $2.6 million from the CDC’s budget, the amount the agency’s injury center had spent on firearms-related research the previous year. This amendment, together with a stipulation that “None of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control,” sent a chilling message. Since the legislation passed in 1996, the United States has spent about $240 million a year on traffic safety research, but there has been almost no publicly funded research on firearm injuries. As a consequence, U.S. scientists cannot answer the most basic question: What works to prevent firearm injuries? We don’t know whether having more citizens carry guns would decrease or increase firearm deaths; or whether firearm registration and licensing would make inner-city residents safer or expose them to greater harm. We don’t know whether a ban on assault weapons or large-capacity magazines, or limiting access to ammunition, would have saved lives in Aurora or would make it riskier for people to go to a movie. And we don’t know how to effectively restrict access to firearms by those with serious mental illness. What we do know is that firearm injuries will continue to claim far too many lives at home, at school, at work and at the movies until we start asking and answering the hard questions. “Such violence, such evil is senseless,” President Obama said last week. What is truly senseless is to decry these deaths as senseless when the tools exist to understand causes and to prevent these deadly effects. We were on opposite sides of the heated battle 16 years ago, but we are in strong agreement now that scientific research should be conducted into preventing firearm injuries and that ways to prevent firearm deaths can be found without encroaching on the rights of legitimate gun owners. The same evidence-based approach that is saving millions of lives from motor-vehicle crashes, as well as from smoking, cancer and HIV/AIDS, can help reduce the toll of deaths and injuries from gun violence. Most politicians fear talking about guns almost as much as they would being confronted by one, but these fears are senseless. We must learn what we can do to save lives. It is like the answer to the question “When is the best time to plant a tree?” The best time to start was 20 years ago; the second-best time is now.

              since President Barack Obama took a surprisingly tough stance in favor of gun control last night, wading into the gun debate for the first time since last Friday's mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado. In a speech to the National Urban League in New Orleans, the President admitted that not enough has been done to reduce gun violence and to ensure that guns don't end up in the hands of criminals. Although Obama offered no new policy proposals, he pledged to support ""common sense"" restrictions, including a new ban on assault weapons. Here's the relevant excerpt from the White House transcript (emphasis mine): ""I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals — that they belong on the battlefield of war, not on the streets of our cities. I believe the majority of gun owners would agree that we should do everything possible to prevent criminals and fugitives from purchasing weapons; that we should check someone’s criminal record before they can check out a gun seller; that a mentally unbalanced individual should not be able to get his hands on a gun so easily. These steps shouldn’t be controversial. They should be common sense."" Still, the President made little indication that he plans to push for new legislation, citing opposition in Congress as an obstacle to any further restrictions. Watch the clip below, courtesy of MSNBC:  Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy Meanwhile, Obama's Republican opponent Mitt Romney came down on the other side of the debate Wednesday night, stating that although he passed an assault weapons ban as Governor of Massachusetts, he opposes a federal ban. ""I don't happen to believe that America needs new gun laws,"" Romney told NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams during an interview in London Wednesday night. ""A lot of what this young man did was clearly against the law. But the fact that it was against the law did not prevent it from happening."" ""And so we can sometimes hope that just changing the law will make all bad things go away,"" Romney added later. ""It won't. Changing the heart of the American people may well be what's essential, to improve the lots of the American people.""

Wade Michael Page, the alleged killer, according to multiple news sources was a 40 year old Army veteran with a hate symbol tattoo who received a demotion and a less than honorable discharge from the military in 1998 for ""patterns of misconduct"" according to CNN after six years of service, finishing up at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Disgruntled military veteran killers like Nidal Hassan (who was in the Army), Holocaust Museum shooter James von Brunn, Olympic and clinic bomber Eric Robert Rudolph as well as executed Oklahoma City Bomber Timothy McVeigh and D.C. Sniper John Allen Muhammad (the latter two had accomplices), have led many to mechanistically conclude that military service is part of a profile of loner extremists. The real story is far more complex, as it is more likely that a first responder or victim to a mass shooting will be a military veteran than the shooter. Irrespective of their military status, these kind of killers are often depressed, socially and psychologically itinerant adult males whose significant and defining life setbacks in career or relationships create a festering anger that explodes into violence against a symbolic target. These targeted locations and innocent people are the sincere focus of aggression in the contorted thinking of someone whose anger and belief system leads them to settle a score and reaffirm their self worth by achieving notoriety through violence. A violent act transforms them from losers to warriors for a cause that is bigger than they are, and they are hitting back, not only on behalf of themselves, but for others who faced similar unfairness from an uncaring society. The three main categories of extremist aggressors are listed below, and usually one is the primary element with an offender, with at least one other playing a secondary supporting role: . The Ideologically Motivated (Religious, Political or Hybrid) . The Psychologically Dangerous (Sociopath or Cognitively Impaired) . Personal Benefit or Revenge A politically controversial, if not prescient 2009 DHS Report noted: The possible passage of new restrictions on firearms and the return of military veterans facing significant challenges reintegrating into their communities could lead to the potential emergence of terrorist groups or lone wolf extremists capable of carrying out violent attacks. Hate Rock and Hate Crime Page according to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) was ""part of the white power music scene since 2000, when he left his native Colorado on a motorcycle."" SPLC further reports: He attended white power concerts in Georgia, North Carolina, West Virginia and Colorado. At various times, he said, he also played in the hate rock bands Youngland (2001-2003), Celtic Warrior, Radikahl, Max Resist, Intimidation One, Aggressive Force and Blue Eyed Devils. End Apathy, he said, included ""Brent"" on bass and ""Ozzie"" on drums; the men were former members of Definite Hate and another band, 13 Knots. The SPLC also stated that in 2000 Page attempted to buy materials from the neo-Nazi National Alliance, that at the time, was among the nation's most prolific sellers of hate material and music. Page reportedly belonged to a group called End Apathy and conducted an interview on a hate rock website. The National Alliance frequently sought to recruit active duty military and veterans, specifically targeting Fort Bragg in the late 1990s, where page had served. In 1995 a billboard outside the installation advertised the hate group, and in December 1995 two neo-Nazi soldiers from the Fort killed an African-American couple off base after getting drunk and listening to hate rock music. According to the Sikh coalition there have been about 700 instances of violence or non-criminal discrimination against the community since 9/11 including homicides, assaults, and arson. Sikhism was established in what is now the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent about five centuries ago and its 27 million adherents constitute the fifth largest religious faith. Recently a bill was introduced to count anti-Sikh hate crime in federal hate crime statistics. About 4% of hate crimes take place at houses of worship, with 16% of anti-religion hate crimes occurring there. Over the last decade the FBI has reported less than one dozen hate homicides annually and reported hate crime are near fourteen year lows. At the same time, the number of hate groups nationally has risen each year over the last decade to over 1,000. The overwhelming majority of hate crimes overall are not committed by hard core hate mongers, but hard core hatemongers are believed to be responsible for about 33%-40% of hate motivated homicides. We will find out more about the offender and motives behind this horrendous atrocity, which shocked the sensibilities of our pluralistic democracy. One thing is certain, lone wolves, have been and remain a significant domestic terror risk that is difficult to thwart. A combination of isolation, depression, anger and an enabling hateful belief system, as in the case of hate rock, often combine to produce acts of inexplicable violence against innocent people, except in the twisted minds of those who commit these crimes, and those who share their hatreds and frustrations.

820150271,2012-07-23 00:00:00,Here Are the Most Insane Aurora Shooting Conspiracy Theories,http://gawker.com/5928451/here-are-the-most-insane-aurora-shooting-conspiracy-theories,en,False,,5880,Gawker,http://gawker.com,"While some choose to debate about gun control or the state of healthcare for the mentally ill, other stalwart truthseekers have made it their mission to get to the bottom of James Holmes' massacre at a midnight showing of The Dark Knight Rises. Appearing on CNN's State of the Union to discuss the mass shooting in Aurora, Coloradoâ¦ And when it comes to the internet, we know what's at the bottom of everything â conspiracy theories. ""I believe the Obama administration is behind this.""
In a post on Conservatives4Palin.com (""Just the facts""), user mark1955 heads to the Aurora shooting open thread to make his case. Commenting on yesterday's massacre in Aurora,Colorado. I'm gonna catch heck for this,but i am going to say it anyway's. I believe the Obama administration is behind this. Not one week from the rumored Obama signing of the UN Gun Ban Treaty,on Friday the 27th and Obama is 'Gift Wrapped' this horrific slaughter, that he can take and use to Obliterate our God given Second Ammendment Right's. Bulshe! This ain't no coincidence! Now hear him out. Mark has good reason to believe the official story is ""bulshe."" They can't realize any of their plans to enslave and then murder us,in order to destroy the United States of America as founded,unless they take our Firearms away.This is an administration that thought nothing about creating a program like,'Fast and Furious',specifically designed to result in the murder of 300 mexicans and two American Border Patrol Agents, to see their goal of taking away our Firearms so we can't defend ourselves. You think they would have any qualms about murdering little children in a theatre? They wouldn't. At the foundation of statism is mass genocide. It's what they feed off of. Mark's other evidence: James Holmes' mother didn't seem surprised that her son was a mass murderer. ""It was a little too quick,"" he notes. And don't think this is the last massacre the Obama administration will orchestrate. Finally,as revealed above with their,""By any means necessary plans"" as we get closer to the elections ( Which i don't believe Obama wants to have take place ),expect more deliberately horrors like yesterday,increasing in frequency and body count, as justification to suspend elections and take away our Rights. ""Virginiagentleman1"" responded that he once would have called Mark crazy â even suggested he seek treatment for his conspiracy theory. ""But so much has changed in America,"" the commenter concludes, ""all bets are off."" ""Someone else taught this guy these skills and funded the acquisition of the equipment.""
The editor of Natural News, Mike Adams, doesn't go so far as to name Obama, but his argument amounts to the same: James Holmes was hired and trained by the U.S. government for the express purpose of taking away your guns. Adams doesn't think Holmes' actions make sense â why did he wear a bulletproof vest? Why did he tell police about the bomb at his apartment? (""If you were really an evil-minded Joker trying to kill people [including cops], why would you warn them about the booby trap in advance? It doesn't add up."") While such ""inconsistencies"" could easily be attributed to psychosis or misreported facts, the author has a more reasonable explanation: this was all government coercion. There is already conjecture that James Holmes may have been involved in mind-altering neuroscience research and ended up becoming involved at a depth he never anticipated. His actions clearly show a strange detachment from reality, indicating he was not in his right mind. That can only typically be accomplished through drugs, hypnosis or trauma (and sometimes all three). Adams' primary evidence seems to be that Holmes could never have acquired all of this equipment on his own. He comes up with the dubious figure of $20,000, which yes, would be difficult for a failed med student to spend. Adams jumps to the most logical conclusion â and you're an idiot if you don't see it. In other words, this guy was equipped with exotic gear by someone with connections to military equipment. SWAT clothing, explosives, complex booby-traps... c'mon, this isn't a ""lone gunman."" This is somebody who was selected for a mission, given equipment to carry it out, then somehow brainwashed into getting it done. C'mon. Now, stick with him â given that Holmes was obviously brainwashed and supplied with weapons, doesn't it follow that someone in the government is responsible? Again, Adams doesn't name names, but he does once more invoke ""Fast and Furious"" as evidence that the current administration will do anything in their power to destroy the Second Amendment. This has all the signs of Fast & Furious, Episode II. I wouldn't be surprised to discover someone in Washington was behind it all. After all, there's no quicker way to disarm a nation and take total control over the population than to stage violence, blame it on firearms, then call for leaders to ""do something!"" Such calls inevitably end up resulting in gun confiscation, and it's never too long after that before government genocide really kicks in like we saw with Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, Mao and other tyrants. He's not saying Obama is Hitler. He's just saying. ""The city officials of Aurora actually created an environment in which victims would be unarmed and at a considerable disadvantage against an armed attack.""
But wait, there's more. Adams returned with a disgusting article in which he essentially blamed the victims for not doing more: ""Why did no one fight back?"" Sure, the scene was dark and chaotic and filled with smoke, but it's just impossible that no one even tried to take down the gunman. (Maybe they were too busy protecting their loved ones.) Seriously, though, Adams is terrible. When tragedy strikes, I stay up all night reading the news. The only way I know how to processâ¦ A baby was shot at point blank range, the family were gathered around screaming. Huh? If the baby was shot at point blank range, that means the shooter was right there beside them. Instead of gathering around and screaming, why didn't the family tackle the shooter? Adams swear he's not blaming the victims, right before he goes on to say ""they let him do it."" And they had plenty of opportunities to stop him, as Adams helpfully explainsâ To fire 100+ rounds of ammunition from any weapon requires multiple reloads, each of which takes several seconds to carry out. There would have been long pauses in the shooting. There has even been a report that the AR-15 rifle used by the shooter jammed, which would have created an even longer pause. These pauses are opportunities to bum rush the guy, or shoot back, or throw something at him, or just punch him right in the jaw with everything you've got. Holding a gun does not make you invincible. If anything, it makes you very, very vulnerable to all sorts of attacks. It's all meaningless speculation: by the end, Adams' argument is essentially that Americans have been terrorized into fear, meaning they will sit down and take it instead of fighting back. As far as I can tell, his point is that if he'd been there, things would have gone differently, because Adams is not part of the ""culture of passive victims."" Adams was forced to update his story when it was revealed that Aurora, Colorado does not allow citizens to carry concealed weapons. This helps him arrive at his next bullshit conclusion, ""In Aurora Colorado, it is illegal to stop a massacre."" It is astonishing that cities like Aurora, Colorado do not allow citizens to protect themselves against violence. The deaths of those 12 victims rest squarely on the officials of the city of Aurora who deliberately created an environment of total helplessness that directly led to the unnecessary deaths of innocent people, including young women and children. ""Deliberately"" is the key word here. The implication isn't just that Aurora is responsible for taking innocent people's guns away â it's that they wanted this massacre to happen. ""Aurora is considered to be the mother of the morning star, also know as the Light Bringer, or Lucifer.""
On the surface, this post on The Vigilant Citizen is the same kind of crazy Adams is spouting: James Holmes was a ""mind-controlled patsy."" But here's where it goes from crazy to extra crazy. Is there some kind of ritualistic connection between The Dark Knight, the sacrificial death of Heath Ledger and this new installment of a Batman movie that was ""launched"" with a mass murder? Is there a reason why this mass-murder, which occurred during the midnight screening of a movie called Dark Knight RISING took place in a city called Aurora, the name Roman goddess of dawn (dawn being the time where the sun begins to rise)? Another interesting fact: Aurora is considered to be the mother of the morning star, also know as the Light Bringer, or Lucifer. Really using the term ""interesting fact"" loosely there. Yes, this was a ""mega-ritual carried out by the occult elite and its mass media appendage."" As we all know, blood sacrifice is an important part of these rituals, and the more witnesses, ""the more potency it gains."" And if you want to see things take a turn from extra crazy to certifiable, check out the comments. Of course, the Illuminati get namechecked. Sometimes I don't want to believe it was the Illuminati. Sometimes, I would rather just accept that this was a mere coincidence. But everywhere I turn, every fucking time, there's symbolism jam-packed into the event in question. Not only that, but it's only the events that have said symbolism that get covered by the mass media for days on end. I wonder whyâ¦ It spirals from there. There's lots of talk of numerology and impossible coincidences (Katie HOLMES and James HOLMES, holy shit). Then there's the symbolism of ""Colorado."" Also, are you aware that the word âcolorado' actually means: âred color' i,e, blood? I found that bit of info quite appropriate considering all that goes on there. Columbine shooting, JonBenet, Aurora shooting, not to mention the bizarre Denver International Airport murals. One more observation here, 12 victims, 2+1=3. Cool observation. This is only the tip of the iceberg. A basic Google search of ""Aurora shooting conspiracy"" pulls up several pages of results. Perhaps it's not satisfying to accept James Holmes as a man who lost touch with reality and committed a horrifying act of violence. Why fear a random gunman when you can fear the government as a whole? Also, Lil Wayne. [Image via AP]"

July 27, 2012 -- intro:As the initial horror of last week's movie theater massacre in Aurora, Colo., begins to subside, the calls for action to prevent another mass shooting are growing. But in the week following the worst mass shooting in U.S. history that left 12 dead and 58 injured, the political push for gun control is far weaker than after similar tragedies of the past. Nearly every major reform to U.S. gun laws has come on the heels of a mass shooting. From Columbine to John F. Kennedy, America's most terrifying shootings have been the catalysts for the country's most sweeping reforms. quicklist: 1title: St. Valentine's Day Massacre category: Inspired a hefty tax on automatic weaponstext:During prohibition in 1929 mobsters like Al Capone ruled the streets of Chicago, stockpiling fortunes from bootlegged alcohol sales and taking no prisoners. To solidify his position as Chicago's No.1 gangster, Capone's cronies executed seven rival mobsters in what came to be known as the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. Capone's men were loaded down with two Thompson submachine guns when they burst into rival mobster George ""Bugs"" Moran garage, lined seven men up against a wall and opened fire, shredding their victims with 90 bullets. The massacre inspired Congress to take action against the machine guns and short-barreled shotguns that were common in gang violence. In 1934 President Franklin Roosevelt signed the National Firearms Act which imposed a hefty $200 fined on such gangster weapons. media: 16861523 quicklist: 2title: President Kennedy's Assassination category: Inspired Congress to outlaw mail order sales of rifles and shotgunstext: After Lee Harvey Oswald assassinated President John F. Kennedy using a sniper rifle he bought through the mail, Sen. Thomas Dodd, D-Conn., introduced a ban on mail order sales of rifles and shotguns, re-igniting the gun control debate. While Kennedy's assassination in 1963 restarted the national discussion about gun control, it was not until the back-to-back assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert Kennedy pushed Congress to actually pass legislation. Four months after Robert Kennedy was killed, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Gun Control Act of 1968 into law, banning mail order sales of rifles and shotguns and prohibiting most felons, drug users and people found mentally incompetent from buying guns. media:16861488 quicklist: 3title: President Reagan's Assassination Attemptcategory: Inspired criminal background check requirementstext: President Ronald Reagan had been in office a mere 69 days when John Hinckley Jr. attempted to assassinate him while leaving the Washington Hilton Hotel in D.C. Reagan was shot in the lung and made a full recovery. Reagan's press secretary James Brady was not so lucky. He took a bullet to the head that left him permanently paralyzed. Following the attack, Brady became an advocate for handgun control, founding the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence that is still active today. In 1993 President Bill Clinton signed a law that requires prospective gun owners to pass a federal background check before buying a gun. The act was named after James Brady. media:16861542  quicklist: 4title: 101 California Street Shootingcategory: Inspired the 1994 assault weapons bantext: On July 1, 1993 a 55-year-old man strolled into the Pettit & Martin law offices on 101 California St. in San Francisco with three handguns and opened fire, killing eight and wounding six before killing himself. The shooter, Gian Luigi Ferri, used two TEC-9 handguns equipped with Hellfire triggers, which allow the gunman to shoot faster and make the semi-automatic weapon nearly automatic. It was the worst mass killing in San Francisco's history and inspired some of the most sweeping gun control laws at both the state and federal level. Thirteen months after the attack, Congress passed an assault weapons ban, outlawing the three handguns Ferri used along with 17 other types of military-style guns such as the AK-47 and the Uzi submachine gun. The 1994 assault weapons ban expired in 2004 and all five attempts to renew it have failed. The shooting inspired California to pass the most stringent state gun control law in the country. The law, which took effect six years after the California Street shooting, banned semi-automatic rifles and pistols that have various accessories like pistol grips or folding stocks. It also outlawed magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. media:16861478 quicklist: 5title: Columbine High School Shootingcategory: Re-ignited gun control debate, but no changes to lawtext: When teenagers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold opened fire on their fellow students at Columbine High School on April 20, 1999 they struck fear into the hearts of parents and schoolchildren nationwide. By the time the pair committed suicide, 12 of their classmates and one teacher lay dead. It was, at the time, the most deadly school shooting in American history, creating a cloud of fear that hung over schools around the country. But the massacre did not result in changes to America's gun control policies. A month after the shooting, the Senate narrowly passed a bill requiring background checks for firearm sales at gun shows, with Vice President Al Gore casting the deciding vote. The bill, which also required child safety trigger locks to be sold with guns, never passed the House. media:16861589 quicklist: 6title: Virginia Tech Shootingcategory: Inspired more stringent background check systemtext: Virginia Tech senior Seung Hui Cho was deemed ""mentally ill"" and ""an imminent danger to self or others"" more than a year before he murdered 32 of his fellow Virginia Tech University students in the deadliest school shooting in U.S. history. Cho legally purchased two handguns in the months following the psychological evaluation. In the year following the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, Congress passed and President George W. Bush signed the first major change to U.S. gun laws in more than a decade.

Mark Follman, Gavin Aronsen, and Deanna PanUpdated: May 26, 2021, 10:45 a.m. PT In July 2012, in the aftermath of the movie theater massacre in Aurora, Colorado, Mother Jones created a first-of-its-kind open-source database documenting mass shootings in the United States. Our research focused on indiscriminate rampages in public places resulting in four or more victims killed by the attacker. We exclude shootings stemming from more conventionally motivated crimes such as armed robbery or gang violence. (Or in which the perpetrators have not been identified.) Other news outlets and researchers have since published larger tallies that include a wide range of gun crimes in which four or more people have been either wounded or killed. While those larger datasets of multiple-victim shootings are useful for studying the broader problem of gun violence, our investigation provides an in-depth look at a distinct phenomenon—from the firearms used and mental health factors to the growing copycat problem. Tracking mass shootings is complex; we believe ours is the most useful approach for studying this specific phenomenon.  Since we began, our interactive map below and the downloadable database behind it have been expanded with 62 additional cases from 2013-2021. Dating back to at least 2005, the FBI and leading criminologists essentially defined a mass shooting as a single attack in a public place in which four or more victims were killed. We adopted that baseline for fatalities when we gathered data in 2012 on three decades worth of cases. (It is important to note that there have been many similar indiscriminate gun rampages in public places—but resulting in fewer fatalities—that would otherwise be included in our dataset. In that regard, ours is a conservative measure of the problem.) In January 2013, a mandate for federal investigation of mass shootings authorized by President Barack Obama lowered that baseline to three or more victims killed. Accordingly, we include attacks dating from January 2013 in which three or more victims were killed. (Any analysis of the frequency of mass shootings using our database should account for this.) Our original analysis, which covers cases from 1982-2012 with four or more victims killed, follows below. The cases we’ve documented since then using the revised federal baseline reaffirm our major analytical findings. <span data-mce-type=”bookmark” style=”display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;” class=”mce_SELRES_start”>﻿</span>&amp;amp;amp;lt;span data-mce-type=”bookmark” style=”display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;” class=”mce_SELRES_start”&amp;amp;amp;gt;﻿&amp;amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;amp;amp;gt; It is perhaps too easy to forget how many times this has happened. The gun massacre at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, in July 2012, another at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin that August, another at a manufacturer in Minneapolis that September—and then the unthinkable nightmare at a Connecticut elementary school that December—were some of the latest in an epidemic of such gun violence over the past three-plus decades. Since 1982, there have been at least 124 public mass shootings across the country, with the killings unfolding in 36 states, from Massachusetts to Hawaii. They are occurring more often: An analysis of this database by researchers at Harvard University, further corroborated by a separate study from the FBI, determined that mass shootings have tripled in frequency in recent years. We’ve gathered detailed data on nearly four decades worth of cases, including information on the attackers’ profiles, the types of weapons they used, and the number of victims they injured and killed. [Editor’s note: The following analysis covers our original dataset comprised of 62 cases from 1982-2012.] Weapons: Of the 143 guns possessed by the killers, more than three quarters were obtained legally. They included dozens of assault weapons and semi-automatic handguns with high-capacity magazines. (See charts below.) Just as a perpetrator used a .40-caliber Glock to slaughter students in Red Lake, Minnesota, in 2005, so too did the one in Aurora, along with an AR-15 assault rifle, when blasting away at his victims in a darkened movie theater. In Newtown, Connecticut, the attacker wielded a .223 Bushmaster semi-automatic assault rifle as he massacred 20 school children and six adults. The perpetrators: More than half of the cases involved school or workplace shootings (12 and 20, respectively); the other 30 cases took place in locations including shopping malls, restaurants, and religious and government buildings. Forty-four of the killers were white males. Only one was a woman. (See Goleta, Calif., in 2006.) The average age of the killers was 35, though the youngest among them was a mere 11 years old. (See Jonesboro, Ark., in 1998.) A majority were mentally troubled—and many displayed signs of mental health problems before setting out to kill. Explore the above map and database for further details—we do not consider it to be all-inclusive, but based on the criteria we used, we believe that we have produced the most comprehensive rundown available on this particular type of violence.

821172718,2012-07-27 14:30:00,Feinstein presses for assault weapons ban,https://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/Feinstein-presses-for-assault-weapons-ban-3741632.php,en,False,"politics and government,editorials,terrorism",14,SF Chronicle,http://www.sfgate.com/,"Sen. Dianne Feinstein led the effort to ban assault weapons after a mass shooting in San Francisco. In July 1993, a deranged gunman entered the office building at 101 California St. in San Francisco and moved floor to floor, shooting whomever he saw. He killed eight before taking his own life. Nearly two decades later, a similarly armed gunman entered a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., shooting 70 people, of whom 12 have died. This was the largest attack of its kind in American history. Along with the sadness and grief, Americans across the country are asking themselves: Why has so little been done to stop this seemingly endless cycle of violence? Are we helpless in the face of these horrible tragedies, doomed to witness these scenes of carnage again and again? The answer is as frustrating as the question. Over and over, commonsense measures to protect the American public have been stymied by a powerful gun lobby that has a stranglehold on many in Congress. The 101 California Street shooting helped galvanize Congress to pass the 1994 crime bill, which included a federal assault weapons ban that I was proud to have authored. But just a decade later, proponents of the ban were unsuccessful in extending it. That was deeply frustrating. Contrary to gun-lobby propaganda, the assault weapons ban worked. The 101 California Street attack involved two TEC-9 semiautomatic handguns. The Aurora shooting involved an AR-15-style semiautomatic assault rifle with a 100-round ammunition drum. The manufacture and sale of these weapons, along with the 100-round drum, would have been prohibited under the assault weapons ban. Who needs these military-style assault weapons? Who needs an ammunition feeding device capable of holding 100 rounds? These weapons are not for hunting deer - they're for hunting people. Would these massacres have been prevented if the powerful weapons used were still banned? Maybe not. But it's hard to imagine a gunman using a handgun with a maximum of 10 rounds causing the wholesale slaughter that resulted from a 100-round, semiautomatic assault rifle. We should be outraged by how easy it is for the perpetrators of these horrific crimes to purchase powerful weapons. As a nation, it's time we engage in a sane conversation about the proliferation of guns in our society. Let me be clear: If an individual wants to purchase a weapon for hunting or self-defense, I support that right. But a semiautomatic assault rifle with a 100-round ammo drum - or a handgun with a 30-round magazine like the one used to shoot former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in Arizona - has but one purpose: to kill as many people as possible in as short a time as possible. I challenge anyone who claims that prohibiting the purchase of military style assault weapons infringes on American freedoms. No sane person would argue that an individual should be free to own a nuclear weapon - we set limits and we abide by them. And we need to set limits on assault rifles. Machine guns have been banned in this country for decades. Even as it found an individual right to gun ownership in the Second Amendment, the Supreme Court made the following observation: ""Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited,"" that it is ""not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever"" and noted ""the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of 'dangerous and unusual weapons.' "" That opinion wasn't written by some wild-eyed liberal - it was written by conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. I reject the assertion that these massacres are simply a fact of life, that there is nothing we can do about them. For too long, Washington has bowed to the wishes of the gun lobby, even though numerous surveys show that substantial majorities of gun owners, among many other Americans, support a renewed assault weapons ban. California has banned the sale of assault weapons. President George W. Bush supported the assault weapons ban. Even Mitt Romney signed an assault weapons ban into law as governor of Massachusetts. To break the stranglehold of the gun lobby, people from across the political spectrum must stand up and say, ""No more."" No more will we allow these weapons of war to create carnage in our movie theaters, office buildings, schools and playgrounds. We must not allow another tragedy to occur before we get serious about fixing our nation's gun laws. The assault weapons ban meant fewer Americans were killed. That's a result that Republicans and Democrats alike should embrace. The federal ban, in effect from 1994 to 2004, worked, as these statistics show. 2/3 the amount by which use of the weapons in crimes dropped during the first nine years of the ban. 7 percent, the decrease in total gun murders in the country during the ban. 450 the number of violent crimes committed involving assault weapons since the law's 2004 expiration. 750 the number of individuals shot using these weapons (of whom 350 were killed).

Colorado Shooting Suspect James Holmes: New Details AURORA, Colo. July 20, 2012— -- Suspected Colorado movie theater gunman James Holmes purchased four guns at local shops and more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition on the Internet in the past 60 days, Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates told a news conference this evening. ""All the ammunition he possessed, he possessed legally, all the weapons he possessed, he possessed legally, all the clips he possessed, he possessed legally,"" an emotional Oates said. The chief declined to say whether the weapons were automatic or semi-automatic, but ""he could have gotten off 50 to 60 rounds, even if it was semi-automatic, within one minute,"" Oates said. Authorities have yet to identify the 10 victims who died at the theater. Two other people died at the hospital, including 24-year-old aspiring sportscaster Jessica Ghawi, for a total of 12 dead.  Thirty people remained hospitalized, 11 of them in critical condition, Oates said. Fifty eight people were injured, most of them by gunfire but a ""handful"" during the ensuing chaos, Oates said. One person was hit in an adjacent theater. As for the dead, Oates said he hoped soon to get a ""confirmed list of the 10 deceased and we will begin the agonizing process of meeting with those families and confirming what has happened to their loved ones."" Gov. John Hickenlooper opened the news conference this evening, saying, ""We are seeing this community rise up and do the things that communities do. At times lost for words, he repeatedly praised the efforts of the first responders. The shooting occurred during a sold-out midnight premiere of the new Batman movie, ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" when Holmes, 24, allegedly unloaded four weapons' full of ammunition into the unsuspecting crowd. The number of casualties makes the incident the largest mass shooting in U.S. history. An honors student and Ph.D. candidate at a nearby college with a clean arrest record, Holmes allegedly entered the movie auditorium wearing a ballistics helmet, bulletproof vest, bulletproof leggings, gas mask and gloves.  He detonated multiple smoke bombs, and then began firing at viewers in the sold-out auditorium, police said today. Holmes, who is being held in jail and will make his first court appearance Monday, is originally from Riverside, Calif., where he attended the University of California branch, Oates told the news conference this evening. ""Neighbors report that he lived alone and kept to himself,"" Oates  added. Oates also offered a warning about the veracity of online information. ""In the era of blogs,"" he said, ""and everything else, we just caution you that everything you read may not be true."" He added that two local high schools will be offering grief counseling Saturday. Bullets from the shooting spree tore through the theater and into adjoining theaters, where at least one other person was struck and injured. Ten members of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" audience were killed in the theater, while two others died later at area hospitals. Numerous patrons were in critical condition at six local hospitals, the Aurora police said this afternoon. Authorities began removing the bodies this afternoon,  according to ABC News Denver affiliate KMGH-TV. Several people have been reported missing as the coroner identifies the dead. Holmes was apprehended within minutes of the 12:39 a.m. shooting at his car behind the theater, where police found him in full riot gear and carrying three weapons, including an AR-15 assault rifle, which can hold upwards of 100 rounds, a Remington 12-gauge shotgun, and a .40 Glock handgun. A fourth handgun was found in the vehicle. Agents from the federal bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms are tracing the weapons. According to police sources, Holmes told the officers arresting him that he was ""The Joker,"" referring to the villain in the second installment of the Batman movie trilogy, ""The Dark Knight."" He also warned police that he had booby-trapped his apartment, leading officers to evacuate the Aurora apartment building. Chief Oates earlier today said that police, bomb squads and the ATF have found a large number of explosive devices and trip wires at Holmes' apartment and have not yet decided how to proceed without setting off explosions. ""The pictures we have from inside the apartment are pretty disturbing considering how elaborate the apartment is booby trapped,"" police said outside of the apartment complex today. The ""flammable and explosive"" materials could have blown up Holmes' apartment building and the ones near it, police said. The apartment complex is home exclusively to University of Colorado Medical Center students, patients and staff members, residents told ABC News. Oates this evening said police will allow residents to retrieve personal belongings but leave the booby-trapped apartment alone for now, and inspect them Saturday with the help of federal law enforcement. Residents are staying at a local high school in the meantime. Oates didn't know many people are displaced from the five apartment buildings involved. Moviegoer Christopher Ramos today recalled the real-life horror of the midnight premiere of the latest Batman movie, ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" in Aurora, Colo., as a gunman decked in riot gear set off smoke bombs and opened fire on the unsuspecting audience. ""People were running everywhere, running on top of me, like kicking me, jumping over me. And there were bodies on the ground,"" Ramos said. ""I froze up. I was scared. I honestly thought I was going to die."" ""The image in our heads is stuck in there. I still have the ticket right here and, honestly, I'm never going to forget this night at all. Because it was the first time I saw something that was real. Like a real-life nightmare that was there, not dreaming of,"" Ramos told ABC News today. Witnesses in the movie theater said they saw smoke and heard gunshots that they thought were part of the movie until they saw Holmes standing in front of the screen, after entering from an emergency exit.  Holmes methodically stalked the aisles of the theater, shooting people at random, as panicked movie-watchers in the packed auditorium tried to escape, witnesses said. At one point the shooter exited the theater only to wait outside the doors and pick off patrons as they tried to exit, witness Jennifer Seeger told ""Good Afternoon America.""  ""You just smelled smoke and you just kept hearing it, you just heard bam bam bam, non-stop. The gunman never had to reload. Shots just kept going, kept going, kept going,"" one witness told ABC News. ""I'm with coworkers and we're on the floor praying to God we don't get shot, and the gunshots continue on and on, and when the sound finally stopped, we started to get up and people were just bleeding,"" another theatergoer said. The suspected shooter will face his first court appearance next week, according to district attorney Carol Chambers. Holmes, originally of San Diego, moved to Aurora to pursue his Ph.D. at the University of Colorado medical center, living blocks from the hospital in an apartment that police say is now laced with explosives and being searched by HazMat teams. Federal law enforcement sources told ABC News that Holmes bought a ticket to the movie, slipped out of the theater once it began and propped open the emergency exit before gathering his weapons and gear and coming back into the theater. Once inside, he opened fire. A San Diego woman identifying herself as James Holmes' mother spoke briefly with ABC News this morning. She had awoken unaware of the news of the shooting and had not been contacted by authorities. She immediately expressed concern that her son might have been involved. ""You have the right person,"" she said. ""I need to call the police,"" she added. ""I need to fly out to Colorado."" The woman and her husband later released a statement saying their ""hearts go out to those who involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved. We are still trying to process this information and we appreciate that people will respect our privacy."" The highly anticipated third installment of the Batman trilogy opened to packed auditoriums across the country at midnight showings this morning, and features a villain named Bane who wears a bulletproof vest and gas mask. Trailers for the movie show explosions at public events, including a football game. Though many moviegoers dressed in costume to attend the opening-night screening, police have made no statements about any connection between the gunman's motives and the movie. Police in New York have intensified security around showings of the film throughout the five boroughs today, with Police Commissioner Ray Kelley saying that ""as a precaution against copycats and to raise the comfort levels among movie patrons in the wake of the horrendous shooting in Colorado, the New York City Police Department is providing coverage at theaters where the 'The Dark Knight Rises' is playing."" The Paris premiere of the movie has been cancelled in the wake of the shootings.  ""Warner Bros. and the filmmakers are deeply saddened to learn about this shocking incident. We extend our sincere sympathies to the families and loved ones of the victims at this tragic time,"" the movie's producers said in a statement. Witnesses watching movies in theaters next to the one where the shooting took place said bullets tore through the theater walls and they heard screaming.  ""The suspect throws tear gas in the air, and as the tear gas appears he started shooting,"" said Lamar Lane, who was watching the midnight showing of the movie with his brother. ""It was very hard to breathe. I told my brother to take cover. It took awhile. I started seeing flashes and screaming, I just saw blood and people yelling and a quick glimpse of the guy who had a gas mask on. I was pushed out. There was chaos, we started running."" One witness said she saw people dropping to the ground after the gunshots began. ""We were maybe 20 or 30 minutes into the movie and all you hear, first you smell smoke, everybody thought it was fireworks or something like that, and then you just see people dropping and the gunshots are constant,"" witness Christ Jones told ABC's  Denver affiliate KMGH. ""I heard at least 20 to 30 rounds within that minute or two."" A man who talked to a couple who was inside the theater told ABC News, ""They got up and they started to run through the emergency exit, and that when she turned around, she said all she saw was the guy slowly making his way up the stairs and just firing at people, just picking random people. ""The gunshots continued to go on and on and then after we didn't hear anything ...we finally got up and there was people bleeding, there was people obviously may have been actually dead or anything, and we just ran up out of there, there was chaos everywhere."" Witnesses and victims were taken to Gateway High School for questioning. Hundreds of police and FBI agents are involved in the investigation. A senior official who is monitoring the situation in Washington said that early guidance based on the early snapshot of this man's background indicated that this act does not appear to be linked to radical terrorism or anything related to Islamic terrorism. Dr. Comilla Sasson, at the University of Colorado Hospital where many of the victims were taken, said they were operating on nine critical patients and have treated 22 in all. She called the hospital ""an absolutely terrifying scene all night."" ""The good news is that the 3-month-old has actually been discharged home and is in the care of their parents."" In a statement, President Obama said, ""Michelle and I are shocked and saddened by the horrific and tragic shooting in Colorado. Federal and local law enforcement are still responding, and my administration will do everything that we can to support the people of Aurora in this extraordinarily difficult time. We are committed to bringing whoever was responsible to justice, ensuring the safety of our people, and caring for those who have been wounded.""

          / CBS/AP Last Updated 10:42 a.m. ET  (CBS/AP) Eyewitnesses described scenes of panic, chaos and patrons covered in blood after a gunman opened fire with assault weapons at an Aurora, Colo., multiplex shortly after midnight Friday. At least 12 people have died; Dozens more were wounded. The violence occurred at midnight screenings of the opening of the new Batman film, ""The Dark Knight Rises."" ""I went out to enjoy a movie and I ended up in a gruesome thing - I don't know how you would qualify it,"" witness William Kent told CBS News. Police said the suspect appeared at the front of the crowd in Theater 9, threw some type of gas or explosive device, and started shooting. A woman named Jennifer Seeger told CBS Station KCNC that the gunman came in, lit a gas canister and threw it into the crowd. ""At that point he shot his first fire into the ceiling to scare everybody. They started scattering - mass chaos just happened."" ""He pointed the gun at me,"" she said. ""I was terrified, so I just dove into the aisle. At that point he started shooting people behind me. I had bullets that were on my forehead, burning my forehead, and I told myself, I need to get out of here. ""I crawled on the ground and I just laid in a ball and waited for him to go up the stairs,"" Seeger said, then told her friend that they had to leave.  ""At that point, I was trying to crawl out but then everybody was crawling back in and saying, 'Don't go over there. He's going to shoot everybody trying to get out of the main doors,' and he was. All I hear is gunshot after gunshot. Just women and children are screaming."" She said the gunman was wearing a gas mask and so she could not see his face. ""I don't know exactly what kind of gun it was, it was just a big rifle . . . They were big bullets, too, and they were hot. I smelt gunfire in the air. I was just terrified. The gas was getting to me. I was having a hard time breathing."" The assailant was seized at the scene. A law enforcement source told CBS News the suspect was well-equipped, with one rifle, two handguns, a knife, bulletproof vest, ballistic helmet, gas device, gas mask and military/SWAT-style clothing. There were also unidentified explosives found in his vehicle. Security increased at theaters after Colo. shootingComplete coverage: Colo. movie theater massacre CBS News senior correspondent John Miller said on ""CBS This Morning"" that Seeger is lucky to be alive. He said, ""She said she felt bullets burning her forehead. What she's talking about is stippling, which is the gun was being fired so close in front of her that the gunpowder and burn that comes out of the barrel and where it's ejected actually was hitting her skin as the bullets went by. So the witness we just heard - that vivid description - is extraordinarily lucky, as I think she understands, to not be one of the gunshot victims and to be around talking."" Mass shooting at Batman showing in Denver suburb""Dark Knight Rises"" shooting: Suspect's home, belongings key to investigation Corbin Dates told CBS News correspondent Barry Petersen he saw a man take a phone call by the emergency exit and possibly try to signal or look for somebody during the movie's opening credits. After the movie started, the emergency exit door swung open. ""Somebody walks in dressed all in black, helmet, gas mask, black outfit, you cannot see anything but the person's eyes,"" said Dates, ""and there was a gas can that was thrown into the audience behind me. It went off. I thought it was a stunt of the movie, so I didn't think anything serious of it once it went off."" When gunshots went off, Dates and his friend dropped to the floor and started to crawl through the theater, he said. ""I felt the caps from the bullets burn my leg,"" Dates said. Another woman, Spenser Sherman, told ""CBS This Morning"" that she saw the emergency exit door open and a tear gas thrown in. ""Then it was a blur,"" she said. ""Then I heard a couple gunshots."" ""I thought it was part of the movie, like a fun little prank - that it would be over in a few seconds. It obviously wasn't.""  She said she only saw a silhouette of the suspect, and that the gunman said nothing. ""Everybody had dropped to the floor after the first couple gunshots, and then he fired some more. And then after that, there was a pause in the gunshots. Some people say he was reloading, I don't know. But at that point, my boyfriend was like 'This is the time, we need to go, we need to get out of the theater right now.' So we ran."" She and her friends got out safe. Sherman said she saw one woman with blood on her face. ""It's really mind-boggling that someone would turn an event like this into something this terrible."" ""As I walk out, I see that young girl shot, blood, everything that I would never expect to see in real life,"" Shayla Roeder, who left the multiplex, told CBS News. And I just keep looking around seeing what's my surroundings, and I see people walking out with blood on them. I'm still thinking maybe this is just, you know, maybe nothing is really going on here. And I'm walking out seeing everyone else walking out nonchalantly with blood on them. Police officers following them saying we need ambulances out. ""And then what really caught me off-guard is, there was a girl, like 24 or 25-years-old, my age. She said, 'I just need someone to talk to. One of my best friends just got shot and I don't know who to talk to right now.'"" Witnesses report bullets passed through the wall into Theater 8, where Kent was watching the movie. Initially,  Petersen reports, audiences in Theater 8 did not know that the sounds of gunfire were not part of the film. ""There was a lot going on in the soundtrack of the movie at that time. In the beginning, I don't think people realized what was happening,"" said Kent, who saw evidence of bullets passing through the walls. ""They started the fire alarm, or the emergency alarm - said that there had been something that happened in the building and they evacuated everybody. There was a huge commotion to get out of the theater,"" said Kent. ""When I exited, there were police officers with assault rifles running in."" Salina Jordan told the Denver Post she saw police carrying and dragging bodies. Donovan Tate told KCNC that he saw a girl spitting up blood. ""There were bullet holes in some people's backs, in some people's arms. There was one guy who was just stripped down to his boxers. It looked like he had been shot in the back,"" Tate said. It was the worst mass shooting in the United States since 32 people were killed on the Virginia Tech campus in 2007. In 1999, 13 people were killed in the Columbine High School massacre - about 25 miles southwest of Friday shooting. Ben Fernandez and his girlfriend were in the theater next door when alarms went off - and first thought it was a false alarm. ""The alarms went off and there was just a voice over the intercom saying, 'You have to exit the theater, there's an emergency,' and we thought it was just kind of a false alarm so we just kind of stood there trying to watch the movie still,"" Fernandez told ""CBS This Morning."" ""And then when we saw the police, you know, they weren't even really ushering people out, like calmly. They were pretty much yelling at everybody, screaming at them that they need to get out, telling people to just sprint out of the theater, and that's when we realized something bad was happening."" After going outside Fernandez said he saw several armed police officers. ""We walked to the left in front of the theater and we saw a young girl, maybe like 12, 13, just laying on the concrete. From what I saw, she had two bullet wounds in her leg and she had just blood all over her stomach. Her friends were all just yelling, crying. There were people just saying, 'My friend just got shot.' We were just all pretty much in shock,"" Fernandez said. He described people who had gathered in different crowds, some wounded.  ""We saw police officers helping out a man that was just covered in blood. We didn't know what happened to him - he was just completely out of it and covered in blood. Like i said. It was just really scary."" Then, Fernandez said, a large crowd started sprinting away from the theater.  ""We weren't sure, you know, if people were going to come out like shooting guns or what was going on. So we all just kind of took off running towards the car. It was just pretty much like panic and pretty much chaos like at first . . . I feel shaky even talking about it right now. It was just a lot of crazy, crazy stuff going on that I've never seen before in my life."" Fernandez said he did not see the shooter.  ""As we were leaving, the police were questioning everybody coming out, trying to see what was going on, if anybody saw the shooter up front."" Witnesses and people who were evacuated from apartments nearby were being taken to Gateway High School for interviews and also to reunite with friends and family. At least 24 people were being treated at Denver area hospitals. The youngest victim reported was a 3-month-old, who is reportedly doing fine at University Hospital, where nine others are in critical condition. Two people in critical condition were rushed to nearby Swedish Medical Center, spokeswoman Nicole Williams said.

Police identified the suspected gunman as 24-year-old James Eagan Holmes, a graduate student at the University of Colorado who was in the process of withdrawing from his academic program. Officers arrived at the theater in the Denver suburb of Aurora within 90 seconds of receiving the first 911 call at 12:39 a.m., and almost immediately arrested Holmes, who was next to his white Hyundai outside a rear entrance to the theater, police said. Authorities recovered two Glock pistols, a Remington 12-gauge shotgun and a Smith & Wesson AR-15 assault rifle. Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates said there was “pretty significant evidence” that the shotgun, the assault rifle and at least one of the pistols were used in the attack. He said he did not know what the “legal status” of the weapons was, a matter he said is under investigation. Federal law enforcement sources said later the gunman bought all four guns legally over the last two months from the local branches of two national chains: Gander Mountain Guns and Bass Pro Shop. Investigators believe the shooter acted alone and not as part of a terrorist group. “We are not looking for any other suspects,” Oates told reporters. “We are confident that he acted alone, but we will do a thorough investigation to make sure that is the case.” Witnesses told police the gunman fired a handgun in the air, then began shooting at adults and children in the darkened theater — many of whom initially thought his entrance was a promotional gimmick for the movie, “The Dark Knight Rises.” The gunman looked calm and said nothing as he walked up an aisle, firing as he went, witnesses said. As shrieking movie-goers realized the attack was real, they dove to the floor or scrambled to flee the Century 16 theater. “There were many, many shots fired,” Oates said at a midday news conference. “There are many critical patients, and I am not in any position to give you updates on the 59 who were injured.” The bodies of 10 victims remained at the theater more than 12 hours later, Oates said, along with numerous shell casings. Oates said police are trying their best to remove the bodies, identify them and notify next of kin as soon as possible. The gunman “was aiming anywhere,” survivor Chris Ramos told CNN. “He was not aiming for a specific person. He was aiming for everyone.” Ramos said he believes the man in the seat next to him, the father of two daughters, was killed. Oates said the assailant was dressed all in black, wearing a “ballistic helmet,” a bulletproof vest, leggings, a throat protector, a groin protector, a gas mask and protective gloves. He declined to speculate on a motive for the massacre or say whether Holmes was answering questions from police. Law enforcement sources said the shooter’s hair was died orange-red, like the Joker character in the Batman movies. When he was arrested, he was wearing all of his black gear. The Pentagon said three military personnel were injured in the shooting and that another service member at the theater remained unaccounted for. Two of the injured are members of the Air Force, while the third serves in the Navy, the Defense Department announced Friday afternoon. The unaccounted-for service member is also a sailor. The Pentagon did not identify any of the individuals or their units, or provide details of their medical condition. The department said Holmes “is not a past or current member of any branch or component of the U.S. Armed Forces.” Among those killed was Jessica Ghawi, according to her brother, Jordan Ghawi. She was an aspiring sports journalist who had recently survived another shooting at a mall in Toronto. Ghawi was the first confirmed fatality in the Colorado shootings. She had tweeted from the theater shortly before the rampage that she was excited to see the movie. Salina Jordan was in the next theater, also watching “The Dark Knight Rises,’’ when she heard a series of pops. “It was so in synch we thought it was part of the movie,’’ said Jordan, 19. “We thought it was a special effect because they were trying to do it up big for opening night.’’ Then bullets began piercing the wall of the second theater. A teenager to Jordan’s right was shot in the jaw. The fire alarm went off. In the lobby, by the concession stands, SWAT teams trained their guns at Theater 9. They directed frightened patrons to remain in place — or run for the exits — as gunfire started and stopped. Jordan said she watched a police officer carry out the inert body of a little girl, who appeared to be about 9. “She had been shot through her stomach, and the blood was just coming out,” Jordan said. “Her body was so limp. And her face, there was no life in her face.’’ Police converged on Holmes’s apartment, in a modest neighborhood about five miles from the theater, at about 2 a.m., after Holmes indicated it contained explosives . Oates initially told reporters that the apartment, No. 10, appeared to be rigged with “pretty sophisticated” explosives. But he said later, at the news conference, that bomb technicians were trying to determine whether the maze of wires and incendiary materials they found at the apartment were a hoax or posed a real danger. “Everything was linked together with all sorts of wires,” Oates said. Five buildings were evacuated. Holmes, who will have a preliminary court appearance on Monday, had no previous contact with the Aurora police department, save for a traffic summons for speeding in 2011, Oates said. A University of Colorado neuroscience faculty member, who asked for anonymity because of privacy concerns, said he taught Holmes in a class at the school’s medical campus. Holmes was “very quiet, strangely quiet in class,” and he seemed “socially off,” the faculty member said. When the staff member heard Holmes’s name in connection with the shooting, he thought that it could well be his student, and he was not surprised to find out later that it was. When Holmes and other neuroscience students took their comprehensive exams last semester, Holmes did very poorly, he said, and the school’s staff contemplated putting him on academic probation. The shooting horrified the nation and  immediately drew the attention of President Obama and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, his GOP rival in the 2012 election. Both Obama and Romney expressed condolences, canceled planned campaign events and suspended campaign advertising in Colorado. Noting that his two young daughters like to go to the movies, just like millions of other Americans, Obama said he and first lady Michelle Obama would “hug our girls tighter tonight.” The shooting is a “reminder that life is fragile,” Obama said. “Our time here is limited, and it is precious.” Jennifer Seeger, 22, was sitting in the second row of the theater when the gunman burst in. He pointed a rifle at her face. She dove into the aisle and tucked herself under a chair, and the gunman shot a person behind her. “He was literally massacring everyone who ran away,” Seeger told CNN. Police initially said 14 people were killed in the attack, which began about a half-hour into the movie. But they later revised that number to 12 — 10 of whom died at the theater. Two others were rushed to a hospital but succumbed to their wounds. Others remain hospitalized in critical condition, and police warned that the death toll could increase. Victims ranged from young children to adults, and they were taken to six different area hospitals, police said. Many were driven to hospitals in police cars, after officers decided not to wait for more ambulances to arrive. “This is not only an act of extreme violence, it is also an act of depravity,” Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (D), a former Denver mayor, said. “It is beyond the power of words to fully express our sorrow this morning.” In San Diego, a woman who was contacted by ABC News told reporters she was Holmes’s mother. She said had awoken unaware of the shooting and had not yet been contacted by authorities, but immediately expressed concern to ABC that her son may have been involved. “You have the right person,” she said. “I need to call the police.... I need to fly out to Colorado.” The apartment building where Holmes lived was affiliated with the University of Colorado-Denver’s Anschutz Medical Campus, residents said. The burgeoning campus includes a medical school, a trauma center and a children’s hospital. It is the same complex where many of victims of the mass shooting were taken for treatment. University officials said Holmes enrolled in the graduate program on the medical campus just over a year ago. A neighbor of Holmes’s said she and other residents were woken by police at 2 a.m. and told to get dressed and evacuate immediately.  The police did not explain the reason or mention the mass shooting, but asked whether residents of the small apartment building had heard any noises coming from apartment No. 10.

Description of deadly shootings In response to the shooting rampage at a midnight screening of ""Batman: The Dark Knight Rises"" in Colorado, The National Association of Theater Owners said in a statement Friday that its members are now ""working closely with local law enforcement agencies and reviewing security procedures."" Law enforcement officials in New York City said Friday they are beefing up security in response to the shootings, which left at least 12 dead. NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly said officers will be at theaters where “The Dark Knight Rises” is playing throughout the five boroughs as a precaution against copycats, and to raise the comfort levels of movie patrons. [pullquote] A rep for the LAPD told FOXNews.com that they had additional police at the city's Thursday midnight screenings, and in the wake of the Colorado shootings would be discussing additional strategy Friday morning. Hartford police Told FOXNews.com they are in communication with the local cinema regarding security measures, but at this stage no plans have been put in place, and have had no calls of concern. A rep for the Indianapolis Police Department told us that while strategies are likely being discussed, there is no immediate plan in place at this time, given that theaters are privately owned. San Antonio Police Department said at this stage the department had not been brought in on any extended security plans. The AMC theater chain, the nation's second largest with over 5,000 theaters across the country, said all of  its theaters are reviewing security procedures. ""We are terribly saddened by the random act of violence in Aurora and our thoughts are with the victims and their families. For the safety and security of our guests and associates, we are actively working with local law enforcement in communities throughout the nation and under the circumstances we are reaching out to all of our theatres to review our safety and security procedures,"" a rep said in a statement. ""Being a safe place in the community for all our guests is a top priority at AMC and we take that responsibility very seriously."" FOXNews.com talked to several ""Dark Knight Rises"" ticket holders, most of whom remained unfazed by Friday morning's mass shooting. “I actually plan on watching the film today,"" said Joey Garcia of Texas. ""It's terrible what happened but you can't cease to live your life out of fear of what may happen.” “Even though planes crash all of the time we still travel,"" said one New Yorker. ""Same example can be used across the board.  Who are we as Americans if we let one event affect the way we live!  I bought my tickets a month ago and I’m going at 6pm tonight.” “I still plan on going,"" said one 'Dark Knight' fan in Chicago. ""One mentally unstable person’s actions have no relation to the film itself. It’s horrible but has nothing to do with the movie.” “Massacres can happen anywhere and at anytime.  It’s impossible to predict,"" said Florida resident Geri Guercio weighed in. ""I’m not going to avoid public places, especially movie theaters, in fear that something could happen.” Not everyone was so sanguine. New Yorker Jamie Krauss told FOXNews.com: ""It wouldn't affect me seeing the Batman movie at some point, however I wouldn't go into any movie theater this weekend.  I'd be too nervous and looking over my shoulder the whole time."" The shooter, identified as James Holmes, 24, has been arrested. The FBI says there is no indication so far of any links to terror groups. -- Hollie McKay and Diana Falzone contributed to this report.

706365771,2012-08-06 08:00:00,Shooter's odd behavior did not go unnoticed,http://archive.jsonline.com/news/crime/shooter-wade-page-was-army-vet-white-supremacist-856cn28-165123946.html/,en,False,"biographical information,murders and attempted murders",36,Milwaukee Journal Sentinel ,http://www.jsonline.com/,"He wore his beliefs on his arm, along with his hate. He called non-whites ""dirt people,"" and sent roses to his grandmother. He talked about accomplishing positive results in society, then killed six people and tried to gun down a cop (hitting him at least eight times) who was helping the wounded. Wade Michael Page, dead himself in the wake of his mass-slaying rampage at the Sikh temple in Oak Creek Sunday, appears to have been many things - Army veteran of a special unit, fired truck driver, devoted grandson, hard-metal musician, white supremacist. But to psychiatric nurse Jennifer Dunn, the 40-year-old with the shaved head was merely the ""creepy quiet"" neighbor who moved into her Cudahy building three weeks ago, toting his belongings in two black plastic garbage bags. He rarely left his one-bedroom upper, where he lived alone. His only visitor, Dunn said, was a pizza delivery guy who stopped by a couple of times. She didn't think twice about Page's numerous tattoos - one, it turns out, was an obscure reference to white supremacist doctrine - but his manner was strange. ""He made no eye contact,"" she said. ""That's an abnormal thing. He wasn't rude, but he was not wanting to be engaged."" Late last week, Dunn said, Page's behavior became odder still. On Friday and Saturday, he blasted aggressive music from his stereo. ""He really had the tunes cranked up,"" said Dunn, who lives downstairs with her two daughters. Then, on Saturday, Page carried what appeared to be the same ""two bags full of crap"" to his red SUV parked in the alley. He also carried out a large cardboard box. ""He paced around the truck for about 10 minutes"" and then sat behind the wheel for a long time ""staring off into space,"" Dunn said. One of her daughters came inside and told her mother, ""the dude is acting strange."" A day later, with police SWAT teams surrounding their home and Page and six innocent victims shot dead in and around the temple, she'd find out how strange he was. But it didn't start that way. Sobbing Tuesday as she spoke by telephone from her home in Denver, Colo., Page's stepmother said he grew up as a ""precious child"" in a normal, loving family. ""Where he changed and where this came from, we have no idea,"" said Laura Page, who was married to Wade Michael Page's father for about two decades. The boy was 10 when the couple married. Three years later, his birth mother died, from lupus. Like any child losing a parent, ""he was devastated,"" Laura Page said. Yet, she said, her stepson was mostly happy and liked to do ""normal little boy stuff"" - play with his dog, fish, camp. He loved music and played his guitar often, she said. ""He was kind and gentle and loving,"" she said. ""He was normal in every way that I can think of."" She and Page's father moved to Texas when the boy was a teenager, but he stayed in Colorado, splitting time between an aunt and his grandmother, with whom he was very close. He rejoined his parents in Texas after graduating from high school, took a job at a convenience store and eventually joined the Army. ""He said it was one of the best things he ever did - it gave him focus, a direction,"" Laura Page said. She divorced Page's father in 2001, but talked with him after Sunday's killings. The father said he had tried calling his son about three weeks ago, but never got a call back. Page may have thought he found direction in the Army, but it appears that by then he was already pointed down the road that would lead to the mass shooting in Oak Creek. He served approximately from 1992 to 1998, and was assigned to psychological operations - the specialists who analyze, develop and distribute intelligence used for information and psychological effect. ""That is very exclusive,"" said John Liebert, a psychiatrist who performs fitness examinations for the military and is an expert on suicidal mass murderers. ""It's like going from the lobby to the 20th floor."" But Page's beliefs were starting to show. Fred Allen Lucas, a Bloomington, Ind., man who served with Page at Fort Bragg, N.C., in a psychological operations battalion, recalled that he spoke of the need for securing a homeland for white people and referred to all non-whites as ""dirt people."" ""It didn't matter if they were black, Indian, Native American, Latin - he hated them all,"" Lucas said. Lucas said he met Page in 1995, the same year that the killings of a black couple in Fayetteville by two members of the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg revealed the presence of a white-supremacist movement among soldiers on the base. At the time, Lucas said, Page was covered with tattoos, including one that made a reference to the ""14 words,"" a phrase used by white supremacists: ""We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children."" ""He criticized me for my attraction to (Latina) women,"" Lucas said. ""He'd call me a 'race-traitor.' He said I should change my ways because I was a blond-haired, blue-eyed white guy, and I shouldn't be wasting myself on that."" Page left the Army in 1998 with a general discharge, a cut below honorable. He was ineligible for re-enlistment, Oak Creek Police Chief John Edwards said Monday. By 2000, according to an interview Page gave two years ago, he was circulating in what the Southern Poverty Law Center called the white-power music scene. The center said Page was a member of two racist skinhead bands -- End Apathy and Definite Hate. End Apathy was Page's project, started in 2005. In the interview two years ago with a website, he said he launched the band ""to figure out what it would take to actually accomplish positive results in society and what is holding us back. ""A lot of what I realized at the time was that if we could figure out how to end people's apathetic ways it would be the start toward moving forward,"" Page is quoted as saying. ""Of course after that it requires discipline, strict discipline, to stay the course in our sick society."" Photos on the band's MySpace page, which was taken down Monday, show Page playing a guitar with a stars-and-bars strap, and the ""14"" tattoo prominent on his shoulder. In a picture of a band practice, a Nazi flag hangs behind the drummer. The Southern Poverty Law Center said that in 2010 Page played at a racist music festival in Baltimore called Independent Artist Uprise. For part of the last decade, Page lived in North Carolina. According to the Fayetteville Observer, he worked at a Harley-Davidson dealership as a parts coordinator, but was fired after a series of clashes - one involving his displeasure at taking orders from a female co-worker. The newspaper quoted general manager John Tew as saying that, after Page was fired, he found an application for joining the Ku Klux Klan on Page's desk. ""I threw that in the trash can,"" Tew was quoted as saying. ""He came back looking for it. And I told him I discarded that. He got all chapped again."" Page worked as a truck driver for about five years, but was dismissed from that job as well, in 2010. Last year, he lost a house, too. He had purchased a $165,000 home in the Fayetteville, N.C., area in September 2009, using a Veterans Administration loan. Last August, with the house already vacant, Wells Fargo foreclosed. The bank took over the property in February. By then, Page was in Wisconsin. He moved into a South Milwaukee apartment in late 2011, joining his girlfriend, who had been living there for about two years. Neighbors described him as a grumpy loner who occasionally pumped high-volume music through the building, worked third shift at a south side factory and disappeared on weekends, with a couple of guitars and his girlfriend in tow to play gigs with his band. ""If you were lucky, he would just say 'hi,' otherwise he would just shrug,"" said Dave Brown, who lived downstairs. ""The less I had to do with him the better."" Page stayed in South Milwaukee only for a few months, moving out in June and getting his own place in Cudahy. He appears to have lost his job around then. Neighbors near his Cudahy apartment said he didn't appear to be working. Page has had minor scuffles with the law, most notably a drunken driving conviction - he pleaded guilty - in Colorado in 1999. But while he had no police record of violence, Liebert, the psychiatrist who does examinations for the military, sees in Page's past warning signs of potential trouble. The fact that the Army essentially dropped Page after he had been selected for psychological operations team seems significant, said Liebert, who practices in Arizona and, for a time, worked at St. Francis Hospital here. ""I would want to know what happened to cause him to leave suddenly,"" he said. Liebert wonders now, given Sunday's carnage, whether Page was mentally ill, and what could possibly have been going through his mind. ""He had to know that he was going to be killed,"" Liebert said.

Warner Bros. said that Imax screenings of the film contributed $2.3 million to that total in 330 Imax locations. It is the second biggest late-night showing of all time. The total is short of the record held by ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2,"" which earned a staggering $43.5 million in midnight shows on about 3,800 screens last year, on its way to a $169.2 million opening weekend. It just surpassed the $30.2 million earned by midnight showings of ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn — Part 1"" last November on 3,251 screens. The vampire romance sequel made $138.1 million in its debut weekend. Also read: Warner Bros. Considers Cancellation of ‘Dark Knight Rises’ Screenings In May, Disney and Marvel's ""The Avengers"" took in $18.7 million from midnight shows, though at far fewer locations. The super-team film earned those numbers on 2,500 screens — with $1.3 million coming from 273 Imax screens — on its way to biggest opening weekend ever at $207.4 million. It was a day of mixed emotions for Warner Bros., which has launched one of the biggest advertising campaigns in movies history, but now must contend with the aftermath of a massacre at a Colorado showing of the superhero sequel. That mass-shooting left 12 people dead and 38 injured and has led theater chains and police departments across the country to announce that they will increase security measures at screenings of the film. As TheWrap reported, Warner Bros. is considering canceling screenings of the film. Should it proceed with its original rollout plan, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" will expand to  4,404 theaters across North America on Friday. Though marred by the tragedy unfolding in the suburb of Aurora, Colo., Christopher Nolan's final film in his franchise enjoyed a massive opening haul. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" late-night gross is also a franchise best. ""The Dark Knight"" earned $18.5 million at midnight back in 2008 and went on to a $158 million debut weekend. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" stars Christian Bale, Anne Hathaway, Tom Hardy and Michael Caine. Taking place eight years after the events of the previous film, the finale finds Batman menaced by the brutish Bane and the slinky Catwoman.

685907616,2012-08-05 02:50:00,Wisconsin Sikh temple shooting: six killed in act of 'domestic terrorism',https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/05/wisconsin-sikh-temple-domestic-terrorism,en,False,"politics and government,united states politics and government,religion and churches,terrorism",1751,Guardian US,https://www.theguardian.com/us,"A gunman shot dead six worshippers at a Sikh temple before opening fire on officers in what police described as an act of US ""domestic terrorism"".  The attack began shortly before 10.30am local time on Sunday as dozens of people were gathering at a place of worship in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. After killing a number of people inside the temple, the gunman then fired on a police officer who was helping a wounded victim outside the building. A second officer fired on the suspect, who died at the scene. The wounded officer – who was shot multiple times – was taken to hospital for surgery. He is expected to survive. At a press conference held outside the temple on Sunday, Oak Creek police chief John Edwards said the ""heroic actions"" of the two officers ""stopped this from being worse than it could have been"", noting that many people had gathered for worship at the time of the attack. Edwards said that authorities were treating the killing as a ""domestic terrorism incident"", but added that it was too early to suggest a motive. Some Sikh members of the community told the media they feared that it was a hate crime. ""We are at the beginning stages of this investigation,"" Edwards said. The FBI has taken over the criminal inquiry. It is thought that around 50 people were in the temple as the shootings took place. Prominent members of the local Sikh community were among those thought to have been injured or killed by the gunman. Jatin Der Mangat, 38, of Racine, said his uncle, the temple's president Satwant Singh Kaleka, was one of those wounded, but he didn't know how serious his injuries were. ""It was like the heart just sat down,"" he said. ""This shouldn't happen anywhere."" Sukhwindar Nagr, also of Racine, said he called his brother-in-law's phone – a senior religous figure at the temple answered and told him that his brother-in-law had been shot, along with three other people. Children hid in closets in the temple amid fears that the suspect was still on the loose, Nagr was told. CNN reported that two handguns were recovered by forensic experts at the scene. But initial fears that the gunman may have had an accomplice appear to be unfounded. There are often reports of multiple gunmen at incidents of mass shootings, because of the confusion, large number of witnesses and different perspectives. Police said sweeps of the temple and the surrounding area suggested that the shooting was the act of a lone killer. Alongside the six people the suspect shot, three people were injured and taken to a nearby hospital. They were all in critical condition. The officer who was shot by the gunman is among those being treated. ""We expect him to recover"", Edwards said. Police said the unnamed officer was ""ambushed"" by the gunman as he and a colleague responded to a 911 call alerting authorities to the scene of the shootings. Emergency teams later found the bodies of four victims inside the temple. Three more corpses lay outside the building, including that of the suspect. For hours after the initial incident, a cordon was placed around the temple amid fears that a second armed man remained at large. Ambulances and police marksman surrounded the temple. The cordon was raised when police were sure that no other peope were involved. Bradley Wentlandt, police chief of the nearby town of Greenfield, confirmed later that there was only one suspect. ""There is no evidence of additional shooters at the temple,"" he said. Despite fears that the attack may have had a racist motive, some in the Sikh community cautioned against jumping to conclusions. Sapreet Kaur, executive director of the Sikh Coalition, the largest Sikh American civil rights organisation in the US, said: ""There have been multiple hate crime shootings within the Sikh community in recent years and the natural impulse of our community is to unfortunately assume the same in this case. ""Let's let law enforcement investigate the case and as new facts emerge the dialogue can change,"" he urged. Kaur added: ""Americans died today in a senseless act of violence and Americans of all faiths should stand in unified support with their Sikh brothers and sisters."" The incident in Wisconsin comes just 16 days after 12 people were killed and nearly 60 injured in a mass shooting at a movie theatre in Aurora, Colorado, during a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises. President Barack Obama was informed of the latest atrocity shortly before 1pm ET by homeland security adviser John Brennan. In a statement, the president said he was ""deeply saddened"". He added: ""At this difficult time, the people of Oak Creek must know that the American people have them in our thoughts and prayers, and our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who were killed and wounded."" Obama's Republican challenger for the White House, Mitt Romney, expressed his condolences to those caught up in America's latest mass shooting. This article was amended on 6 August 2012 to remove a reference to 'priests' in relation to the temple."

Jump to the times listed below to listen to scanner traffic by Milwaukee County emergency responders. Click image to enlarge. The children were downstairs, in Sunday school. The women were in the kitchen nearby, cooking the weekly meal that is free to all. And the gunman was striding into the wide-open Sikh Temple, bent on killing as many people as he could. Then came the shots, ripped off, according to a weapons instructor who lives nearby, ""as fast as you can pull the trigger."" By the time the shooter was done, six people lay dead or mortally wounded in what Oak Creek police said was being treated as a domestic terrorist incident - if so, one without precedent in Wisconsin. Counting the gunman - fatally shot by an Oak Creek police officer - the death count stands at seven. ""This,"" a temple leader said later, ""is insanity."" It is also the most deadly U.S. attack on Sikhs - who often have been mistaken for Muslims and targeted in hate crimes - in recent memory. Within three hours of the mass slaying at the five-year-old temple, built on S. Howell Ave. to accommodate the Milwaukee area's growing Sikh community, a task force of federal, state and local law enforcement officers was gathering on the scene. Sunday night, team members - some wearing military gear and carrying heavy weapons - surrounded a duplex in Cudahy. The upper flat had been rented just one month ago by a single man in his 40s, the landlord, Kurt Weins, said. ""I had him checked out and he definitely checked out,"" said Weins, who refused to name the man. ""The cops told me they don't want me to say nothing right now."" An FBI official later confirmed that the police action in Cudahy, which involved numerous agencies and heavy military-style equipment, was related to the temple slayings. FBI Special Agent Theresa Carlson said officers were executing a search warrant. The agency said they had not established a motive. A law enforcement source familiar with the investigation said the shooter had been discharged from the Army. The source said one firearm was recovered at the temple as well as multiple magazines. Oak Creek Police Chief John Edwards said officers arriving on the scene ""stopped a tragedy that could have been a lot worse."" Beyond the murders, three people were injured in the rampage. They included an Oak Creek police officer who was helping a victim outside the temple when the gunman opened fire on him. A second Oak Creek officer returned fire, killing the shooter. The police officer and two other men were taken to Froedtert Hospital. All were in critical condition with gunshot wounds - one to the chest and abdomen, one to the neck, and the third to his face and extremities, a hospital spokesman said. The mass shooting occurred some time before 10:30 a.m., as members of the temple prepared for weekly worship. The first 911 calls were recorded at 10:26 a.m. The service was to begin at 11:30 a.m., but dozens of people were already on hand. The temple opens at 5:30 a.m. to anyone who wants to pray on their own, and in the three days leading up to the service, priests read continuously from a holy book. In the kitchen downstairs, women were cooking for the ""langar,"" a free, shared meal that is part of a Sikh tradition emphasizing equality and common roots. Children were at Sunday school, where they are taught about religion, culture and the language of Punjab, the part of northwestern India that is the Sikh homeland. Then shots rang out. Two children ran to the kitchen, and they and the women there - 16 people in all - made for a pantry, closed themselves in and huddled, terrified. Two priests and a few others locked themselves inside a bathroom. One used a cell phone to report that Satwant Kaleka, the temple president, had been shot twice and was lying on the floor, bleeding. Kaleka, who died, had tried to tackle the shooter, said his son, Amardeep Kaleka. Outside, another man, shot in the abdomen, staggered to a ranch house 300 yards away and pounded on the door. Jim Haase opened the door to see a gray-bearded man of 60 or 70 years old standing in a blood-soaked white tunic. ""He couldn't speak English but he was pointing at it,"" Haase said of the victim gesturing to the wound in his mid-section. A weapons instructor, Vietnam veteran and retired firefighter trained as a first responder, Haase knew what to do. He grabbed a towel and laid the man on his front lawn to apply pressure to stop the bleeding. The bullet, which made an entry hole no bigger than the diameter of a pen, appeared to go straight through the man, who remained conscious the whole time, Haase said. He called Oak Creek police, then continued to tend to the victim until an ambulance arrived. Police were at the temple within three minutes of the initial 911 call, but the very first call was so garbled that the gravity of the situation didn't come through. ""Squad, I'm taking report of a altercation, Sikh temple, 7512 S. Howell,"" the police dispatcher said. ""I have a lot of noise. I'm unable to get much info, but there's a fight . . . "" Less than a minute later, however, the dispatcher added that there had been reports of gunshots. Very shortly after that, she radioed that ""a bald male with glasses may have shot someone."" Four of the slaying victims were found inside the temple, 7512 S. Howell. Three were outside. Among them was the gunman himself. He had opened fire on an Oak Creek police officer who was helping a victim, when another officer shot him. The injured officer, who has been on the force at least 20 years, is expected to survive, Chief Edwards said at a media briefing outside the temple. He did not name the officer. Edwards said the mass shooting is being treated as an incident of domestic terrorism. But FBI representatives later backed away from that categorization, saying they were still investigating motive. Though the gunman was killed outside the temple not long after the shooting spree began, it wasn't until shortly before noon that a police SWAT team entered the building and brought uninjured people out. For Parminder Toor and the other women barricaded in the kitchen pantry, it was more than an hour of terror. Toor, 54, spoke to a reporter later Sunday at Classic Lanes, a bowling alley across Howell Avenue where uninjured temple members gathered and were interviewed by police. The women could smell oil burning in the kitchen where they had left the food cooking, and they cried as they hid from the gunman, she said through her daughter in law, Jaskiran Toor. When police came, the women were still wary. ""The police officers knocked on the door, (but) they were scared and didn't want to open it,"" Jaskiran Toor said. She said the women were led out one by one with their hands behind their head. As they walked through the temple, crying, Parminder Toor saw three bodies. Others saw them too. Kulwant Kaur had hidden in the pantry, and as she was led out, a relative said, she saw her father-in-law lying on the floor, blood coming from his head. Also in the kitchen when the shooting broke out, and taking refuge in the pantry, was the mother of Gulpreet Kaur. ""Two bullets passed by on either side of her, her friend was hit in the foot,"" said Kaur, 24. Kaur, who was allowed in to the bowling alley, said her mother was traumatized by what happened and alternately cried and talked about what she heard and saw. While the FBI was taking a cautious approach on the motivation for the shootings, the incident was being watched at the country's highest levels. White House officials said President Barack Obama was notified of the shootings shortly before 1 p.m. by John Brennan, his Homeland Security adviser, and was getting updates through the day. Members of the Sikh temple here expressed little doubt about the underpinnings of the rampage. ""It's pretty much a hate crime,"" said Ben Boparai, one of the temple's committee members. ""It's not an insider."" That would make for a different situation than the 2005 mass shooting at a service of the Living Church of God at the Sheraton hotel in Brookfield. There, a church member, Terry Ratzmann, 44, opened fire during services, killing seven people and himself. According to Ri, the Oak Creek gunman first walked up to a priest who was standing outside, shot him, then entered the temple and began firing. ""It's sad, I don't know how to describe it,"" said Ri, who has been fielding calls all morning from around the world, including India. ""Sikhism is such a peaceful religion. We have suffered for generations, in India and even here."" Baljander Khattra's thoughts also turned to the gunman as he waited at the bowling alley for word of his father. ""I don't know what that person thinks,"" Khattra said. ""...We are peaceful. The Sikh temple is open to anybody."" Earlier Sunday groups of temple members gathered outside a day care center two blocks away, using cell phones, conferring in small groups and simply watching. There were few tears, just shock and disbelief. As the sun beat down, a few small trees provided scant shade. Some older people sat in cars with the air conditioning on. By mid-afternoon the American Red Cross delivered bottled water. The day care center parking lot filled with cars of temple-goers, including several yellow taxi cabs, some parked as though they arrived in a hurry. People talked of the victims, among them Kaleka, and Parkash Singh, a priest who was killed. Temple member Manminder Sethi, a dentist who works in Brown Deer, said Singh was in his mid 30s. The priest had lived in Oak Creek for several years, Sethi said, and recently returned to India to bring his wife, daughter and son to live with him in Wisconsin. ""He was a good guy,"" said Sethi, ""a noble soul."" Satwant Kaleka's nephew, Gurmit Kaleka, said his uncle was 65 and was married with two grown sons, one of them a former Milwaukee police officer. Satwant Kaleka has been president of the church - which formerly met in a south side location - since about 1996. He has never felt threatened or unsafe in any way, Gurmit Kaleka said. Amardeep Kaleka said his father emigrated from Punjab in 1982 with a couple of hundred dollars in his pocket, and became a successful businessman owning gas stations and other properties in the area. He co-founded and helped to build the temple. ""It was like a second home to him,"" Amardeep Kaleka said. ""He was the kind of person who, if he got a call that a bulb was out at 2 a.m., he'd go over to change it."" Darshan Dhaliwal, who identified himself as a leader at the temple, said the temple had not been the subject of any threats or graffiti recently. Meanwhile, Brookfield police officers were dispatched to the Sikh Temple at 3675 N. Calhoun Road as a precaution in the aftermath of the Oak Creek shooting. At least three squads were at the temple in Waukesha County and they blocked off roads leading to the building. About 50 people were at the Brookfield temple for a morning service and many of them went outside after they learned of the shooting in Oak Creek. Gurcharan Grewal, president of the Sikh Religious Society of Wisconsin told a Journal Sentinel reporter: ""People are really shocked. There was a little bit of panic. But everything is holding together."" Also, in the shooting's wake, the Islamic Society of Milwaukee, locked down the mosque at 4707 S. 13th St. in Milwaukee with a police car guarding entrance doors. During the afternoon prayer, around 1 p.m., the mosque was only allowing in attendees they recognized. And the 128th Air Refueling Wing at Mitchell International Airport went into lockdown for a time on Sunday. No personnel were allowed in or out of the base to ensure maximum safety and security. More than 20 million people worldwide follow the Sikh religion, established about 500 years ago in the Punjab region of India. Devout male followers must wear long beards and their hair in a turban, and in America are sometimes mistaken for Muslims; the two religions are not affiliated. In the days after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, at least four acts of violence against Sikhs occurred in the Milwaukee area, said Swarnjit S. Arora, a founder of the local Sikh Religious Society. Two taxis owned by Sikh drivers were vandalized, and two Sikh men were assaulted, said Arora. The crimes were not widely reported by the news media because they were overshadowed by dramatic events across the nation, he said. About 3,000 Sikh families live in southeastern Wisconsin. A tight-knit community, they meet for religious services and to share meals at the Religious Society in Brookfield and the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin, in Oak Creek, which opened in 2007.

That's the upshot of our fall fundraising drive, and we're hoping to raise $250,000 in a shorter than normal three-week window so we can keep right on doing it. Mark Follman, Gavin Aronsen, and Deanna PanUpdated: May 26, 2021, 10:45 a.m. PT In July 2012, in the aftermath of the movie theater massacre in Aurora, Colorado, Mother Jones created a first-of-its-kind open-source database documenting mass shootings in the United States. Our research focused on indiscriminate rampages in public places resulting in four or more victims killed by the attacker. We exclude shootings stemming from more conventionally motivated crimes such as armed robbery or gang violence. (Or in which the perpetrators have not been identified.) Other news outlets and researchers have since published larger tallies that include a wide range of gun crimes in which four or more people have been either wounded or killed. While those larger datasets of multiple-victim shootings are useful for studying the broader problem of gun violence, our investigation provides an in-depth look at a distinct phenomenon—from the firearms used and mental health factors to the growing copycat problem. Tracking mass shootings is complex; we believe ours is the most useful approach for studying this specific phenomenon.  Since we began, our interactive map below and the downloadable database behind it have been expanded with 62 additional cases from 2013-2021. Dating back to at least 2005, the FBI and leading criminologists essentially defined a mass shooting as a single attack in a public place in which four or more victims were killed. We adopted that baseline for fatalities when we gathered data in 2012 on three decades worth of cases. (It is important to note that there have been many similar indiscriminate gun rampages in public places—but resulting in fewer fatalities—that would otherwise be included in our dataset. In that regard, ours is a conservative measure of the problem.) In January 2013, a mandate for federal investigation of mass shootings authorized by President Barack Obama lowered that baseline to three or more victims killed. Accordingly, we include attacks dating from January 2013 in which three or more victims were killed. (Any analysis of the frequency of mass shootings using our database should account for this.) Our original analysis, which covers cases from 1982-2012 with four or more victims killed, follows below. The cases we’ve documented since then using the revised federal baseline reaffirm our major analytical findings. <span data-mce-type=”bookmark” style=”display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;” class=”mce_SELRES_start”>﻿</span>&amp;amp;amp;lt;span data-mce-type=”bookmark” style=”display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;” class=”mce_SELRES_start”&amp;amp;amp;gt;﻿&amp;amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;amp;amp;gt; It is perhaps too easy to forget how many times this has happened. The gun massacre at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, in July 2012, another at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin that August, another at a manufacturer in Minneapolis that September—and then the unthinkable nightmare at a Connecticut elementary school that December—were some of the latest in an epidemic of such gun violence over the past three-plus decades. Since 1982, there have been at least 124 public mass shootings across the country, with the killings unfolding in 36 states, from Massachusetts to Hawaii. They are occurring more often: An analysis of this database by researchers at Harvard University, further corroborated by a separate study from the FBI, determined that mass shootings have tripled in frequency in recent years. We’ve gathered detailed data on nearly four decades worth of cases, including information on the attackers’ profiles, the types of weapons they used, and the number of victims they injured and killed. [Editor’s note: The following analysis covers our original dataset comprised of 62 cases from 1982-2012.] Weapons: Of the 143 guns possessed by the killers, more than three quarters were obtained legally. They included dozens of assault weapons and semi-automatic handguns with high-capacity magazines. (See charts below.) Just as a perpetrator used a .40-caliber Glock to slaughter students in Red Lake, Minnesota, in 2005, so too did the one in Aurora, along with an AR-15 assault rifle, when blasting away at his victims in a darkened movie theater. In Newtown, Connecticut, the attacker wielded a .223 Bushmaster semi-automatic assault rifle as he massacred 20 school children and six adults. The perpetrators: More than half of the cases involved school or workplace shootings (12 and 20, respectively); the other 30 cases took place in locations including shopping malls, restaurants, and religious and government buildings. Forty-four of the killers were white males. Only one was a woman. (See Goleta, Calif., in 2006.) The average age of the killers was 35, though the youngest among them was a mere 11 years old. (See Jonesboro, Ark., in 1998.) A majority were mentally troubled—and many displayed signs of mental health problems before setting out to kill. Explore the above map and database for further details—we do not consider it to be all-inclusive, but based on the criteria we used, we believe that we have produced the most comprehensive rundown available on this particular type of violence.

Two days after a shooting rampage killed 12 people and wounded 58 in a movie theater, President Obama flew in to praise victims and survivors. And Colorado leaders held the first large public memorial service, asking a crowd of thousands to repeat “We will remember” after each of the 12 names. Away from these rituals, new details emerged about the suspect, James Holmes, 24. Authorities said the gunman might have killed more if his assault rifle had not jammed. And he might have been mistaken for a SWAT officer by arriving police, had not one officer spotted something odd in his body armor. But these details did not answer the searching questions of the first memorial events. “Why did this senseless act of violence happen?” Aurora Mayor Steve Hogan asked, facing families of the dead and thousands of people standing behind them. “It may be impossible to arrive at an explanation that would make sense to us.” Holmes, being held without bond at the Arapahoe County jail, is scheduled to appear in court for the first time Monday. “Aurora is strong,” said one handwritten sign at a makeshift memorial marked with 12 white crosses near the Century 16 movie complex, where the gunman burst into a midnight screening of the new Batman movie, “The Dark Knight Rises.” A large banner read “Angels Walk With Those Who Grieve.” On Sunday evening, thousands of people filled a plaza in front of Aurora’s city hall for the vigil. The event blended familiar rituals of mass grief — American flags waved, and mourners laid flowers and lighted candles — with symbols of the young fan community that had gathered in the theater that night. One man held up a sign that combined the Batman bat silhouette with the “C” on Colorado’s flag. A woman paired the bat with a bright-red heart. “Hope Lives,” that sign said. Police officers watched from the rooftops. Obama went to the University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora to meet with the families of victims. Ten of the victims are still being treated in the hospital, with seven listed in critical condition. Obama said he “tried to assure them that although the perpetrator of this evil act has received a lot of attention over the last couple of days, that attention will fade away. And in the end, after he has felt the full force of our justice system, what will be remembered are the good people who were impacted by this tragedy.” Speaking at the hospital, he told a long anecdote about a 19-year-old woman who was shot in the neck and her friend, who refused to abandon her and who put pressure on the wound even as the gunman continued to fire. Such courageous young Americans, Obama said, “assure us that out of this darkness a brighter day is going to come.” Jordan Ghawi, brother of Jessica Ghawi, an aspiring sports reporter killed in the attack, tweeted Sunday: “Sat down with President Obama. He has been incredible. He too has agreed not to mention the shooter’s name.” Colorado is a swing state in the presidential election, but the candidates have pulled down their television ads. Obama chose not to attend the large memorial service later in the evening; he flew on to the West Coast. Nor has he tried to use the mass shooting to call for any new gun-control laws. White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters on Air Force One during the flight to Colorado, “The president’s view is that we can take steps to keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have them under existing law.” A law enforcement source, who is close to the investigation but not authorized to speak publicly, said something went awry in the killer’s planned assault at the theater. Police said the alleged gunman had three weapons: a Remington shotgun, a Smith & Wesson M&P assault rifle and a Glock .40-caliber handgun. The assault rifle, which is akin to an AR-15 and is a civilian version of the military’s M-16, could fire 50 to 60 rounds per minute and is designed to hold large ammunition magazines. The source said that Holmes allegedly had obtained a 100-round drum magazine that attached to the weapon but that such large magazines are notorious for jamming. The law enforcement official said authorities think the gunman first used the shotgun — some victims have buckshot wounds — and then began using the assault rifle, which jammed. Then he resorted to the handgun. Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates, interviewed on “Fox News Sunday,” did not confirm or deny that the gun jammed but said police found a 100-round magazine on the theater floor. He said he did not know whether it was empty. Holmes is accused of killing 12 people and wounding 58 in one of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history. Initial police accounts said he surrendered without incident to officers who found him at his car behind the theater complex. But Oates, in an interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday, described a more complicated scene in the minutes after the shooting. He said police arriving at the scene might have mistaken Holmes for a SWAT officer. He was allegedly dressed in black ballistic gear, including a helmet, a throat guard, a vest, leggings and gloves. Oates said a piece of equipment in Holmes’s elaborate gear — he would not specify which piece — struck one of the responding officers as irregular. The officer questioned Holmes. Oates did not describe the exchange, only the result: Holmes was arrested. Police, meanwhile, are trying to restore some sense of normalcy to the neighborhood where Holmes lived and where residents of five buildings had been evacuated after police discovered that the suspect’s apartment had been booby-trapped with dozens of explosives. After clearing the apartment of explosives Saturday, bomb squad officers on Sunday transported hazardous chemicals to a nearby field and burned or destroyed the material. Police said Holmes spent months amassing explosives, weapons and ammunition. In an appearance Sunday on “Face the Nation,” Hogan said nine of the people wounded at the theater were in critical condition. “They’re in bad shape,” Hogan said. “There are people who have had already numerous surgeries, numerous brain surgeries. There are some folks that are in bad shape.” He said authorities were analyzing the contents of Holmes’s apartment. “I’m told there was a computer inside the apartment, and with the assistance of the FBI that computer will be completely analyzed,” he said. “That may take some time. So we’re hopeful that will yield some information.” Meanwhile, details began to emerge about the failed neuroscience student who is scheduled to appear in court Monday. He tried to join a shooting range in late June. Glenn Rotkovich, owner of the Lead Valley Range in Byers, Colo., said Holmes e-mailed a request for an application to join. The application included a series of questions, including “Are you prohibited by state or federal law from possessing firearms or ammunition?” and “Have you ever been convicted of any domestic violence offense?” Holmes replied in the negative to all four such screening questions. But when Rotkovich called Holmes, he said, he got an answering machine with a “bizarre,” guttural, unintelligible recorded greeting. He told his staff that if Holmes showed up he should not be allowed to fire weapons until Rotkovich checked him out. At the memorial service, an array of speakers struggled to explain what had caused the attack. A Catholic bishop used the word “evil” six times. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) did not even want to try. “I refuse to say his name,” he said, to the loudest applause of the night. He sought to turn the attention to victims instead, reading their names and asking the crowd to remember them. At some names, family members cheered. Others brought cries of grief. The scope of the tragedy was brought home at the end of the night The crowd was supposed to sing “Amazing Grace” as families of the dead filed out. But the song ended, and the families were still walking. “Let’s do the first verse again, ‘Amazing Grace,’ ” an emcee said. The crowd sang it again, then again. Then another time, just humming and repeating “praise God” until the last of the family members had left the plaza. Heath and Achenbach reported from Washington. Sari Horwitz, Carol D.

          / CBS News (CBS News) During a visit to Aurora, Colo., Sunday, President Obama met with victims of Friday's mass shooting at a movie theater, which killed 12 people and injured 58 others. Mr. Obama, accompanied by Gov. John Hickenlooper, Aurora Mayor Steve 
Hogan and other local officials, spoke to victims and victims' families at the University of Colorado Hospital
 in Aurora, where 23 of the victims were taken in the aftermath of the 
shooting and 10 remained Sunday. ""I confessed to them that words are always inadequate,"" Mr. Obama said, following the meeting, but added that his ""main task was to serve as a representative of the entire country and we think of them at this moment and we will continue to think of them each and every day."" Peter Burns, a Denver radio host and a friend of Jessica Ghawi, who was killed in Friday's massacre, wrote about Mr. Obama's visit on Twitter.  Burns said that he heard a request that was repeated more than once: pleas for the media focus more on the victims and not on the suspect, 
James Holmes. The president promised to try to help on that front, Burns said. Jessica Ghawi's brother, Jordan, wrote on Twitter, after meeting with Mr. Obama, ""Sat down with President Obama. He has been incredible. He ... has agreed not to mention the shooter's name."" The president said after his meeting, ""I also tried to assure them that this perpetrator has received a lot
 of attention, that attention will fade away. ... In the end...
 what will be remembered are the good people who were impacted by this 
tragedy."" He said he was moved by the story of survivors Allie Young, a 19-year-old who was shot in the neck, and her best friend, Stephanie Davies, 21, who saved Young's life by keeping pressure on her wound as bullets flew. Mr. Obama said they ""represent what's best in us."" ""Because of Stephanie's timely actions - I just had a conversation with Allie downstairs and she's going to be fine,"" he said. ""I don't know how many people of any age would have the presence of mind to do what Stephanie did,"" the president said, adding, ""out of this darkness, a brighter day is going to come.""   On a lighter note, Burns added on Twitter, when one victim told Mr. Obama that he lost his 
driver's license during the shooting and was worried about being able to
 get on a plane to get home, the president quipped, ""I have a little 
pull with the TSA."" When asked how the shooting will affect the presidential campaign, Obama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, ""[T]his is so fresh and new for so many people, including the people 
in Colorado, who are still mourning the loss of their loved ones, will 
be for a long time, many people are still recovering, we're still 
learning what exactly happened here and more details -- that's where our
 focus is right now."" ""And so it's really too early to say 
how this will play.  ... we're just taking it day by day,"" Psaki said. She added that a Tuesday campaign rally in Portland, Ore., was canceled, explaining that one reason was because ""the nature of the tragedy and the 
feeling, while there's not a playbook for this, that given the tone of 
grassroots [campaign] events, it was the right step to take."" ""Clearly, the tragic events of last Thursday have changed ... the tone"" of the campaign, Psaki said and noted that the negative TV ads the campaign stopped running in Colorado on Friday would remain off the air for the 
rest of the week. Meantime, Mitt Romney's campaign told CBS News their ads in Colorado are 
down ""until further notice."" The shooting has thrust the gun control debate back into the spotlight. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney was asked if Mr. Obama feels current gun laws are sufficient to prevent shootings like Friday's. The president ""believes we need to take steps that protect Second Amendment rights of the American people but that ensure that we are not allowing weapons into the hands of individuals who should not, by existing law, obtain those weapons,"" Carney said. After putting politics aside for the past couple of days, the president stopped in Colorado en route to the west coast, where he'll resume his official schedule.  Monday, he will speak to the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Reno, Nev., where he's expected to discuss national security and the fight against terrorism - and not spend time criticizing his Republican rival. Following that speech, Mr. Obama will attend several fundraisers in California, Oregon and Washington State. Romney was off the campaign trail until Sunday, after addressing the shooting on Friday in New Hampshire. He's in California through Monday for campaign events and will address the VFW in Reno, Nev., on Tuesday before traveling to London for the Olympics opening ceremonies.  Following his trip to England, he will also make stopsin Poland and Israel. At a fundraiser in San Francisco Sunday night, the event began with a moment of silence.  Romney referenced the president's trip to Aurora saying it's ""the right thing for the President to be doing on this day. I appreciate that."" ""I will note that my remarks here today will not be as partisan as normal,"" he continued. ""We obviously have heavy hearts. It is a reminder of loss, a loss of young minds and youthful voices and souring spirits lost senselessly and thoughtlessly,"" Romney said. ""We turn to a power greater than our own to understand purpose and if not to understand at least to be able to soothe the wounds of those who have been so seriously hurt.""

A headline in Norway's largest newspaper captured the disbelief in other industrialized countries in the wake of the tragedy: ""Stricter Firearms Is a Non-Issue Even After Massacre."" We learned today that the Aurora mass shooting is as big a story around the world as it is in the U.S., but the reaction is not. A headline in Norway's largest newspaper captured the disbelief in other industrialized countries in the wake of the tragedy: ""Stricter Firearms Is a Non-Issue Even After Massacre."" That headline, shown above, appeared in Aftenpost and while the article exaggerates the lack of domestic debate in the U.S.—it claims the deaths have ""not led to any national debate on stricter gun control""—it does tap into a feeling taking root in countries with stricter gun policies: How can America continue to drag its feet on gun control? In Britain, home of some of the toughest gun laws in the world, The Guardian has been at the forefront of denouncing the American opposition to gun control. ""America has had more than its share of deadly shootings, but there is scant hope of a change to gun laws,"" reads a damning editorial. ""The difficulty is not just checks, balances and partisanship, it is a great swath of voters."" In a column, Alex Slater asks ""How many gun deaths does it take for American politicians to crack down on the availability of deadly weapons?"" Answering the question to his own disbelief, he adds ""Seemingly no number is high enough."" Meanwhile, at The Herald in Scotland, the editorial board attributes the political stagnation on Americans' belief that the ""right to bear arms"" is a ""totemic liberty."" In France, where gun laws have become even stricter following a recent killing spree that embroiled the country, observers were puzzled at the lack of response. ""Obama Can No Longer Avoid the Issue of Weapons,"" reads the headline in France's TFI News. In Japan, which forbids almost all firearm ownership and reported just two homicides involving guns in 2006, stacks upon stacks of guns were depicted in an AFPBB news story, noting that ""American gun society unchanged, even after massacre."" As we noted during the health care debates earlier this year, welcome to America, world!  "
86341623,2012-07-20 12:49:46,Gunman kills 12 in Colorado movie theater,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_latest/~3/XKpbkZ3eZUA/index.html,en,False,"motion pictures,murders and attempted murders",1095,CNN,http://www.cnn.com/,"The suspect in the mass shooting at an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater screening of the new Batman film early Friday had colored his hair red and told police he was ""the Joker,"" according to a federal law enforcement source with detailed knowledge of the investigation. At least 12 people were killed in the rampage and 58 were injured, one fewer than earlier reported. Of those injured ""nearly everyone was shot,"" Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates said Friday night, adding that a handful of people were hurt in the resulting chaos. Ten of the victims were killed inside the theater while two others died at hospitals. As of Friday evening, the 10 bodies had been removed from the complex and authorities were preparing to begin ""the agonizing process"" of notifying families, Oates said. A mug shot of suspect James E. Holmes has not been released. Witnesses to the shooting described him as wearing a gas mask that concealed much of his face and head. But the federal law enforcement source's information about the suspect's appearance fits with a statement from New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, who was briefed by Colorado authorities Friday. Oates declined to comment on Holmes' appearance other than to describe what he was wearing, and said he would not release his booking photo ""for investigative reasons."" The Joker has long been a fixture in Batman comics and was famously brought to life by the late Heath Ledger in 2008's ""The Dark Knight,"" the predecessor to Friday's release of ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Ledger won a posthumous Academy Award for his sinister portrayal of the iconic villain who encourages anarchists to take over Gotham City. Meanwhile, authorities were faced with the difficult task of entering Holmes' Aurora apartment, which was left rigged with traps. ""It's booby-trapped with various incendiary and chemical devices and trip wires,"" Oates said, adding that it could take days to work through the apartment safely. Five buildings around the apartment building were evacuated, Oates said. Residents were allowed back home briefly Friday night to retrieve such emergency items as medicine. Authorities have postponed until Saturday any attempts to enter the apartment and are bringing in resources from the federal government to help with the situation, Oates said. Shootings cast pall over 'Dark Knight Rises' blockbuster weekend Police say Holmes, 24, dressed head-to-toe in protective tactical gear, set off two devices of some kind before spraying the Century 16 theater with bullets from an AR-15 rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun and at least one of two .40-caliber handguns police recovered at the scene. Oates said the guns were purchased legally by Holmes at stores in the Denver area in the past two months. More than 6,000 rounds of ammunition were also purchased online, according to Oates. A receipt obtained by CNN shows Holmes bought some of the tactical gear, including a vest and magazine pouch, online on July 2. Oates said investigators are ""confident"" that Holmes acted alone. The shooting unfolded inside a darkened theater packed with Batman fans, some in costume for the premiere of the movie. Aurora police said how the suspect entered the theater is still under investigation. A law enforcement source working the investigation told CNN that the gunman walked into the movie theater after purchasing a ticket. After the movie was under way, he went out a rear exit door, propping it open, and gathered weapons before re-entering through the door, the source said. As he re-entered, he tossed in a canister before starting to shoot, according to a second law enforcement source involved in the investigation and several witnesses. Screaming, panicked moviegoers scrambled to escape from the black-clad gunman, who shot at random as he walked up the theater's steps, witnesses said. It was a scene ""straight out of a horror film,"" said Chris Ramos, who was inside the theater. ""He was just literally shooting everyone, like hunting season,"" Ramos said. In Aurora, the agonized seek answers through faith A federal law enforcement official told CNN the man used tear gas, but Oates said Friday afternoon that it was not clear what the substance was. Holmes surrendered without resistance within seven minutes of the first calls from panicked moviegoers reporting the shooting, Oates said. Victims flooded overwhelmed hospitals. One of the injured is just 4 months old, the child's mother said. The infant was treated and released from the hospital. ""I don't know how else to explain it. It's horrific,"" said Tracy Lauzon, director of EMS and trauma services at Aurora Medical Center. Theater shooting unfolds in real time on social media Oates said the man was wearing a ballistic helmet and protective gear for his legs, throat and groin, black gloves and a gas mask. Jennifer Seeger, who survived the attack, said she had seen the man and thought his get-up was part of the entertainment for the film's debut. She said the man first shot toward the ceiling, then began shooting at people. He reloaded during his attack, she said. ""He was just literally just massacring anybody that got up that was trying to run away,"" Seeger said. As of Friday afternoon, 30 people remained hospitalized, 11 of them in critical condition, according to Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper. Holmes is scheduled to appear in an Arapahoe County, Colorado, courtroom Monday morning, Rob McCallum, spokesman for the Colorado Judicial Department, said Friday. The court file was sealed, according to a court order. He is being held in the Arapahoe County jail, Oates said. A statement from Holmes' family in San Diego asked for ""privacy during this difficult time."" ""Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved,"" the statement said, adding, ""We are still trying to process this information."" Shooting turns movie into surreal horror: 'This is real' The FBI is assisting in the investigation, officials said, though it did not appear that the incident was related to terrorism. Prior to Friday's shooting, Holmes' criminal record in Aurora consisted only of a traffic summons. Aspiring sports reporter feared dead in shooting President Barack Obama canceled campaign events Friday, telling supporters at what had been scheduled as a rally in Fort Myers, Florida, that ""there will be other days for politics."" ""This will be a day for prayer and reflection,"" he said, calling for the country to unite as one and support the victims. Flags at the White House were lowered to half-staff Friday afternoon in honor of the victims. iReporter witness: 'We have to run' A law enforcement source said two of the guns used in the attack were purchased at a Bass Pro Shop in Denver, while the two others were bought at separate Gander Mountain Guns outlets in the area. Investigators also found a drum magazine, capable of carrying 100 rounds of ammunition, which was attached to the AR-15 rifle, two law enforcement officials said. KWGN: Witnesses first thought gunfire was part of movie A statement from Bass Pro Shops said its Denver store followed appropriate protocol on the sale of the two weapons. Authorities also searched the suspect's car in the parking lot of the movie theater and found more magazines and ammunition, a federal law enforcement official said. ""It was everywhere,"" the official said. Opinion: Gun control won't stop mass murder Christopher Nolan, director of ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" condemned the shooting as ""savage"" and ""appalling."" ""The movie theatre is my home, and the idea that someone would violate that innocent and hopeful place in such an unbearably savage way is devastating to me,"" Nolan said in a statement on behalf of the cast and crew of the film. ""Nothing any of us can say could ever adequately express our feelings for the innocent victims of this appalling crime, but our thoughts are with them and their families."" Four Aurora theaters showing ""The Dark Knight Rises"" will have extra security for the foreseeable future ""out of an abundance of caution,"" Oates said. Warner Bros., the studio behind the film, canceled the movie's Paris premiere, while New York police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said his officers would watch over screenings of ""The Dark Knight"" in the city to prevent copycat shootings. AMC Theatres, meanwhile, said it would not permit guests in costumes that make others uncomfortable, nor will it allow face-covering masks or fake weapons. 911 tape: 'I need somebody to shut this movie off' Aurora, a Denver suburb, is about 13 miles from Littleton, Colorado -- site of the April 1999 Columbine High School massacre. In that incident, two teenage students, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, armed themselves with guns and bombs and shot people inside the high school. They killed 13 and wounded 23 before killing themselves. Timeline: Worst mass shootings in U.S. Are you there? Share your story on CNN iReport and post tributes to the victims."

Smith, who was arrested after allegedly attending the latest Batman movie armed with a gun, ammunition and knives. Smith was indicted Monday on one felony count of carrying a concealed weapon, one misdemeanor count of carrying a concealed weapon and one misdemeanor count of carrying weapons ""under disability,"" charges that refer to the effects of prescription drugs Smith was taking, said Nicole DiSanto of the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor's Office in Cleveland. Smith originally faced 21 weapons-related charges. Judge rules on records in Colorado case ""I'm happy the indictment only came out with three counts,"" Scott's attorney, Matthew Bruce, said Tuesday. ""I still dispute Mr. Smith is under any kind of a disability. He has no record, certainly not of violence. He's not drug or alcohol dependent."" Police say on the night of August 4, Smith went to the Regal Theater in Westlake to see the 10:30 p.m. showing of ""The Dark Knight Rises."" According to DiSanto, Smith was the first to arrive, 30 minutes before the movie's start, and took a seat in the back row, directly in the middle, with his back to a wall. A manager at the theater and an off-duty police officer grew suspicious of where he sat, and they noticed the bag Smith was carrying. They asked to search the bag, DiSanto said, and inside found a loaded 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, two loaded magazine clips and three knives. Police said Smith was carrying another knife on his person. Smith's lawyer said he had arrived early to get the best seat in the theater. ""That's just the kind of person he is,"" said Bruce, who acknowledged that Smith was not carrying the gun legally. Smith told the off-duty officer he was carrying the gun and knives for protection, to protect himself and other moviegoers, said police, who took him into custody. A search of Smith's home turned up more weapons, including rifles, shotguns and survivalist gear, according to authorities. ""He had a fear and wanted to protect himself,"" Bruce said recently. Police Lt. Ray Arcuri said police believe Smith's position in the movie theater was ""tactical"": not only was he protected from the back, but he could have fired to his right, left and center on anyone in the theater in front of him. About 80 people attended the movie that night. In 1995, Smith enlisted in the U.S. Army but did not finish basic training, according to Army spokesman George Wright. The charges against Smith follow the mass shooting last month in Aurora, Colorado, where a gunman fired on a crowd of moviegoers watching a showing of ""The Dark Knight Rises."" The attack killed 12 people. Aurora suspect's writings offer insight Arraignment is scheduled for August 27. Bruce said Smith plans to plead not guilty to all counts."
1017412520,2012-08-07 10:22:42,Mark Kelly: Gabrielle Giffords Satisfied With Jared Lee Loughner Guilty Plea,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gabrielle-giffords-jared-lee-loughner-plea_us_5bb859fce4b0877500e83c85,en,True,"medicine and health,decisions and verdicts,crime and criminals,murders and attempted murders,sentences (criminal),mental health and disorders",623375,Huffington Post - United States,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/?country=US,"By ELLIOT SPAGAT AND BOB CHRISTIE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS TUCSON, Ariz. -- Jared Lee Loughner has pleaded guilty to going on a rampage in Tucson, Ariz., that left six dead and wounded then-Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and 12 others. Loughner's plea Tuesday allows him to avoid the death penalty in a mass shooting that gained worldwide attention in January 2011 because his intended target was the congresswoman. Among the dead were Arizona's chief federal judge and a Giffords' aide. Federal Judge Larry A. Burns had found that Loughner was mentally unfit to stand trial. He ruled on Tuesday that months of forcibly medicating him to treat his schizophrenia made him competent to understand the gravity of the charges against him and assist in his own defense. Loughner is expected to be sentenced to life in prison without parole. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below. Former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords is satisfied with Tuesday's expected plea agreement from the man accused of shooting her and many others in a deadly rampage at one of her political events, and she hopes it will allow victims of the mass shooting to move on with their lives. Jared Lee Loughner is expected to plead guilty in federal court in Tucson, Ariz., as part of an agreement that will allow him to avoid the death penalty in the shooting that left six people dead, including a federal judge, and wounded Giffords and 12 others. ""The pain and loss caused by the events of Jan. 8, 2011, are incalculable,"" Giffords said in a joint statement with her husband, Mark Kelly. ""Avoiding a trial will allow us - and we hope the whole Southern Arizona community - to continue with our recovery."" Later Tuesday, the legal team defending Loughner will have to convince a judge that he is competent enough to enter a plea. The 23-year-old college dropout is scheduled to attend a hearing during which his attorneys and prosecutors will try to persuade U.S. District Court Judge Larry A. Burns that Loughner is no longer mentally unfit for trial. Experts had concluded that Loughner suffers from schizophrenia, and officials at a federal prison have forcibly medicated him with psychotropic drugs for more than a year. A court-appointed psychiatrist is expected to testify Tuesday that he is competent to enter a plea. If Burns agrees, as legal experts expect, a formal change-of-plea hearing will follow. That's when those in the court will hear from Loughner at length for the first time, as the judge questions him about the agreement and changing his plea to guilty. Burns may ask Loughner to recite his actions in his own words, but either his lawyer or the federal prosecutor could just read the facts of the January 2011 shooting spree at a Tucson supermarket, where Giffords was holding a meet-and-greet with constituents. Either way, Loughner will be asked to acknowledge that he shot and killed six people, including the top federal judge in Arizona, and wounded 13 others, including Giffords. He'll need to convince Burns he understands what is going on, what he's doing and what he did. Loughner could break down, change his mind about pleading guilty or show so little understanding of what he's doing that Burns rejects the plea, lawyers not involved in the case said Monday. ""The fact that there is this planned change of plea is no guarantee that it will go forward,"" said Paul Charlton, a former U.S. attorney for Arizona. ""There are any number of things that would happen that would either cause it to be removed from the calendar or not go forward at all."" The plea agreement that is expected to be made public on Tuesday would see Loughner sentenced to life in prison, taking the possibility of the death penalty off the table in the federal case, a person familiar with the case told The Associated Press on Saturday. The person was not authorized to discuss the case publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. An agreement that would spare Loughner the death penalty offers something for both sides, said Quin Denvir, a California defense attorney who has worked with Loughner attorney Judy Clarke on the case against unabomber Ted Kaczynski. Prosecutors would avoid a potentially lengthy and costly trial and appeal, knowing that the defendant will be locked up for life. Clarke managed to avoid the death penalty for other high-profile clients such as Kaczynski and Eric Rudolph, who bombed abortion clinics in the late 1990s and Atlanta's Olympic park in 1996. The top prosecutor in southern Arizona's Pima County said last year that she may file state charges in the case that could carry the death penalty. An official in the prosecutor's office, Amelia Craig Cramer, declined to comment, saying the office did not have an active prosecution against Loughner. Denvir said it was possible that the plea agreement calls for the state to avoid pursuing criminal charges against Loughner, though that's not a given. ""Ideally (as a defense attorney) you'd like to have it resolved all at once, but sometimes you have to take one at a time,"" he said. The decision to spare Loughner a federal death sentence makes sense, said Dale Baich, a federal public defender in Phoenix who handles capital case appeals and isn't involved in the case. ""As time went on and there were numerous evaluations, I think everybody had a better understanding of Mr. Loughner's mental illness."" Baich said. He added: ""It appears that he will need to be treated for the rest of his life in order to remain competent."" ___ Christie reported from Phoenix.

Colorado Shooting Suspect James Holmes: New Details July 20, 2012 — -- Editor's Note: An earlier ABC News broadcast report suggested that a Jim Holmes of a Colorado Tea Party organization might be the suspect, but that report was incorrect. ABC News and Brian Ross apologize for the mistake, and for disseminating that information before it was properly vetted. A California woman who identified herself as the mother of James Holmes, the 24-year-old man federal authorities said is the suspect in a mass shooting in an Aurora, Colorado movie theater, told ABC News her son was likely the alleged culprit, saying, ""You have the right person."" The woman, contacted at her home in San Diego, spoke briefly with ABC News and immediately expressed concern her son may be involved in the shooting death of at least 12 people overnight. ""You have the right person,"" she said, apparently speaking on gut instinct. ""I need to call the police... I need to fly out to Colorado."" Holmes was apprehended by police outside the theater after allegedly killing 12 people and injuring another 50 during a late night screening of the blockbuster movie ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" authorities said. Law enforcement officials told ABC News the weapons used in the massacre include a military-style AR-15 assault rifle, a shotgun and two handguns. Local news reports showed aerial video of police cautiously searching Holmes' apartment, some five miles from the Century Aurora 16 theater, as the suspect reportedly told police he had explosives inside. At a morning briefing, local police said that the apartment appeared to be booby-trapped. A thousand miles away in San Diego, several police cars have arrived at the home of Holmes' mother.  James Holmes was a student at the University of Colorado Denver Medical Campus but had dropped out in June, according to a school official. He attended high school in California, a police spokesperson there said. The police spokesperson provided a statement from the Holmes family in which they said their ""hearts go out to those who [were] involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved."" The spokesperson said the family was ""very upset"" and the incident ""has taken everyone by surprise."" Witnesses to the shooting said that a man appeared at the front of the theater about 20 minutes into the movie with a rifle, handgun and gas mask. He then threw a canister that released some kind of gas, after which a hissing sound ensued, and he then opened fire on the crowd packed into the early-morning screening of the film. ""We were maybe 20 or 30 minutes into the movie and all you hear, first you smell smoke, everybody thought it was fireworks or something like that, and then you just see people dropping and the gunshots are constant,"" witness Christ Jones told ABC's Denver affiliate KMGH. ""I heard at least 20 to 30 rounds within that minute or two."" A man who talked to a couple who was inside the theater told ABC News, ""They got up and they started to run through the emergency exit, and that when she turned around, she said all she saw was the guy slowly making his way up the stairs and just firing at people, just picking random people."" ""The gunshot continued to go on and on and then after we didn't hear anything,"" the couple told the man. ""We finally got up and there was people bleeding, there was people obviously may have been actually dead or anything, and we just ran up out of there, there was chaos everywhere."" The FBI said approximately 100 of its agents are on the scene assisting with the ongoing investigation.

          / CBS News (CBS News) Below is a rush transcript of ""Face the Nation"" on July 22, 2012, hosted by CBS News Bob Schieffer. Guests include: Aurora Police Chief Daniel Oates, Aurora Mayor Steve Hogan, Colorado Rep. Ed Perlmutter and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also joined the program. A roundtable discussing the latest on the Colorado shooting includes CBS News correspondents John Miller, Bob Orr, Norah O'Donnell and John Dickerson. BOB SCHIEFFER: Today on FACE THE NATION, we'll talk to Aurora police chief, Daniel Oates, in his first interview since the killings in Colorado and the discovery of the suspect's booby-trapped apartment. DANIEL OATES (Aurora Police Chief): Make no mistake, okay, this apartment was designed and to kill whoever entered it. Who was most likely to enter that location after he planned and executed this horrific crime? It was going to be a police officer, and if you think we are angry, we sure as hell are angry. BOB SCHIEFFER: Chief Oates will be with us this morning as we continue to report on the largest mass shooting in U.S. history, a crime that has so far left twelve dead and seventy wounded. Even after the arrest of James Holmes, questions remain--how and for what reason could all this have happened? We'll also talk to Aurora Congressman, Ed Perlmutter; Aurora mayor, Steve Hogan; and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg who says the presidential candidates must stop avoiding the subject of guns. MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: Where are they now and why don't they stand up and if they want our votes, they better? BOB SCHIEFFER: We'll also bring in the CBS team covering this story, correspondents Barry Petersen, John Miller, and Bob Orr. In London reports this morning that Israeli security forces are searching for an Iranian terror squad planning an attack on Israeli Olympic athletes. We'll get the latest on that from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Plus, analysis on all of the above from our own Norah O'Donnell and John Dickerson because this is FACE THE NATION. ANNOUNCER: And now from CBS News in Washington, FACE THE NATION with Bob Schieffer. BOB SCHIEFFER: And good morning, again, on a sad morning and welcome to our broadcast. Here's the latest from Aurora, Colorado. This morning of the seventy people who were shot, twenty-six are still hospitalized, eleven of whom are still in critical condition. James Holmes is in solitary confinement, will be arraigned tomorrow. President Obama goes to Colorado later today. The lead investigator Aurora Police Chief Daniel Oates is joining us this morning for his first interview since all of this happened. Chief, thank you very much for taking the time to be with us. Can you first clear up this story that originated overnight that investigators were looking for some so-called person of interest. What was that all about? DANIEL OATES: Sure. I'm not quite sure what the term person of interest means. We're interested in anyone who knew or had contact with the suspect, and this was a person who had contact with the suspect, a casual acquaintance. We found him yesterday. We interviewed him. The relationship was really inconsequential. And we're happy that we spoke to him but that's all that was. And as a responsible part of this investigation, we would be doing that with any of his acquaintances. So it's really an inconsequential matter. BOB SCHIEFFER: As far as you know at this time, this involves only one person? DANIEL OATES: All the evidence we have, every single indicator is that this was-- this is all Mister Holmes's activity and that he wasn't particularly aided by anyone else. BOB SCHIEFFER: Bring us up to date on the very latest in this investigation. DANIEL OATES: Well, you know there is so much-- it is so complex. We're-- we're focusing on how he got the materials that he got that were used in this shooting, that were used in the-- in the apartment. We're focusing on anyone who knew him and statements he may have made. We're building a case to show that this was a deliberative process by a very intelligent man who-- who wanted to do this. So it will take-- it will take quite a bit of time. I-- there are so many loose ends and we've been so busy dealing with the families and the aftermath of this and the apartment, and the dangers of the apartment, that I haven't even been briefed by my investigators on probably ninety percent of what they know. That kind of work will take place in the next couple of days. I'll be more up to speed but we're doing everything good. BOB SCHIEFFER: Oh, go ahead. But I just wanted to say, can you tell us-- we have a report-- CBS News has learned that you may have recovered a Batman poster or something to that effect in his effects. Is that true? DANIEL OATES: I don't know anything about that. I have not been briefed on what's inside the apartment. The-- the major concern in the apartment was-- was the weaponry or the explosives and all that material. That was all taken by the FBI yesterday and they're going to do all the forensics on that. And I have not yet been briefed on-- on what else we took out of the apartment. And-- and we wouldn't share that with the media at this time, anyway, whatever we took out of there. BOB SCHIEFFER: All right. I want to bring-- Chief, I want to bring into this now our senior correspondent John Miller in New York. John. JOHN MILLER (CBS News Senior Correspondent): Thanks. Chief, one of the things we've been looking at is that apartment yesterday. That was an extraordinarily unusual crime scene with extraordinary hazards. Talking to the technical people yesterday, they said this was a very complex chemical reaction device where a trip wire would be set off by opening the door, one chemical would pour into another, they would react and cause this conflagration. What does that tell you about the level of sophistication of this suspect and his intent? DANIEL OATES: I think it's a-- I thinks it speaks volumes about his-- his-- his intelligence and his deliberation, and his cold-bloodedness. I-- I could not believe the pictures I saw from the robot about-- about the way this thing was designed. And there was a second triggering mechanism, too. So, if-- if somehow that was defeated, there was another electronic mechanism of some sort that also would have set the whole thing off. JOHN MILLER: So, one critical question-- DANIEL OATES: I had never seen-- I had never seen anything like it. JOHN MILLER: One critical question there, Chief, we are told he advised police, if you go to the apartment you are going to find explosives. Did he tell you and your officers that it was a trap or was it something you were meant to walk into after talking to him? DANIEL OATES: Well, I'm not going to discuss his admissions, but I will tell you that we were aware of the possibility when we arrived. I--I-- I'm simply not in a place to say in any form what he told us. JOHN MILLER: Now you haven't had time to be briefed on a lot of detail aspects of the investigations but you did have a chance to talk to the officer who actually arrested him. I imagine that officer in confronting him seeing a guy in heavy body armor with a ballistic helmet and an AR-15, probably first assumed he was a S.W.A.T. officer. How did that arrest go down? What did he say? DANIEL OATES: Without going into too many details it was one aspect of what he was wearing that did not fit what a S.W.A.T. officer might be wearing. There was one particular piece of equipment that he had on him that was out of place. And I am so proud of my officers that they spotted that right away and challenged him. I can't tell you. In that chaos, it is quite reasonable that an officer might have confused him for another-- for a S.W.A.T. officer, a heavily armed officer who was responding to the scene. So kudos to my two cops who grabbed this guy and that they-- and that sharp observation that they made immediately that led them to suspect him as being the suspect. BOB SCHIEFFER: Chief, it's Bob Schieffer again. You don't-- can you tell us what that piece of the equipment was or would you-- DANIEL OATES: No, I prefer to-- I'd rather not. I prefer to leave that for the evidence at trial. BOB SCHIEFFER: Let me ask you this: you say you can't really talk in detail about what was in the-- in the apartment. But did you run across anything in there--notebooks, computer, things of that nature that would give us some insight into the working of the mind of this person? DANIEL OATES: I'm told there was a computer inside the apartment and with the assistance of the FBI, that computer will be completely analyzed. That may take some time. So we're hopeful that that will yield some information. BOB SCHIEFFER: John? JOHN MILLER: Chief, if I can ask that question a different way. What we see is a lot of activity and may going into June. He drops out of a PhD program. He starts ordering massive amounts of weapons, tactical gear, ammunition. Other things are changing, he's planning. Has there been any sign of what was occurring in his life at that time that seemed to be the stressor that pushed him toward this plot? DANIEL OATES: I've heard one morsel of information about a relationship that may or may not be true. And-- and that's why we have the-- all our investigators working on this. That's why we brought in the FBI behavioral analysts. They're going to figure all that stuff out, and there will be no easy or quick answers. And maybe there will never be any answers. This-- this requires a lot of work and we're just not in a position to give any indications of that now. And, again, whatever we do develop, the proper place to make sure we get proper justice for the victims is to reveal that stuff in the course of the criminal prosecution. BOB SCHIEFFER: Chief-- JOHN MILLER (overlapping): Chief, the President is coming later today. He's going to meet with you. He's going to meet with the victims. Of course, it's also a political season. Do you feel there is a utility to that, and do you think it's going to help? DANIEL OATES: I can't tell you how important this visit is. I spent ninety minutes with the families on Friday afternoon, and this was during the period where the ten deceased-- the bodies were still in the theater and they were so desperate for confirmation, and I couldn't give it to them. And they were hurting so much. And we were so pleased to be able to tell them through our victim advocates contacting the families yesterday, that the President was coming here, and they-- these families need that kind of contact by our elected leader, and it will be very powerful, and it will help them. As-- as awful as what they've been through and what they are going through has been, having the President here is very, very powerful. It means a great deal to them and I think all of Aurora. JOHN MILLER: Dan, let me for a moment drop the veneer of objectivity. We're friends. I've known you a long time. Your daughter went to the Batman premiere that night. Thank God at another theater. But you've got a family to support during a crisis in your town. You've got police officers who have seen things that most people don't see unless they are in Iraq and Afghanistan and will need to recover from that while they are working and you have a community that looks to you for protection and to tell them everything is going to be all right and where this goes next. I have to ask, how are you doing? DANIEL OATES: I'm doing fine. I can't tell you how proud I am of everybody in this department and what they've done. And this touches all of us. I-- I know any number of friends whose children were at a Batman premiere that night. Young kids were very excited to see the movie. And I mentioned that my daughter was at one of the other theaters in Aurora and there is probably about five-- five friends of mine had the same reaction, the same experience. And it could have happened to any of us. And-- and, unfortunately, the way America is today, could have happened to any parent anywhere in the country. And that's-- that's the perverse thing about this and-- and something we as a nation have to deal with. JOHN MILLER: Chief Daniel Oates, thank you for joining us this morning. Bob. BOB SCHIEFFER: And thank you, John. John will be back later in the broadcast to talk some more about this. Chief Oates, may I also take this opportunity to say thank you and to congratulate you on the very professional way that your department is handling this situation that nobody wants to be confronted with. We-- we all appreciate it and we thank you. DANIEL OATES: Thank you. BOB SCHIEFFER: I want to turn now to Bob Orr, our Justice Department correspondent. Bob, you just heard the Chief. You've been checking with federal sources. What do you have to add? BOB ORR (CBS News Justice Correspondent): Bob, first of all, the Chief was modest. I don't think he really gave us all the details of what the great work that's been done on the ground has produced. The police there along with the federal partners have amassed a substantial case of evidence already. That this was a premeditated act of murder and the planning goes back about four months. They've recovered things like shipping labels from a dumpster in front of Holmes's apartment. They've got credit card records. They know he shopped at internet sites like BulkAmmo.com, TacticalGear.com. They have a surveillance tape of Holmes allegedly picking up a hundred and sixty pounds of ammunition at a FedEx counter in Colorado. And they also have talked to a UPS driver that says, ""Oh, I remember this guy. He had ninety packages delivered to him in his work address."" So all of this evidence and the fact that they found him with four guns, they know where the guns came from-- they have built a substantial criminal case, and whether he cooperates or not is immaterial. They have got this thing nailed cold. They're still trying to find motive. That's the big thing. BOB SCHIEFFER: And, Bob, we'll be back later as well as we continue on this. Bob Orr, thank you very much. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is at CBS News headquarters in New York. Mister Mayor, thank you. Both the President and Governor Romney have expressed sympathy to the people in Colorado this morning. What else would you like to hear from them? MICHAEL BLOOMBERG (New York City Mayor): Well, expressing sympathy is-- is nice and it's a horrible tragedy and I know everybody in this country, everybody around the world, their hearts and prayers go out to the families, but somebody's got to do something about this and this requires--and particularly in a presidential year--the candidates for President of the United States to stand up and once and for all say, yes, they feel terrible. Yes, it's a tragedy. Yes, we have great sympathy for the families but it's time for this country to do something. And that's the job of the President of the United States. And I don't know what they're going to do. But I think it's incumbent on them to tell us specifically, not just in broad terms. You know, Governor Romney, when he was governor of Massachusetts, actually passed a ban on assault weapons. And President Obama, when he came into office in 2008, said he would reinstitute the ban, the federal ban on assault weapons, and the governor has, apparently, changed his views, and the President has spent the last three years trying to avoid the issue or if he's facing it. I don't know anybody that's seen him face it. And it's time for both of them to be called-- held accountable. You know we spend all our time talking about tax returns and gaffes and things like that. This is one of those issues, along with a handful of others that really matter to the American public. It matters to the future of our country. It matters to you and me and to our children and grandchildren. And it's time, I think, that we hold them accountable, and say, ""Okay, you want our votes, what are you going to do?"" BOB SCHIEFFER: Well, why do you think they have not said anything? Is this because of the power of the National Rifle Association and its lobby? Is-- is that why we're not hearing from them in your view? MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: Well, you know, they have to explain themselves as to why, and I shouldn't be putting words in their mouths. I don't know what their motives are. The NRA is an organization that is adamant about no controls on weapons in spite of the fact that we have federal laws that say you cannot sell guns to minors, to people with psychiatric problems, or drug problems or convicted felons. And yet they pressure Congress and the White House--and they've been doing it for decades--to not fund enforcement of those laws. We don't need more laws. We need a couple of fixes. There's a loophole where you can sell guns without a background check at a gun show, forty percent of guns are sold that way, same thing on the internet. We need to fix the fact that states are supposed to send records into the central database of who has psychiatric problems and who is convicted because when somebody sells a gun, they've got to check the database, and if there's no data in it, it wouldn't do any good. The NRA has opposed anything. And if you do a survey it's interesting eighty percent of the NRA members say, for example, that the federal laws on guns should be enforced and that we should stop all this closing our eyes and-- and letting people go and buy guns, you know, there are-- there are guns that are advertised on the internet--.50-caliber rifle, and it says, ""able to bring down a commercial jetliner at a mile and a half"" or ""armor-piercing bullets."" Last time I saw a deer wearing a bulletproof vest was a long time ago. And the bottom line is, weapons that are sold, advertised as high-capacity and very powerful aren't weapons that are to be used in hunting and they certainly aren't weapons to be used to defend yourself. You know, the Supreme Court said, excuse me, that, yes, we have the Second Amendment, you have a right to bear guns. But reasonable restrictions are constitutional. And I think the Congress passed reasonable restrictions. But to not enforce them is just ridiculous and you've got to ask the candidates why they are unwilling to do so. Leadership is-- is leading from the front, not doing a survey, finding out what the people want and then doing it. What do they stand for and why aren't they standing up? BOB SCHIEFFER: Well, let me just point out as surveys go, clearly, the public mood on this has changed. In 1990 polls suggested that eight people in ten wanted stricter gun laws. But a majority wanted now, in 2010, a majority favored no change in the law or-- or laws that were less strict. And it's still today, even after the Gabby Giffords' shooting, the country seems pretty much now just evenly split about whether there's a connection to stricter gun laws and-- and-- but, clearly, people seem to have changed their mind. They don't seem to see the connection now. MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: Well, number one, I think it's our job, me as a mayor, you as one of the great presenters in this country of the news, to explain to people the connection between gun laws and the safety of themselves and their children and the safety of the police officers around this country who put themselves, their lives on the line for us. But I think, also, a little bit of this is how you phrase the question. The bottom line is most people do understand, and when we-- the polls that my organization has done, we have an organization of over seven hundred mayors, Republicans and Democrats and independents; rural areas, urban areas; north, south, east, west; and they understand the reason mayors are in this organization is we're the ones that get the call in the middle of the night that a police officer has been shot. We're the ones that have to go to the hospital. I can tell you, I've been in office now ten and a half years, and the only thing that I do that is really, really tough is to look somebody in the eye, a mother, a father, a sister, a brother, a husband, a wife, and, say, or a child, and say, ""Your loved one's not coming home. I'm sorry"". BOB SCHIEFFER: You know-- MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: And I think if people had to do that, if-- if-- if the Congress had to do that rather than just look at the numbers and pander to the television, they might view this a little bit differently. BOB SCHIEFFER: Mister Mayor, it's always a pleasure to talk to you. Thank you so much. MICHAEL BLOOMBER: Bob, thank you. This really is an enormous problem for the country; and it's up to these two presidential candidates. They want to lead this country and they've said things before that they are in favor of banning things like assault weapons. Where are they now and why don't they stand up and if they want our votes, they better. BOB SCHIEFFER: Thank you, Sir. We'll be back in one minute with Ed Perl-- Perlmutter, the Congressman who represents Aurora, Colorado. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) BOB SCHIEFFER: Congressman Ed Perlmutter represents Colorado's seventh district which includes Aurora. He is there this morning. Congressman, thank you for joining us. You've been talking to your constituents almost nonstop since this happened. What do they want you to do? What do they think ought to be done now? REPRESENTATIVE ED PERLMUTTER (D-Colorado): Well, I'll tell you a story of a young lady in pizza restaurant, in the mall right behind us, and I said, ""If I had to share something on TV tomorrow, what would it be?"" And she said to tell people to think about the folks who have been hurt in all of this and our community that's been hurt in all of this, and to get their sympathy and their prayers and thoughts because this is a great community. I'm not kidding about that. It hurts now. And young lady there knew two people who were shot in this thing. So it touches all of us. BOB SCHIEFFER: Well, I hope you will pass-- REPRESENTATIVE ED PERLMUTTER: So that's what she wanted to say. BOB SCHIEFFER: I hope you will pass on that-- they-- you certainly have the sympathy of all of us here and I think it's fair to say people across the country. What about the gun laws? Are people out there saying-- REPRESENTATIVE ED PERLMUTTER: Okay. BOB SCHIEFFER: --it's time to tighten them up now or leave them like they are? What-- what's the sense now? REPRESENTATIVE ED PERLMUTTER: Well, that conversation really isn't taking place, although I can tell you I pulled out of my driveway yesterday and a lady was walking her dog, and she said, ""This has gone too far. We have got to do something."" And so, you know, the mayor is saying this is all on the President's back or the presidential Candidates' back, Romney and President Obama. I think this is really a Congressional issue that has to be dealt with. You know, should we reinstate the assault weapons ban? I think we should; and I think that's where it starts. We ought to be taking a look at how this guy was able to accumulate so much ammunition. He had enough ammunition for, like, a small army. I mean, this is-- there's something wrong about that. So to that point, the-- the mayor is correct. But I think he's putting his finger on the wrong spot. This is a congressional issue. BOB SCHIEFFER: And can we expect that you'll be talking about this a lot in the coming congressional session when Congress comes back? REPRESENTATIVE ED PERLMUTTER: I don't think you-- we can avoid it. Carolyn McCarthy from New York, you know, has been a big ad-- big advocate-- BOB SCHIEFFER: All right. REPRESENTATIVE ED PERLMUTTER: --in this arena and I'm going to be with her. BOB SCHIEFFER: All right. Congressman, thank you so much. We're out of time. I appreciate you being with us. Back in a second. REPRESENTATIVE ED PERLMUTTER: Thank you. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) BOB SCHIEFFER: When Thomas Paine wrote the essay, Common Sense, it rallied the American colonists to take on the greatest power in the world and what resulted was the United States of America. Maybe what we need these days in an-- is an essay called, Lack of Common Sense. How else can we account for the current state of affairs? Of course, there are legitimate reasons for people to own guns for both sport and protection. But doesn't common sense tell us we must keep guns away from people like the Colorado shooter? Don't we all agree on that? Finding a solution to fix that won't be easy, but if that is our goal, shouldn't that be where we start the discussion? Where's the common sense in not starting there? This is not about ideology. It is about the safety of innocent people and going to the movies without fear of being killed. It's like so many issues these days. The one thing gone missing from the argument is common sense. Why? Because we've allowed the lobbyists and the partisans and the ideologues--and, yes, the people who make money out of politics--to take control of the argument and shift it from common sense to endless, hair-splitting, meaningless rhetoric and ideological talking points designed to avoid blame and fatten campaign war chests. Common sense doesn't really fit when the goal is not what's good for us but what's good for my side. We remember Thomas Paine saying in another essay, ""These are the times that try men's souls."" But maybe we've forgotten what it took for the courageous people of his time to do what they did. Here's a clue--it wasn't a fear of getting beat in the next election. Back in a minute. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) BOB SCHIEFFER: Some of our stations are leaving us now. For most of you, we will back with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) BOB SCHIEFFER: And we're back now on FACE THE NATION with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Prime minister, thank you for joining us. As Americans have been shocked by this tragedy in Colorado, Israel has been burying the dead from the attack last week on innocent Israeli tourists in Bulgaria. It goes without saying, of course, that our sympathy goes out to you and the people of Israel. But before I get to that, let me ask you about a report in London newspapers this morning that as we near the fortieth anniversary of the attack on Israeli athletes in Munich, that Israeli agents have launched a massive search after reports that an Iranian terror squad is now plotting to kill Israeli athletes at the London Olympics. What can you tell us about that, Sir? BENJAMIN NETANYAHU (Israeli Prime Minister): Well, first, I can say that we sympathize--that's not even the word--we deeply empathize with the American people over this tragic massacre in Colorado. You know, you're right, we experience these blood-lettings of innocents periodically, and we know that each time the American people stand with us, so we stand with you. And we-- we-- we say that with great profundity. We feel that grief that sweeps across the American people. You asked about the London Olympics. Look, we've been witnessing over the last two years, an Iranian-sponsored global campaign, along with its sidekick, Hezbollah, to launch terror attacks against Israelis, and coincidently not only Israelis, they tried to murder the Saudi ambassador in Washington and they were willing to take several senators with him. That was a real possibility. So they've covered about twenty-four countries in five continents, including the attacks in Bulgaria and attack in Cyprus a few days before. They are-- we are vigilant about the possibility that they would attack elsewhere but I can't give specific detail. BOB SCHIEFFER: Well, let me then-- BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: And we do give specific details to whoever-- to whoever we need to do and responsible governments and agencies. BOB SCHIEFFER: So you are-- your other-- other agencies as well as the Israelis are looking for these people and-- and investigating this plot, the one-- BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: No, I'm not-- I'm not confirming any information that we have. BOB SCHIEFFER: All right. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: On the Olympics we know that Iran and Hezbollah have been carrying out attacks. Most of them failed because of intelligence successes that we and some other services have had. Some of them, unfortunately, succeeded, as the tragedy in-- in Bulgaria shows. But we-- we are always vigilant. I can't give you any substantiation-- BOB SCHIEFFER: All right. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: --or any attack on the Olympics. BOB SCHIEFFER: Well let-- let's talk about this attack in Bulgaria last week. How sure are you that Iran is behind this? BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: Well, Iran and Hezbollah have been carrying out these attacks in just all these countries, in Kenya, in Cyprus before that, in Thailand, in India, many, many countries in many-- many continents. Now, a week before everybody can see what I'm just about to say because this is public. A week before in Cyprus, a Hezbollah operative that was captured, he was arrested and he admitted that his task was to get at Israeli passengers, prepare the attack of Israeli passengers that get off a plane and then they would be targeted with a terrorist attack, exact same pattern. So you'd think, I mean you'd surmise intelligently, that if Hezbollah backed by Iran did this in Cyprus a week earlier, that the same modus operandi repeats itself in Bulgaria. That would be an intelligence surmised for those who see only that. But the prime minister of Israel sees more than that. And I give you a clear statement. We have unquestionable, fully substantiated intelligence that this was done by Hezbollah backed by Iran. BOB SCHIEFFER: You have said that you will act against Iranian terror with great force. Exactly what do you mean, Sir? BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: What I mean by that is that we will do whatever is necessary to protect, to defend the lives of innocent Israelis, and we'll take those measures as necessary. The reason regimes and organizations use terror tactics is to avoid the consequences and the first act in fighting terrorism is to name and shame the terrorist nations and the terrorist organizations. BOB SCHIEFFER: Well-- BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: That's what I'm doing now in your program. It's-- BOB SCHIEFFER: Well-- BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: --Iran with Hezbollah. And the second thing is to exact a price because the only way you stop terror after you've exposed it is to make sure that terror doesn't pay. BOB SCHIEFFER: Would you go so far as to actually attack Iran? BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: Well, I-- I'm not going to get into the specifics of what we will do and not do but I think the most important first step is to expose Iran's culpability. And I think this is not nearly an Israeli issue. Yes, they've targeted Israelis, although they targeted and killed, actually, nationals of other countries. Hezbollah and Iran together have claimed the lives of others as well. And the attack, the systematic attack in dozens of countries, in five continents is allowing terror to sweep over the-- the globe. And, you know, if you don't stop it, it gets worse and worse and worse. And I think it's important for the entire international community to stop this wave of terror, but also to consider what would be the consequences of these people who murder diplomats, who roll over embassies, who send terrorist suicide bombers into buses. Just imagine what the consequence would be if these people and if this regime got a hold of nuclear weapons. I think the most important message that I could give is stop-- expose the terrorists, stop the terrorists, and make sure that the world's most dangerous regime doesn't get the world's most dangerous weapons. BOB SCHIEFFER: Let me shift to-- to something else. The Republican candidate for President, Mitt Romney is going to be visiting you this week during his trip to Israel. What do you-- what will you be saying to him? BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: Oh, pretty much the same things I've said to the presumptive Democratic candidate, Senator Barack Obama, when I greeted him four years ago--roughly the same time--in the campaign. I'll tell him about Israel's desire for peace and also about Israel's concern with the-- the arming of Iran with nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, it's still with us four years later. And, also, the-- the threat to peace and the threat to-- to Israel and to others by the growing arsenal of the terrorists with the Iranian backers. BOB SCHIEFFER: Would you be as comfortable with Mitt Romney as President of the United States as you are with Barack Obama? BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: Oh, God, I'm-- I'm just not going to go that way, Bob. BOB SCHIEFFER: All right. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: You're far too experienced a reporter to try to think that I am less of experience-- experienced public figure, and we're both experienced and we're not going to go that way. BOB SCHIEFFER: All right. Well Mister Prime Minister-- BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: I have enough politics here. BOB SCHIEFFER: You know-- you know that you have to ask these questions. And you've been around long enough to know that. Thank you very much for joining us this morning. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: You can try it's-- BOB SCHIEFFER: All right. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: Thank you, Bob. BOB SCHIEFFER: Thank you, Sir. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: Good to be with you. BOB SCHIEFFER: Thank you. We'll be back in a minute. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) BOB SCHIEFFER: Back now with more from our CBS News team covering the story out in Aurora. Our lead correspondent on this story, Barry Petersen; plus, our Justice Department correspondent, Bob Orr; and our own Norah O'Donnell and John Dickerson. But, let's start back in New York with CBS senior correspondent John Miller. And I want to start with you, John, because before we get to Aurora, I know you had been doing some work on these Iranian terror squads that we heard Prime Minister Netanyahu talk about. Bring us up to speed on what that's all about. JOHN MILLER: You know, this week we were looking at those attacks. We examined the July seventh arrest of the Hezbollah operator in Cyprus as the prime minister was talking about. We looked at the July third case in Kenya where they were targeting an Israeli-owned and occupied hotel in the resort area of Mombasa. And what we're seeing is in the intelligence community, our sources are telling us a fanning out across the globe, targeting areas where Israeli tourists are after a series of failed attacks against Israeli officials. So, it seems they are turning to the softer targets but the-- the suggestion by this latest information that there might be an attack on the Olympics using a combination of Iranian Revolutionary Guard forces or Hezbollah operators is certainly something to be concerned about. BOB SCHIEFFER: All right. We'll be back to you in just a sec, John. I want to go back to Aurora now, Barry Petersen, just kind of bring us up to speed on-- on what happens next. I know the President gets there this afternoon. Just kind of run through that for us. BARRY PETERSEN (CBS News Correspondent): Well, there are a couple of things going on, Bob. As you mentioned, President Obama is going to come here. He's going to meet with government officials. More importantly, he's going to meet with families of the victims, and I think talk with them, express his concern. Later this evening, on an equally personal note, the city of Aurora is having a huge vigil. And they want to make it clear that anybody can come to this. They want the police to come, any family members, friends, ordinary people. I think this is a chance for people to express what they've been doing since this tragedy began, which is to somehow in some way get a part of this and get through it in their own way. And then tomorrow morning, we have the first court appearance of the suspect. We don't know how-- what he's going to say, if anything. We're not quite sure how that's going to unfold. But I want to mention in that light, if I can just look ahead a little bit past the court appearance, Colorado is a death penalty state. So, it's entirely possible that if this plays out, if this man is convicted, he could die by lethal injection. BOB SCHIEFFER: Well, we-- Norah O'Donnell, I thought it was interesting when we talked to Chief Oates out there. He said he thought it was extremely important for the President to come out there. But, I guess what I want to ask both of you as after hearing this kind of Michael Bloomberg sort of laying down the law here. He said, look, both these people running for President need to tell us where they stand on-- on gun laws and just the whole subject of guns. Where does-- What does the President-- can we expect to hear something from him on that? NORAH O'DONNELL (CBS News Chief White House Correspondent): Well, I think you'll see the President with some of these victims' families today. Although that will largely probably be private meetings, as a consoler in chief, something that the President does, provides that kind of leadership at a time like this but there will be no change in policy. And we heard that from the President's spokesman. In fact, there are many gun control advocates who are upset with President Obama because he has not pushed for renewal of the assault weapons ban. He signed bills that allow guns into national parks and on Amtrak trains. So gun control advocates have been unhappy with President Obama for not being more active and the politics are quite simple. The NRA is the most powerful lobby in Washington. There are more than four million registered Americans as part of the NRA, and many of them are in swing states like Ohio and Florida. BOB SCHIEFFER: Many people forget that Governor Romney, when he was governor of Massachusetts, did actually sign a ban on assault weapons as governor. Does he still talk about that, John? JOHN DICKERSON (CBS News Political Director): Not at all. In fact, he's come to a new position on assault weapons, says he doesn't you want to re-up the ban. As Norah said, there's a real risk for the President after the shooting in Arizona of Congresswoman Giffords, he didn't mention gun control in his speech or later in the State of the Union. He's staying away from it. Mitt Romney really going to stay away from it, too. His problem is with his own voters. I was in Durbin, West Virginia, about as not-President Obama territory as you can be, pro-Romney voters. At the-- at the city fair that day what was the raffle--a .22 rifle. A conversation about something else got into gun control very quickly. The relationship between gun control--gun rights, as they see it there--and freedom is direct. If Mitt Romney looks like he's going to be touching on any of those essential freedoms as these voters see it. Then, he's just like President Obama. This is a real danger for him, and, as Norah said, West Virginia is-- is Romney country to be sure. But in Ohio, in Pennsylvania, in Virginia, there are voters there that Mitt Romney wants. They're part of his coalition. He's not going to do anything to-- to freak them out. NORAH O'DONNELL: But the irony is is that Mitt Romney was more active on gun control than President Obama when he was a Massachusetts politician. As you pointed out, Bob, signing into law an assaults weapon ban after the Congress allowed the other one to expire. BOB SCHIEFFER: But you all are both telling me don't expect anything to change here. Here's-- now-- now the Colorado Congressman said he's going to try to lead an effort to get that assault ban-- a ban on assault weapons put back into law. But-- NORAH O'DONNELL (overlapping): But he probably hasn't spoken with the Democratic leadership yet. JOHN DICKERSON: Well, here's what could change the dynamic, two important pieces. One, we don't have all the evidence in. If it turns out that there was some crazy loophole here--who in the world should be ordering, you know, this much ammunition by just the hundreds of pounds. There-- there might be some piece of evidence that shocks common sense, as you pointed out, in which it changes the political dynamic that it become-- becomes hard for anybody who is a supporter of gun rights to say I can defend this and-- and still be considered to have common sense. There's also a mental health piece to this. You could see somebody arguing that this is about crazy people and we have got to find a way to have a system that-- that makes it easier to treat people like this. BOB SCHIEFFER: Well, I mean, the fact is, he bought all this stuff, legally, and, boy, did he buy a lode. I mean you could fill up a dump truck with what he bought. BOB ORR: He-- he bought a ton of stuff but he did it-- he could have bought it anywhere, Bob. This was a so-called clean skin. The man had no record at all. I mean zero on the record. Over a period of six weeks, he went into three different gun shops, legally purchased some high-powered weapons, the Smith & Wesson version of an AR-15, semiautomatic assault rifle. A two .40-caliber Glock pistols, semiautomatics, and then a 12-gauge shotgun for good measure and then over the internet bought six thousand rounds--six thousand rounds of ammunition and we think from a company called BulkAmmo.com. This was apparently delivered to a FedEx outlet there in Colorado. This was all very, very easy. And, apparently, Mister Holmes stayed within the law and it was easy for him to do. BOB SCHIEFFER: I thought one interesting thing that came to light overnight, John Miller, and also Barry, apparently, that assault weapon that-- that he was firing jammed at one point, and he had to go to a smaller weapon with less firepower. Had-- had it not jammed, he might have killed even more people, John. JOHN MILLER: So what you're looking at there is you are looking at a drum magazine. That-- you know, that weapon is designed for a straight up-and-down thirty-round magazine, what people commonly refer to as a clip. This drum magazine is like something you would see for a Gatling gun, and it is designed for that weapon. I think the lucky thing here is that weapon was not designed for that magazine, is not made by the manufacturer, so it is-- it was probably prone to that kind of jam and that probably did slow him down to take that off, discard it, and reload. But at some point, as he wandered out of the theater and almost waited for police who, as we learned, almost mistook him for a S.W.A.T. member, except for the fact, you know, I'll say this according to the sources because I learned it a different way, he was wearing the wrong kind of gas mask but he seemed to stop on his own. He certainly had ammo and weapons left. BOB SCHIEFFER: Barry Petersen, we have heard very little. We know that he-- he offered no resistance when the officers arrested him. What do you know about-- about the arrest? How did it take place? How did they spot him? What happened? BARRY PETERSEN: Well, let me-- let me jump into that previous debate just for a second, Bob. I want to bring a little Western perspective to this issue of gun control. People here think that this is different from those of East Coast cities and things like that. In the West, you need guns to literally protect yourself sometimes against wild animals. The amount of ammunition that he bought, six thousand rounds, somebody said, is really not that unusual. If you are an avid target shooter, you would buy that much in a month, you'd go through it. As for the arrest, he was literally no resistance. It's one of the significant things about what he did. He left the theater, goes to his car, sits there, the police approach him, no effort to fight against them. He basically gave himself up. So I don't know the mentality of this. I don't know if this was part of his plan. But he certainly did not want to do one of those death by cop things, where he ended up getting shot by the police. He wanted to do his deed and he wanted to live to talk about it. BOB SCHIEFFER: Bob Orr, there was one report that he told police, ""I am the Joker,"" and that he was-- he had either dyed his hair red or was wearing a red wig. Have you been able to nail that down? BOB ORR: Yeah, sources say that's true that apparently some time ago he had dyed his hair with some kind of bright fiery orange color or red and apparently said near the time of his arrest, either as he was leaving the theater or as he was waiting for the police, ""I am the Joker."" Now some people have speculated that that speaks to possible motive. Maybe he was acting out some kind of diabolical fantasy and maybe-- BOB SCHIEFFER: So maybe I can clarify that. BOB ORR: --he viewed himself as an arch evil enemy of Batman. John has a-- a thought on this, too. But I don't think we know yet whether that means anything. BOB SCHIEFFER: John. JOHN MILLER: So-- so he definitely did dye his hair bright red, like the character, the Joker. And police did have an early report that he said, ""I am the Joker,"" but ,as they run that backwards, that report has turned out not to be true. So, yes, on the hair, no, on the utterance. And, you know, there's also a conflict there which is every single witness that they've spoken to and that we've spoken to has said he did not say a word, he just opened fire. And in fact, he was wearing a gas mask with a movie going on in the background. So had he actually elected to say anything, nobody would have heard him anyway. BOB SCHIEFFER: Norah and John, so we have a brief kind of interval here in the campaign, but does this affect the campaign in any way? What happens next? NORAH O'DONNELL: Well, they-- both sides out of respect for the families and their victims took down some of their--what they call comparative ads what we know as negative ads--airing in Colorado. But the President is going out to Aurora today to meet with-- with the families, but then he is going to the West Coast anyway for what is a series of campaign events for three days. So the campaigning will continue next week, and, of course, John can tell you, too, Mitt Romney is going ahead on his overseas trip and-- JOHN DICKERSON: Yes, Governor Romney has a plan here. He's got his-- his overseas trip, which is coming up. He's also going to announce his vice president. They-- they've got things to do that are not in the attack category but that will move the-- the campaign along. And as we discussed before, neither has a real interest to (INDISTINCT) any of this. NORAH O'DONNELL: Yeah. BOB SCHIEFFER: Any-- any-- any estimate on when he's going to announce the veep. JOHN DICKERSON: The veep, it used to be in the old days you did it right before the convention. That was because you wanted to get the-- the news cycle on your side. You also-- there was a monetary reason to do it. For candidates who were taking matching federal funds, it was expensive to get a vice president. So you wanted to do it as close to that time when you got the matching-- mederal fun-- federal funds. That's not a-- at play here because Governor Romney is not going to take those funds. So he can take a vice president earlier, maybe when he gets back from the Olympics, use the vice president to raise money and to take on the President. BOB SCHIEFFER: Has he told you who it's going to be? JOHN DICKERSON: No, not yet. But I expect to call later today. BOB SCHIEFFER: Listen, thank you all. A tough story to be working on but you all have done a splendid job, all of you. We'll be back with the mayor of Aurora. So stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) BOB SCHIEFFER: And we're back now. We're going to back out to Aurora where the mayor of Aurora, Steve Hogan, joins us now. Well, Mister Mayor, fair to say, you've had one of the toughest jobs of all since all of this happened because you've made it your business to go around and visit with the wounded, to try to offer whatever-- STEVE HOGAN (Aurora Mayor): Yeah. BOB SCHIEFFER: --consolation and so forth you can to the families. How are the people doing? STEVE HOGAN: People are doing well. They-- they appreciate the visit, but, certainly, we still have, at last-- my last notification, nine people in critical condition. Those who are out of the hospital already, you know, we're following up with them. Those who are still in the hospital, the families are happy to know that somebody cares. I mean, inherently they know that, but-- but to see someone makes a difference. I want to thank Governor Hickenlooper for-- for getting out and-- and-- and accompanying me at times. And sometimes just going on his own. He's been a wonderful support. BOB SCHIEFFER: Governor, these people who are critical, how bad are they? STEVE HOGAN: They're-- they're in bad shape. There are-- there are people who have had already numerous surgeries, numerous brain surgeries. There are some folks that are in-- in bad shape. BOB SCHIEFFER: What-- what are the families, what are the people talking to you about right now? STEVE HOGAN: Well, you know, first, as I said, they're thankful to know that someone cares. Secondly, the great care that they're receiving at the various hospitals, and then, lastly, you know, just a sense of-- of shock and frustration. But no one-- no one is-- no one's bitterly angry, at least not yet. I think, you know, we're starting-- we're starting now to go through that grieving process and I think some of that will come out, but not yet. BOB SCHIEFFER: These things, you don't get over them right away. What-- what can the rest of the nation do to help you, Mayor? STEVE HOGAN: Well-- well, certainly, emails, texts, we're setting up a-- a donation fund. Some of these families don't have insurance. They are going to be some of these victims who are going to be paralyzed for life. So any financial support would be greatly appreciated. And-- and just remembering. I mean I'm very thankful. We've heard from literally the world, and I'm thankful for that and we'll get back to everybody and say thank you. BOB SCHIEFFER: All right. Well, Mister Mayor, our sympathy to you. Thank you so much for taking time to join us. We'll be back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) BOB SCHIEFFER: And we leave you now with a remembrance of those who were lost in this awful episode.

""On behalf of the Poway Unified School District, Superintendent [John] Collins joins the rest of the nation in offering our deepest condolences to the victims and their families,"" the statement read. UPDATE 1:00 p.m. --  According to University of Colorado Hospital spokeswoman Jacque Montgomery, James Holmes was studying neuroscience in a Ph.D. program at the University of Colorado-Denver graduate school. Montgomery said Holmes enrolled in the neuroscience program in 2011 and was in the process of withdrawing. She said she did not know why he had decided to withdraw. UPDATE 11:30 a.m. --  More details are emerging about James Holmes, the suspected shooter in Thursday night's movie theater massacre in Colorado. Lt. Andra Brown of the San Diego Police Department briefed reporters outside James Holmes' mother's home Friday. Brown confirmed Holmes attended high school in San Diego before going to Colorado to pursue additional studies. Brown would not name either school. San Diego media outlets have reported Holmes attended high school at Westview in Carmel Valley and graduated in 2006. Brown said Holmes' mother was in her house, but that his father has been ""escorted from the home."" She did not elaborate further. ""The police department is just here to preserve the peace and to make sure the privacy of the family is still respected,"" said Brown. ""That's the only reason why the San Diego police department is here."" Brown also provided a statement to reporters from the family. ""Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy,"" the statement read. ""We ask that the media respect our privacy at this difficult time ... We are still trying to process this info and appreciate that people respect our privacy."" Margie Aguilar, who has lived for 10 years on the same San Diego block as Holmes' family briefly spoke to HuffPost ""I feel heartbroken,"" she said, adding that her children went to high school with the suspected shooter. ""They're [the Holmes family] victims in this, too. I want to respect their privacy. ""Everybody is in shock and devastated."" Police are still trying to clear the suspect's Aurora apartment. According to police, explosives found inside the unit are ""very sophisticated"" and could take some time to disarm. The U.S. Army, in response to speculation that Holmes had served in the military, issued a statement that said they found ""no evidence"" he had served in the Army."" EARLIER -- An initial portrait of James Holmes, the man allegedly responsible for the mass shooting spree in a Colorado movie theater, is slowly emerging. According to the police, Holmes lives in an apartment in Aurora, approximately five miles from the Century 16 movie theater where he gunned down at least 12 people and wounded 38 others during a midnight screening of the new Batman movie, ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Authorities at this hour are cautiously entering the apartment. The suspect, according to police, said he had explosives inside. The FBI has approximately 100 agents at the scene assisting with the investigation. The FBI has revealed Holmes is a white male who is 6 feet, 3 inches tall and 24 years old, with a birth date of Dec. 13, 1987. Authorities have found no significant criminal record and no terrorist affiliations. Investigators suspect he acted alone. A motive in the shooting is not yet known. A San Diego, Calif., woman who identified herself as Holmes' mother told ABC News she had not yet been contacted by authorities. She said she was unaware of the shooting and expressed concern that her son may have been involved. ""You have the right person,"" she said, apparently speaking on instinct and not second-guessing her son would be involved. ""I need to call the police ... I need to fly out to Colorado."" Holmes reportedly had Tennessee license plates on the vehicle he was driving at the time of the shooting, but a connection to that state remains unclear. He was arrested next to the vehicle, without incident, after the shooting spree ended. Police say he was wearing a bullet-resistant vest and gas mask at the time of the shooting and was armed with two long guns and a handgun. As updates continue to trickle in, MSNBC reports that a survivor of the massacre in Colorado said she first thought the man dressed in black who entered through an exit door was part of the premier of the movie.

1222840644,2012-08-01 08:21:10,Aurora's Hard Truth: Mental Health Screening for Gun Buyers Is Nearly Non-Existent,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/auroras-hard-truth-mental_us_1727695,en,False,"law and legislation,medicine and health,gun control,firearms,murders and attempted murders,sales",96720,HuffPost Latino Voices,http://voces.huffingtonpost.com/#spider,"Executive Director, Coalition to Stop Gun Violence If you learn only one new thing about America's gun laws after the gruesome mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, learn this: Even when individuals do undergo a background check when buying a gun in this country, the screening for mental health history is cursory at best. You don't need to submit to a background check to buy a gun, of course. Currently, Americans can buy firearms through ""private sales"" in more than 40 states without undergoing any type of screening at all. The law requires background checks only for guns sold by federally licensed firearm dealers (FFLs), allowing those not ""engaged in the business"" of dealing firearms to do so without conducting background checks or maintaining any records of sale. How do we know who is ""engaged in the business""? We don't (the IRS isn't looking at anyone's tax returns to find out), at least until guns start turning up at crime scenes and an investigation is opened by law enforcement. One study estimated that private sales account for 40% of all gun sales in the United States. When an individual purchases a firearm from an FFL, however, he must undergo a criminal background check. First, the buyer fills out a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) Form 4473 by hand, providing simple yes or no answers to a series of questions about criminal, mental health and substance abuse history. The dealer then queries the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) database maintained by the FBI via a toll-free telephone number or through the NICS E-Check System online (in a handful of states the dealer contacts the state police who in turn contact NICS). This instant computer check searches the NICS database for any disqualifying records that would prohibit that individual from buying a gun. During the check, the system does not disclose to gun dealers any actual information about these records. Dealers are simply seeing one of three responses from NICS on their computer screen: proceed, denied or delayed. If a potential gun buyer is denied, the FFL is never informed of the reason. The specific disqualifications related to mental health are quite narrow. Under federal law, an individual is prohibited from buying or possessing firearms if they have been ""adjudicated as a mental defective"" or ""committed to a mental institution."" A person is ""adjudicated as a mental defective"" if a court -- or other entity having legal authority to make adjudications -- has made a determination that an individual, as a result of mental illness: 1) Is a danger to himself or to others; 2) Lacks the mental capacity to contract or manage his own affairs; 3) Is found insane by a court in a criminal case, or incompetent to stand trial, or not guilty by reason of lack of mental responsibility pursuant to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. A person is ""committed to a mental institution"" if that person has been involuntarily committed to a mental institution by a court or other lawful authority. This expressly excludes voluntary commitment. If a person falls under one of these two categories, they are prohibited from purchasing and possessing firearms for life -- although federal law now allows states to establish procedures for such individuals to restore their right to purchase or possess firearms. Many states have done so at the behest of the National Rifle Association, with questionable results. There is no guarantee, however, that a formal record of adjudication or involuntary commitment will find its way into the NICS database. Often disqualifying mental health records go unreported by the states. In Colorado, for example, only about 1% of people who have disqualifying mental health histories have been reported to NICS. Another problem is that few Americans suffering from serious mental illness ever come into contact with the ""system"" or receive treatment for their condition(s). According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), approximately 10% of children and adolescents suffer from mental illnesses. Yet only 20% of this group have been diagnosed and are receiving services. Looking at adults, approximately 1 in 17 live with a serious mental disorder such as schizophrenia, major depression, or bipolar disorder. Yet less than one third receive mental health services. James Holmes, the gunman who allegedly killed 12 people and injured 58 others in just two minutes at a crowded midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises in Aurora, appears to possibly be one of those Americans suffering from serious mental illness. Holmes was seeing Dr. Lynne Fenton, a psychiatrist at the University of Colorado who specializes in schizophrenia. Prior to the shooting, he sent her a notebook detailing his plans for the massacre. In June, Holmes applied to join a gun range but was rejected because the range's owner was disturbed by the ""weird and bizarre"" behavior Holmes exhibited on his voicemail recording. Immediately after the shooting on July 20th, Holmes told police officers that he was The Joker, a villain from Batman comic books and movies. We will undoubtedly learn many additional details about Holmes' mental health history in the months ahead. Almost all Americans would agree that dangerously mentally ill individuals, possibly like James Holmes, and like Tucson shooter Jared Loughner (who was found incompetent to stand trial because of paranoid schizophrenia) should not be able to legally purchase firearms. And it's not like this is a problem without a solution -- there is no other high-income nation on the face of the earth in which Holmes and Loughner could have legally purchased such weapons. So how can we provide for the public's safety while at the same refraining from the stigmatization of those suffering with mental illness (because, to be fair, research has made it clear that the vast majority of the mentally ill will never be violent)? Several states have enacted laws that could serve as models for federal legislators. California, for example, takes a graduated approach to the problem, prohibiting the purchase and possession of firearms by individuals who:  • Have been voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric facility and are receiving inpatient treatment for a mental illness and the attending mental health professional states that the individual is a danger to self or others. Once an individual has been discharged from the facility, the prohibition no longer applies.  • Have communicated to a licensed psychotherapist a serious threat of physical violence against a reasonably identifiable victim or victims. This prohibition applies for six months after the report of a threat is made. The subject of the prohibition may petition to have it removed. • Are currently under a court-ordered conservatorship because they are ""gravely disabled"" as a result of a mental disorder. The prohibition expires when the conservatorship ends, though the subject of a conservatorship may ask the court for a hearing to contest the prohibition. • Are receiving involuntary mental health treatment as part of a 72-hour hold (also known as a 5150) because they are a danger to themselves or others. The individual is prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms while they are in the facility and for five years from the date of admission to the facility. The subject of the prohibition may go before a state court to petition for the restoration of their right to purchase and possess firearms. New Jersey has created a model where any person seeking to purchase or possess a firearm must obtain either a permit to purchase a handgun or a Firearms Purchaser Identification Card (FPIC) to purchase a long gun. Applicants for a permit to purchase a handgun or FPIC are required to provide two character references and must agree to waive confidentiality and disclose their mental health records. No permits to purchase a handgun or FPICs are issued to individuals who: • Have been confined for a mental disorder to a hospital, mental institution or sanitarium. • Refuses to waive confidentiality and agree to disclosure of their mental health records. In addition, the New Jersey state police can deny the issuance of handgun permits and FPICs when they feel it would not be ""in the interest of the public health, safety or welfare."" Individuals can appeal to a state court if they feel the state has abused its discretion in denying a permit or FPIC. It's not difficult to see how such processes might have thwarted severely mentally ill individuals like Loughner and possibly Holmes. Would either have been able to provide character references? What would a careful and confidential analysis of their mental health records have uncovered? The bottom line is that it's been almost 45 years since federal legislators defined mental health disqualifications for gun buyers in the Gun Control Act of 1968. It's time to see what else we can do to save lives. Providing law enforcement and mental health professionals with more tools won't stop every shooting, but -- combined with a policy of universal background checks on all gun sales -- could certainly lead to a future where grotesque acts of gun violence are not a daily feature of American life.

1222840641,2012-08-07 10:22:42,Mark Kelly: Gabrielle Giffords Satisfied With Jared Lee Loughner Guilty Plea,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gabrielle-giffords-jared-lee-loughner-plea_us_1751313,en,True,"medicine and health,crime and criminals,murders and attempted murders,sentences (criminal),mental health and disorders",96720,HuffPost Latino Voices,http://voces.huffingtonpost.com/#spider,"By ELLIOT SPAGAT AND BOB CHRISTIE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS TUCSON, Ariz. -- Jared Lee Loughner has pleaded guilty to going on a rampage in Tucson, Ariz., that left six dead and wounded then-Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and 12 others. Loughner's plea Tuesday allows him to avoid the death penalty in a mass shooting that gained worldwide attention in January 2011 because his intended target was the congresswoman. Among the dead were Arizona's chief federal judge and a Giffords' aide. Federal Judge Larry A. Burns had found that Loughner was mentally unfit to stand trial. He ruled on Tuesday that months of forcibly medicating him to treat his schizophrenia made him competent to understand the gravity of the charges against him and assist in his own defense. Loughner is expected to be sentenced to life in prison without parole. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below. Former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords is satisfied with Tuesday's expected plea agreement from the man accused of shooting her and many others in a deadly rampage at one of her political events, and she hopes it will allow victims of the mass shooting to move on with their lives. Jared Lee Loughner is expected to plead guilty in federal court in Tucson, Ariz., as part of an agreement that will allow him to avoid the death penalty in the shooting that left six people dead, including a federal judge, and wounded Giffords and 12 others. ""The pain and loss caused by the events of Jan. 8, 2011, are incalculable,"" Giffords said in a joint statement with her husband, Mark Kelly. ""Avoiding a trial will allow us - and we hope the whole Southern Arizona community - to continue with our recovery."" Later Tuesday, the legal team defending Loughner will have to convince a judge that he is competent enough to enter a plea. The 23-year-old college dropout is scheduled to attend a hearing during which his attorneys and prosecutors will try to persuade U.S. District Court Judge Larry A. Burns that Loughner is no longer mentally unfit for trial. Experts had concluded that Loughner suffers from schizophrenia, and officials at a federal prison have forcibly medicated him with psychotropic drugs for more than a year. A court-appointed psychiatrist is expected to testify Tuesday that he is competent to enter a plea. If Burns agrees, as legal experts expect, a formal change-of-plea hearing will follow. That's when those in the court will hear from Loughner at length for the first time, as the judge questions him about the agreement and changing his plea to guilty. Burns may ask Loughner to recite his actions in his own words, but either his lawyer or the federal prosecutor could just read the facts of the January 2011 shooting spree at a Tucson supermarket, where Giffords was holding a meet-and-greet with constituents. Either way, Loughner will be asked to acknowledge that he shot and killed six people, including the top federal judge in Arizona, and wounded 13 others, including Giffords. He'll need to convince Burns he understands what is going on, what he's doing and what he did. Loughner could break down, change his mind about pleading guilty or show so little understanding of what he's doing that Burns rejects the plea, lawyers not involved in the case said Monday. ""The fact that there is this planned change of plea is no guarantee that it will go forward,"" said Paul Charlton, a former U.S. attorney for Arizona. ""There are any number of things that would happen that would either cause it to be removed from the calendar or not go forward at all."" The plea agreement that is expected to be made public on Tuesday would see Loughner sentenced to life in prison, taking the possibility of the death penalty off the table in the federal case, a person familiar with the case told The Associated Press on Saturday. The person was not authorized to discuss the case publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. An agreement that would spare Loughner the death penalty offers something for both sides, said Quin Denvir, a California defense attorney who has worked with Loughner attorney Judy Clarke on the case against unabomber Ted Kaczynski. Prosecutors would avoid a potentially lengthy and costly trial and appeal, knowing that the defendant will be locked up for life. Clarke managed to avoid the death penalty for other high-profile clients such as Kaczynski and Eric Rudolph, who bombed abortion clinics in the late 1990s and Atlanta's Olympic park in 1996. The top prosecutor in southern Arizona's Pima County said last year that she may file state charges in the case that could carry the death penalty. An official in the prosecutor's office, Amelia Craig Cramer, declined to comment, saying the office did not have an active prosecution against Loughner. Denvir said it was possible that the plea agreement calls for the state to avoid pursuing criminal charges against Loughner, though that's not a given. ""Ideally (as a defense attorney) you'd like to have it resolved all at once, but sometimes you have to take one at a time,"" he said. The decision to spare Loughner a federal death sentence makes sense, said Dale Baich, a federal public defender in Phoenix who handles capital case appeals and isn't involved in the case. ""As time went on and there were numerous evaluations, I think everybody had a better understanding of Mr. Loughner's mental illness."" Baich said. He added: ""It appears that he will need to be treated for the rest of his life in order to remain competent."" ___ Christie reported from Phoenix.

1227078044,2012-07-20 20:12:00,Colorado tragedy prompts calls for urgent action on gun control,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/20/colorado-tragedy-action-gun-control,en,False,"politics and government,law and legislation,united states politics and government,elections",1751,Guardian US,https://www.theguardian.com/us,"The mass shooting in Colorado prompted immediate calls for fresh action on gun control even as the two contenders for the White House led the chorus of politicians offering condolences to the families of the victims. Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, was first to call on Barack Obama and Mitt Romney to address gun control following the deaths of at least 12 people and wounding of scores more at a Colorado screening of The Dark Knight Rises by a man, James Holmes, with an assault rifle, a shotgun and pistols.  Bloomberg criticised the presidential candidates for offering sympathy to the victims of the latest of a string of massacres to shock the US in recent years but avoiding the thorny political issue of America's loose gun laws. He said in a radio interview that ""soothing words are nice"" but not enough. ""Maybe it's time the two people who want to be president of the United States stand up and tell us what they're going to do about it, because this is obviously a problem across the country. And everybody always says: 'Isn't it tragic?'"" he said. ""There are so many murders with guns every day. It's just gotta stop. And instead of these two people, President Obama and Governor Romney, talking in broad things about they want to make the world a better place. OK, tell us how. And this is a problem. No matter where you stand on the second amendment, no matter where you stand on guns, we have a right to hear from both of them, concretely, not just in generalities, specifically: what are they going to do about guns?"" Both Obama and Romney responded to the deadliest massacre in the US since the killing of 32 people in the Virginia Tech shootings five years ago by pulling campaign adverts from Colorado television stations. The president also called off a political rally in Florida and limited himself to short remarks of condolence. ""Now, even as we learn how this happened and who's responsible, we may never understand what leads anybody to terrorise their fellow human beings like this. Such violence, such evil is senseless. It's beyond reason. But while we will never know fully what causes somebody to take the life of another, we do know what makes life worth living,"" Obama said to strong applause. ""If there's anything to take away from this tragedy it's the reminder that life is very fragile."" But Obama made no mention of gun control nor questioned how it is that a person who he describes as ""evil"" was able to obtain several powerful weapons. Neither did Romney in his response to the shooting. ""We are praying for the families and loved ones of the victims during this time of deep shock and immense grief. We expect that the person responsible for this terrible crime will be quickly brought to justice,"" said the Republican candidate. New York's mayor was backed by others, including the Brady Centre to Prevent Gun Violence, named after the White House press secretary wounded in an assassination attempt against President Ronald Reagan in 1981. Daniel Vice, the group's senior attorney, accused Obama and Romney of cowardice on the issue. ""If they don't speak out soon, very soon, then that will be shameful,"" he said. ""Mitt Romney, when he was governor, signed an assault weapons ban into law. President Obama has said in the past that he supports strong guns laws, but he has done nothing to improve our gun laws and actually has gone backward. We do see far too much cowardice on the part of our political leaders but Americans are angry and they are demanding change."" National opinion polls show that, if anything, there is growing support for easing gun regulation. Two decades ago, about 70% of Americans favoured stricter firearms control, according to Gallup. Today more than half do not want to see any change, or back less regulation. It seems that with each new massacre – the Columbine school killings in 1999, Virginia Tech, the wounding of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and killing of six other people in Arizona last year – support for controls fell. Last year, in the wake of the Giffords shooting, a Pew Research Center poll showed a small spike in support of greater gun control but the drift has largely been the other way. ""Historically, large majorities of Americans favoured stronger gun laws, way back to the 1930s,"" said Robert Spitzer, author of the Politics of Gun Control and chair of the political science department at State University of New York College at Cortland. ""But visibly in the last decade public opinion has shifted toward being more sympathetic toward the gun rights position."" Spitzer said that is in part because the Democrats have backed away from gun control in the face of the mobilisation of some of the country's 80 million gun owners by one of the US's most powerful lobby groups, the National Rifle Association. ""The Democrats felt that advocacy for gun control hurt them back in the 2000 election. That was the last election where a Democrat running for president really made something of the gun issue, supporting stronger gun laws. They felt that issue hurt them in that election,"" Spitzer said. ""Since then, they have been mostly walking away from the issue partly due to encompass more conservative Democrats within their movement to recapture the Congress, a movement that has met with some success,"" he said. Spitzer said that US supreme court rulings in 2008 and also two years later which affirmed the right of almost everyone to own a gun also swayed public opinion. ""That puts the government seal of approval on this notion of guns rights,"" he said. Vice said that while there is growing support for broad gun rights, the issue is complicated. ""People don't realise how weak our gun laws are. When you ask them specifics – should we have background checks? Should we ban assault weapons? – there's overwhelming support for those laws,"" he said. The latest killings and Bloomberg's call have thrown a spotlight on Obama's failure to follow through on a commitment in the 2008 presidential campaign to press for tighter gun controls in a country where more than 10,000 people a year are murdered using guns. The Brady Centre says an average of eight children and teenagers are shot dead every day. Although Obama spoke in favour of greater gun control before he became president, he has said almost nothing since other than to call for a ""new discussion"" on firearms laws after Giffords was shot. ""During the campaign Obama spoke a good game,"" said Ladd Everett of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, a group of 48 organisations that favour greater gun control. ""We expected more from him. Yet when he got into office and started taking advice from Rahm Emanuel and David Axelrod the political calculus changed and they determined that if they wanted to push ahead with certain high priority items like health care then it would be best not to speak out on the gun issue. ""We are disappointed. He's done nothing to save lives that are being lost to gun violence every day in this country."" That is unlikely to change in the run-up to the presidential election. The NRA plans to spend tens of millions of dollars on political adverts against Obama's re-election by claiming that the president would use a second term to push through much greater gun control. The group tried similar scaremongering tactics during the 2008 campaign. It didn't affect the outcome, but after Obama was elected, gun shops saw a surge in sales with assault rifles in particular disappearing from the shelves as speculation grew among the more conspiratorially minded that he would ban certain types of guns. Claims that the president also planned a punitive tax on bullets briefly led to a national ammunition shortage as some gun owners bought up everything they could. Gun control advocates have scored some significant victories against the NRA. This year they managed to block NRA-backed legislation to allow guns on college campuses in 12 states. The shooting of Trayvon Martin in Florida has put the brakes on stand-your-ground laws, permitting people to shoot if they feel threatened, in other states. The NRA also failed in an attempt to pressure the US Congress to pass a law forcing states with greater gun control to recognise permits from other states allowing people to carry concealed weapons failed. ""There are certain areas where victories are occurring but to be honest I think that fundamental victory is still elusive,"" said Everett. ""The sad thing is that politicians continue to make the calculation that they are unable to quash the National Rifle Association and address this problem. ""The problem has been a lack of leadership at the highest levels to stand up to the NRA and say: this has gone so far that even homicidal maniacs are now legally able to get guns. If you look find instances in US history a bully's power was broken when someone in a high place stood up and said ""enough"" and gave others the courage to do the same thing. ""That's what we desperately need to break the influence of the National Rifle Association: someone with the power and moral authority to stand up."""

We'll be bringing you updates as the details unfold. Here's a summary of where things stand: • At least six victims are dead and several wounded after a gunman opened fire this morning at the temple in Oak Creek, a Lake Michigan shore town outside Milwaukee. A responding officer is believed to have shot the gunman dead. The officer, described as a 20-year-veteran, was wounded and was being treated at hospital. His condition was unknown. • Four people were killed inside the temple and three, including the gunman, outside. The gunman was described by witnesses as a white male in his 30s. • In a news conference a police spokesman sought to correct early reports of multiple gunmen. ""At this time we have not identified any additional gunman,"" he said. He warned that the situation was ""extremely fluid."" ""We got multiple calls and multiple reports,"" he said. ""It's possible the multiple reports were of the same person."" • The shooting comes 16 days after 12 were killed and 58 wounded in a shooting in Colorado at a premiere of the latest Batman movie. The suspect, a 24-year-old former student, is in custody and undergoing preliminary court hearings. At the moment, the motives for the shooting are not clear. We will follow developments here as details emerge. Police are due to hold another press conference soon, and details will start to emerge of how the incident unfolded. Meanwhile here's our latest news story on the incident. 4.58pm: The FBI is on the scene of the temple shooting in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. The local Froedtert hospital told local station WISN they are treating 3 people injured in the shooting, all men, WISN's Tom Swigert reports. Children's classes were scheduled to begin at 11:30 am, according to WISN. The shooting started around 10:20am. 5.05pm: President Barack Obama has issued a statement on the shooting in Wisconsin. Here is the statement: Michelle and I were deeply saddened to learn of the shooting that tragically took so many lives in Wisconsin. At this difficult time, the people of Oak Creek must know that the American people have them in our thoughts and prayers, and our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who were killed and wounded. My Administration will provide whatever support is necessary to the officials who are responding to this tragic shooting and moving forward with an investigation. As we mourn this loss which took place at a house of worship, we are reminded how much our country has been enriched by Sikhs, who are a part of our broader American family.  Presidential candidate Mitt Romney has issued a statement too: Ann and I extend our thoughts and prayers to the victims of today's shooting in Wisconsin. This was a senseless act of violence and a tragedy that should never befall any house of worship. Our hearts are with the victims, their families, and the entire Oak Creek Sikh community. We join Americans everywhere in mourning those who lost their lives and in prayer for healing in the difficult days ahead. Is it offensive to suggest that both men must by now have a generic template document offering words of consolation and succor in the event of a mass shooting in the states? 5.10pm: The police in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, are holding a news conference on the shooting. Attending are:Brad Wentlandt, police chief of Greenfield, a neighboring community.Chief John Edwards of the Oak Creek PD.Oak Creek Mayor Steve ScaffidiOak Creek Fire Chief Tom RosandichRichard Schmidt of the Sherriff's OfficeJohn Chisholm, the Milwaukee County District AttorneySpecial Agent Thomas AhernTeresa Carlson, special agent in charge of FBI 5.20pm: Chief John Edwards of the Oak Creek PD is speaking to the press. He says: ""Because of the heroic action of our officers, they stopped this from being worse than it could have been."" Edwards says the officers responded to a 911 call, where they found a victim. Their officer, a 20-year-veteran, was ambushed and shot multiple times by the suspect. The officer is in surgery now. ""We expect him to recover,"" Edwards says. ""Another officer on the scene was engaged by the suspect,"" Edwards says. ""Our officer engaged that individual and that individual is deceased from actions our officer took. ... It could have been a lot worse."" ""It has taken all day to clear the area... we have numerous individuals that are deceased at this point."" Edwards says the FBI will be handling criminal incident. ""We're treating it as a domestic terrorist type incident."" Edwards said there were seven deceased and ""three injured including our officer."" The chief has no info on the suspect: ""I don't have any information for you on the suspect."" The chief takes questions: He's asked what he means by ""domestic terrorism"": ""Domestic terrorism is somebody who's doing some active terrorism within the US. Not from another country."" He's asked about the weapon: ""The weapon is not yet known. Not clear if multiple."" He's asked if the temple is clear: ""No one left in the temple. That is a crime scene."" Oak Creek Mayor Steve Scaffidi speaks briefly: The city is outraged. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims. We are thankful for the officers who responded. He pledges cooperation 5.26pm: The Oak Creek police chief described how the suspect in the shooting was killed. A 20-year veteran of the police force responded to a call of a shooting at the temple and found a victim outside. While treating the victim the officer was ambushed by the gunman and shot multiple times. A second officer then shot the gunman dead. The officer shot by the gunman is in surgery and is expected to recover. The chief, John Edwards, said he has no information on the suspect but described the incident as a ""domestic terrorist-type incident,"" meaning perpetrated by a US citizen within the United States. 5.34pm: Oak Creek Police Chief John Edwards said three were wounded in the shooting, including the veteran police officer who was among the first to respond. Among those who were shot was the president of the temple, Satwant Kaleka, who was taken to a hospital. The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinal has reported that the temple president, Satwant Kaleka, was shot and transported to the hospital. 5.36pm: Police Chief Edwards said he had no information on the suspect, who was killed at the scene, in what he called an act of ""domestic terrorism."" The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel quotes a temple member on the shooter's identity: One of the temple's committee members, Ven Boba Ri, said that based on communication with people inside the temple, the shooter was a white male in his 30s. 5.40pm: Oak Creek community members are organizing a vigil tonight for the victims of the shooting and their families and loved ones. A Facebook page for the vigil is here. A message on the page calls on community members to ""come together for a vigil and spread peace and show support for the victims and family members of the Sikh Temple Shootings."" The vigil is scheduled for 8pm at Cathedral Square Park in Milwaukee. 5.46pm: Local law enforcement met with leaders of the Sikh temple in Oak Creek last year following a series of disturbing crimes apparently targeting Sikhs in the area. The Oak Creek Patch reported last August: State Rep. Josh Zepnick and District Attorney John Chisholm visited the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin, 7512 S. Howell Ave., on Sunday to discuss public safety issues in the Sikh community. Satwant Singh Kaleka, president of the Sikh Temple, requested the meeting after the July 4 melee in Milwaukee's Riverwest neighborhood, according to a news release from Zepnick's office. Those incidents included the looting of at least one Sikh-owned business. Singh Kaleka told local officials that what was seen in Riverwest has become too common at gas stations and convenience stores owned by members of the Sikh community. Many businesses and workers have been the victims of robberies and vandalism, he said. (via @BuzzFeedAndrew) 6.00pm: A man interviewed outside the temple has told local WISN news that the shooting victims may have been members of the temple who came early to help prepare a large community lunch to be held after services.Two children were the first to see the shooter outside the temple and the first to warn temple members what was happening, the witness said. ""It was a boy and a girl who were sitting outside. The girl was from the family who was hosting the lunch today. The first shot that the shooter took was just like some firework [the children thought]. ""He shot the two people who actually came out of the cab and they were entering the church. These two kids [ran inside and alerted members]."" The witness said he spoke to the children and they described the gunman: ""One guy, blue pants, white shirt, white guy, little heavy, who was taking these shots."" ""People who got injured were mostly employees of the church"" who'd arrived early to prepare lunch, he said. The name of the interviewee was not supplied by WISN. 6.03pm: The man interviewed by WISN news who had been inside the temple said that after the shooting started ""it was chaos."" ""There are four sections to the church,"" the interviewee said. ""One for the shoes. One where we worship. One for community lunch where everybody sits and eats food."" ""There were some families who locked themselves in the bathroom. There were some who locked themselves in the kitchen area."" The man says he does not think the shooting was motivated by hatred of religion: ""I don't think this person has anything to do with religion. He just came out and started shooting like all other psychos we have heard about who have done other things in the past."" 6.10pm: Local news station WISN is at Froedtert hospital in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. A reporter says one victim was shot in the neck and is in surgery. One is shot in abdomen and chest. One is shot in face and arm. 6.14pm: Residents are being evacuated from the neighborhood of Cudahy, Wisconsin, WISN reports. Milwaukee police and the FBI are active in the area. Residents have not been told why they are being evacuated, WISN reported. Cudahy is near Milwaukee's General Mitchell International Airport. WISN speculated that police were investigating the suspect's residence. 6.21pm: Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker tweeted Sunday that he told President Obama that the FBI was ""part of an excellent team effort of local, state & federal authorities on site."" Appreciated the call from the President.It is a sad day for the Sikh community, Oak Creek, Wisconsin, and America. — Governor Walker (@GovWalker) August 5, 2012 Walker's office later released this statement: While the situation in Oak Creek continues to develop rapidly, we are working with the FBI and local law enforcement. I became aware of the situation late this morning and continue to receive updated briefings. Our hearts go out to the victims and their families, as we all struggle to comprehend the evil that begets this terrible violence. At the same time, we are filled with gratitude for our first responders, who show bravery and selflessness as they put aside their own safety to protect our neighbors and friends. Tonette and I ask everyone to join us in praying for the victims and their families, praying for the safety of our law enforcement and first responder professionals and praying for strength and healing for this entire community and our state. 6.36pm: The Sikh Coalition, the largest Sikh American civil rights organization in the U.S., has released a statement with background information about the temple, or Gudwara, in Oak Creek: The Gudwara in Oak Creek, Wisconsin was founded in 1997 and had over 400 peaceful worshipers that worked and lived in the greater Milwaukee area. The Gudwara, known as being a wonderful neighbor, had come to represent the valued contributions of the Sikh faith in a community where Sikhism was understood to be another contributing fabric in the cloth of American plurality. The impulse is to assume that the attack is a hate crime, coalition director Sapreet Kaur is quoted as saying: There have been multiple hate crime shootings within the Sikh community in recent years and the natural impulse of our community is to unfortunately assume the same in this case. Let's let law enforcement investigate the case and as new facts emerge the dialogue can change. Americans died today in a senseless act of violence and Americans of all faiths should stand in unified support with their Sikh brothers and sisters. The coalition statement supplies statistics on Sikhism: With over 25 million followers worldwide, Sikhism is the fifth largest religion in the world, with over 500,000 followers in the U.S. For more information on Sikhism please visit our website here. 6.41pm: Jaisal Noor has put together a report for Democracy Now! on violence and harassment against the Sikh community since 9/11. The violence began directly after the 9/11 attacks, on Sept. 15, 2001, when Balbir Singh Sodhi, a gas station owner, was murdered in Mesa, Arizona, by a man who apparently wanted revenge for the attacks and associated Sikhism, which originates in India, with the mutant Islam associated with the attacks, with its roots in Saudi Arabia.  6.47pm: The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel is reporting that law enforcement authorities have arrived outside of a home in Cudahy, Wisc., a town about 5 miles north of Oak Creek. Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are also reportedly outside the home. 7.00pm: We're going to wrap up our live blog coverage of the shooting at the Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. We have just published an updated news item here. Here's a summary of where things stand: • A gunman killed six victims and wounded three, including a police officer, at the temple before being shot dead by a second police officer. The three wounded were being treated at hospital and were expected to survive. • Authorities were at the scene of a home in the Milwaukee area believed to be connected with the shooter. • The gunman was described by a man who spoke to eye witnesses as white, in his 30s, ""a little heavy,"" wearing blue pants and a white shirt. He is believed to have acted alone. Police said ""weapons"" were recovered inside the temple but had no further information. • A man at the temple told local news station WISN that two children saw the suspect shoot two people exiting a taxi outside the temple. The children, who were unharmed, then ran inside to warn congregants about the shooter. • The Sikh Coalition noted an impulse to assume the act was a hate crime. Sikhs have regularly been singled out for hate crime attacks since 9/11. Please visit the Guardian US home page for further updates."

Thirteen years ago, another shooting rampage at Columbine High School, not far from Aurora, produced a brief bump in support for stricter gun laws, but that new support had eroded a year later and ultimately gave way to a longer-term decline. The Columbine shootings attracted by far the most public interest of any news story in 1999, according to the Pew Research Center. That April week, more than two-thirds of Americans (68 percent) said they had followed the story very closely. The tragedy helped provoke a national debate over gun control laws, which in turn produced a flurry of polls checking Americans' opinions on the wisdom of such laws. A few weeks after the shootings, Pew Research found 65 percent of Americans said it was more important to control gun ownership, while only 30 percent said it was more important to protect the right of Americans to own guns. That was a eight-point jump in those favoring gun control laws (up from 57 percent) since the pollster had last asked the question in December 1993. The post-Columbine bump had faded about a year later, and support for stricter gun laws remained roughly constant over the next eight years. Following the 2008 election, however, support for stricter gun laws dropped off considerably. By April 2010, Pew Research found more Americans placing greater importance on protecting the rights of gun owners (49 percent) than on restricting gun ownership (45 percent).  Similar questions tracked by Gallup and the Washington Post and ABC News showed similar patterns. Just after the Columbine shootings, Gallup found 66 percent of Americans saying that laws covering the sale of firearms should be stricter, but by October 2010 the pollster found support for stricter laws had fallen to just 44 percent. Likewise, the Post/ABC poll showed a longterm decline in support for stricter guns laws, dropping from 67 percent in May 1999 to 52 percent in January 2012. The Pew Research surveys show that the increase in support for gun rights since 2007 has occurred mostly among independents and Republicans, creating very wide partisan differences. In Pew's most recent survey, 72 percent of Republicans say it is more important to protect the rights of gun owners, compared to just 27 percent of Democrats.  Partisanship does not entirely explain the trend, however. The Pew surveys found that although white Americans are far more likely than non-whites to back gun rights, African Americans' support has increased by 18 points (from 17 to 35 percent) since 2007.  As always, these general views on stricter gun laws versus stronger gun rights can translate into very different attitudes when pollsters ask about specific proposals. For example, a CBS News/New York Times poll conducted in January 2011, immediately after the shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 18 others in Tucson, Ariz., found that 65 percent of Americans opposed a ban on the sale of all handguns. Yet on the same survey, nearly as many supported a nationwide ban on ""assault weapons"" (63 percent) and a nationwide ban on ""high-capacity magazines"" (63 percent). The latest tragedy in Colorado may well produce another brief polling bump, but it is unlikely to shift in attitudes over the long term absent a more fundamental change in the gun policy debate.

President Barack Obama headed to Aurora, Colorado, on Sunday to meet families grieving their losses Friday’s mass shooting that has stunned the nation and rekindled debate about guns and violence in America. Churchgoers dabbed at their eyes as special prayers were offered in Aurora for those who died in the town of 325,000, which is not far from the scene of the 1999 Columbine High School student massacre. “Our culture needs to change,” Father Mauricio Bermudez told a packed mass at the Queen of Peace Catholic Church in Aurora. “What kind of people are we becoming? Today, we must change. Today is the day.” The victims, who ranged in age from a girl of six to a man of 51, died early on Friday when a gunman police identified as graduate-school dropout James Holmes opened fire at a packed midnight premiere of the Batman film, “Dark Knight Rises.” “We’re still reeling,” Aurora Mayor Steve Hogan said at a memorial late on Saturday for one young shooting victim. A vigil was scheduled for 6:30 p.m. on Sunday in front of Aurora City Hall organized by civic community and religious leaders. Obama’s trip comes as investigators are deepening a probe into Holmes. He was arrested at the multiplex immediately after the shootings and local and federal authorities disarmed explosives in his booby-trapped apartment on Saturday. Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates said the shooting followed months of “calculation and deliberation,” as Holmes received a “high volume” of deliveries of weaponry to his work and home. Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, speaking on NBC television’s “Meet the Press” program, said there were still no clues as to the motive for the shooting. But he said Holmes was “a twisted, really delusional individual” who had not been cooperating with authorities. “DIABOLIC, DEMONIC” “He was diabolical, demonic,” Hickenlooper said. “I think of him almost as a terrorist. He wanted to take away, not just from the people here but from the country, our ability to enjoy life,” he said. On Saturday afternoon, the local coroner’s officer released the names of the 12 people killed, including those of the six-year-old girl, a young man celebrating his 27th birthday and an aspiring sportscaster who had barely escaped a shooting in a Toronto mall earlier this summer. Those who witnessed the shooting told of a nightmarish scene, with dazed victims bleeding from bullet wounds, spitting up blood and crying for help. For many, it evoked memories of the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, 17 miles (27 km) from Aurora, where two students opened fire and killed 12 students and a teacher. The incident has also reverberated in the U.S. presidential race. Both Obama and his Republican rival, Mitt Romney, toned down their campaigns on Friday, pulled ads from Colorado and dedicated scheduled events to the victims. In Rome on Sunday, Pope Benedict expressed dismay and sadness at the shooting. “I was deeply shocked by the senseless violence which took place in Aurora, Denver,” he said in his regular Sunday Angelus address. “I share the distress of the families and friends of the victims and the injured, especially the children,” he said. Holmes was arrested in a parking lot behind the cinema. He was armed with a Smith & Wesson M&P .223 semi-automatic rifle, similar to an AR-15 assault rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun and a Glock .40-caliber handgun. Police found an additional Glock .40-caliber handgun in his car. All the weapons were legally bought in the previous 60 days. “THE JOKER” Authorities said Holmes had dyed his hair red and called himself “the Joker” in a reference to Batman’s comic-book nemesis, was due to make an initial court appearance on Monday. Sources familiar with the investigation said some 30 softball-sized containers filled with gunpowder were found in Holmes’ apartment, together with containers filled with “incendiary liquids” intended to fuel a fire from the initial explosions, as well as bullets meant to ricochet around the apartment. Holmes was being held in solitary confinement to protect him from other prisoners, a routine move in high-profile cases, said Grayson Robinson, sheriff of Arapahoe County. He is due to make his initial appearance before a judge at the Arapahoe County Justice Center on Monday morning. Little has surfaced from his past to suggest he was capable of such violence. Until last month, Holmes was studying for a doctoral degree in neuroscience at the University of Colorado’s Anschutz Medical School, a few blocks from his apartment. The University of Colorado Hospital, which treated some of the shooting victims, said 10 people had been released and five remained in critical condition. The Medical Center of Aurora said four of its seven patients remained in intensive care, while three others were on the main trauma floor. A memorial of flowers, candles and stuffed animals has sprung up where the shootings took place. A handwritten sign read: “7/20 gone not forgotten.” (Additional reporting by Stephanie Simon, Keith Coffman, Edith Honan, Dan Whitcomb and Donna Smith in the United States and James Mackenzie in Rome; Editing by Tom Brown and David Brunnstrom) Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

7.20.2012 11:31 AM We have–and good!–a culture where people have the ways and means to blather about whatever is going on, and plenty of free time to so, and to reach everyone on earth who might care. Why, many of us are even paid to do so. And such blathering–also good!–tries to pretend it's relevant. Hence the collection (which will grow) that Matt Welch  blogged below of wild speculation regarding the horrible murders in Aurora Colorado last night. And as CNN's Piers Morgan is  leading the way (with Salman Rushdie following), there will be attempts to use the nightmarish event to plump for stricter laws, of some sort (often unspecified), to restrict people's ability to possess or carry weapons, since it was someone carrying a weapon that committed the crime. But turning the (still) very rare criminal and evil uses of guns to indiscriminately harm innocents into a reason for policy change doesn't work that well in America any more, and it shouldn't, and it likely won't now. As I wrote after the last big newsmaking American mass shooting, the one by Jared Laughner that wounded Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), and not much has changed: Americans' attitudes toward gun laws have shifted since the mid-'90s, when Congress passed the now-expired ""assault weapon"" ban and the Brady Act. Brady instituted federal background checks for every potential gun buyer….At the start of the 1990s, according to Gallup polls, 78 percent of Americans wanted stricter gun control. By 2009 that number had fallen to a historical low of 44 percent. As Americans' attitudes have shifted, even Democrats have mostly avoided trying to expand gun control at the national level…. There is no consistent association between gun crimes and easy access to guns or the right to carry. Crimes such as Loughner's are so bizarre and rare that there is no sense in trying to craft laws aimed at preventing them. Despite constantly expanding gun ownership—the number of new firearms entering American possession averages around 4 million a year—and expanded rights to legally carry weapons, the last two decades have seen a 41 percent decline in violent crime rates. Since the 2004 expiration of the ""assault weapon"" ban, murder rates are down 15 percent. Many pundits have tried to explain Loughner's crimes by citing Arizona's ""loose"" gun laws, including the lack of permit requirement for concealed or open carry. It's true that Loughner exercised his right to carry without a permit, but he would doubtless have carried the gun even if he was violating the law doing so… A CBS poll two weeks after the massacre found that 51 percent of Americans still think gun laws should either stay the same or be loosened. That was down from 58 percent in March 2009 but still above 2002 levels, when 56 percent of respondents in another CBS poll supported tighter gun control. Americans understand that even strange people should be able to own weapons, and not just for deer hunting. The very rare crimes of very unusual Americans should not dictate how everyone's right to self-defense is managed, and even in the wake of tragedy that is fortunately unlikely to change A concomitant wave of blathering won't be about gun laws, but about motives–finding out exactly what made accused shooter James Holmes do it, so that we can either decry or attempt to squash such influences on other lives, or target gun restrictions somehow on such folk. Why did Holmes, presuming he is the guilty party, do it? Because he wanted to. Whatever other influences we may discover in his background–his leisure interests, politics, philosophy, family (his mom  wasn't surprised at all) don't explain it, as assuredly thousands/millions of other young men will share such interests or rough background. The endless and unmanageable mystery of the individual's power and choice to do evil is what's at play, and there aren't many explanations of that of policy relevance. What are some of the seemingly policy-relevant aspects of this story? Colorado in general has very liberal (in a pro-Second Amendment sense) concealed carry laws, though the particular spot, a Cinemark Theater, apparently bars non-law enforcement from bringing in guns. Whether Holmes knew this and chose that site for his murders deliberately is something we don't know yet. Guns are still very, very dangerous. The vast, vast, vast majority of people who have them still use them safely, and in many cases to  protect innocent life. They aren't disappearing from the Earth, and evil people's choices to use them can't be meaningfully curtailed. Trying to ""turn tragedy into politics"" feels gross, because the deaths and the grief for the living are real and terrible and demand respect–and in reality, except for the news and commentary chatter today, this is unlikely to turn into politics, for reasons stated above. If I weren't a professional writer about the Second Amendment (in my 2008 book  Gun Control on Trial) on record as believing in the right to bear arms, I wouldn't dream of weighing in at all. The White House is being circumspect as well, saying the crime is  not changing Obama's general attitude about gun possession. If you want to keep up on a well-curated collection of ongoing links about actual news as it arises regarding the Aurora shooting, Marc Ambinder of The Atlantic is doing a good job of that on Twitter. Zerohedge has a  long (but incomplete) list of mass gun murders in the past couple of decades. Bureau of Justice Statistics on gun crime (plummeted enormously since 1993).

Y’just know Democrats are going to yelp about how this is another reason to bring the shithammer down on law-abiding gun owners, all of whom are just time bombs waiting to go off and Wild West the entire country. I’m just wondering how they’ll name the new gun-control law so as to form the acronym “B.A.T.M.A.N.” Ask and ye shall receive. Banning Armaments and the Transportation of Munitions Across the Nation. If only your powers could be used for good! can we stop calling this a “tragedy?” It was a crime. What would’ve happened if somebody in the theater had been legally carrying concealed? That’s all I could think about after hearing about this. If only someone had been carrying who could at least tried to stop this idiot or at least slowed him down. Then I read that despite Colorado having a pretty liberal concealed carry law the Theater had a “no guns” policy. Sigh. If the Theater had a “no guns” policy, how did this shooting occur? I mean, I don’t know about you, but I would have seen the “no guns” sign and found another place to commit a massacre. Seems logical to me. You wouldn’t want to offend them. Maybe the shooter was the illiterate? Obviously the solution is to shovel more money at the Dept of Education. And ban video games. sarcasmic:I agree 100%, but I guess that is what gun free zones are for,to make the criminal feel safe. What would’ve happened if somebody in the theater had been legally carrying concealed? He would have been forcibly removed or arrested and this incident would have occurred regardless. I mean if they didn’t have the “no guns” policy. Interestingly, that was one of the first things they mentioned about this story on 104.3 this morning. That is what I thought too. And I was immediately told by EPisiarch and Gilmore that I was just as bad as the liberals for suggesting such. Well, obviously, if they said so then it must be true. unfortunately probably arrested being in a gun free zone and all. There should be mandatory time between when a law can be enacted and the tragedy that spawned it. If it’s that important, Bruce’s Law can survive that waiting period. Bruce’s Law? Is it this one? Good. Bad. I’m the guy with the gun. I’m supposed to see the movie tomorrow. Any bets on the increased police presence at theaters for the rest of the weekend? Not entirely a bad idea, just that it’s leans more to knee-jerk overreaction than necessarily precaution. More overtime for your local law enforcement. Yippie! If it scares away the pranksters, I’ll be okay with a cop cruiser in the parking lot. But not so much for an armed officer posted at each entrance. I think I’ll just wait for it to hit dvd or OnDemand. You know, just in case. You know what else would scare away the pranksters? Girls? #WINNING The Selective Service administration? Hitler? Brian Doherty’s book? You know, I was planning on going out and killing a bunch of people this weekend, but then I remembered that there are laws against carrying guns around! Dammit! Stupid misdemeanor preventing me from committing a felony! Unfortunately we’re having a  similar debate in Canada after a spate of shootings in Toronto. Unlike in the US, these reactionary laws have a better chance of going through. I’m accelerating my plans to purchase some firearms (which will put a bit of a hole in the old budget, but, oh well…) ABC says oops: “Editor’s Note: An earlier ABC News broadcast report suggested that a Jim Holmes of a Colorado Tea Party organization might be the suspect, but that report was incorrect. ABC News and Brian Ross apologize for the mistake, and for disseminating that information before it was properly vetted.” http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/…..Al846DHmSq Well at least they didn’t confuse him with John Holmes who has comparable range. Well, I’m sure “Jim Holmes of a Colorado Tea Party organization” feels much better now that “Jim Holmes of a Colorado Tea Party organization”‘s name has been cleared. Once again, we’d like to apologize to “Jim Holmes of a Colorado Tea Party organization” for this mishap. Now let’s turn to Bob from the Southern Poverty Law Center, who’s an expert on the Colorado Tea Party, and have him give us some insight into this horrendous event… Bob? But don’t dare question their veracity or judgement the next time they smear somebody! My NoScript goes nuts on their site. Can’t verify, but I’m willing to bet they buried that. I am sure he would have made the same mistake had it been an OWS site. NBC News has 911 audio from the night, edited for relevancy: I am… George… z… im… mer… MAN! …and I… don’t… like… BLACK… people- Actually, wouldn’t they have the shooter reciting the 2nd amendment while walking through the theater? No caller said the word “amendment”. Oh, come on Brian. Next you’ll be suggesting that people should judge this incident based on–ick–facts. When any good Progressive can tell you that feelings trump facts. But it was a gun free zone. Maybe they didn’t make that clear. And the shooter didn’t understand he was breaking the rules by bringing a gun into the theater. We need more signs. Maybe a public service campaign to make people aware. NBC needs to run one of those “Now You Know” campaigns. was he educated by teachers the rest of us paid for? He didn’t do that shooting, we did. No, no, no, that’s not how it works! Collective ownership only applies when you have something the statists want to steal, like wealth. Blame, on the other hand, belongs strictly to individuals (and to any icky organizations they can be Kevin Baconed to, like the NRA or the Tea Party). My question: Where the hell are all the concealed carriers in CO? Can you imagine how this tragedy would have just been a footnote if one person would have popped a cap in his ass the minute he started shooting? It was illegal to take a gun there. So the CC permit holders abide by the law and left their guns at home. Over the fence… Deja vu? I couldn’t figure out what your comment link referred to, but after going over that thread I see there was a what-if discussion had someone been conceal carrying. I was careful to write my comment as thus: if one person would have popped a cap in his ass the minute he started shooting? I didn’t ask what would have happened had someone just been carrying? That’s too hard to tell. They may have never had a clean shot, they may have been the first one to get shot, they may have ran out of the theater. That wasn’t my question. My question was, how long would the shooter have been able to continue on had he himself been shot? Not even a footnote. Discussing armed citizens successfully defending themselves is verboten. It ruins the narrative. . Whatever other influences we may discover in his background–his leisure interests, politics, philosophy, family (his mom wasn’t surprised at all) don’t explain it, as assuredly thousands/millions of other young men will share such interests or rough background. Her son had recently moved to Colorado to pursue a PhD, according to reports. Clearly, the problem is higher education. Metal detectors at the movies in 3, 2, 1, …. MannedPersonned by agents of the Theater Security Administration, of course. TSA Chief Counsel Office is working feverishly as we speak trying to figure out a way to explain how Theaters are part of the transportation system. Well, going to see a movie is a form of “escape”. Think that’s close enough? Yep. Also, anyone who needs to “escape” is probably dangerously mentally ill. There are roads leading to all movie theaters, John, so COMMERCE CLAUSE and Fuck You, That’s Why both apply. John give them a chance.My oldest son said something very similar yesterday. Holmes was a med student who dropped out a month ago. I blame Chief Justice John Roberts. No, Watson was the one who studied medicine. Fox News has a decent article with some eye witness accounts included. Wilburn and three friends dove to the floor, hiding behind seats in front of them. The gunman was only five or six feet away, he said. Once the shotgun was empty, the gunman calmly dropped it to the floor, took the rifle and went on firing. Wilburn heard roughly 30 shots, the Denver Post reports. Open letter to politicians: When you repeatedly make disdainful references to “the wild west”, I’d like to point out, that had everyone been carrying a gun on their hip (a la the fabled Wild West), this man would have died in a hail of bullets the moment he “calmly dropped [his empty weapon] to the floor, took the rifle and went on firing.” That is all. Dude you just never know now days whats gonna drive some one to go all Postal on ya! http://www.Full-Anon.tk If it’s not our guns they want to take away from us after something like this it’s our video games. Well they’ll only get my Grand Theft Auto the same way they’ll get my rifles: FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS! Can’t get mine Brian I sold them.I guess you can still do private sales in this country.

7.22.2012 3:30 PM  Early last year a senseless mass shooting played out in Arizona. And much like the reaction to that tragedy, journalists and politicians have begun to  jump to conclusions surrounding the recent murders in Colorado. Therefore, It seems appropriate to reaquant ourselves with a few simple rules from a 2011 ReasonTV post. Here is the orginal text from the video: Tragedies like the mass shooting in Tucson at a public event organized by Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) are horrifying enough on their own, but they also have a way of bringing out the worst in reporters and politicians. In fact, knee-jerk reactions often leave us with misconceptions and bad policies that stick around long after the healing has begun. And so Reason.tv presents: 5 Rules for Coping with Tragedy Approximately 2.45 minutes NEXT: Where are the Jobs? The Parallels Between Today and the Great Depression Nick Gillespie is an editor at large at Reason and host of The Reason Interview with Nick Gillespie.

        comment for any reason at any time. Report abuses. http://news.yahoo.com/calls-gu…..19718.html Puke-inducing, noxious pile of bullshit excuse for an article. What a fucking blast. I) “Gun control advocates sputter at their own impotence. The National Rifle Association is politically ascendant. And Barack Obama’s White House pledges to safeguard the Second Amendment in its first official response to the deaths of at least 12 people in a mass shooting at a new Batman movie screening in suburban Denver.” II) “”Everyone is scared of the NRA,” he said on MSNBC. “Number one, there are some things worth losing for in politics and to be able to prevent carnage like this is worth losing for.”” III) “Yet it’s been more than a decade since gun control advocates had a realistic hope of getting the type of legislation they seek, despite predictions that each shocking outburst of violence would lead to action.” IV) “In 1994, Congress approved a 10-year ban on 19 types of military-style assault weapons. Some Democrats quickly came to believe the legislation contributed to their loss of the House a few months later.” Where (on about 500,000 different occasions) have I read this shit? I love how it is the evil NRA like anyone would give a shit about the NRA if there wasn’t millions of Americans willing to vote to preserve the second amendment. These people just can’t admit that their policies are unpopular. I remember on 9/11 I could almost sixth-sense feel Brady-clowns ramping up with morbid glee for Big Mother gun control…until it came out box-cutters were the tools hijackers used. I think that much as anything put a sock in gun-control for this generation. Nothing gets people killed en masse like lambs to the slaughter than when they literally act like sheep. In terms of electoral politics, Harry Wilson, a Roanoke College professor and author of a book on gun politics, said violent crime has been declining in recent years and, “It becomes increasingly difficult to make the argument that we need stricter gun control laws.” Maybe that means we DON’T need stricter gun control laws, professor. The fact that this tragedy doesn’t have the public at large screaming for gubmit to do something makes me think there just might be hope for America’s future. What do y’all think of  this piece. The piece isn’t as horrible as I expected, but the comments are godawful. I think it summed up the tragedy cycle quite nicely, and ignoring the author’s apparent disappointment that no laws have been passed it was good read. As for the comments, I submit this beacon of ignorance: What about common sense regulation that would at least have the effect of reducing the carnage? In the Second Amendment “arms” is not defined. A lot of the Bill of Rights is written in general terms; they HAD to put trust in future generations to deal with situations as they arose. 50 caliber sniper rifles? 100 round drum magazine on the military style assault rifle the killer in Aurora used? 30 round magazines for automatic pistols? Can you see the insanity in allowing this? Anticipating the argument that they’ll get them anyway, I submit that control can be established if anyone convicted of selling them is put in prison until they rot. The founding documents outline how we will share power. When you stock your own personal arsenal it’s a statement that power sharing isn’t good enough. When the scary black man was elected president most available personal defense weapons and ammunition disappeared from the shelves. Was he coming to take them away? No. That was projection. Rank fear in the home of the brave. I died a little bit inside. Sadly, that is one of the more coherent ones. Again, maybe Reason should take its own advice in regard to police shootings. cant tell if serios http://news.yahoo.com/ap-sourc…..34899.html AURORA, Colo. (AP) ? The semiautomatic assault rifle used by the gunman in a mass shooting at a midnight showing of the latest Batman movie jammed… ————— That’s when I stopped reading. It reminds me when the supposes oxycontin plague was hitting the streets every reporter would refer to oxycodone as a “synthetic form of heroin”. What? Really? Reason staff excluded, reporters are too dumb to handle the responsibility of providing the news. Fuck man, can’t we just clone Radley Balko and staff the papers with the results. We wish, dude. There was some vapid dipshit on TV today trying to explain how “semiautomatic assault weapons have high-caliber chambering and are really dangerous military weapons.” He then dove into a lecture about how the US is the most violent country in the developed world because GUNS!HYSTERIA!SANDYVAGINAHURRR! It’s fucking stupendous that these people have any sort of credibility. And they’re going to keep coming on and on and on and on for weeks, since there’s a fresh tragedy to exploit. Also, some British guy was saying how in England, a man can feel safe in the streets, whereas Americans must cower and tremble because thugs are armed because LAX GUN LAWS. Do words like ‘knowledge’ or ‘fact’ even feature in their dictionaries? The comments to the story aren’t as bad as one would think. Not like a CNN story, christ. Here’s a good one: Those super high capacity magazines sound terrifying and are great for parting suckers from several hundred dollars but they almost never function in in real life. No surprise his jammed. True. Particularly the ones you can get on a grad student budget. Dollars to donuts this guy had never shot the AR with that magazine in it before, as that would attract a lot of unwanted attention at a range open to the public. I did some trembling this morning…it was before my morning caffiene however, so its hard to read into it. The dipshit’s probably never seen crime statistics for our respective countries, and how much more violent than ours his is. what, the English aren’t all Hugh Grants? Shocker, right? Not only are they the most violent in Europe, they also managed to surpass South Africa in the rankings. South mother-fucking Africa. The irony is shit-thick. Despite the fact that violent crime in the UK is several times what it is here. Want a mental assault for dessert? US Violent Crime Rate: 475 per 100,000 citizens (Year: 2003 http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/05cius/data/table_01.html ) UK Violent Crime Rate: 4,100 per 100,000 citizens (Year: 2003 http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/r…..lr1804.pdf ) That’s their peak in 2002-2003, still much, much, much higher than in the US either way. Also, some British guy was saying how in England, a man can feel safe in the streets Better to be stabbed than shot, eh? Only if you’re more likely to survive the stabbing. In fairness, an AR 15 is an “assult rifle”. I have always understood the term “assualt rifle” to not refer to it being automatic. But instead the term refers to a rifle that fires rounds in between a pistol load and a rifle load. Long guns that fire pistol loads are carbines. Long tuns that fire full rifle rounds are rifles. Long guns that fire an inbetween load are “assault rifles”. do any assault rifles (purchasable, not modified) still fire automatic bursts? I thought that all guns in sold condition on the market fire one shot per trigger pull. Is this correct? Unless you have a major federal fire arms’ license. Yes. so semi-automatic is a complete misnomer, because every gun would be semi-automatic then. so semi-automatic is a complete misnomer, because every gun would be semi-automatic then. Nope. Bolt-action rifles are good example of a weapon with nothing automatic at all. Pump-action weapons are another. And who can’t love some muzzle-loading Daniel Boone shit? Functionally, revolvers are ‘semi-automatic’ with one-shot-per-trigger pull. But anything ‘auto’ regarding guns refers specifically to bits and pieces of the gun using the gun’s combustion gasses to work the gun (eject cartridges and load rounds or whatever). Ok, so typical pistols (glock) are semi-automatic compared to a bolt-action or pump action gun, but the term semi-automatic always seems to act as a scare quote to get “automatic” into the conversation. A AR-15 is no more automatic than a typical pistol, yet are talked about in much worse terms. In a revolver, the next round is moved into the chamber by the shooter’s own muscle power, so it’s not semi-automatic. Even though in DA that’s all part of the process of pulling the trigger, of course. You don’t need an FFL to own a full auto. You need an NFA tax stamp, and the gun has to have been registered prior to 1986. If the gun was manufactured after 1986, THEN you would need an FFL, and you could only have the gun as a demonstration model and you’d need to have an active business of selling guns to the military and police. Wrong. You do not need an FFL to purchase an automatic weapon, just a lot of cash. And a background check. My understanding is that this varies by state. You know who else called them assault rifles? No really: The term assault rifle is a translation of the German word Sturmgewehr (literally “storm rifle”, as in “to storm a position”). The name was coined by Adolf Hitler[3] to describe the Maschinenpistole 43, subsequently renamed Sturmgewehr 44, the firearm generally considered the first assault rifle that served to popularise the concept and form the basis for today’s modern assault rifles. *slow clap* nice godwining. And general Naked, do you know what bay the Sturmgewehr an assualt rifle as opposed to a machine gun? The Germans looked at the results in combat and concluded that soldiers rarely kill anyone at long range. At the same time, carbines and submachine guns didn’t have quite enough killing power or range. So they compromised and came up with a mid sized load that was lighter than a full rifle round (enabling the soldier to carry more rounds) but heavier than a pistol round (giving the weapon better range and stopping power than a carbine). Thus was born the “assault rifle”. And an AR 15 is descended dirctly from the Sturmgeweh 44. See the wiki didn’t have that info, pretty interesting. And now that you say it it seems like such common sense but it took a lot of years for somebody to actually think of it. Another concept that plays into assault-rifles is the rounds-per-kill. In WWII, we were finding it took thousands of infantry rounds expended to actually kill someone. Make cheaper low-powered rounds and the kill-ratio stays the same. So you want to spray them (drive the bullet count up on one side of the ratio) hence auto and burst-modes etc. Plus, for the same number of rounds its less weight for Beetle Bailey to lug around – indeed lighter through the whole logistics chain. And the military’s bean-counters just love all that kind of shit. It requires select-fire capability, necessarily including automatic fire. Point is, these people know as much about firearms as they do about economics — that is, nothing at all. By some definitions yes. But I go by the traditional definition, which defines it by the round it fires. That’s never been the traditional definition, to my knowledge. Every definition of assault rifle that I can find includes that it must be capable of both semiautomatic and full automatic fire. So while caliber is important, so is function. Wrong! An Assault Rifle, as defined by DOD is a medium caliber, SELECTIVE FIRE individual rifle. “Assault Rifle” as you are using is a Brady talking point. Get with the program John. In fairness, an AR 15 is an “assult rifle”. I have always understood the term “assualt rifle” to not refer to it being automatic. But instead the term refers to a rifle that fires rounds in between a pistol load and a rifle load. Firing intermediate cartridges is part of it, the other part being capable of firing in either fully automatic or 3 round bursts. Some stronger suggestions; 1) Assume that all reports that come out sooner than six months after the tragedy will be wrong in every important particular. Such an assumption won’t be wrong often enough to matter. 2) Any legislation proposed in the wake of a tragedy will be either a long standing hobbyhorse that could not, for good reason, have been passed without a general panic or a badly written mess certain to cause more trouble than the tragedy itself. Often both. 3) Any politician who uses a tragedy to further his personal agenda is an unprincipled hack who should be separated from public office at the first opportunity. 4) In the wake of any tragedy will come a flood of self-appointed experts desperate to impress the public by taking the situation ‘seriously’; such people are seldom helpful and often a hinderance. They should be made pariahs. 5) Attempts to depict the victims of a tragedy as saints or the perpetrators and demons dehumanizes them and hinders any real attempt to understand causes and possible safeguards. People are not caricatures, and solutions that would work to prevent the intentions of an evil caricature will not work in the real world on real people. 1a) Editorials will be written by shocked, saddened, and dismayed pundits that would like to address the readership, not as a reporter but as a parent and as an American, to advocate for sensible, common sense, long overdue legislation so that one more child won’t have to die. If it saves just one child, it will all have been worth it. WE ARE ALL SMALL SCHOOLKIDS NOW. Speaking as a parent, and as an American I am shocked and dismayed at your flippancy during this time of crisis. The NRA is holding this great nation hostage and preventing sensible, common sense legislation that would have prevented anything bad from happening ever. I, too, speaking as a modern American parent of a small modern American child in modern America, wish to see my child protected by common-sense, common, logical, reasonable, logically reasonable, reasonably logical and commonsense streetsweeper assault gun cannon bans and hollow-cap assault bullet restrictions. Commonsense and sensible commonsense gun control child-saver legislation is commonsense and sensible. /IRL concern-troll eloquence Don’t forget those evil teflon coated, cop-killer bullets that are taking out the brave men and women in blue like the plague. The are especially bad when fired from a Saturday Night Special. what goes on on saturday evening that requires a saturday night special. You would think that most angering events occur during the week. On that’s got a barrel that blue and cold? Saturday Night Special No, it is not the Skynyrd song The term “Saturday Night Special” is a Racist take on the term “Nigger Town Saturday Night”. A phrase used commonly in the early 20th century by Police in the south to describe the criminal activities that occured, usually on Saturday when folks were drinking, in the poorer parts of town. Seems like Friday night would be more violent, but I never grew up in poorer parts of town, maybe they were too exhausted then. Then propose an amendment to the Constitution that would make gun control Constitutional. I am far more worried by people who think that the Constitutional Limits (whatever may remain) on the powers of the State should be ignored if they interfere with an emotional agenda. If Gun Control is so important, then treat it as important enough to justify the work necessary to pass an amendment. The Constitution is about 130 years old and not written in English. “Thou art ruffian infringed bear arms secure in their persons”, or whatever the hell it says on that silly old piece of paper, ain’t English, bruh. /Ezra Klein A) If you seriously can’t understand the English of the Constitution, then you should sue your schoolteachers for malpractice. B) What you posted isn’t in English, either, which reinforces point A) above. Note the /Ezra Klein tag. I wasn’t being serious. Ezra at his finest. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_IhX0v-lHg Ive said before that any “event” that leads to a change in the law should require a 1 year waiting period before the law can be voted on. Exceptions can be made for acts of war, obviously. Warty said it best. Any tragedy is sure to confirm all of my pre-existing biases and beliefs. Have a dose of Gail Collins brand stupid. Although her lamentations and tears are quite yummy. http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07……html?_r=1 Bad, just so so bad. Yeah Gail, you fucking hack piece of shit, anti-gun nuts are just like those black kids getting dogs sicced on them in the ’60s south. That is one thing that pisses me off more than anything: comparing your pet cause to an actual example of oppression. Hey Gail, why don’t you just come out and say that the NRA are nazis and that gun control advocates are the people they fed into the ovens, you ass of a woman. Fuck her and her stoopid face. Oh and it’s funny the anti-gun nut’s name is Mauser. One of these days some clown is going to homebrew a flamethrower and wander into theater/school/Micky-D’s and I wonder what the AK-criers will say about that. “BAN ORGANIC COMPOUNDS!” or “BAN HYDRAULICS AND PNEUMATICS!” or go for the Hail Mary and “BAN TOOLS!” I mean, where do you go here if you have the Ban it! gene? Yeah, you’ll have to wait five days and pass a background check to buy one of  these. “The mentally disturbec shouldn’t be allowed to buy matches! Common sense legislahuuur!” Exceptional. This level of developmental retardation should be an impediment to employment in media. Vapid prohibitionist sack of shit. She’s an ADA hire. “This is the only time you have the opportunity that people will listen to you,” said Representative Carolyn McCarthy, who has spent her entire legislative career fruitlessly attempting to do something about assault weapons that allow crazy people to easily mow down a flock of victims in a couple of minutes. Not sure if it was intentional, but if it is, the last sentence reveals Gail’s mentality. The people are sheep and they need a strong shepherd (like her) to tell them what do, or some wolf armed with an assault weapon will mow them down. Oh, and FEAR! DOOM! DESPAIR! She’s just like jesus. Congress has, in recent years, refused to consider laws that would ban the sale of assault weapons capable of firing 100 bullets without reloading, and declined to allow the attorney general to restrict people on the terrorist watch list from purchasing weapons. I didn’t know about that last one, but not in the way she expects. Considering that the watch list is completely managed by the executive branch with no oversight and no recourse to get off of it, not allowing anyone on it to purchase weapons would be an obvious violation of the 2nd amendment. But presidential candidates look at this issue and see the same thing other elected officials do: a rich, fierce, loopy lobby on one side, and, on the other, people with petitions, slogging along. Well at least we agree on one thing. Okay, so I was reading the wiki page on assault weapons, specifically the ones included in the ban and it says that one of the characteristics of a bannable gun was a barrel shroud. Why put that on there? Is is because they make the gun look more military-y?Did they think that someone might not go on a rampage if they thought they might burn their hand on the top of the barrel in the commission of their mayhem? Same thing with the pistol grip. The mind, it boggles. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v…..re=related Wow, that’s scary. I thought there was at least some sort of rational behind it. Guess not. There was a video out once (tried to find it on Ytube) where an instructor stands behind a table containing two guns of idenical make, one a hunting rifle (and not covered by the AW ban) and an obvious “assault” weapon (indeed covered by the ban). As he talks about the ban he moves the fire supressor, front handle, 30 round clip, retractable stock and bipod from the assault rifle and installs them on the hunting rifle, turning each into the other. Takes him abouit 2 1/2 minutes. It really isn’t exaggeration to say that the people proposing these sorts of laws don’t know anything about the thing they’re attempting to regulate or ban. They’re fucking idiots. On the contrary, the people proposing the laws know a fair amount. They count on the general populace not knowing much. They propose laws that sound like they ban military grade weapons (which are already tightly controlled) and include a scattereshot of characteristics broad enough that they can apply the law to just about any firearm they don’t like … and they don’t like any of them. Why do you have to pay $200 just to be allowed to buy hearing protection? Most gun control laws are completely retarded. That’s definitely a ‘watched too many movies’ law. They think that a suppressor makes the gun go ‘p’tchwee p’tchwee’ and inaudible in the room over. Whoa, found this gun it actually works almost like that. Neat. The sad thing is, it isn’t. Suppressors were regulated with the 1934 National Firearm Act (along with short barreled rifles/shotguns and full autos). It was actually an anti-poaching measure; or at least, that was the rationale. I’m pretty sure the only reason it has survived is because of movies, though. The real reason was there were all these G-Men who used to enforce Prohibition who needed something new to regulate. Actually, the real reason was that FDR was an authoritarian fuckstick who lived far longer then he deserved. The whole handgun “registration” law was a farce. Enacted to “protect” handgun consumers. What you received after visiting the sheriff with your new purchase was a “Safety Registration Certificate”. I scoffed at this after purchasing a Blackhawk .44mag and wanted to know how the deputy could determine it was “safe” without firing it. He said their indoor range wouldn’t handle the magnum load. I was ready to be outraged until I saw what you’re calling “hearing protection”. If you have to use an unusual definition of a term to make your point, it’s probably not a good point. You know Tulpa, you can be an outright dumbass sometimes. What the fuck do you think that suppressors were designed for? They’re essentially the same thing as a muffler for a car. Their original intended use was to protect the ears of the operator, plain and simple. Thus, they’re a form of hearing protection. Here are some old ads that prove my point: http://www.aacblog.com/wp-cont…..ont-pg.jpg http://rlv.zcache.com/vintage_…..2q_400.jpg Notice the emphasis on noise reduction and that these ads were targeted at target shooters. Hiram Maxim was the guy who invented suppressors. I think I’ll take his word for what they were designed for over yours, Tulpa. It should also be noted that several European nations, such as Norway, Finland, and fucking Great Britain, either don’t regulated suppressors at all (Finland and Norway) or only do so lightly. In Great Britain, they even encourage people to use mufflers for sporting purposes as it reduces noise pollution and the litigation that can surround it. That’s pretty stupid, Tulpa. Even in Europe, it’s considered rude to shoot without a sound suppressor. Yeah, and don’t forget bayonet lugs – that is another thing that the AWB banned. As if we really have to worry about drive by bayonetings. As I understand it, when they were adopting the list, Feinstein, in trying to point out a folding stock, said “the shoulder thing that goes up…” Those were banned too. The fact that it’s called ‘gun control’ should give you an idea of what it’s really about: it is not about making the country safer, it’s about creating a false sense of security for people who worship government. Liberals get off on being able to control the world using their favorite tool, government. That’s why most calls for gun control are from people who don’t know jack shit about guns and use ridiculous arguments. I’m wondering if we’ll find out whether Holmes was on psychiatric medications. http://news.yahoo.com/shooting…..19340.html Shooting suspect’s gun range membership rejected It’s annoying how they keep taking the same story and adding stuff on top of it and giving it a new headline. That said, I’d like to hear his “bizarre ? guttural, freakish at best” voicemail to the gun club. It was his voicemail announcement that the gun club guy heard when calling him, not the other way around. Probably doing some Joker thing. The Gun Club For no reason other than it may be the single best thing on youtube. I was THIS close to unfriending a batch of FB idiot commenters today, but gave it a rest. It is nearing the point where I literally can’t stand to read teh stoopid any more. I’d feel a lot better if I could put about 500 rounds downrange, but the gun club’s closed today….:( You could always “unfriend” people the old fashioned way. /sarc Dude. do what I did and just stop logging in to Facebook. 7 months ago. Ha! My progressive libtard fb friends would get eaten alive if they started spouting off in favor of gun control and by people who never participate in political discussions.Yankees,college faculty, Marxists, expats… no matter where they live now they all have some deep connection to The REAL AMERICA Dixie or they probably wouldn’t be people I’ve actually known. Quite a few are very pro-2nd amendment even if they are anti-private property. I logged in just to be sure The craziest thing I’ve read about the Batman shootings: http://www.naturalnews.com/036….._flag.html Actually the article makes some valid points. Ones I had been thinking since he surrendered and told the police his apartment was booby trapped. Why would a guy who just murdered 12 people (and to his knowledge possibly many more) suddenly get a conscience about killing his cops and neighbors with explosives he set specifically for that purpose? Kinda weird… How does an unemployed medical student afford $20,000 in weapons gear? NIH grants.I doubt he had more than $5k in that shit. The latest report I’ve seen (grain of salt) is that the tactical gear was an attempt to blend in with the SWAT team when they showed up. Supposedly the cops thought he was a “brother in blue” until one noticed something off and arrested him. This is some Alex Jones shit and it makes me laugh, but the whole way he gave up at the end and didn’t let the police blow up in his house is really inconsistent behavior. I usually agree that Alex Jones sucks… but this time is different. Just think that four years ago, if i said that the DOJ was giving thousands of guns to drug cartels you would have called me crazy.. Just saying. Approximately 2.45 seconds If only. the media is absolutely running with this. Fox is saying that violent entertainment needs to be banned; CNN and the rest of the goons say guns AND violent entertainment needs to be banned…. Remember this, Fast and Furious didnt pan out like the DOJ and Obama wanted it to. I fear the assault weapons ban is being dug back up by the trendies and soccer moms…it will be back in a few weeks *Northern Trendies All these incidents are just giving america a new direction and that is gun control. fact, knee-jerk reactions often leave us http://www.ceinturesfr.com/cei…..-c-27.html with misconceptions and bad policies that stick around long after the healing has begun. And so Reason.tv It really saddens me that not one single movie goer was carrying a firearm. Had jsut one person been carrying, they could have dropped that loser on the spot and saved lives. http://www.fun-anon.tk as Norma implied I am amazed that some people able to make $4245 in 4 weeks on the internet. did you look at this web site makecash16com What happened to masculinity in this society? In a room with probably a 100 or more men could not 2 or 3 of them said “We are going to take this guy.” The lives that could have been saved… Makes me respect what the Flight 93 people did even more. Completely different scenerio. On Flight 93, the assailants were armed with box cutters not guns. The passengers had a good amount of time to discuss things and plan their counter assault together, and they were unlikely to feel like their lives were about to end any second. In the movie theatre survival instincts kicked in and people did was natural, they tried to save themselves. Ayup. Nihlist has obviously never been surprised at deafening gunfire inside a room (regardless how large), nor heard the snap of a round close to his ear. This is a tragedy !

Oates confirmed that the suspect was James Holmes, a 24-year-old graduate student who had only one previous run-in with the law — a speeding ticket from October 2011. ""At this time we are confident that he acted alone,"" Oates said. Holmes' apartment has been booby trapped, Oates said, with various incendiary and chemical devices. Neighbors have been evacuated. ""It may be resolved in hours or days,"" Oates said, noting that they had several experts on the scene. Holmes did not resist arrest, according to the police chief. The officers apprehended him outside of his white Hyundai behiind the theater. It appears that he used four weapons during the shooting spree — two handguns, a shotgun and an assault rifle. The police could not yet calculate how many rounds were fired, but 71 people were shot, including those in a theater adjacent to the one at the center of the attack. He set off two devices to distract the crowd, which Oates described as containing ""some sort of irritant or smoke."" Holmes was outfitted in ballistic armor and a gas mask. Ten people died in the theater and police are still identifying their bodies. Two victims died of injuries they sustained during the shooting at nearby hospitals. Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper and Aurora Mayor Steve Hogan also addressed the media, telling the press that although the city and state had taken a blow, both would rebound.

              since Politico reports that the billionaire media mogul/mayor will host a fundraiser for Brown at his Upper East Side townhouse next month, one of the first such events he has hosted this year. Bloomberg typically backs several candidates each cycle from across the political spectrum. Bloomberg's endorsement of Brown is perhaps unsurprising, given Warren's aggressive stance toward Wall Street reform, a position that helped launch her political star. Bloomberg, on the other hand, has emerged as one of the staunchest defenders of the 
                        
financial services industry
, and tends to dismiss bank criticism as naive. But the Mayor's office insists that his Massachusetts Senate endorsement is not about Warren or Wall Street, but about Brown's willingness to buck his party on gun control. Bloomberg has been a longtime advocate for more restrictive gun laws, and is one one of the loudest voices on the issue in the wake of last week's mass shooting in Aurora, Colo. “If you take a tough stand and buck party orthodoxy that helps the City of New York, the mayor would like to support you,” Bloomberg spokesman Stu Loeser told The New York Times, dismissing criticism over Brown's high NRA ratings and lack of support for a new federal assault weapons ban. “The biggest reason the mayor is supporting Senator Brown is the senator’s help on one of our biggest gun issues: Opposing concealed-carry reciprocity that would let people with gun permits from rural states like Arkansas and Kentucky carry hidden handguns in New York City,"" Loeser said. When asked whether Warren's Wall Street positions played any role, however, Loeser danced around the question: ""If people say the challenger is better on X, Y or Z, it’s not a question of whether they are or aren’t. We tend not to entertain the hypothetical over the real.” For you For you"

Granholm says the public cannot wait on ""darn politicians"" to pass common-sense gun laws. Instead, the former politician is urging Americans to use ballot referendums to address the issue at the state level. ""It's time for a call to action, everybody, people,"" Granholm said earlier this week on her Current TV show. ""I'm just sick of this garbage too. You should be as well. ""We can not stand idly by. We can sit and complain about what those darn politicians are doing, or say words, or we can do something. But, we can not wait for the politicians. Do not wait.

If Tom Mauser can do it, if Colorado can do it, so can you."" Mauser, whose son was killed in a 1999 mass shooting in Columbine High School, in 2000 successfully urged the Colorado legislature to require background checks for buyers at gun shows. And in the wake of last week's mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Mauser is again calling for tougher gun laws, urging Congress to renew a federal ban on assault weapons and prohibit high-ammunition magazine clips. Authorities believe suspected Aurora gunman James Holmes used legally purchased firearms -- an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun and at least one Glock semi-automatic pistol -- to kill 12 individuals and wound more than 50 others. The White House confirmed Thursday that President Barack Obama will not push for stricter gun laws in the wake of the tragedy, choosing instead to focus on improving enforcement of existing regulations. Republican Presidential challenger Mitt Romney, who approved a state-level assault weapons ban as governor of Massachusetts in 2002, also said this week that he does see the need for new federal laws. Granholm, who continues to raise her profile as a political pundit, argued that voters in states that allow ballot referendums (such as Michigan) should take matters into their own hands.

2043808613,2012-08-15 00:00:00,Sheriff's office says: 'No known ties' between Parkland shooting suspect and supremacists,https://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/Sheriff-s-office-says-No-known-ties-between-Parkland-shooting-suspect-and-supremacists_165520128/,en,False,,22,Tampa Bay Times,http://www.tampabay.com/,"PARKLAND — A law enforcement official says he knows of ""no known ties"" between the suspect who confessed to a deadly mass shooting at a Florida high school and a white supremacist group. Lt. Grady Jordan is a spokesman for the Leon County Sheriff's Office in Tallahassee, where the white nationalist militia known as the Republic of Florida is based. RELATED: White supremacist claimed ties to Parkland shooter. His group has less than 10 members. Jordan said Thursday that his office has arrested militia leader Jordan Jereb at least four times since January 2014 and has been monitoring the group's membership. He says his office has ""very solid"" information on the group and ""there's no known ties that we have that we can connect"" 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz with the group. Nikolas Cruz legally purchased the AR-15 rifle used in the assault at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, law enforcement officials told The Associated Press. As the criminal case against the suspect took shape, the leader of a white nationalist militia called the Republic of Florida said Cruz was a member of his group and participated in exercises in Tallahassee. Jordan Jereb told The Associated Press that he had only a brief interaction a few years ago with Cruz, who came across as ""a normal Florida white guy."" The group wants Florida to become its own white ethno-state. Jereb said his organization holds ""spontaneous random demonstrations"" and tries not to participate in the modern world. RELATED: Nikolas Cruz, charged with 17 Parkland murders, legally bought AR-15 ""We don't really endorse doing the things he did,"" Jereb said. ""But at the same time, it's inevitable that people are going to go crazy because we live in an inherently sick society,"" he said, citing ""hyper-egalitarianism"" and feminism as some of society's ills. He also said Cruz had ""trouble with a girl"" and that he believed the timing of the attack, on Valentine's Day, was not a coincidence. Authorities offered no details about a possible motive, except to say that Cruz had been kicked out of the high school, which has about 3,000 students. Students who knew him described a volatile teenager whose strange behavior had caused others to end friendships with him. In a national address from the White House, President Donald Trump said he wanted America's children to know, ""You are never alone, and you never will be."" RELATED: 'It is a question of when': How Tampa Bay school districts are responding to Parkland school shooting He said no child should have to go to school in fear of getting killed. He planned to travel to Florida meet with victims' families, explore how to better secure schools and to ""tackle the difficult issue of mental health."" At no point did Trump mention guns or gun-control measures. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he wants the Justice Department to study how mental illness affects criminal behavior, to better understand how law enforcement can use existing laws to prevent school shootings. ""It cannot be denied that something dangerous and unhealthy is happening in our country,"" Sessions told a group of sheriffs in Washington. In ""every one of these cases, we've had advance indications, and perhaps we haven't been effective enough in intervening."" Other elected officials also offered ideas for reform. RELATED: The victims of the Parkland school shooting Republican Gov. Rick Scott said he's already told Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran that ""if someone is mentally ill, he should not have access to a gun."" Broward County Schools Superintendent Rob Runcie said ""now is the time to have a real conversation about gun control legislation."" And if adults cannot manage that in their lifetimes, he said, students will do it. Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel called for giving law enforcement more power to detain people who make ""graphic threats or post disturbing material online."" He would like the authority to bring them involuntarily to mental health professionals to be examined. Some bodies remained inside the high school Thursday as authorities analyze the crime scene, the sheriff said. The slain included a school athletic director and another adult who worked as a monitor at the school. RELATED: Bill Nelson calls for restrictions on assault weapons; Rubio focuses on 'deeply disturbed' shooter Thirteen wounded survivors were hospitalized, including two people in critical condition. Cruz was ordered held without bond at a brief court hearing. He wore an orange jumpsuit with his hands cuffed at his waist. His attorney did not contest the order and had her arm around Cruz during the short appearance. It was the nation's deadliest school shooting since a gunman attacked an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012. ABOUT NIKOLAS CRUZ: What we know about the Florida school shooting suspect Wednesday's shooting was also the 17th incident of gunfire at an American school this year. Of the 17 incidents, one involved a suicide, two involved active shooters who killed students, two involved people killed in arguments and three involved people who were shot but survived. Nine involved no injuries at all. Trump lamented in a tweet that there were ""So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!"" Two federal law enforcement officials say Cruz's rifle, a Smith & Wesson M&P 15 .223, was purchased legally at Sunrise Tactical Gear in Florida. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were briefed on the investigation but not authorized to discuss it publicly. FBI agent Rob Lasky said the agency investigated a 2017 YouTube comment posted with the screen name Nikolas Cruz that said ""I'm going to be a professional school shooter."" Lasky said the FBI did a database review, but could not determine the time or location of the post, or the true identity of the person making the comment. RELATED: Amid massacre, a story of courage: Reports say football coach stepped in front of bullets Ben Bennight, whose YouTube username is ""BenTheBondsman,"" posted a video Wednesday saying he had spotted the comment on Sept. 24, took a screenshot, flagged it for YouTube and called an FBI office in Mississippi to report it. He said two FBI agents visited him the next day. ""I knew that I couldn't just ignore that,"" Bennight said. The FBI called him again Wednesday within about two hours of the shooting, and one agent interviewed him in person, he said. Cruz's mother, Lynda Cruz, died of pneumonia on Nov. 1 neighbors, friends and family members said, according to the Sun Sentinel . Cruz and her husband, who died of a heart attack several years ago, adopted Nikolas and his biological brother, Zachary, after the couple moved from Long Island in New York to Broward County. RELATED: Florida Democrats say school massacre a call for gun control The boys were left in the care of a family friend after their mother died, said family member Barbara Kumbatovich, of Long Island. Unhappy there, Nikolas Cruz asked to move in with a friend's family in northwest Broward County. That family agreed, and Cruz moved in around Thanksgiving. According to the family's lawyer, who did not identify them, they knew that Cruz owned the AR-15 but made him keep it locked up in a cabinet. He did have the key, however. Attorney Jim Lewis said the family is cooperating with authorities and had no idea he was planning the shooting. He seemed like ""just a mildly troubled kid who'd lost his mom"" during the three months they lived together, Lewis said. Lewis also said the family was not aware of any other weapons in the gun cabinet he had. Photos posted in an Instagram account linked to Cruz show half a dozen weapons displayed on a mattress and a box of ammunition. Victoria Olvera, a 17-year-old junior, said Cruz was expelled last school year because he got into a fight with his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend. She said he had been abusive to the girl. ""I think everyone had in their minds if anybody was going to do it, it was going to be him,"" said Dakota Mutchler, also 17."

We've received your submission. AURORA, Colo. — Family members of some of those killed or wounded in the mass shooting at a suburban Denver movie theater want Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and other lawmakers to use their influence and move a $5 million victims’ fund out of the hands of a private group. They made the plea to have the money overseen by an independent arbitrator at a news conference Thursday that was markedly less emotional than one last month in which they demanded a say in how the $5 million is spent. Tom Teves, of Phoenix, whose son, Alex, was among 12 people killed in the July 20 shooting, said the families have learned that the Giving First will be able to keep interest earned on money in the fund and plans to spend some money on mental health care for victims. But the families want the money given directly to them and have local, state and federal dollars pay for all medical bills, including mental health treatment, he said. Teves said the families are working behind the scenes to help one another, such as reaching out to Habitat for Humanity to build a handicapped-accessible house for Ashley Moser. Her family has said she would be paralyzed as a result of her wounds. She also lost her 6-year-old daughter in the shooting and also miscarried. “There have been two tragedies in Aurora. The first was the theater shooting. The second is how the victims have been treated by the powers that be,” he said. The 7/20 Recovery Committee, which makes recommendations on how the money is spent, issued a statement ahead of the press conference saying that it’s committed to honoring the input of all victims, not just the voices of a few. “In fact, we have been and continue to actively seek input from all the victims injured and who lost family in this tragic event,” committee adviser Rich Audsely said. Fewer people stood with Teves than at the previous press conference, but he didn’t know many families were represented. Share Selection"

280938535,2012-08-24 12:00:00,The Mediscare Advantage,http://patriotpost.us/digests/14524,en,False,"politics and government,finances,united states politics and government,budgets and budgeting,elections,presidents and presidency (us),presidential elections (us),election issues,presidential election of 2004",25626,patriot post,http://patriotpost.us," Mitt Romney’s selection of Paul Ryan as his running mate made clear that the presidential race would not only be about what a lousy job Barack Obama has done but also about the future of our great nation. We welcome the choice, not least because it drives the Left absolutely batty. Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, knows the federal fiscal situation inside and out. Indeed, he schooled the president during last year’s debt ceiling negotiations and during the February 2010 bipartisan health care reform meeting. Not that Obama can be taught – he’s an extreme leftist Keynesian through and through. The campaign now will center on how to fix Obama’s abysmal record of setting a new spending floor with more than triple the highest Bush deficit and driving up national debt by nearly $6 trillion in his all-too-long three-and-a-half years in office. Ryan has a plan to put the brakes on this bullet train. It’s not a miracle plan that will suddenly restore constitutional boundaries to federal spending, and it’s certainly not a plan to “end Medicare as we know it” or to “dump grandma off a cliff,” as the Left would have us believe. It also won’t cost seniors another $6,400 a year, as Obama falsely claims. But it is a plan that will rein in spending growth and stabilize Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid for future generations. Ryan’s Medicare reform plan, crafted with the help of Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), provides a premium-supported private-insurance alternative for seniors that would introduce competition to drive costs down. One downside is that it doesn’t start until 2023, but his plan offers choice – something the Left purportedly favors. Obama’s record, on the other hand, is that he transferred $716 billion from the coming decade’s Medicare funding to hide some of ObamaCare’s massive cost. In other words, Obama and the Democrats are the ones “ending Medicare as we know it.” Then again, Medicare can’t continue “as we know it” – it’s going bankrupt and will take the country with it. It’s ironic and outrageous that the Left built the “fiscal cliff” we’re careening toward only to blame the Right for the consequences, all because we won’t stand for raising taxes or running up the deficit even more. There’s no doubt that Romney-Ryan can win in November. The only question is whether they can communicate their more fiscally responsible vision in a way that resonates with the American people and sufficiently rebuts the Obama campaign’s attempts to divide by class, age, race and gender. “The truth of the matter is you can’t just make stuff up. That’s one thing you learn as president of the United States.” –Barack Obama, who specializes in making stuff up  As readers are no doubt well aware, Missouri Republican Senate candidate Todd Akin completely blew it this week when asked about his opposition to abortion in cases of rape. “First of all, from what I understand from doctors,” he began, pregnancy due to rape is “really rare. If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.” Howls of outrage from both sides of the aisle quickly followed. Recognizing the irreparable damage he had done to his candidacy, Republicans of all stripes called on Akin to bow out of the race – which he stubbornly refuses to do – while Democrats will spend the next two months gleefully tying Akin’s bumbling statement to Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan and every other Republican on any ballot. It’s telling, but the only two people who think Akin should remain in the race are Akin himself and his opponent, vulnerable Democrat incumbent Claire McCaskill. Where to start? It should be obvious that “legitimate” and “rape” should never be used in the same sentence, unless one is talking about punishment for the perpetrator. We suspect Akin was trying to differentiate between forced and statutory rape, but it was a terrible blunder. Akin is sorely mistaken if he thinks a woman’s body can “shut that whole thing down” – pregnancy results in 5 percent of rapes. Besides, even if he were correct, his assertion makes no sense in the context of the argument because the number of pregnancies caused by rape is irrelevant to the principle. If one is opposed to abortion in cases of rape, which Akin is (as are we), the correct answer is that the child has a right to life regardless of the circumstances of conception. The death penalty doesn’t apply to rapists, but, tragically, that’s not true for the innocent life created by the rape. There are at least a couple of reasons why the entire kerfuffle is ridiculous. First, Akin’s position on abortion isn’t outside the “mainstream,” even if his reasoning is. On the contrary, the position far outside the mainstream is the one held by Barack Obama – the president supports abortion all the way through pregnancy, including partial-birth abortion, and has even opposed legal protection for babies who survive abortion attempts. Second, it highlights the chasm separating the two parties. Akin’s comments, despite his apology, earned him the scorn and vigorous opposition of his own party from leadership to grassroots. The National Republican Senatorial Committee says it will not contribute to Akin’s campaign, nor will various PACs, leaving Akin to fend for himself if he continues. Democrats, on the other hand, twice nominated and elected to the presidency an accused rapist. In two weeks, Bill Clinton, who also conducted an affair with a 21-year-old White House intern in the Oval Office, will enjoy a prime-time speaking slot at the Democratic National Convention, as well. Guess which man Democrats think stands for “women’s rights”? Unfortunately, Akin’s goof could cost the GOP the Senate, which in turn could cost them a repeal of ObamaCare. Akin should have stepped aside for someone who’s actually able to make a coherent statement about a fairly basic platform plank. Instead, he’s staying in for the sake of “principle” (read: ego) and will almost certainly go down in defeat. The Obama re-election campaign continued its single-minded pursuit of Mitt Romney’s tax returns this week, proving once again that the Republican’s private sector pursuits are more important to them than a substantive debate about the economy. Obama campaign manager Jim Messina sent a letter to Romney campaign head Matt Rhoades reducing their demands to five years’ worth of returns in exchange for a promise not to demand more information later in the campaign. However, there’s no reason to believe that Obama’s campaign would stick to that promise, and it’s highly likely that Obama surrogates in the media would continue to hector Romney even if he did comply. Rhoades wisely didn’t take the bait. Meanwhile, Republican vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan voluntarily released two years’ tax returns, revealing that he and his wife paid $34,233 in 2010 and $64,764 in 2011 in federal taxes, effective rates of 15.9 percent and 20 percent, respectively. No word yet from the Obama campaign about how unhappy they are that Ryan didn’t provide more information. Despite Barack Obama’s much-ballyhooed fundraising prowess, the Romney campaign has won the fundraising battle in each of the last three months. Obama quickly took to using the embarrassing numbers to cry poverty, but his campaign has burned through an astounding $325 million since formally announcing his re-election campaign last year. By comparison, George W. Bush spent $205 million by this point in 2004. No wonder Obama has held more fundraisers – over 200 and counting – than his five predecessors combined. True to his governing form, Obama’s campaign spent $10 million more than it took in last month, its second straight month of deficit spending. Much of that money – $48 million – went into a massive advertising push in battleground states. Obama’s team also employed 853 staffers in July, more than twice the number Romney had on the payroll. According to FEC filings, Romney now leads with $185.9 million total cash on hand compared to Obama’s $123.7 million. For all the money that Obama has spent, and all the people his campaign has taken on, one would think he would’ve moved the poll numbers more clearly in his favor, yet the race remains close – at least that’s what the polls would have us believe. Military veterans are organizing to protest Barack Obama’s use for political advantage of the Osama bin Laden raid and selective intelligence leaks. Obama brushed the criticism aside, saying, “I don’t take these folks too seriously,” a statement that we think reflects his view of members of the Armed Forces in general. To back himself up, he advised his critics to “talk to General McRaven, who’s in charge of our Special Ops.” Trouble is, William McRaven serves in the U.S. Navy and holds the rank of admiral, not general. At least Obama didn’t refer to him as a corpse-man. To further bolster his credentials as comrade in chief, Obama later added, “I’ve been criticized by some for being too vigorous in going after folks who leak information that impacts our national security.” His “vigorous” pursuit of leakers has yet to yield any suspects, however, and no formal investigation has taken place. The Obama campaign has indeed been vigorous in one way: vilifying veterans concerned about intelligence leaks, especially singling out on Obama’s campaign website organizations such as Special Operations for America and Veterans for a Strong America. John Kerry, whose questionable military record was exposed in 2004 by the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, shamelessly denounced veterans’ criticism, while leftist groups categorized U.S. Navy SEALs as “gutless.” Someone’s “gutless,” all right, but it’s not the Navy SEALs. Speaking of the SEALs, one of the members of the SEAL Team that dispatched bin Laden, wrote a book under the pseudonym “Mark Owen” detailing the raid. The former SEAL could face legal trouble, though, because he apparently didn’t clear the book with the Pentagon to ensure no classified information was divulged. The cozy relationship Barack Obama has had with the White House press corps is starting to turn ever so slightly cooler thanks to his extended inaccessibility. Just as murmurs were spreading, however, the president made a surprise appearance at the Monday press briefing, his first appearance in the West Wing since March. He took four questions and spoke for 22 minutes, focusing on trying to refute the charge that his campaign has become excessively negative. For example, he protested, “Nobody accused Mr. Romney of being a felon,” disregarding Deputy Campaign Manager Stephanie Cutter’s doing so last month when discussing the aforementioned tax returns. Rather than face tough questions about his failed economic policies in Washington, Obama has chosen instead to grant interviews to such journalistic stalwarts as Entertainment Tonight, ESPN and People magazine. Cutter went so far as to claim that these staged media appearances and the White House press corps are “equally important.” Despite the continued snubs, however, the media obediently continue serving as Obama’s lapdogs while yapping about their objectivity and the First Amendment. The character of the Democrat and Republican presidential candidates came into sharp relief this past week in two separate stories. The first, by writer Dinesh D'Souza, co-director of the documentary film “2016 – Obama’s America,” explores the relationship between Barack Obama and his brother George. The president, who religiously repeats that “we are our brother’s keeper,” remains estranged from his own half-brother, who lives in abject poverty in Nairobi, Kenya. When George Obama needed financial help to cover medical bills for his son who suffers from a chest ailment, he turned to D'Souza because brother Barack refuses to even acknowledge him. The brothers last met in 2006, but Barack never offered to “spread the wealth around” with George. Likewise, since becoming president he hasn’t provided any assistance to his brother – even for George to visit his own mother in the United States. The second story explores an episode from Mitt Romney’s time at Bain Capital in 1996. One of Bain’s employees came to Romney with the news that his daughter had gone to a rave in New York City and had been missing for three days. Romney promptly closed the office, traveled with the entire staff to New York, and beat the streets for several days until they found the wayward 14-year-old. These two stories speak volumes about the choice American voters will face in November. One man preaches from the supposed moral high ground yet remains deliberately aloof and turns his back on his own family. The other man values close relationships with family and community and is willing to give of himself to those in his charge. The man we choose as our next president will be a reflection not only on the candidates, but on us as well. It’s not the strongest law on the books, but the commonwealth of Virginia will be allowed to enact its newly revised voter identification statute this fall. Because Virginia is one of 16 states covered in whole or in part by a provision of the Voting Rights Act requiring federal approval of state election law changes, the fact that Attorney General Eric Holder’s Justice Department allowed this change on the eve of a presidential election indicates Virginia’s new rules weren’t worth the fight that may have ensued. The DoJ is already embroiled in contesting voter ID laws in South Carolina and Texas. Holder’s office may have given Virginia a pass because the state accepts non-photo forms of identification, including utility bills, paychecks, bank statements and government checks. Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell concurrently signed an executive order to send a new voter identification card to all active voters in the commonwealth. On the other hand, the new law eliminates the option of signing an affidavit to vote without any identification – those voters can now only cast provisional ballots, counted only after proof of identification is received. With Virginia considered one of a handful of battleground states, the effect of the new law will be watched closely. When a government check can be used as identification, the number of possible Democrat voters will surge to record highs. The next inspector general’s report on Fast and Furious is finished and soon to be released with one detail particularly noteworthy. Former ATF official Bill McMahon remains on paid leave from the agency while drawing a six-figure salary from J.P. Morgan, the investment bank. Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), who are heading up the congressional investigation, are demanding answers. “Given McMahon’s outsized role in the Fast and Furious scandal,” they wrote, “the decision to approve an extended annual leave arrangement in order to attain pension eligibility and facilitate full-time, outside employment while still collecting a full-time salary at ATF raises a host of questions about both the propriety of the arrangement and the judgment of ATF management.” Indeed, but that’s the story of the whole scandal, isn’t it?  Now that “Recovery Summer 3.0” is proving to be as much of a bust as the previous two – unemployment increased in 44 states in July – the Obama campaign/administration is scrambling to blame Republicans for the oncoming “fiscal cliff” that will occur if both the massive tax increases and federal spending sequestration mandated by the 2011 budget deal take effect. Meanwhile, the administration discovered unspent federal money that states have to “use or lose” by the first of October, conveniently in time for the election. The Congressional Budget Office, which admittedly is full of Keynesians that make faulty assumptions about taxing and spending, painted two different scenarios for 2013: One depends on raising taxes and cutting $100 billion in federal spending; the second preserves both the tax rates and current spending. In the first instance, the deficit drops to $641 billion but GDP growth slows to a negative 0.5 percent and unemployment jumps to 9.1 percent. On the other hand, keeping both tax rates and spending in place would leave the deficit at $1.037 trillion but the economy would creep along at a 1.7 percent GDP growth, and unemployment would plateau at 8 percent. Some choice. To help with Obama’s re-election, then, the administration issued an offer for states to spend $473 million in leftover earmark cash set aside between 2003 and 2006. “These idle earmarks have sat on the shelf as our infrastructure continued to age and construction workers stood on the sideline,” said Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. But the money won’t be available until the Department of Transportation approves the projects, so swing states and districts with vulnerable Democrats will probably be first in line to get the symbolic checks – the real cash comes much later. The earmark funds would be perhaps the easiest way to announce budget “savings,” but why do that when Obama can grease the palms of important constituents? The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia provided a mixed bag of results for the Obama administration’s job-killing EPA over the last week, giving the agency a victory in its quest to force E15 ethanol blend fuel on the automotive market but losing a bid to unilaterally set cross-state air pollution rules. A diverse group of automakers, grocers and other manufacturers asked the court to toss out the ethanol mandates but were denied only because, in the court’s eyes, they lacked standing to bring the case. Who are automakers, after all, to decide what fuel will damage the engines they build? Two of the three judges on the panel denied the plaintiffs’ standing, while Circuit Judge Brett Kavanaugh, a George W. Bush appointee, dissented. This leaves only Congress to void the E15 rules. Kavanaugh was on the winning side, however, in the cross-state air pollution case. This dispute pitted a number of Southern and Western states against a group of states mainly along the East Coast, a cadre that blames upwind states and their coal-burning power plants for the poor air quality suffered by those in the Northeast. Yet this three-judge panel threw out the EPA rules, citing the authority of states to enforce federal limits on pollution as they see fit and not under a blanket, one-size-fits-all EPA edict. Moreover, they ruled the EPA can’t force a state to do any more than its assigned share to remedy downwind states. With the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule vacated, the EPA will revert to the Bush-era Clean Air Interstate Rule.  U.S. troops in Afghanistan have endured an increasing rate of so-called “green-on-blue” attacks – “green” referring to Afghan Army forces, “blue” to NATO forces – perpetrated by disgruntled allies or Taliban infiltrators. Some 40 U.S. and NATO troops have been killed so far this year in such attacks, and they show no signs of abating. In fact, U.S. troops are still fighting and dying at a rate of about one per day in Afghanistan, while nearly 70,000 troops will remain in the country after Oct. 1. The primary task for U.S. forces now is to train the Afghans to handle their own security. There are approximately 350,000 Afghan security forces, but it is becoming increasingly difficult for U.S. troops to do their jobs with the rise in insider attacks. Yet preventing Afghanistan from again devolving into the terrorist breeding ground it was prior to 9/11 is still America’s foremost national security interest there. As it stands, however, many Americans – apparently including the commander in chief – would rather forget about the war than remain vigilant. Former U.S. Marine Brandon Raub, a veteran of both Afghanistan and Iraq, was detained (handcuffed and apparently not read his Miranda rights) last week and subjected to a psychiatric evaluation for Facebook posts he made referencing a coming revolution. There certainly may be extenuating circumstances, but short of a lot of additional evidence indicating this individual was an imminent threat, this arrest was outrageous. Yesterday, a judge agreed and ordered his release due to insufficient evidence. Raub subscribes to some unfortunate conspiracy theories, but if the FBI picked up everyone who bought into stupid theories, the entire Obama administration would be arrested for subscribing to those of Karl Marx. In related news, The New York Times reports, “Analysts for a Department of Homeland Security program that monitors social networks like Twitter and Facebook have been instructed to produce reports on policy debates related to the department, a newly disclosed manual shows. … [T]he 2011 manual, which was disclosed this week as part of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, lists a series of categories that constitute an ‘item of interest’ warranting a report. One category is discussion on social media networks of ‘policy directives, debates and implementations related to DHS.’” The manual includes a list of keywords that analysts may look for when perusing social media sites. Of course, only the dumbest “terrorists” are unaware of the DHS social network monitoring capability, and dumb terrorists are often self-solving, blowing themselves up while trying to make bombs. U.S. Army Maj. Nidal Hasan, the jihadi mass murderer who opened fire at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009, killing 14 people including an unborn child, has successfully delayed his court-martial – all because of the Islamic beard he grew once put in prison. Hasan has refused on six occasions to shave, arguing that his “religious” choice trumps U.S. military code. Prosecutors are seeking to have him forcibly shaved so that the trial can proceed, but the judge has yet to rule. Ironically, the same government that is providing Islamic meals for Hasan and tip-toeing around the beard issue is the same government that decided his shouting “Allahu Akbar!” while shooting innocent people was just a case of “workplace violence.” Enough is enough – Hasan should either be shaved or permitted to appear in court as the jihadi scum he is. Justice must be done. With Alabama as the latest battleground in the war over illegal immigration, a federal court this week upheld parts of that state’s immigration law while striking down other parts. The ruling is in keeping with the Supreme Court’s recent decision on Arizona’s immigration law, with the key difference that the court in the Alabama case ruled that schools cannot check the legal status of students on enrollment as this would be “a substantial burden on the right of undocumented school children to receive an education.” (You’ll find this “right” in the Constitution in Article – oh, wait, never mind.) Despite ridiculous court rulings, though, some states are still standing firm. Arizona and Nebraska, for example, showed they are unimpressed with the president’s recent “DREAM” executive order, announcing that they won’t accept documents stemming from the order to provide driver’s licenses and welfare benefits. On another note, 10 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents sued the administration to stop its DREAM implementation. Meanwhile, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has his own approach to illegal immigration – and apparently his own reality as well. Speaking at an immigration forum in Boston earlier this month, Bloomberg claimed “nobody has come across the border in a long time.” He advised would-be illegal immigrants that the best way into the country is to “get on an airplane, fly here, and overstay your visa.” He also suggested that illegal immigrants be “assigned” to a city, such as Detroit, where if they can survive for seven years without taking government benefits or getting arrested, they and their families should receive citizenship. In Bloomberg’s twisted universe, cracking down on sugary drinks and salt is more important than protecting our borders. Julian Assange, the founder of the government-document leaking website WikiLeaks, has been holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London to prevent British authorities from extraditing him to Sweden to face charges of rape and sexual assault. Assange claims that, if he is extradited, Sweden will then extradite him to the United States to face torture and execution for treason. Assange’s WikiLeaks published massive quantities of sensitive and classified U.S. government documents, damaging American intelligence operations and assets. Assange obtained the documents through U.S. Army Private Bradley Manning, who has been charged with a number of offenses, including communicating national defense information to an unauthorized source and aiding the enemy. In Assange’s London sideshow, on a balcony in the Ecuadorian embassy, he told supporters he was the victim of U.S. oppression and demanded that the U.S. “renounce its witch-hunts against WikiLeaks.” He called for the release of Manning, trying to position himself as a defender of free speech. Meanwhile, he and his supporters praise Ecuador, with its lack of a free press, for acting in accord with principles of international human rights.  After last week’s shooting by a homosexual activist at the Christian-run Family Research Council (FRC) in Washington, DC, sanctimonious leftists at the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) continue to call FRC a “hate group” for peacefully supporting the traditional definition of marriage between a man and a woman. In the SPLC’s (and Leftmedia’s) view, dissent from leftist orthodoxy warrants such labeling. As the SPLC refuses to admit any difference between violent groups and a Christian organization whose views on marriage and family are closely aligned with the majority of the country’s citizens, its “hate group” designation is rendered meaningless. It’s worth pondering why left-wing groups continue to demand tolerance of everyone else while they themselves practice the most intolerance against anyone with whom they disagree. Hypocrites don’t deserve what they don’t practice. In related and breaking news this morning, details are sketchy but several people were shot at the Empire State Building in New York City. Finally, in Norway, Anders Behring Breivik was deemed sane and sentenced to a period between 10 years and the maximum 21 years in prison for the mass shooting and bombing that killed 77 last year. Woefully insufficient, in our humble opinion. The media continue to perpetuate the myth that Breivik was a “right-wing extremist,” but that was easily debunked last year. A recent study by the Chronicle of Philanthropy yielded some interesting, albeit unsurprising, results: Those who live in Red states give more of their income to charity than those in Blue states. The study examined individual tax returns from zip codes across the country, taking into account both religious and political affiliation. The Chronicle also found a direct correlation between religion and philanthropy. Indeed, the New England states, which are among the most secular in the country, landed at the bottom of the list. Of course, most of the media outlets covering the story made a point of saying that wealthier people, particularly those who live among other wealthy people, give less. They even quoted experts who cited a “lack of empathy” among high earners, who become increasingly focused on themselves and “less attuned” to the needs of others. That conveniently echoes what the Obama campaign has been saying about GOP frontrunner Mitt Romney – that, because of his wealth, he is out of touch with the “average” American and especially the poor. Like so many of the Left’s theories, however, it’s been reduced to empty rhetoric. Romney’s charitable giving dwarfs Obama’s. In the years leading to his bid for the White House, Obama gave between 0.4 and 1.4 percent of his income to charity. Romney, on the other hand, gave 13.8 percent in 2010 and 19.2 percent in 2011. Ironically, his giving lowered his tax burden considerably and opened him up to class warfare attacks by the Left for supposedly not paying his “fair share.” It just goes to show that leftists are always very generous with other people’s money, but not nearly so with their own. It also reaffirms the generosity of those who live for something greater than themselves. People don’t need to be forced by the government to give to those less fortunate. They’ll do it all on their own – as long as they’re still employed. In a case we documented last year, Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri went on trial in 2007 for allegedly falsifying records for patients who had late-term abortions, among other things. Further, a bombshell erupted late last year when documents critical to the case were found to have been shredded by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment in 2005 – during the tenure of then-Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, who is now Obama’s Secretary of Health and Human Services. At first, prosecutors appeared to have a solid case against Planned Parenthood. But in November last year, 49 of 107 charges were dropped – including 23 felony charges – and 26 more were dismissed two weeks ago by Judge Stephen Tatum. The entire five-year-old trial stinks of corruption after prosecutors tossed the 32 remaining misdemeanor charges – which alleged Planned Parenthood broke state law on fetus-viability tests and illegally performed late-term abortions. In another twist, District Attorney Phill Kline – the original prosecutor in the trial – lost re-election to Steve Howe in the 2008 Republican primary. Kline now faces ethics allegations amid an effort to have his law license revoked because of his role in the Planned Parenthood investigation. According to LifeSiteNews.com’s Kathleen Gilbert, Howe “consulted unnamed medical experts who agreed with Planned Parenthood’s methods of determining gestational age, and that it was ‘reasonably probable’ that an unborn child would die if born at 24 weeks, and thus should be considered non-viable.” The move was praised by Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards who declared, “The message is clear. You cannot use public office to warp the law to advance an ideological agenda aimed at intimidating women and the health care providers they rely on.” There’s an ideological agenda, all right, but the gist of the story is: Nothing to see here folks, move along. A group of Muslims in Staten Island, New York, recently gathered for prayer to celebrate the end of Ramadan, but they were dismayed to find the park unfit for their presence. As New York’s WCBS-TV reports, “[B]efore most of the faithful arrived for Morning Prayer, it was discovered that someone had scattered a quantity of raw bacon on the field.” That, of course, was a job for the NYPD’s Hate Crimes Task Force (sadly, we’re not making that up). As Muslims are forbidden to eat (or apparently be in the vicinity of) pork, someone must have really been spreading the hate. As it turns out, however, the whole thing was a mistake. The Staten Island Advance received an anonymous confession from a man who admitted putting the bacon there. He explained, “It was going bad in my trunk and I put it out for the scavengers like the opossums and the raccoons and sea gulls, and I did not intend for that to cause anybody any problems.” On second thought, this crime really is serious. How could anyone let bacon go bad in a car trunk? Semper Vigilo, Fortis, Paratus et Fidelis! Nate Jackson for The Patriot Post Editorial Team Read The Latest Digest > Cal Thomas

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: DENVER—The man accused of opening fire on an Aurora movie theater told a classmate he wanted to kill people four months before the shooting, newly released court records allege. Prosecutors made the allegation in a motion released Friday seeking access to James Holmes’ records from the University of Colorado Denver’s neuroscience graduate program. Holmes “had conversations with a classmate about wanting to kill people in March 2012, and that he would do so when his life was over,” attorneys for the state wrote. The student wasn’t identified. That alleged conversation would have occurred at roughly the same time that police have said Holmes began receiving “a high volume of deliveries” at his home and at the university. Police haven’t said what those packages contained, but they said he ordered thousands of rounds of ammunition on the Internet. The prosecution’s allegation is the earliest report of a possible threat from Holmes, who was an enigma to many before authorities said he opened fire on a midnight showing of “The Dark Knight Rises” on July 20. Twelve people were killed and 58 were wounded. Prosecutors allege Holmes also made unspecified threats to a professor in June, the same month in which they say he failed his year-end final. University officials say he left the program after the exam. Holmes’ attorneys argue that prosecutors should have no access to his student records. It’s not clear whether Holmes’ attorneys filed a response to the prosecution’s allegations. Most filings in the case are sealed and none of the defense filings released Friday by the judge address the alleged threats. The prosecution motion was filed last week but not released by the judge until Friday, a day after a court hearing in which prosecutors first asserted that Holmes had made threats. They didn’t disclose any details about the threats then but did say that professors had sought to keep Holmes out of their labs and that “professors urged that he find another line of business.” A spokeswoman from the University of Colorado declined comment. Prosecutors and defense attorneys didn’t return calls seeking comment. Holmes’ defense lawyer, Daniel King, has said Holmes is mentally ill and was seeing a psychiatrist at the university, setting up a possible insanity defense. However, prosecutors are suggesting that Holmes was motivated by his anger that he was failing at school. Chief Deputy District Attorney Karen Pearson told the judge Thursday that prosecutors need access to school records to establish motive by showing what Holmes hoped to accomplish at CU and the “dissatisfaction with what occurred in his life that led to this.” They also want to see records from campus police and a campus threat evaluation team similar to those established across the country after the 2007 Virginia Tech University shootings. Prosecutors say they need the university documents to gain access to a notebook reportedly containing violent descriptions of an attack. The notebook was in a package Holmes sent to university psychiatrist Lynne Fenton. She is expected to testify at an Aug. 30 hearing.

Special Correspondent Lisa Robles was selling sightseeing tickets outside the Empire State Building when one of the tour managers shouted a single word to her. “Run!” His tone precluded questions and run she did with the manager on her right. A man from another tour was on her left. She only learned why they were all running when she looked back and saw a man in a business suit with a gun in his hand. She would later be told that the man had just shot and killed a former clothing company co-worker around the corner on West 33rd Street and stashed the gun in a black shoulder bag before trying to slip away in the Friday morning crowd on Fifth Avenue. Some construction workers pointed him out to the two cops who are posted at the building’s entrance as a counterterrorism measure. The man saw the cops and took the gun back out of the bag with a furious expression on his face. “All I know is he looked mad,” Robles says. She kept running as a flurry of shots erupted. She is from a part of Brooklyn where guns are still a plague even as New York has become the safest big city in America, and she has gotten to where she can distinguish the large caliber weapons from the small. “I hear it every day in front of my house,” says the 44-year-old grandmother of two. “That’s how I know.” And these were large-caliber sounds, all the louder in Manhattan, echoing off not just some Brooklyn tenement but off the world’s most famous skyscraper. “Shooting and shooting and shooting,” Robles says. The manager on her right was hit and he went down. She kept running and the man on her left also went down. “He hit the ground really hard,” she says. The shooting finally ceased, and she stopped running. She went back to check on the man who had told her to run. She knows only his first name, Alberto. “He saved my life,” she says. Only later did she learn that at least some or maybe even all of the nine bystanders who were wounded had been hit by police gunfire. Nobody can question the bravery of the cops who ran straight at a man with a gun who had just shot somebody. They certainly had every right to draw their weapons and fatally shoot him when they saw him point his .45 automatic at them, as is said by a senior police official to be unmistakable in the surveillance-video footage. And the cops are certainly not to blame for the escalation of firepower that led to their being armed with a gun that can fire as many as 16 rounds as fast as they can pull the trigger. That escalation goes back at least to 1986, the year a young cop in Queens named Scott Gadell got into a shootout with a man armed with one of the automatic pistols that were becoming all the rage among violent criminals. Gadell was armed with the six-shot revolver that was then standard issue with the NYPD. He fired the last of these and he had to reload by hand, bullet by bullet. He was still bent over his gun, his head bowed, when the man came up and executed him with an automatic pistol. Automatics kept proliferating in the street and that, together with the memory of what happened to Gadell, eventually led the NYPD to join the other departments in the country in abandoning the old six-shot revolver. Cops were thereafter armed with automatics that fired more than twice as many rounds and could be almost instantly reloaded just by pressing a release to discard the empty clip and putting in a new one. Meanwhile, the criminals continued to prove to horrific effect that the problem is not just the number of illegal guns but also the firepower. The result reaches public attention when a maniac uses a Glock in a mass shooting at Virginia Tech or nearly kills former U.S. representative Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson. But generally it goes ignored while entire neighborhoods live in terror of the sound of the big-caliber guns. “Loud!” Robles says. And with the criminals packing such firepower, there is no way to send cops into the street as outgunned as poor Gadell was that day years ago. Cops are trained only to fire when deadly force is absolutely necessary and then to keep applying that force until the threat is gone. The cops outside the Empire State Building did as they were trained to do with the weapons they were authorized to carry. Word of the shooting reached Mayor Michael Bloomberg at City Hall a few minutes after his weekly radio show, where he had once again spoken out for the need to do something about gun violence. His words on this day should have held particular relevance for the citizens of Chicago, where 19 people were shot from Thursday into early Friday, apparently all with automatic pistols. The city of St. Louis also had cause to listen after it was announced that two 18-year-olds had been arrested for the murder of a former college volleyball star who was shot to death in an apparent robbery attempt while he was attending an alumni function. Bloomberg’s feelings about illegal guns were forged when meeting with the families of shot cops in emergency rooms. He might have ended up going to see two more shot cops on Friday after the counter-terrorism detail at the Empire State Building encountered the everyday terror that rages on and on with no seeming end. But this time the cops got the gunman before he got them. The gunman, identified by police as Jeffrey Johnson, 58, could have shot any number of other innocent people if he had not been stopped; he had plenty of extra ammunition in his bag. Nobody is saying the cops kept firing when they should have stopped. The cops could even be said to have shown a measure of restraint. One cop fired nine times, the other seven, neither coming close to emptying his gun when an untrained finger surely would have just kept squeezing the trigger. In a twist not without irony, investigators deduced that many of the bystanders must have been hit by police gunfire because the gunman was armed with a .45-caliber automatic whose clip holds “only” eight rounds, half of what the popular street guns hold. The gunman had fired five shots at his first victim and still had two rounds left when he himself was killed, leaving at most one bullet that might have been actually fired at the police officers. Of course, the only reason anybody was shot was that the gunman drew that .45 automatic in the first place. Bloomberg addressed the press at the scene and noted that New York remains the safest big city in America. “But we are not immune to the national problem of gun violence,” he said. By then, Robles had been given the rest of the day off from work. She later learned that the men who were shot on either side of her might well have been hit by police gunfire. But she does not forget how it all started. “All I know is when I saw the gunman pull out the gun…” she says. In the evening, she was with her two grandchildren, the younger of whom was celebrating her fourth birthday. They had seen TV news reports of the shooting. “I told them, ‘I almost lost you guys,’” she says. “They didn’t really understand much.” Robles then headed to her home in a part of the safest big city in America where shootings are still common and seldom make the TV news, where a father this week lost a 17-year-old son as an innocent victim of guns and said he had also lost his brother as an innocent victim of guns back in 1988. That was two years after Gadell was murdered and thousands of gun murders ago. Robles went right into her house. She never lingers on the street. “I work and go home,” she says."

The Aurora shootings changed everything, he writes. I’m afraid to go to the movies. It’s a double whammy for me, since I pride myself on being a tough New Yorker and because I produce movies for a living. I grew up braving a pre-Disney Times Square, when its inhabitants were decidedly less PG than Snow White. New Yorkers think we have a sixth sense about our surroundings; when we get on a subway or cross a street, we’re hyperattuned to what’s going on around us. It serves us well in our home city, but perhaps gives us an unwanted air of paranoia and aggressiveness in, say, Hailey, Idaho. When terrorists did the unimaginable just a few blocks from my Tribeca office nearly 11 years ago, I swore—like many others—that it wouldn’t prevent me from flying or continuing to live in this great city. This is different. What those of us in the entertainment business had privately feared would happen for years—through changing technology and shifting sociological patterns—one lunatic in Aurora, Colo., managed to do through violence. Movies had always been a communal event for me. My earliest memories of classic cinema are going to Ferris Bueller’s Day Off and Back to the Future with my friends. In those quaint days, a new movie came out every few weeks, so the choices were much more limited. No VOD or Netflix or Hulu; it’s possible we took a horse and buggy to the theater, though I’m pretty sure the movies were in color. Then home theaters took off and suddenly everyone had huge screens at home. I remember a friend showing off his obscenely large new flat screen and a collection of DVDs, proudly proclaiming, “I’ll never have to go to the theater again!” The film industry panicked. Was this the end of moviegoing as we knew it? Along came handheld devices. Screens suddenly got smaller and people watched music videos, YouTube, and all manner of developing content on tiny screens. I sat next to a woman on a plane as she watched a movie I had spent two years making. I’m not sure why I’d bothered hiring a top cinematographer and sound designer since she was watching it on a 10-inch iPad screen and listening on her $9 Radio Shack headphones. Here at 35,000 feet, was this finally the end of the audience-theater experience? And yet nothing stopped it. Whether it was the adrenaline rush of an Avengers, the zeitgeist of The Hunger Games, or the raucous laughter of Ted, sitting in a packed theater experiencing something wonderful with hundreds of strangers was still the preferred way to watch films all over the world. Overall box office was up, and though new forms of distribution were appearing everywhere, movie theaters were alive and well. Until Aurora. A man in a crowded Colorado movie theater randomly executing a roomful of total strangers including women and children? This, to me, is literally the definition of incomprehensible. A month after that horrific night, 20 percent of the moviegoing audience is still fearful about returning to theaters, according to the research firm NRG. Sadly I’m no exception. I live within a few blocks of three great theaters in my New York neighborhood, but can’t bring myself to do what I’ve always loved. On a recent Saturday night, I went to a particularly popular multiplex to see The Watch (big Jonah Hill fan), but as I waited in the long line amid the usual chaos of a typical raucous New York Saturday night, I began to feel uneasy. There were a lot of odd-looking people—loners, hostile energy, pushing and shoving—was this the usual New York crowd? Or something more sinister? It was hard to remember what it felt like before July 20. Now I notice everything, completely missing the point of the event in the first place. Where once there was expectation, thrills, and joy, there is now uncertainty, dread, and fear. Is the violence of The Expendables 2 too cartoonish to get someone amped up? Even the audience for Ice Age now seems ominous, with all the kids running up and down the aisles. I know there are psychopaths in every walk of life, and there’s no logic to what I’m feeling. I remember back when airplanes felt safe until that was taken away from us. Are movies the new planes? Teens texting, audiences talking back to the screen, people eating loudly—it all seemed like harmless fun in the past, part of the strange and wonderful shared experience of going to the movies with a roomful of complete strangers. No more. I left the multiplex before buying my ticket and haven’t been to a movie since. I know it makes no sense and is cowardly. I grew up going to the theater, make my living creating movies for audiences, and wondered for years if that experience would be sustained. My confidence is now forever and irreparably shaken for reasons I never could have fathomed."

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: LONDON — After reveling in a rousing Olympic summer of sporting success, Britain awoke Tuesday, Sept. 11, to another major milestone: Finally, after 76 years of waiting, the country has a male Grand Slam tennis champion. 
Andy Murray’s five-set victory over Novak Djokovic in the U.S. Open final Monday provided the perfect bookend to a summer in which a British rider won the Tour de France and British athletes scooped heaps of medals at the hugely successful London Olympics and Paralympics. 
						
After losing in four previous Grand Slam finals, Murray outlasted defending champion Djokovic 7-6 (10), 7-5, 2-6, 3-6, 6-2 after nearly five hours to become the first British man to win a Slam since Fred Perry captured the Wimbledon and the U.S. Championships in 1936. 
At last, for Britain, the “Fred Perry curse” has been broken — although until Murray wins Wimbledon, it won’t be fully put to rest. 
“Thank God that’s over. Thank God we can let Fred Perry lie easy. Thank God for Andy Murray,” wrote the Guardian newspaper website. 
Fittingly, Murray’s breakthrough came in a year when Britain has enjoyed its greatest sports summer of a generation — coinciding with national celebrations of Queen Elizabeth II’s “Diamond Jubilee” of 60 years on the throne. 
In a message posted on Twitter, Prime Minister David Cameron said he was “delighted Andy Murray is continuing a golden summer of sport by winning the U.S. Open. A truly great victory.” 
The summer began with Bradley Wiggins becoming the first British rider to win the Tour de France. Then came the Olympics, where Britain recorded its best showing in 104 years with 29 gold medals (including Murray winning the men’s singles) and 65 medals in all. Britain celebrated the close of the Paralympics on Sunday after winning 120 medals, including 34 gold. 
More than 1 million people lined the streets of London on Monday to cheer the nation’s Olympians and Paralympians in a two-hour parade to mark the end of the 2012 Games. 
A few hours later, with most of the country asleep, Murray became the first man to win the U.S. Open and Olympic gold in the same year. 
“The forecast of course was made yesterday that the great summer of British sport was over, but he’s given us another immense prize to wake up to,” said Cameron, speaking outside his Downing Street residence. 
The victory came on the exact day — Sept. 10 — that Perry won the U.S. title in 1936. It also came in Murray’s fifth Grand Slam final, following in the footsteps of his coach, Ivan Lendl, who lost his first four Grand Slam finals before winning eight major titles. 
Nowhere was the impact of Murray’s win felt more deeply than in his Scottish hometown of Dunblane, a cathedral town made infamous for a mass shooting in 1996, when a gunman killed 16 children and their teacher in an elementary school. 
A noisy crowd of about 80 people packed into the bar at the Dunblane Hotel to watch the match that ended shortly after 2 a.m. British time, cheering wildly when Djokovic hit a forehand service return long on the final point. 
Murray did most of his tennis training as a youth in Barcelona but remains fiercely loyal to his Scottish roots. Two other famous Scots — actor Sean Connery and Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson — were among those in the stands cheering him on at Flushing Meadows. 
“Now Olympic and U.S. Open champion, Andy truly is a Scottish sporting legend and I’m certain that more Grand Slam titles will follow,” Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said. 
The end of the match came too late for many British newspapers, but Murray’s triumph made some late editions. 
“History Boy!” blared the tabloid Daily Mirror on the front page. On the sports pages, the Mirror launched a campaign for a Murray knighthood: “Arise Sir Andy: Grand Slam Glory at Last. Oh What a Knight.” 
British TV stations camped out early Tuesday at the modest tennis courts where Murray got his start as a young boy, interviewing youngsters who said they were inspired by his triumph. 
It’s been a long time coming. 
Murray is one of only two men in the Open era, which began in 1968, to have lost his first four Grand Slam finals — against Djokovic in the 2011 Australian Open, and against Roger Federer at the 2008 U.S. Open, 2010 Australian Open and this year’s Wimbledon. 
It was Murray’s decisive, straight-sets victory over Federer in the Olympic final in August on Centre Court at Wimbledon — less than a month after the Wimbledon defeat — that lifted his self-belief and provided the platform for his Grand Slam success. 
“Ever since he won the Olympics, he has walked around with a lot more confidence,” said Murray’s former coach, Leon Smith. “After winning yesterday, it’s going to do even more so now. For a great summer of British tennis, this is the icing on the cake.” 
Former British player Greg Rusedski said Murray can only go higher. 
“Having won this, he can go on to win many majors and maybe end the year as … No. 1,” he said. 
Murray is ranked No. 4 but is close behind No. 3 Rafael Nadal. Djokovic is No. 1 in this week’s rankings, with Federer dropping to No. 2. 
Also crucial to Murray’s success has been the influence of Lendl, the no-nonsense Czech-born coach who won two French Opens, two Australian Opens and three U.S. Opens. 
“So much confidence has come from Andy’s Olympics win and Lendl has added a great presence,” said former British player Roger Taylor, a four-time Grand Slam semifinalist. “There is such a similarity (between the two). It will have given Andy more belief to see Ivan go on to win many Grand Slams and it took him five. He (Lendl) has made a great difference.” 
For years, Murray has been considered just a rung below the “Big Three” of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic, who had shared 29 of the previous 30 major titles. Now he’s joined the club and Britain is rejoicing. 
“We are all delighted for Andy,” Wimbledon chairman Philip Brook said. “Winning your first Grand Slam has to be a very special moment in a player’s career and it was a fantastic performance in an epic final to cap a truly memorable summer of tennis for him personally and for British tennis.” 
Even more special would be lifting the Wimbledon trophy. In July, Murray became the first British man to reach the Wimbledon final in 74 years.

In a message posted on Twitter, Prime Minister David Cameron said he was “delighted Andy Murray is continuing a golden summer of sport by winning the U.S. Open. A truly great victory.” 
The summer began with Bradley Wiggins becoming the first British rider to win the Tour de France. Then came the Olympics, where Britain recorded its best showing in 104 years with 29 gold medals (including Murray winning the men’s singles) and 65 medals in all. Britain celebrated the close of the Paralympics on Sunday after winning 120 medals, including 34 gold. 
More than 1 million people lined the streets of London on Monday to cheer the nation’s Olympians and Paralympians in a two-hour parade to mark the end of the 2012 Games. 
A few hours later, with most of the country asleep, Murray became the first man to win the U.S. Open and Olympic gold in the same year. 
“The forecast of course was made yesterday that the great summer of British sport was over, but he’s given us another immense prize to wake up to,” said Cameron, speaking outside his Downing Street residence. 
The victory came on the exact day — Sept. 10 — that Perry won the U.S. title in 1936. It also came in Murray’s fifth Grand Slam final, following in the footsteps of his coach, Ivan Lendl, who lost his first four Grand Slam finals before winning eight major titles. 
Nowhere was the impact of Murray’s win felt more deeply than in his Scottish hometown of Dunblane, a cathedral town made infamous for a mass shooting in 1996, when a gunman killed 16 children and their teacher in an elementary school. 
A noisy crowd of about 80 people packed into the bar at the Dunblane Hotel to watch the match that ended shortly after 2 a.m. British time, cheering wildly when Djokovic hit a forehand service return long on the final point. 
Murray did most of his tennis training as a youth in Barcelona but remains fiercely loyal to his Scottish roots. Two other famous Scots — actor Sean Connery and Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson — were among those in the stands cheering him on at Flushing Meadows. 
“Now Olympic and U.S. Open champion, Andy truly is a Scottish sporting legend and I’m certain that more Grand Slam titles will follow,” Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said. 
The end of the match came too late for many British newspapers, but Murray’s triumph made some late editions. 
“History Boy!” blared the tabloid Daily Mirror on the front page. On the sports pages, the Mirror launched a campaign for a Murray knighthood: “Arise Sir Andy: Grand Slam Glory at Last. Oh What a Knight.” 
British TV stations camped out early Tuesday at the modest tennis courts where Murray got his start as a young boy, interviewing youngsters who said they were inspired by his triumph. 
It’s been a long time coming. 
Murray is one of only two men in the Open era, which began in 1968, to have lost his first four Grand Slam finals — against Djokovic in the 2011 Australian Open, and against Roger Federer at the 2008 U.S. Open, 2010 Australian Open and this year’s Wimbledon. 
It was Murray’s decisive, straight-sets victory over Federer in the Olympic final in August on Centre Court at Wimbledon — less than a month after the Wimbledon defeat — that lifted his self-belief and provided the platform for his Grand Slam success. 
“Ever since he won the Olympics, he has walked around with a lot more confidence,” said Murray’s former coach, Leon Smith. “After winning yesterday, it’s going to do even more so now. For a great summer of British tennis, this is the icing on the cake.” 
Former British player Greg Rusedski said Murray can only go higher. 
“Having won this, he can go on to win many majors and maybe end the year as … No. 1,” he said. 
Murray is ranked No. 4 but is close behind No. 3 Rafael Nadal. Djokovic is No. 1 in this week’s rankings, with Federer dropping to No. 2. 
Also crucial to Murray’s success has been the influence of Lendl, the no-nonsense Czech-born coach who won two French Opens, two Australian Opens and three U.S. Opens. 
“So much confidence has come from Andy’s Olympics win and Lendl has added a great presence,” said former British player Roger Taylor, a four-time Grand Slam semifinalist. “There is such a similarity (between the two). It will have given Andy more belief to see Ivan go on to win many Grand Slams and it took him five. He (Lendl) has made a great difference.” 
For years, Murray has been considered just a rung below the “Big Three” of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic, who had shared 29 of the previous 30 major titles. Now he’s joined the club and Britain is rejoicing. 
“We are all delighted for Andy,” Wimbledon chairman Philip Brook said. “Winning your first Grand Slam has to be a very special moment in a player’s career and it was a fantastic performance in an epic final to cap a truly memorable summer of tennis for him personally and for British tennis.” 
Even more special would be lifting the Wimbledon trophy. In July, Murray became the first British man to reach the Wimbledon final in 74 years. 
The pursuit of Fred Perry is not quite over. “Thank God that’s over. Thank God we can let Fred Perry lie easy. Thank God for Andy Murray,” wrote the Guardian newspaper website.

Murray is ranked No. 4 but is close behind No. 3 Rafael Nadal. Djokovic is No. 1 in this week’s rankings, with Federer dropping to No. 2. 
Also crucial to Murray’s success has been the influence of Lendl, the no-nonsense Czech-born coach who won two French Opens, two Australian Opens and three U.S. Opens. 
“So much confidence has come from Andy’s Olympics win and Lendl has added a great presence,” said former British player Roger Taylor, a four-time Grand Slam semifinalist. “There is such a similarity (between the two). It will have given Andy more belief to see Ivan go on to win many Grand Slams and it took him five. He (Lendl) has made a great difference.” 
For years, Murray has been considered just a rung below the “Big Three” of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic, who had shared 29 of the previous 30 major titles. Now he’s joined the club and Britain is rejoicing. 
“We are all delighted for Andy,” Wimbledon chairman Philip Brook said. “Winning your first Grand Slam has to be a very special moment in a player’s career and it was a fantastic performance in an epic final to cap a truly memorable summer of tennis for him personally and for British tennis.” 
Even more special would be lifting the Wimbledon trophy. In July, Murray became the first British man to reach the Wimbledon final in 74 years. 
The pursuit of Fred Perry is not quite over. “The forecast of course was made yesterday that the great summer of British sport was over, but he’s given us another immense prize to wake up to,” said Cameron, speaking outside his Downing Street residence. 
The victory came on the exact day — Sept. 10 — that Perry won the U.S. title in 1936. It also came in Murray’s fifth Grand Slam final, following in the footsteps of his coach, Ivan Lendl, who lost his first four Grand Slam finals before winning eight major titles. 
Nowhere was the impact of Murray’s win felt more deeply than in his Scottish hometown of Dunblane, a cathedral town made infamous for a mass shooting in 1996, when a gunman killed 16 children and their teacher in an elementary school. 
A noisy crowd of about 80 people packed into the bar at the Dunblane Hotel to watch the match that ended shortly after 2 a.m. British time, cheering wildly when Djokovic hit a forehand service return long on the final point. 
Murray did most of his tennis training as a youth in Barcelona but remains fiercely loyal to his Scottish roots. Two other famous Scots — actor Sean Connery and Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson — were among those in the stands cheering him on at Flushing Meadows. 
“Now Olympic and U.S. Open champion, Andy truly is a Scottish sporting legend and I’m certain that more Grand Slam titles will follow,” Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said. 
The end of the match came too late for many British newspapers, but Murray’s triumph made some late editions. 
“History Boy!” blared the tabloid Daily Mirror on the front page. On the sports pages, the Mirror launched a campaign for a Murray knighthood: “Arise Sir Andy: Grand Slam Glory at Last. Oh What a Knight.” 
British TV stations camped out early Tuesday at the modest tennis courts where Murray got his start as a young boy, interviewing youngsters who said they were inspired by his triumph. 
It’s been a long time coming. 
Murray is one of only two men in the Open era, which began in 1968, to have lost his first four Grand Slam finals — against Djokovic in the 2011 Australian Open, and against Roger Federer at the 2008 U.S. Open, 2010 Australian Open and this year’s Wimbledon. 
It was Murray’s decisive, straight-sets victory over Federer in the Olympic final in August on Centre Court at Wimbledon — less than a month after the Wimbledon defeat — that lifted his self-belief and provided the platform for his Grand Slam success. 
“Ever since he won the Olympics, he has walked around with a lot more confidence,” said Murray’s former coach, Leon Smith. “After winning yesterday, it’s going to do even more so now. For a great summer of British tennis, this is the icing on the cake.” 
Former British player Greg Rusedski said Murray can only go higher.

“We are all delighted for Andy,” Wimbledon chairman Philip Brook said. “Winning your first Grand Slam has to be a very special moment in a player’s career and it was a fantastic performance in an epic final to cap a truly memorable summer of tennis for him personally and for British tennis.” 
Even more special would be lifting the Wimbledon trophy. In July, Murray became the first British man to reach the Wimbledon final in 74 years. 
The pursuit of Fred Perry is not quite over. Murray is one of only two men in the Open era, which began in 1968, to have lost his first four Grand Slam finals — against Djokovic in the 2011 Australian Open, and against Roger Federer at the 2008 U.S. Open, 2010 Australian Open and this year’s Wimbledon. 
It was Murray’s decisive, straight-sets victory over Federer in the Olympic final in August on Centre Court at Wimbledon — less than a month after the Wimbledon defeat — that lifted his self-belief and provided the platform for his Grand Slam success. 
“Ever since he won the Olympics, he has walked around with a lot more confidence,” said Murray’s former coach, Leon Smith. “After winning yesterday, it’s going to do even more so now. For a great summer of British tennis, this is the icing on the cake.” 
Former British player Greg Rusedski said Murray can only go higher. 
“Having won this, he can go on to win many majors and maybe end the year as … No. 1,” he said. 
Murray is ranked No. 4 but is close behind No. 3 Rafael Nadal. Djokovic is No. 1 in this week’s rankings, with Federer dropping to No. 2. 
Also crucial to Murray’s success has been the influence of Lendl, the no-nonsense Czech-born coach who won two French Opens, two Australian Opens and three U.S. Opens. 
“So much confidence has come from Andy’s Olympics win and Lendl has added a great presence,” said former British player Roger Taylor, a four-time Grand Slam semifinalist. “There is such a similarity (between the two). It will have given Andy more belief to see Ivan go on to win many Grand Slams and it took him five. He (Lendl) has made a great difference.”

A poll conducted by The Denver Post shows residents by a 56 percent-to-39 percent margin say the state should protect the rights of gun owners rather than controlling their purchase.
Advertisement Men surveyed were nearly twice as likely to support gun ownership rather than gun control. Women were more evenly split on the issue, the poll found. The poll, conducted by The Post and Survey USA, was roughly in line with national opinions on the issue, the newspaper said. The issue largely cut along partisan lines, with 79 percent of Republican respondents favoring gun owners' rights and opposing gun control. Just 29 percent of Democrats agreed. The poll comes weeks after accused gunman James Holmes opened fire in a mass shooting in an Aurora, Colo., movie theater. Holmes is accused of killing 12 people and injuring 58 more."

""(T)here's not a liberal America and a conservative America; there's the United States of America,"" a little-known Illinois state senator named Barack Obama declared as he gave the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston. ""There's not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there's the United States of America."" Obama's rousing speech helped to introduce him to Democratic loyalists and lay the groundwork for his long-shot bid for the White House in 2008. With both parties set to hold their conventions in the next few weeks, the political world will be watching to see who, if anyone, breaks out to become the next rising Democratic or Republican star. Drama is rare in modern conventions Will it be the high profile Cuban-American senator from Florida who was on Mitt Romney's vice presidential short list? Could the law professor-turned-consumer-rights-advocate-turned-Senate-candidate in Massachusetts break out? And what about the young, Latino mayor of San Antonio or the senator from Kentucky who is the son of Rep. Ron Paul? 'We need (a) Moses now because we're in the desert' Republican strategist Alex Castellanos says the next breakout GOP star should be a speaker who focuses not so much on policy but on vision, conviction, leadership, an orientation toward the future, and the establishment of an emotional connection with the audience. In other words, the next big GOP star must have what pundits frequently call ""the vision thing."" Rare opportunity for speakers at GOP convention Castellanos, a CNN contributor who was also the chief media consultant for Mitt Romney's 2008 presidential campaign, says the GOP is longing for someone who can paint a vision of a brighter future built on Republican principles -- someone who, in Castellanos' words, can compellingly deliver the message, ""Follow me. There's a better place."" ""We need (a) Moses now because we are in the desert,"" the GOP strategist says. ""We're stuck. We don't know where we're going."" REPUBLICANS Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida: Even though he already has a substantial national profile, Rubio is the best bet to have an Obama-like performance at the GOP convention, Castellanos says. Elected with support from the tea party movement, a Latino and a fluent Spanish speaker, Rubio is from an important battleground state and the son of immigrant parents. He seems tailor-made to help the GOP speak to the nation about a brighter future under Republican stewardship. ""He's the future of the party,"" Castellanos says. ""I'd keep an eye on him. ... He's the real thing. He has that gift."" Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky: A fiscal conservative who is beloved by the tea party movement and the son of Ron Paul, Rand Paul also has potential to make a splash on the national stage, according to Castellanos. In particular, the freshman senator appeals to conservatives and libertarians who want to shrink the size, scope and power of the federal government. Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire: Another tea party favorite from a battleground state, Ayotte was one of the few women believed to be on Romney's short list of vice presidential prospects. ""She has tremendous potential,"" Castellanos says, ""She could be your dark horse."" Congressional candidate Mia Love: Black, Mormon and fiscally conservative, Love is an unlikely candidate to be the new face of the Grand Old Party.  But the mayor of Saratoga Springs, Utah, is greatly loved by tea party activists and by conservative women. Love is running to represent Utah's 4th Congressional District. If elected, she'd be the first black Republican woman in Congress' lower chamber. Love is aware but resolute about her unique status in the GOP. ""There are a lot of people who have tried to define me as a person,"" Love, the daughter of Haitian immigrants, told CNN in May. ""I'm not a victim, and I don't allow anybody to put me in a box."" 'Someone who can electrify the hall' Raw political talent is the first and most important criterion in picking a keynote speaker and doling out other prime-time speaking slots during a convention, according to Democratic strategist Paul Begala. ""You're looking for someone who can electrify the hall and speak to the people back home,"" says Begala, a CNN contributor. Begala also highlighted a speaker's ability to address important themes. ""I want someone who can stand up there and talk about the middle-class American dream and how that dream persists because of the Democratic Party,"" Begala says, adding that the November election could well be decided based on whom voters believe is doing the most to support the middle class. DEMOCRATS Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren: The Democratic Senate candidate in Massachusetts would seem to be the perfect messenger to deliver her party's message about tackling income inequality. ""Nobody fought harder for Wall Street reform, the reform that is now law and protecting consumers all across the country, than Elizabeth,"" Obama said after Warren introduced him at a June campaign event. ""She has been a fierce advocate since before I knew her for the middle class, and she has been advocating on core issues that matter to families her entire career."" Begala says, ""What she has is, I think, a very deep sense of how real people are affected by the economy. She's not just talking about abstractions."" San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro: Castro has been tapped to give the keynote address at the Democratic convention.  Although he isn't well-known nationally, fellow Texan Begala says the mayor is known back in the Lone Star State. ""Everybody's been talking about him for a while,"" Begala says of Castro's reputation in Texas. Castro is the first Latino to deliver the Democratic keynote, according to convention organizers. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper: Before the recent Colorado wildfires and the mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, the state's Democratic governor was already one to watch. Hickenlooper is the highly regarded governor of a battleground state with a background as a small business owner. Colorado governor: Questions about Romney taxes 'almost visceral' California Attorney General Kamala Harris: California's chief law enforcement official is another one to watch, according to Begala. ""I've been really impressed with her,"" the Democratic strategist says, adding that Harris has the needed combination of raw political talent and substantive knowledge to become a figure on the national political scene."

Prosecutors: Theater shooting suspect told classmate he wanted to kill people Teves led a group he said represented 11 of the 12 people who died in the July 20 mass shooting in a news conference in Denver Tuesday afternoon. ""We're certain that everyone who donated their hard-earned wages intended for 100% of the donations to go directly to the victims and then each family affected would use those funds for what they most needed to help their healing process,"" Teves told reporters.  ""Unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case."" The only disbursements have been to 10 local nonprofit groups, including the Colorado Organization for Victim Assistance, also known as COVA, he said. ""When you generate funds for a relief fund called the Aurora Victims Relief Fund, using pictures and names of our murdered loved ones without our permission, it would stand to reason that the fund is for the victims of the Aurora shooting,"" he said. COVA sent checks for $5,000 to each of the 70 victims' families last week, but Chantel Blunk, whose husband Jonathan Blunk was among the dead, said the money is not enough to help her deal with the trauma to her son and daughter, ages 2 and 4. When she asked COVA to buy a plane ticket for her daughter Haley to travel from Reno, Nevada, to Denver, ""They told me 'No,'"" Blunk said.  ""They're like 'There's no more funding and we can't help you."" Judge orders key records sealed, other released Haley has been suffering nightmares and the trip to where her father died might help her find ""closure,"" Blunk said. ""Begging COVA, they just told me 'No,'"" she said.  ""She didn't say sorry or anything."" COVA did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. The families demand ""a robust voice"" on the committee that decides where the money goes, Teves said. Cheryl Haggstrom, Community First Foundation executive vice president, said there has been ""conversation"" about adding family representatives to the committee. Teves called on the governor to intervene, suggesting he has ignored their pleas for help. ""You came and grieved with our families,"" Teves said.  ""We allowed you into our inner-most circle at the worst time in our lives, we didn't do this lightly.  You pledged 12 times 'We will remember.'  Are you a man who is true to his words or are they just words?"" Hickenlooper's spokesman, Eric Brown, told CNN Tuesday afternoon that his office is working to ""improve communication and the ongoing distribution of assistance."" ""Everyone involved is trying to do the right thing in a very difficult situation,"" Brown said. ""We understand the frustration shared today by victims' families. That's why we have been advocating for them to have a greater voice in the process. Family representatives will meet with the relief funds committee on Friday, Brown said. ""Families have received money and other services through the great generosity of others, "" Brown said.  ""They will receive more."" When Hickenlooper's office announced the fund last month, he promised the money would ""help those impacted by this tragedy begin to recover and rebuild their lives."" Initial donors included Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures, co-producers of ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" which was playing in the movie theater when the shooting began. Sources at Warner Bros. studios, a subsidiary of CNN's parent company Time Warner, told CNN that the company made a ""substantial"" donation. Warner Bros., a subsidiary of CNN's parent company Time Warner, would not divulge how much money it was giving out of what the sources said was respect for the victims. The Community First Foundation website said that contributions would go toward meeting the needs of the shooting victims and their families, ""and, as funds are available, the broad needs of those affected in the community.""

Gabrielle Giffords and killed six others met Wednesday with Attorney General Eric Holder to seek his support for stricter enforcement of gun sale checks and tighter requirements on gun sales. The group of survivors from the Tucson, Arizona, shooting is working with New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and others with Mayors Against Illegal Guns to combat gun violence. Ken Dorushka, one of the survivors, said Holder ""seemed to be very supportive of what we're trying to do."" The Arizona contingent hopes to get President Obama and Gov. Mitt Romney to present plans for ending gun violence.  Neither party has wanted to discuss gun violence during the campaign. Dorushka acknowledged the National Rifle Association has enormous political clout, and his group faces an uphill task. The Justice Department confirmed the attorney general met with the group  for about an hour, but would not discuss what was talked about.  The Arizona delegation submitted to Holder hundreds of thousands of signatures in support of the campaign. ""The meeting was positive and constructive,"" said Holder spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler. The group of survivors who met with Holder did not include Giffords, but did include Roxanna Green, the mother of 9-year-old  Christina-Taylor Green who was killed in the  January 8, 2011, shooting spree. Jared Lee Loughner has pleaded guilty in the shooting. 19 months after mass shooting, ex-Rep. Giffords moves back to Tuscon Also among the survivors in the delegation was Bill Badger, who like Giffords was shot in the head. Badger was able to knock Loughner to the ground and helped hold him down until police arrived. The group supports the Fix Gun Check program pushed by Sen. Charles Schumer of New York. The program calls for closing the ""gun show loophole,"" which gun control advocates have long demanded.  Dorushka said an estimated 40% of gun sales occur at gun shows, flea markets and backyard sales, where unlicensed gun dealers are not required to perform background checks on prospective purchasers. Giffords continues a slow recovery at home.  She resigned her congressional seat on July 25.  Loughner pleaded guilty in a deal with federal prosecutors to 19 counts of murder and attempted murder. He will not receive the death penalty, but is expected to serve life in prison after he is formally sentenced on November 15."

The incident came as the first group of miners was released from custody following the Lonmin platinum mine massacre, in which police gunned down 34 of their colleagues.  Rubber bullets and tear gas were used against about 60 mineworkers at the Gold One mine at Modder East near Johannesburg. Police said they were trying to disperse a group of about 200 sacked mineworkers who were attacking reinstated colleagues. Gold One said an illegal blockade began at around 6.30am, preventing about half of its employees from returning to work. ""The group did not present any memorandum of demands,"" a spokesman said. ""The group blocked all access in and out of the mine and threw stones at vehicles attempting to gain access to the operations. ""The South African Police Service (SAPS) addressed the group extensively, informing them that the gathering was illegal and requesting them to disperse. The group refused. At approximately 11.30am the SAPS had to use teargas and rubber bullets to disperse the group. Access to the Modder East Operations has since been re-established."" Captain Pinky Tsinyane, a police spokeswoman, said four people had been taken to hospital, one of whom was critically injured. As South Africa still comes to terms with what has been described as the lowest point since the end of racial apartheid, anxiety over contagion in the mining sector has been compounded by a wildcat strike by 12,500 miners at Gold Fields' Kloof Driefontein Complex gold mine. Frans Baleni, general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers, told South Africa's Business Day newspaper:: ""The issues at Marikana are overflowing. It's quite clear that this wave of new developments on the platinum mines is coming down on us at the gold mines."" Opposition accused the government of failing to tackle the wider crisis. Sej Motau, shadow labour minister for the Democratic Alliance, said: ""Labour unrest has been spreading across the mining sector following the tragedy at Lonmin's Marikana mine."" Protests have been reported at Royal Bafokeng's Rasimone platinum mine, Anglo American Platinum's Thembelani mine, Eastern Platinum's Crocodile River mine and Gold Fields' Kloof Driefontein Complex gold mine, Motau added. ""By focusing all her efforts on establishing a peace accord at Lonmin's Marikana mine, the minister [Mildred Oliphant] is simply reacting to the most immediate symptoms of an underlying dysfunctional labour regime."" As the government, unions and British-owned Lonmin resumed talks on the ""peace accord"", the first group of 42 miners was released after the dropping of fiercely controversial murder charges against them. The jubilant men, released on warning with no need for bail, sang apartheid-era struggle songs and said they were eager to get home to their families. The workers were among 270 arrested for public violence last month after the police opened fire on a group of protesters, killing 34 of them and wounding 78. Debate over what happened on the day of the massacre continues to rage. Greg Marinovich, a Pulitzer prize-winning photojournalist, has published an investigation suggesting that 14 workers died some 300m away from the main site of the bloodshed. Some appeared to have been shot at close range, he argues. ""It is becoming clear to this reporter that heavily armed police hunted down and killed the miners in cold blood,"" he wrote on the Daily Maverick. website. ""A minority were killed in the filmed event where police claim they acted in self-defence. The rest was murder on a massive scale."" In another report published on Monday, Marinovich claimed that individuals close to various arms of the official investigation have approached the Daily Maverick, verifying the main thrust of his argument. Police are also facing allegations that arrested miners were tortured in custody. On Monday officials announced that a preliminary report from the Independent Police Investigative Directorate had been handed to police minister Nathi Mthethwa. ""Government is concerned about allegations of torture and ill-treatment of detainees arrested in connection with the Marikana incident,"" said Collins Chabane, minister in the presidency. ""The investigation is ongoing and the minister will receive a final report with recommendations as soon as it is finalised. The minister has accordingly assured the public that should the investigation point out to any violation of the detainees by any police officer; the full might of the law will take its course."" Chabane, who chairs the inter-ministerial committee dealing with the aftermath of the Marikana massacre, also sought to reassure foreign investors that South Africa is not in disarray. ""The tragic incident at Marikana is not a reflection of the business environment in South Africa,"" he said. ""Government remains in control of the situation and law and order continues to prevail."" A group of civil society organisations – including Amnesty International, the Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation, Section 27 and the Marikana Solidarity Campaign – described the Marikana massacre as ""a defining moment in our history and cannot be allowed to pass without establishing the full truth, ensuring justice and providing redress for the victims and their families."" It added: ""We are outraged by the emerging evidence of targeted killings at Marikana. The Marikana massacre and the subsequent callous responses of both Lonmin and several representatives of the state violate the very spirit of our constitution."""

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Sarah Bard, of Gilbert, shoots at Caswells Shooting Range, Tuesday, April 6, 2010 in Mesa, Ariz. in preparation for her upcoming concealed weapons test. Gov. Jan Brewer has signed into law two bills supported by gun-rights activists. One of the bills signed Monday would broaden the state's current restrictions on local governments' ability to regulate or tax guns and ammunition. (AP Photo/Matt York) Virginia is issuing a rising number of concealed-carry gun permits to people who live in other states in a trend that may be helped along by online gun classes. The commercial courses allow applicants to seek a permit from Virginia that is valid in their state, but without having to meet tougher requirements their home states may impose, such as firing a gun with an instructor. Virginia State Police issued 1,632 concealed-carry permits to nonresidents through the first half of 2012, topping the previous year's total of 1,321 nonresident permits. There was no corresponding increase in demand for resident permits, with just under half the previous year's number reached by mid-2012. There are no hard numbers to explain why nonresident permits are soaring because state police do not track how many people take online training compared to other types of training. However, state police note that the increase came after Virginia law was changed and coincides with online marketing campaigns targeting states that impose tougher training standards for their own permit applicants but also will honor Virginia's easy-to-obtain licenses ""The statute was amended to require the commonwealth to accept certificates issued online as proof of competency, and that's when the increase started,"" said Donna Tate, manager of the state police Firearms Transaction Center. One of at least two Internet sites that offer the training, www.onlinegunclass.com, highlights on its home page the eight states that allow residents to carry a concealed weapon if they get a permit from Virginia. ""You heard me right -- Virginia,"" a pitchman says in an online promotional video outlining the process for potential customers. Their home states may impose more stringent requirements, he tells prospects, but they can get a Virginia permit simply by paying $39.99, reading five chapters about firearms and correctly answering 15 of 20 true-or-false questions on a quiz. The customer receives a certificate to be mailed along with other application materials to the Virginia State Police. After passing a criminal background check, the applicant receives a permit to carry a concealed weapon in his or her home state and 26 others that have reciprocity agreements with Virginia. Customers can take the test up to four times if they have trouble passing, the man in the video says, adding: ""I don't think it's going to be a problem."" Sample questions on the website seem to bear that out. ""The first step in cleaning your firearm is to make sure it is unloaded,"" says one true-false offering. ""Always keep firearms pointed in a safe direction,"" says another. A competing online training course offered by the Concealed Carry Institute at www.concealed-carry.net also concludes with a 20-question quiz, mixing true-false with multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank formats. The institute says more than 99.9 percent of customers pass the test the first time they take it. Andrew Goddard, president of the Virginia Center for Public Safety that lobbies for gun control, doesn't carry a firearm. But he obtained a resident permit by taking the online training so he could speak authoritatively about it to state lawmakers. ""I swear it's third-grade level, and I could have answered every one of the questions right without ever watching the video,"" Goddard said. ""The funny part is the certificate that I printed out says I met the proficiency requirements, but how can you prove proficiency by answering some silly questions?"" The Virginia General Assembly amended the state's concealed-carry statute to specifically allow the online training in 2009 because localities differed over whether those classes met the legal requirements. Lawmakers overrode a veto by then-Gov. Tim Kaine, who said there were no safeguards against cheating. Lori Haas, who became a gun-control activist after her daughter Emily was wounded in the 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech, shares that concern. ""Your blind grandmother could take the online test because who knows who's really pushing the buttons,"" she said. ""It endangers public safety in an immense way."" The law authorizing the online training imposes no specific standards and does not require applicants to actually handle a firearm. A spokesman for Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, who sponsored the amendment when he was a member of the state Senate, said that Virginia's concealed-carry program has never required hands-on training because its goal is to teach gun safety, not proficiency. The only requirement for the online classes: The instructor must be certified by the state or by the National Rifle Association. Ryan Willis of Shepherdstown, W.Va., the NRA-certified instructor who runs onlinegunclass.com, said he is pleased that he has been able to help many non-Virginians obtain the state's concealed handgun permit. ""I just feel like we're making a difference, making safer communities by supplying responsible citizens with concealed-carry licenses,"" he said. Willis acknowledged that Virginia ""makes it easier than some"" to obtain a license, but he noted that Vermont allows citizens to carry a concealed handgun without a permit and has a relatively low crime rate. Vermont's population of about 626,000 is a little more than double the number of Virginia concealed handgun permit holders: 282,591. Among the states Wills targets on his website is Texas, which requires applicants for its concealed handgun permit to complete a 10- to 15-hour course. Along with passing a written exam, applicants must score at least 70 percent in firing 50 rounds from a handgun at three different distances. Or, they can avoid all that by spending a little over an hour taking the Virginia training on the Internet. Statistics suggest many have done just that. According to the Virginia State Police, the number of nonresident permits issued to Texans has increased 96 percent since the online training provision took effect three years ago. Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson, who authored the state's concealed-carry law in 1995 when he was a member of the state Senate, said hands-on training isn't the only thing Texans are missing if they opt for a nonresident Virginia permit. ""The most important thing in the license application to me is not the practical firing of a firearm, it's knowing the laws that relate to deadly force and where you can lawfully carry,"" he said. ""I'm more concerned that the online course doesn't give folks the knowledge they need to have about Texas law than I am about them not being proficient."" Four of the other states that Willis's website targets -- Tennessee, North Carolina, Ohio and Missouri -- have seen increases ranging from 63 percent to 95 percent in the number of nonresident Virginia permits. Kentucky, Oklahoma and Arkansas have not joined the trend.

That was especially true this year, as both the men's and women's finals represented everything that is great about tennis. But unfortunately this year's incredibly deserving champions, Serena Williams and Andy Murray, are also a reminder of another part of our nation - something of which we should all be decidedly un-proud. They serve as a powerful reminder of the tragic toll of gun violence and our nation's unique failure to do enough to prevent it. Both Andy Murray and Serena Williams were touched by gun violence. In 1996 Andy Murray was eight years old when a gunman killed 17 children and teachers at his primary school in Dunblane, Scotland. Andy was heading to the gym when the gunfire broke out there. He and his brother hid under a desk until the shooting was over. Nine years ago -- almost to the day - Yetunda Price, the oldest sister of Serena and Venus, was shot to death in Compton, where the Williams family grew up. Yetunda was 31, a mother of three, a registered nurse who assisted her tennis-playing sisters. How did citizens and lawmakers in the two nations respond? In the United Kingdom it took both Houses of Parliament just eight days to vote to establish a tribunal to investigate the Dunblane massacre and make recommendations about how such tragedies could be prevented. That report formed the basis for a strong legislative response the following year, in which handguns were virtually banned. Parliament had already greatly restricted access to firearms in response to an earlier mass shooting in 1987. America's response, of course, has been the polar opposite. Our political leaders have done virtually nothing to make it harder for dangerous people to get guns despite over a decade of numerous mass shootings -- in Columbine High School, Virginia Tech, Fort Hood, Tucson, Aurora, and elsewhere -- and 30,000 killed with guns in America every year (including many other prominent athletes and members of their families, as noted in a recent Brady Center report, Guns in Sports.) In fact, in recent years Congress has given special legal protections to gun companies who supply criminals. The result? In 2009, the homicide rate in the US was more than 4 times higher than the murder rate in the UK. Our firearms homicide rate is over 40 times higher than that of England and Wales. It's not that Americans are more criminally-inclined or more violent than Brits. It's that our criminals have far-too-easy access to guns. It's not that America should enact the same laws as the United Kingdom. On the contrary, a U.K.-like ban of handguns and other firearms is not advisable, even if it were Constitutional, which it is not. The point is that our political leaders should be engaging in a thoughtful conversation that explores real, effective solutions to our national gun violence epidemic. As a nation, We Are Better Than This. Serena Williams and Andy Murray represent far more than the tragedies that touched their lives, or a crisis that so severely impacts our nation. They showed us that they represent the perseverance, heart and will that it takes to be a champion - to be truly the best. We Americans rightfully believe we live in the greatest nation on earth, But as it relates to gun violence, we are embarrassingly far from it. It is time we show the heart and resolve that so defines our national character, to rid ourselves of the problem of gun violence once and for all, and show that this really is the greatest nation in the world.

89311318,2012-09-17 10:12:16," 2 Months After Aurora, Coloradans Don't Support Stricter Gun Laws",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/17/aurora-theater-shooting-t_n_1889779.html,en,False,"politics and government,law and legislation,gun control,firearms",27502,HuffPost,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/#,"Nearly two months have passed since a gunman opened fire on unsuspecting movie-goers at a midnight screening of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" at Century 16 theater in Aurora that left 12 dead and injured more than 50. And according to a new poll by The Denver Post, a majority of Coloradans still do not favor stricter gun control laws. Of the 615 likely voters polled, 56 percent said it was more important to them to protect gun rights to 39 percent saying gun control was more important. Read the entire poll, exact question wording and results here at The Denver Post. It shouldn't come as much of a surprise when in the immediate wake of the Aurora mass shooting, The Denver Post reported that gun sales in Colorado spiked -- background checks for people wanting to purchase firearms in the state jumped more than 41 percent less than a week after the massacre. Over the weekend after the shooting, the Colorado Bureau of Investigations had approved 2,887 background checks for people seeking to purchase a firearm. The Post's findings echo sentiments observed by two similar polls by Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS News and Public Policy Polling from August that showed similar majorities from Colorado voters. 50 percent of Colorado voters said that gun laws should remain the same with only 38 percent favoring stricter gun laws, in the Quinnipiac/NYT/CBS poll. Fifty-eight percent of Colorado voters told PPP that no gun laws could have prevented the Aurora theater tragedy while only 35 percent believed gun laws could have prevented the shooting. And if history is a guide, the shooting in Aurora is unlikely to push the voters to favoring stricter gun control laws in a lasting way. A recent report by The Huffington Post evaluated polls about gun control after the Columbine High School massacre in 1999 and found that although there was a bump in support for stricter gun laws immediately following the shooting, that support had eroded a year later which then gave way to a longer-term decline. But polling results often come down to the wording of the question. The Colorado Independent spoke with PPP polling analyst Jim Williams who told the Independent, “If you ask a really broad question like ‘Do you think gun laws should be more restrictive?’ people think of the worst case scenario, where people’s hunting rifles would be taken away,"" Williams said. ""But if you ask a more precise question, such as one dealing with assault weapons or high-capacity magazines, then they think more critically."" And that is certainly reflected in both the PPP and Quinnipiac/NYT/CBS polls. When asked about high-capacity ammunition clips and magazines, 58 percent of Colorado voters favored a national ban Quinnipiac/NYT/CBS found in August. PPP's poll showed that 58 percent of Colorado voters were in support of a ban on assault weapons, while only 35 percent were opposed. Nationally, it appears unlikely that gun laws will change. Although Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) has renewed his push for gun safety legislation and whose bill would limit the availability of high-capacity magazines, a senior Democratic aide told The Huffington Post that the bill is unlikely to go anywhere because of the Senate's busy schedule. ""Not this work period,"" the aide said. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has called upon President Barack Obama and presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney to detail their plans to tighten gun laws. ""You know, soothing words are nice, but maybe it’s time that the two people who want to be President of the United States stand up and tell us what they are going to do about it, because this is obviously a problem across the country,"" Bloomberg said in July just after the Aurora shooting had occurred. And we just might get a question on the issue of gun control at the October presidential debates in Denver.

The Post's findings echo sentiments observed by two similar polls by Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS News and Public Policy Polling from August that showed similar majorities from Colorado voters. 50 percent of Colorado voters said that gun laws should remain the same with only 38 percent favoring stricter gun laws, in the Quinnipiac/NYT/CBS poll. Fifty-eight percent of Colorado voters told PPP that no gun laws could have prevented the Aurora theater tragedy while only 35 percent believed gun laws could have prevented the shooting. And if history is a guide, the shooting in Aurora is unlikely to push the voters to favoring stricter gun control laws in a lasting way. A recent report by The Huffington Post evaluated polls about gun control after the Columbine High School massacre in 1999 and found that although there was a bump in support for stricter gun laws immediately following the shooting, that support had eroded a year later which then gave way to a longer-term decline.

The court documents filed Tuesday and reported by the Denver Post don't reveal the nature of the new charges and a spokesperson in the district attorney's office declined to spell them out, because of a gag order. The filings show that prosecutors also plan to amend 17 of the existing 142 charges against the former University of Colorado doctoral student, though the motions don't show what alterations they want to make. The next hearing on Holmes' case is scheduled for Thursday when these motions can be discussed, according to KUSA. Tomorrow's hearing is also expected to include arguments over a diary that Holmes, 24, sent to his psychiatrist before the shooting. His attorneys contend the notebook should be withheld from the case, because of doctor-patient confidentiality rules. The prosecutors, however, want to examine it for clues regarding the case. Dr. Lynne Fenton, Holmes' former psychiatrist, testified at the last hearing on Aug. 30 that she believed her relationship with him ended at his final appointment on June 11. The journal allegedly contains violent imagery and descriptions similar to the midnight mass shooting at the opening night screening of ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" according to Fox News. The indictment against Holmes includes two counts of first-degree murder for each victim killed: one count for murder with deliberation and one count for murder with extreme indifference.

Lauri and Cari Ryding initially hung the Pride flag following the Pulse nightclub massacre, the worst mass shooting in American history. The incident at their home served as a reminder why they hung the flag in the first place. “It was our first experience in Natick of having any type of prejudice,” Cari Ryding said. “We hadn’t experienced it all, and it kind of broke open our little cocoon.” After the egging of the Ryding’s home, their neighbors came together to show their love and support for the couple ― by flying rainbow flags from all of their houses as well. According to The Boston Globe, over 40 homes in the neighborhood made hung flags from their houses, showing love and support for their lesbian neighbors. “It just happened so quickly ― the whole neighborhood said, ‘Get me a flag. Get me a flag. Get me a flag,’” neighbor Penni Rochwerger reportedly stated. “If we can stop whatever hate is out there, I think that’s really important.” This moment in Boston is just one of many powerful displays of community-based solidarity with the LGBT community since the Pulse nightclub massacre. The Rydings told WCVB that they filed a police report in case the vandals return, but they feel encouraged and hopeful from the support from their friends and neighbors. “One person’s act of fear and maliciousness created such a powerful statement of love,” Lauri Ryding stated. “We are very blessed, very fortunate.” HuffPost Queer Voices Editor"

89314965,2012-09-17 14:29:10,Chris Stedman:  Atheists Ignore Islamophobia At Their Peril,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-stedman/atheists-ignore-islamopho_b_1859052.html,en,False,"christians and christianity,religion and churches,islam,terrorism,crime and criminals",27502,HuffPost,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/#,"Guest Writer This post originally appeared on Religion Dispatches. For two insightful responses (one voicing agreement and one voicing some disagreement), check out these pieces by Hemant Mehta and Ed Brayton. When I first heard that a white supremacist opened fire on a Sikh gurdwara in Oak Creek, Wisconsin a few weeks ago, I froze. My stomach lurched and my thoughts turned to the friends I'd made in the Sikh community through my work as an atheist and interfaith activist. In the wake of the horror I reached out to friends directly and logged on to Twitter to express my shock, outrage, disgust, and sadness--as a Millennial, I suppose you could say this is one way I engage in the collective processing of such traumas. Within minutes of my first tweet, I began to get responses from other atheists saying that interfaith work is bad, that I should be more concerned about atheists than Sikhs, and that ""religion poisons everything."" The next day, I was called ""a traitor"" when I tweeted about efforts to raise funds to rebuild a mosque in Joplin, Missouri that was burned to the ground. When I tweeted about reaching out to the Sikh community and expressing solidarity, I was accused of trying to make atheism a religion. And I wasn't alone in facing such criticism. When skeptic blogger Kylie Sturgess wrote a post about the Joplin mosque she was called ""a terrorist"" by a commenter. (This comment, along with at least four other threatening comments made on her post, has been deleted.) Of course, it's hardly reasonable to be concerned solely on the basis of comments made by Internet ""trolls."" Unfortunately, there are worrying indicators that public figures in the atheist movement are perpetuating and enabling a hostile stance toward Muslims--in many cases, above and beyond the criticisms they direct at other religious communities. One of the most widely-known atheists in the world, Bill Maher, for example, is alarmed by the number of babies being named Mohammed in the U.K., and said the following of Muslims and Islam: ""What it comes down to is that there is one religion in the world that kills you when you disagree with them. They say, 'Look, we're a religion of peace and if you disagree we'll cut your fucking head off."" In December of last year, the president of American Atheists posted a status update to his public Facebook profile that read: ""Never give up a right without a fight. I will defame Islam if I want to. It doesn't mean I hate Muslims. It means Islam is a shitty religion that worships a pedophile as morally perfect."" When I expressed my concern about those comments, atheist blogger JT Eberhard wrote the following: Islam is a shitty religion (more shitty than most, and try me if you don't think we can defend that statement) and Muhammad was a pedophile, which has resulted in several Muslims continuing the practice. If Chris doesn't like the word ""shitty"", I wonder what adjective he would suggest. Horrible? Morally repugnant? Should we greet the anti-science, morally fucked up religion of Islam with an, ""Oh shucks, that is pretty anti-humanity and doesn't make much sense now does it?"" How softly would be enough to get Stedman to relinquish his iron-clad grip on his pearls? Frankly, to call Islam shitty is like calling the surface of the sun warm. Later in the post he claimed to just be ""factually criticizing"" Islam and Muslims, but even if that were his aim, several of the claims he put forth about Islam and Muslims were not only false, but were framed in a way that is likely to inflame anti-Muslim sentiment. Another example is Ernest Perce V, the Pennsylvania State Director for American Atheists, notorious for a lawsuit resulting from his depiction of ""zombie Muhammad"" (the judge, who called Perce ""a doofus"" and ruled against him, was forced to relocate shortly after the ruling due to safety concerns over threats made against him). Perce has also made several statements that have inflamed anti-Muslim attitudes in Pennsylvania--his latest being that he plans to publicly flog a Koran on the Pennsylvania state capitol steps next month in protest of a state resolution to name 2012 the ""Year of Religious Diversity."" There is No Such Thing as Islamophobia While these issues have been the subject of debate in segments of the atheist movement for some time, events this month have got me thinking about a new aspect of this issue: the problem of silence. As the Sikh community reeled from the tragedy in Oak Creek and prominent figures from a plethora of religious communities reached out to express their solidarity and sympathy, I was surprised that I didn't see more notable atheists speak up. Browsing some of the most trafficked atheist blogs I saw that they posted little or nothing about the shooting--until Pat Robertson blamed atheists for the tragedy, an accusation that a sizable majority of atheist websites then addressed. RationalWiki, an atheist wiki featuring a newsfeed and articles like ""Atheism FAQ for the Newly Deconverted,"" contained no mention of the Sikh shooting, but it did list an instance where a Florida door-to-door salesman was shot, and noted the recent mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado. PZ Myers, who is among the most visible atheist bloggers in the world, did write about the shooting twice, though one of his posts simply referenced the shooting as a way to condemn America's ""gun culture,"" while the other focused on Pat Robertson's comments. (Most of the more than 35 other dedicated bloggers on Freethought Blogs--a massive atheist blog network he co-founded--didn't address it at all.) But while this silence is deeply troubling, I don't want to suggest that, like some of those mentioned earlier, the atheist community at large necessarily has an Islamophobia problem--or that legitimate criticisms of Islam (or any other religions) constitutes Islamophobia. The problem, I think, lies in a lack of sensitivity to or awareness of the rampant Islamophobia sweeping our society. A key offender in this respect is bestselling atheist author Sam Harris. The day after the shooting in Wisconsin, Harris published a lengthy blog post decrying Internet trolls; bizarrely, though, he included yet another defense of his position that Muslims should face extra scrutiny at airports. He and I engaged in a back-and-forth about this issue earlier this year after he wrote a post where he first argued that ""we should profile Muslims, or anyone who looks like he or she could conceivably be Muslim, and we should be honest about it."" In my response, I challenged his claims that talk of Islamophobia is ""deluded"" and that ""there is no such thing as Islamophobia."" He responded, but largely neglected my concerns about Islamophobia. It was surely nothing more than poor timing on his part to publish his latest defense of profiling one day after a man opened fire on a community of Sikhs, who have frequently been on the receiving end of bigoted anti-Muslim profiling in the years since 9/11. (In fact, the first 9/11-related hate crime was the murder of a Sikh man named Balbir Singh Sodhi by a man shouting, ""I'm a patriot!"") But while Harris may be convinced that he can parse arguments for profiling people who ""look Muslim"" from Islamophobia, the thing about words--especially words put forth by highly visible public intellectuals--is that they have consequences. Unintentional though they may be, such sentiments reinforce and perpetuate the broader cultural climate of Islamophobia. Terry Jones, who garnered worldwide attention for ""International Burn a Koran Day,"" indicated that he was directly inspired by ""Everybody Draw Mohammed Day,"" an event that was chiefly backed by atheists. And even when the corollaries aren't so obvious, anti-Muslim attitudes seep into the culture, no matter where they originate.  ...With Liberty and Justice For All (Not Just Atheists) When incidents like these occur, I think of the ways in which principled religious criticism can easily devolve into unthinking prejudice. I can think of any number of examples from atheist conferences I've attended, such as the time I watched with dismay as attendees shouted ""show us some ankle"" at women wearing burkas for a satirical musical performance, or when a group of fundamentalist Muslim protesters was encircled by a crowd of hundreds of atheist conference attendees shouting things like ""go back to the Middle East, you pedophiles."" We should be free to criticize all religions, Islam included, but that doesn't mean we should feel free to deride and scorn its adherents. It should go without saying that this isn't a problem with atheism, but it is a problem among atheists and it's one that is being largely ignored. 9/11 is frequently lifted up as the genesis of ""New Atheism,"" and it's not uncommon to see people at atheist conferences wearing shirts declaring that ""9/11 was a faith-based initiative."" Popular atheist blogger Greta Christina has stated that she considers 9/11 the atheist Stonewall--a symbolic equivalent to a moment many regard as the beginning of the modern LGBT rights movement. Statements such as this make me wonder if it's perhaps more difficult for some segments of the atheist community to empathize with members of the Muslim community. Again, silence about the recent spike in bias and violence directed at Muslims, Sikhs, Arabs, and others isn't a problem exclusive to the atheist community, but by neglecting to tackle it, the atheist movement is opting out of an important conversation about the mistreatment of certain minority groups in the United States. Figures in the atheist movement talk frequently about how our society should recognize the contributions and worth of atheists, and how everyone should decry rhetorical attacks against the nonreligious, but this argument falls flat when many atheists fail to extend that claim to other communities--especially ones facing frequent rhetorical and physical attacks. As a minority community in America's religious milieu, it makes strategic sense for atheists to ally with Muslims, Sikhs, and others. But as a Humanist atheist, I feel a sense of moral obligation to stand up against identity-based hatred, no matter whom it's directed at. Not only is it absurd to hope that people should care about the lack of acceptance for atheists in the United States without also hoping that society will similarly embrace other communities, it's also selfish. Atheists who remain silent about Islamophobia aren't just missing out on a strategic opportunity to highlight the parallels between their own experiences and those of other disenfranchised religious minorities--they're opting out of an opportunity to do what is right, to take the moral high road, and to demonstrate what we keep telling the rest of the world: that atheists can be ""good without God."" There's been a great deal of discussion in the atheist movement recently about social justice focused on anti-atheist bias, sexism, racism, homophobia and transphobia, ableism, and more. These are, of course, crucial hurdles to overcome in the quest for human progress, but social justice should mean justice for all, including religious people. In fact, this is exactly what ""social justice"" means. From dictionary.com: ""the distribution of advantages and disadvantages within a society."" A recent study by sociologist Jeremy Stangroom may shed some light on why some atheists' definitions of social justice don't seem to include the religious. He found that 32% of atheist respondents felt that ""they are not morally obliged to help somebody in severe need in India, even though to do so wouldn't cost them much, compared to only 22% of Christians who respond the same way (a difference that is easily statistically significant)."" He continued: In other words, the data shows that people who self-identify as Christians are considerably more likely to think there is a moral obligation to help somebody in severe need (in India) than people who self-identify as atheists... A possible (partial) explanation for this failure, supported by the data noted above, is that many (online) atheists don't believe they have a strong moral obligation towards relatively anonymous or distant others, or don't feel the pull of such an obligation even if they believe they have it (or think they believe they have it). Stangroom also noted another recent study that asked whether respondents would be willing to give a small donation to an overseas aid agency: The data shows that only 31% of people who self-identify as atheists respond that they are morally obliged to make such a donation, compared to 36% of people who self-identify as Christian, a difference that is statistically significant... Moreover, if we also look at people who also self-identify as Muslim and Jewish (i.e., as adherents of Judaism), then the gap between how atheists and people who self-identify as religious respond widens (31% to 38%). I wonder if one of the issues at work is that many atheists see Muslims, Sikhs, and other religious individuals as distant others. There are female atheists, queer atheists, and atheists of all different races and ethnicities, so social justice for women, LGBT folks, and racial and ethnic minorities is accessible--these issues impact many people in the atheist community. But what about people in other communities? If this is the case, then interfaith outreach and cooperation is imperative as it strives to decrease the distance between ""others"" and create opportunities for people to identify shared values and a sense of shared humanity--an understanding of identity that allows people to see another's freedom and value as connected to their own. Beyond Tribalism Fortunately, there are indications of progress in this direction. A number of atheists did speak out against the shooting, and the conversation about positive engagement with the religious and the intersections of oppression is advancing. I was fortunate to witness cooperation between atheists and religious individuals in the week following the shooting when 25 atheists, agnostics, Muslims, Pagans, Christians, Zoroastrians, and others met at the Humanist Community at Harvard to attend a memorial for the shooting victims at a gurdwara in Medford, Massachusetts. An atheist in attendance told me that he had never experienced anything like it before, but perhaps the most moving sentiment came from a Christian minister who said during the memorial: ""Personally, I am embarrassed that it's taken a tragedy for me to come here and introduce myself to you."" All of us--atheist and religious--should consider it an embarrassment that there isn't more goodwill and cooperation between religious communities and the nonreligious. There have been at least nine additional attacks on American Muslims and Sikhs in just the last couple of weeks since the gurdwara shooting, so no community can excuse their silence any longer. We can disagree about the veracity of religious claims, but I worry that these disagreements lead some atheists away from defending religious individuals against injustice (and, to be sure, many religious individuals and communities likewise neglect to extend their support to atheists in need). But if the atheist community doesn't speak loudly against Islamophobia now, when will it? If too many are only willing to stand up against hate directed at ourselves and other members of our community, then we are not truly against hate or for social justice--we are merely for ourselves and for our community. Social justice cannot mean in-group tribalism, or it's not justice at all. Guest Writer"
807048755,2012-08-29 00:00:00,Paul Ryan brands himself as outdoorsman in interview with hunting magazine - The Boston Globe,https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2012/08/29/paul-ryan-brands-himself-outdoorsman-interview-with-hunting-magazine/Riu1DouVcAAisiKNl9A6pO/story.html,en,False,"politics and government,biographical information",15,The Boston Globe,https://www.bostonglobe.com/,"Voters, meet Paul Ryan, “diehard deer hunter.” Branded as a budget hawk and policy wonk, Mitt Romney’s running mate is re-introducing himself as an avid outdoorsman in an interview for the October edition of Deer & Deer Hunting magazine. The upcoming issue -- whose cover declares a camouflaged Ryan to be a “diehard deer hunter” -- will not hit newsstands until Sept. 4, but the magazine published an online preview of the Ryan interview on Wednesday, the day he will accept the GOP vice presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention in Tampa. Ryan gave the interview before Romney announced his selection of the Wisconsin congressman earlier this month. But the timing of its release dovetails with the Romney campaign’s apparent effort to market Ryan as a candidate whose support of gun rights is rooted in personal experience -- an image Romney has tried unsuccessfully to project on his own. Though he is known for strict budget proposals, Ryan is expected to focus largely on autobiography in his televised address Wednesday night. In remarks at his hometown high school in Janesville, Wis. Monday -- billed as a preview of his convention speech -- Ryan did not mention his much-debated plan for Medicare reform even once. Advertisement Instead, Ryan cast himself among those who “cling to guns or religion,” as President Obama described some voters in 2008. “From a guy who goes to St. John Vianney over there, whose tree stand is over about six miles that direction and that direction, this Catholic deer hunter is guilty as charged and proud of that,” Ryan said, drawing cheers from supporters at his alma mater. In the Deer & Deer Hunting magazine interview, Ryan describes his fascination with “deer strategy and habitat,” saying he owns a “whole row of books” on the subject. In Ryan’s basement are “some big chest freezers ... for my pheasants, ducks, deer and other game.” Advertisement His heroes include Chuck Adams, a member of the Bowhunters Hall of Fame, who was the first archer to shoot and kill all 27 species of North American big game -- an accomplishment known as the “super slam.” “I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to try [that], but one of my goals is to get a grand slam of sheep with a bow,” Ryan told the magazine. “It would be very tough and very expensive. But I’d love to do some of those great western hunts for sheep and deer.” “I’m just pretty typical for a Wisconsin guy,” he added. “I love hunting and fishing. Bowhunting is my passion. Studying the strategy, preparing food plots, the strategy of where a dominant buck is living or will be moving and then being in position to get a shot, that’s really exciting. Half of it is getting ready for the shot.” Romney has tried in the past to portray himself as an active hunter. In 2007, during his first White House run, Romney told a New Hampshire man wearing a National Rifle Association hat, “I’ve been a hunter pretty much all my life.” Later, Romney acknowledged he had been hunting only twice in his life: once when he hunted rabbits with his cousins in Idaho at age 15 and again when he shot quail in Georgia with major donors to the Republican Governors Association in 2006. Advertisement During an address to the NRA in April, Romney pledged to “safeguard our Second Amendment.” After the mass shooting in Aurora, Colo. in July, Romney said in an NBC News interview that “I don’t happen to believe that America needs new gun laws.” Some gun owners have remained skeptical of Romney’s professed zeal for the Second Amendment. They note that as governor of Massachusetts, Romney signed a state ban on assault weapons and raised gun license fees from $25 to $100. Running for US Senate in 1994, Romney endorsed a federal assault weapons ban and also backed the Brady Bill, which required background checks on people who purchase guns from federally licensed dealers. Ryan’s hunting bona fides appear to be authentic. After he posed with bow drawn in his office for Time magazine last year, Archery Trade Association chief executive Jay McAninch wrote on his blog that Ryan is “the real deal; a hardcore bowhunter.” Callum Borchers can be reached at callum.borchers@globe.com.

443599126,2012-08-29 12:01:32,Here Are All the People Who Should Sue Gawker Media - Breitbart,http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2015/07/17/here-are-all-the-people-who-should-sue-gawker-media/,en,False,"homosexuality,suits and litigation,television,news and news media,media,ethics",19334,Breitbart,http://www.breitbart.com,"What is it with Gawker? Are they just incompetent, or are they actually trying to get sued into bankruptcy? The odious blog network has just added yet another powerful name to the growing list of people who ought to sue them, running a story outing Condé Nast CFO David Geithner as gay, including what purports to be a set of text messages between Geithner and a gay porn star who works as a male escort. Geithner has a wife and kids, and Gawker has offered no public interest justification for outing him. He’s not a public figure or law enforcement official and has never spoken against LGBT rights. So there’s no argument he’s a hypocrite worth exposing. He’s just an accountant – for one of Gawker’s commercial rivals. https://twitter.com/Nero/status/621876502603386880 Worse, it seems the story may not even be true. According to at least one source, the male escort used by Gawker is a conspiracy theorist who delights in leading journalist and politicians astray with bogus stories. Geithner, for his part, denies that any text messages between the “escort” and himself took place: “I don’t know who this individual is. This is a shakedown,” he told Gawker. They went ahead with the story anyway. And Gawker knew it was a shakedown from the very beginning. The “escort” specifically told the blogging network that Geithner promised to take one of the escort’s conspiracy theories to President Obama if he got Gawker to kill the story. Let that sink in for a second: the conspiracy theorist’s plan was to use Gawker as leverage over Geithner. And Gawker acted as a willing participant in gay extortion. A man’s reputation was held hostage at blogpoint and an editor went ahead and pulled the trigger, perhaps even knowing the story was shaky. Evidently, Gawker is the kind of place where they hold up pictures of Sabrina Erdely and say: “Now this is how you do it!” Many of my Twitter followers use “archive links” to deny advertising revenue to sites they dislike. It’s a way of producing a photocopy, if you like, of web content that does not generate new clicks, and therefore ad revenue, when readers visit. I have in the past resisted using services like that out of journalistic solidarity. But after Gawker’s appalling story about David Geithner, there is no more solidarity to be had with them. No reputable journalist can recognise that company as a responsible reporting outlet. From now on, it’s archive.today all the way. https://twitter.com/Nero/status/621998240154689536 It’s as though Gawker CEO Nick Denton has a death wish. I mean, I know liberals are obsessed with ending life, whether by abortion or euthanasia, but I didn’t realise that extended to their media properties. Gawker’s latest blunder even threatens to turn GamerGate, the hashtag movement who cost the media company seven figures in revenue after an advertiser boycott last year, into unlikely heroes. A list of Gawker’s advertisers created by GamerGate last year is currently going viral on Twitter, even appearing in USA Today. Journalists from other publications quickly began piling on. https://twitter.com/julietlapidos/status/621866351771004928 There's no excuse for the Gawker piece, which I won't link to. It's disgraceful, and it shouldn't be referred to as journalism. — Sabrina Siddiqui (@SabrinaSiddiqui) July 17, 2015 what the goddamn hell, Gawker. Seriously. Dude tries a shake down of a closet case, then randomly outs him. https://t.co/FqNkxXKMNI — Justin Ling (@Justin_Ling) July 17, 2015 Dont read Gawker much as it is. But that's the end of it for me. — Ben White (@morningmoneyben) July 17, 2015 Recognising the magnitude of the disaster, other Gawker writers have started to run for cover. https://twitter.com/AdamWeinstein/status/621851862141128704 But it’s too late. This couldn’t have come at a worse time for Gawker. The company is currently facing a $100m lawsuit over their release of Hulk Hogan’s sex tape. Again, no public interest justification has been offered besides mentioning Hogan’s celebrity and his penchant for machismo bragging. For Gawker to remind the world of its reputation for poorly researched, personally-invasive reporting at this moment is utter madness. But, you know what, I’m happy to play Dr. Kevorkian to Gawker’s suicidal tendencies. Geithner and Hulk Hogan are well within their rights to sue. But they’re not the only ones. JUSTINE SACCO
In Jon Ronson’s acclaimed book on Twitter-shaming campaigns, Justine Sacco is the lead example. Sacco wasn’t particularly famous or powerful — she worked in corporate communications. But when Gawker’s Sam Biddle decided to publish a risqué joke she made on Twitter, he maliciously catapulted her into global infamy. Within the space of a few hours, Sacco was rendered unemployable. One joke, magnified by Gawker for no good reason, had ruined Sacco’s career. Sacco has since made peace with Gawker, but after last night’s events, perhaps she could be persuaded to have second thoughts. PAX DICKINSON
Dickinson is the male version of Sacco and the self-described “patient zero” of online shaming campaigns. Whereas Sacco had her career ruined by Gawker falsely accusing her of racism over un-PC jokes, Dickinson faced the same sort of public shaming over allegations of sexism, via Gawker’s Valleywag blog. Strident defenses of his character from female co-workers were not enough to save Dickinson, who was fired and is now considered toxic to employers and investors. Another promising career ruined by Gawker, again for no good reason. QUENTIN TARANTINO
Quentin Tarantino has already sued Gawker, after they leaked the script of one of his movies, the Hateful Eight (2015). There is no question that the leak of the script caused damage to Tarantino’s business interests, but the cult film director decided to voluntarily withdraw his lawsuit in summer 2014. Perhaps it’s time for him to think again. JAMES FRANCO
As the latest Gawker controversy unfolded, a former writer, Richard Lawson, took to Twitter to atone for his sins. “When I was at Gawker I wrote baseless posts accusing an actor of raping an ex-boyfriend”, wrote Lawson. “It did it [because] my boss told me to, but I wanted to too.” That actor was James Franco. In 2008, Lawson authored a Gawker post entitled “The People Have Spoken, and They Think James Franco is a Rapist.” This followed fast on the heels of another post in which Lawson asked the question “Which Actor is Crazy, Violent, and Gay?” Like the Geithner story, it was another attempted outing of someone who had not yet outed themselves (although Gawker once again got it wrong — James Franco is not gay). More to the point, it was another baseless accusation of rape. The Huffington Post thinks Franco should sue. I agree. BRAD WARDELL
Brad Wardell is the CEO of Stardock Corporation, a software and gaming company. Gawker blog Kotaku almost ruined his career when they repeated false allegations that he had sexually harassed one of his employees. Kotaku gave him just one hour of working time to provide them with a comment. The lawsuit against Wardell was later dropped, and the woman who filed it publicly apologized for her claim.
 
MAX TEMKIN
Which news outlet is most famous for reporting rape allegations on the basis of hearsay alone, repeatedly, without apology? Rolling Stone? Well, maybe. But before Rolling Stone there was Gawker, which have so far published no less than three stories on allegations against Max Temkin, the man behind cult creation Cards Against Humanity. These allegations were made on a Facebook post, with no evidence, with no criminal charges filed. Gawker continues to report on them, and appears delighted that Temkin is being banned from conferences. CHRISTINA HENDRICKS & OLIVIA MUNN
Gawker is one of Reddit’s harshest critics. Blogger Sam Biddle regularly accuses the site of racism and sexism, and Gawker writers frequently refer to its role in “The Fappening,” a mass leak of celebrity nudes. But Gawker itself has one of the worst track records in the history of the media when it comes to respecting the privacy of celebrities. Hulk Hogan is just one example. Olivia Munn and Christina Hendricks also fell victim to Gawker’s creepy hunger for nudes. When hackers acquired their photos in 2012, Gawker wasted no time in publishing them. LENORE ZANN
Lenore Zann is a Canadian politician. Gawker published her nudes. MICHAEL SAM
Michael Sam is a gay NFL player – the first publicly gay player to be drafted in the NFL. Gawker published his nudes. HEATHER MORRIS, ROY JONES JR, BRETT FAVRE, TATIANA BARBOSA
The first is an actress, the second two are sportsmen, the fourth is an escort who had a fling with Justin Bieber. Yes, once again, Gawker published all their nudes. No reason. Just prurience and invasiveness. CHRISTINE O’DONNELL
Christine O’Donnell is a Republican activist and was a candidate in the 2010 Senatorial election for the state of Delaware. In 2010, Gawker published an anonymous account of a one-night stand with O’Donnell, alleged to have happened during her college years. The reporting was so egregious that even left-leaning outlets like Salon and the New York Times condemned Gawker.
 
MICHELLE MALKIN
In 2006, Gawker went after the conservative columnist Michelle Malkin. They weren’t going after her politics, though, for once: they were going after her nudes. Not for any good reason, you understand, just to embarrass her. They acquired and published bikini pictures of an Asian college student, claiming it was Malkin. It wasn’t. (Top marks for racial sensitivity there.) Malkin was advised to sue, but decided against it. Maybe it’s time for her to revisit the case? SARAH PALIN
In 2008, Sarah Palin, then the Republican nominee for Vice President, suffered an email hack. While the hacker was caught and jailed, Gawker wasted no time in publishing hacked pictures of Palin’s family as well as their private email addreses. In modern web slang, that’s called “doxing.” Gawker have also made repugnant comments about the pregnancy of Bristol Palin. You can’t sue for that, of course, but it’s worth remembering. Oh, I almost forgot. They also left prank messages on Bristol Palin’s phone, after her number was leaked. Responsible journalism in action. GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE
In 2014, an anonymous source handed Gawker a tape which allegedly depicted New Jersey Governor Chris Christie involved in group sex [NSFW]. The tape was bogus, as was the story. The anonymous source also had a weird, baseless theory about Christie being tied to the Mob, and the video being part of an initiation theory. Gawker admitted all of this in their story. But they ran it anyway, closing their story with the line: “This is what it would look like if Chris Christie ever got into the porn business.” Some self-identified baseless posts are just too good to kill, apparently. GUN OWNERS IN NEW YORK CITY
In the aftermath of the Sandy Hook mass shooting, Gawker was determined to make the case for gun control. So they decided to reveal the personal locations of every gun owner in New York City. PRETTY MUCH EVERY MALE ATHLETE EVER
Did you know Gawker has a news category called “Athlete Dong”? Well, they do. It’s where they post pictures of athlete’s penises. Without their permission and for no good reason at all. (Caution: the links below are very NSFW.) So far, their list of victims includes Brett Favre, Roy Jones Jr, Michael Sam and Australian footballers Nick Riewoldt, Nick Del Santo and Zac Dawson. They didn’t quite manage to get any shots of Josh Hamilton’s dong, but that didn’t stop them publishing a bunch of other personal photos. *** You’re probably getting the message. By all rights, Gawker ought to be drowning in lawsuits. But it isn’t just the complete disregard for privacy rights and basic standards of journalistic accuracy that make Gawker’s wrongdoing so egregious. It’s the rank hypocrisy. Gawker spends much of its time lecturing millennials — the most tolerant generation alive — on why they should be less sexist, racist, and homophobic. When they cover expressions of millennial culture, like Reddit, 4chan, and GamerGate, they will make use of whatever sparse evidence they have to spin the story into one of sexism and racism. Yet for all their virtue-signalling, it is Gawker who harasses people, it is Gawker who abuses people, and it is Gawker who slut-shames and gay-shames. And it is Gawker who repeatedly and habitually outs gay people, despite previously condemning the practice.

San Bernardino’s Common Council endorsed the agreement unanimously on Monday. The agreement clears the way to fold the city’s fire department into San Bernardino County’s fire services district as a critical cost-cutting measure, City Attorney Gary Saenz said in a statement. The union for San Bernardino’s firefighters ratified the agreement last week, their lawyer, Corey Glave, told Reuters. The settlement resolves nine years of claims against San Bernardino, which includes paying the firefighters $2.7 million to resolve claims over changes to the city’s pension policy and to settle lawsuits the firefighters pressed against the city after it filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy in 2012. As part of the settlement, the city will transfer approximately $430,000 to the county so firefighters begin service with the county district with sick and leave time. The agreement also provides for the firefighters’ union to be treated as an unsecured creditor that would get $140,000, or 1 percent, on a $14-million claim in the city’s bankruptcy plan. The agreement followed a legal setback for the firefighters late last month when U.S. District Court Judge Otis Wright ruled that Bankruptcy Judge Meredith Jury did not abuse her discretion by denying them relief from a stay in San Bernardino’s bankruptcy. Jury had ruled firefighters could not sue San Bernardino in state court for cutting salaries and benefits after rejecting their labor contract. She also ruled that neither San Bernardino’s charter nor state law prevents the city from outsourcing its fire service. San Bernardino was the scene of a mass shooting in December that killed 14 people and that U.S. officials called a terrorist attack. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

498839150,2012-08-29 12:01:32,Gunman who killed 49 in Orlando nightclub had pledged allegiance to ISIS,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/06/12/orlando-nightclub-shooting-about-20-dead-in-domestic-terror-incident-at-gay-club/?utm_term=.05864fc21fbb,en,True,"medicine and health,murders and attempted murders",2,Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,"This article is more than 1 year old ORLANDO — A gunman who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State opened fire inside a crowded gay bar and dance club here early Sunday, leaving 49 people dead and 53 injured in the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, authorities said. President Obama labeled the rampage “an act of terror and an act of hate.” The gunman fired bullets seemingly at random inside the popular Pulse nightclub, forcing panicked patrons to dive onto the dance floor, crawl across the ground and scramble out a back entrance. He then held others hostage in a three-hour siege that ended when police stormed the building and killed him. Witnesses described scenes of horrific carnage. Victims flooded local hospitals with gunshot wounds to their chests, legs and arms. Some had their calves and forearms blown off, doctors said. Police said the toll could have been even greater had a SWAT team not rescued 30 people and shepherded them to safety. Many of the victims were Latino; the club was celebrating “Latin Night.” “We’re dealing with something we never imagined and is unimaginable,” said Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer (D), who declared a state of emergency in the city. The gunman was identified as Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old security guard who was born in New York to Afghan parents. After his initial assault on the dance club, Mateen called 911 and pledged allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, according to federal law enforcement officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the FBI investigation is unfolding. During the call, Mateen made reference to the 2013 bombing of the Boston Marathon, officials said. The shooting raised fresh alarm about the ability of overseas terrorists to wreak havoc on U.S. soil. But it also ignited fears of a broader campaign against the American gay, lesbian and transgender community as the first anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage approaches. Hours after the Orlando attack, police in Southern California reported arresting a heavily armed man who said he was headed to a gay pride parade in the Los Angeles area — though authorities later said they were mistaken about the man’s target. Meanwhile, in Washington, police stepped up patrols ahead of the Capital Pride Festival, one of dozens of gay pride events scheduled this month across the nation and around the world. “As Americans, we are united in grief, in outrage, and in resolve to defend our people,” Obama said during a brief speech at the White House, where he said the FBI is investigating the Orlando massacre as an act of terrorism. Until Sunday, the 2007 rampage at Virginia Tech — in which 32 people died — was the country’s worst mass shooting. Throughout the day, relatives and friends of missing clubgoers gathered at a downtown Hampton Inn & Suites to await news of their loved ones. On Sunday evening, as the names of the dead began to trickle out, the scene in the hotel’s sweltering lobby turned tragic.
One woman sat in a chair next to a stack of pizza boxes, sobbing and screaming. Another woman crumpled in her chair, crying, and was taken out in a wheelchair. A third woman vomited into a trash can. Others hugged, shook and softly cried as grief counselors and law enforcement officials milled about. Condemnations of the carnage in downtown Orlando flooded the airwaves from officials and pundits across the political spectrum. But late Sunday, many questions remained unanswered. It was unclear, for example, how a lone gunman managed to hold so many people inside the nightclub for so long, whether any of the clubgoers tried to stop him and why police waited three hours to intervene. A clear timeline of events, including when the victims were killed and injured and who shot them, remained elusive. Authorities declined to offer details. But a senior U.S. law enforcement official said officers delayed their assault on the gunman because the active-shooter scene turned into a hostage negotiation once the gunman called 911. For three hours, the gunman was on the phone with police and no shots were fired. “That is when you do wait,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not an authorized spokesman. “It was appropriate.” Police ultimately chose to end the standoff because of concerns about the health and safety of dozens of people who were injured and trapped inside. Officials at nearby Orlando Regional Medical Center said at least nine people died at the hospital or were dead when they arrived. It was unclear whether anyone was injured during the gunman’s final shootout with officers, although authorities said that one Orlando police officer was shot but his Kevlar helmet saved him. The Islamic State has repeatedly executed gay people and released videos showing their gruesome executions. FBI Special Agent Ron Hopper said the bureau was still working to determine whether sexual orientation was a motive in the Orlando attack. He said investigators had found no indication that Mateen had outside help in planning the attack, nor any sign of other suspects or further threats to the public. Much was also still to be learned about Mateen’s background, although details about his previous contacts with law enforcement officials began to emerge. Much like Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the older of the two brothers who carried out the Boston Marathon bombing, Mateen had been on the FBI’s radar. Hopper, who runs the FBI’s Orlando office, told reporters that Mateen had twice been investigated by the bureau and was cleared both times. In 2013, Hopper said agents twice interviewed Mateen after he made “inflammatory comments to co-workers alleging possible ties to terrorists.” The FBI closed the investigation after it was unable to verify the details of his comments, Hopper said. The following year, FBI agents examined possible ties connecting Mateen to Moner Mohammad Abusalha, the first American to carry out a suicide attack in Syria. Like Mateen, Abusalha lived in Fort Pierce, Fla. “We determined that contact was minimal and did not constitute a substantive relationship or a threat at that time,” Hopper said. Meanwhile, Sitora Yusifiy, Mateen’s ex-wife, said in an interview Sunday that he beat her repeatedly during their brief marriage and that Mateen, who was a Muslim, was not very religious and gave no indication that he was devoted to radical Islam. “He was not a stable person,” she said. “He would just come home and start beating me up because the laundry wasn’t finished or something like that.” On Sunday, the gunman was armed with a handgun and an assault rifle and was carrying additional rounds. “It appears he was organized and well-prepared,” Orlando Police Chief John Mina said.
Mateen had legally purchased the two guns — which the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said were a ­.223-caliber AR-15-type assault rifle and a 9mm semiautomatic pistol — within “the last few days,” according to Trevor Velinor of the ATF. The AR-15 is the civilian variant of the M16 military rifle and is one of nation’s most popular weapons. A standard magazine carries about 30 bullets. The violence in the crowded nightclub began as Saturday gave way to Sunday. About 2 a.m., Pulse Orlando posted an urgent message on Facebook: “Everyone get out of pulse and keep running.” Within minutes, police vehicles and a SWAT team descended on the club. “I was there,” Ricardo J. Negron posted on Pulse’s Facebook page several hours later. “Shooter opened fire @ around 2:00am. People on the dance floor and bar got down on the floor and some of us who were near the bar and back exit managed to go out through the outdoor area and just ran. I am safely home and hoping everyone gets home safely as well.”
Many of the injured were taken to the regional medical center, which was locked down until Sunday afternoon. The hospital permitted only two family members at a time to go inside, leaving 45 people waiting in the 84-degree heat. Some people emerged from the hospital with tears streaming down their faces. One woman lay on the ground, moaning “no” over and over until her family led her away. Joannette Martinez said her family became worried when they couldn’t find her 24-year-old sister, Yilmary. It was Yilmary’s first time at the club, Joanette said; she was celebrating a visit from her brother-in-law. “No one’s told us anything,” Martinez said as she sat on the sidewalk, her back to the hospital, after waiting for several hours. At the Hampton Inn & Suites, Jose Honorato waited with his seven siblings for word about his younger brother Miguel. “He was at the club with three friends. They made it out safely when the shooting started, but they don’t know if he made it out,” Honorato said. Honorato said he had called Miguel’s phone, but it just kept ringing and went to voicemail.
Police described a hellish scene inside the nightclub, which was strewn with bodies. “It’s absolutely terrible,” Mina said. “Fifty victims in one location, one shooting.” The massive law enforcement response included a number of federal agencies. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, who was scheduled to attend a meeting in Beijing on cybersecurity, said Sunday that she was returning to Washington so she could monitor the investigation. At the White House, Obama met with FBI Director James B. Comey and then briefly addressed the nation, saying the entire country stands “with the people of Orlando, who have endured a terrible attack on their city.” The president said it was too early to know “the precise motivations of the killer,” but that the FBI would investigate possible links between the gunman and terrorist groups.
Echoing comments he has made after other mass shootings, Obama said the bloodshed served to highlight how easily people can obtain guns in the United States. He also signed a proclamation honoring the victims and ordering that American flags be flown at half-staff until sunset Thursday. In Orlando, Joshua and Mary Zika, who live less than a block from the nightclub, said they were particularly appalled that the shooter had appeared to target a particular group.
“We’re proud of our gay community in Orlando,” Mary Zika said. By early Sunday evening, a Florida LGBT advocacy group had raised nearly half a million dollars for the victims. More than 11,000 people had donated to Equality Florida’s GoFundMe page in six hours, raising more than $480,000. The funds will go directly to victims and their families, according to the page. Sunday’s rampage followed another shooting in Orlando: The fatal slaying Friday night of a pop singer who was killed while signing autographs after a performance at an Orlando concert venue. Christina Grimmie, a 22-year-old singer who was a finalist on NBC’s “The Voice,” died hours after she was shot by a gunman who then shot himself, police said.

And according to a new poll by The Denver Post, a majority of Coloradans still do not favor stricter gun control laws. Of the 615 likely voters polled, 56 percent said it was more important to them to protect gun rights to 39 percent saying gun control was more important. Read the entire poll, exact question wording and results here at The Denver Post. It shouldn't come as much of a surprise when in the immediate wake of the Aurora mass shooting, The Denver Post reported that gun sales in Colorado spiked -- background checks for people wanting to purchase firearms in the state jumped more than 41 percent less than a week after the massacre. Over the weekend after the shooting, the Colorado Bureau of Investigations had approved 2,887 background checks for people seeking to purchase a firearm. The Post's findings echo sentiments observed by two similar polls by Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS News and Public Policy Polling from August that showed similar majorities from Colorado voters. 50 percent of Colorado voters said that gun laws should remain the same with only 38 percent favoring stricter gun laws, in the Quinnipiac/NYT/CBS poll. Fifty-eight percent of Colorado voters told PPP that no gun laws could have prevented the Aurora theater tragedy while only 35 percent believed gun laws could have prevented the shooting. And if history is a guide, the shooting in Aurora is unlikely to push the voters to favoring stricter gun control laws in a lasting way. A recent report by The Huffington Post evaluated polls about gun control after the Columbine High School massacre in 1999 and found that although there was a bump in support for stricter gun laws immediately following the shooting, that support had eroded a year later which then gave way to a longer-term decline. But polling results often come down to the wording of the question. The Colorado Independent spoke with PPP polling analyst Jim Williams who told the Independent, “If you ask a really broad question like ‘Do you think gun laws should be more restrictive?’ people think of the worst case scenario, where people’s hunting rifles would be taken away,"" Williams said. ""But if you ask a more precise question, such as one dealing with assault weapons or high-capacity magazines, then they think more critically."" And that is certainly reflected in both the PPP and Quinnipiac/NYT/CBS polls.

PPP's poll showed that 58 percent of Colorado voters were in support of a ban on assault weapons, while only 35 percent were opposed. Nationally, it appears unlikely that gun laws will change. Although Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) has renewed his push for gun safety legislation and whose bill would limit the availability of high-capacity magazines, a senior Democratic aide told The Huffington Post that the bill is unlikely to go anywhere because of the Senate's busy schedule. ""Not this work period,"" the aide said. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has called upon President Barack Obama and presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney to detail their plans to tighten gun laws.

It was the Pledge of Allegiance, delivered by a 42-year-old Arizona woman. And when Gabrielle Giffords took the stage on the final night of the convention, she redefined that worn-out, overused word ""inspirational"" and made it hers. Giffords has made few public appearances since the January 2011 mass shooting in Tucson in which she was shot in the head at point-blank range -- and six other people were killed. It was a devastating injury. Giffords had part of her skull and brain removed, underwent intensive reconstructive surgery, and lost the full use of the right side of her body and half of her vision. Yet her recovery has been nothing short of astonishing – a woman whom early media reports had presumed dead was walking, reading and speaking again, after just months of rigorous therapy. Giffords' road since that day back in 2011 has been challenging and mostly private. In November 2011, she and her husband, Mark Kelly, gave an interview with ABC News, in which she understatedly referred to her recuperation as ""difficult."" This past January, she attended the State of the Union address and resigned from Congress, admitting, ""I have more work to do on my recovery."" She also vowed, ""I'm getting better every day. My spirit is high. I will return."" And return, at least for a few moments, she did. To watch Giffords' Thursday performance at the DNC is to see her limping as she navigates her way to the stage, aided by her friend, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz. To watch her hold her right hand in her left as it rests over her heart. To hear her struggle over the word ""indivisible."" To look upon a radically changed person. But that's not what made her appearance so dramatic. It's that the most palpable change in Gabby Giffords is that the woman who was once called the most positive person in Congress now seems, impossible though it may sound, even more positive. No, she didn't resemble the energetic young woman of years past. But she appeared utterly radiant with delight. She looked so damn happy. Happy to be standing in that room, gratefully accepting the cheers flowing her way. Happy to be able to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. Happy, as well, in the words themselves. Watch her performance. Watch how she takes a rote speech we've all droned our way through and makes it a declaration of love. And that is what made it rain on your face Thursday night. The best that anyone who has ever been through something utterly life-shaking can hope for isn't to come back from it. It's to go forward. It's to take the most unthinkably horrible things that have happened to you and keep digging until you find whatever nuggets of pure, shimmering joy that are hidden within them. It is to take the absolute worst events in your life and use them to bring out not just your best, but the best of those around you. It is to struggle mightily, but to struggle, always, toward the light. It is to embody Elizabeth Warren's passionate declaration that ""People have hearts. They have kids. They get jobs. They get sick. They cry, they dance. They live, they love, and they die -- and that matters. That matters."" That Giffords can today walk at all is a stunning accomplishment. That she can walk before the world with such brilliant bliss on her face makes her a role model to us all. As her husband has said, ""Optimism is a form of healing. Hope is a form of love."" Courage doesn't just grit its teeth and square its shoulders. It acknowledges that life is short and desperately, desperately fragile. And so it laughs. It takes the hand of a friend. And it beams with a smile that could bring down the house.  Mary Elizabeth Williams is a senior writer for Salon and author of ""A Series of Catastrophes & Miracles.""

They're picking between the front-runners vying for the GOP nomination to replace retiring Sen. Jon Kyl – six-term U.S. Rep. Jeff Flake and wealthy businessman Wil Cardon. Tuesday's Arizona elections also will oust of one of two Republican House members, both freshmen pitted against each other by redistricting. Five other House incumbents, including former Democratic U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords' hand-picked successor, face challengers. Voters in Alaska and Oklahoma also are deciding House races. In Arizona, Democrats are hoping the surprisingly aggressive – and expensive – challenge from Cardon to Flake, who is widely seen as the favorite in the race, will give them their best shot in years at taking one of the state's two Senate seats. A push by moderate Democrat Richard Carmona, a former surgeon general under President George W. Bush, comes as the GOP is fighting to pick up four more seats to wrest control of the chamber in advance of votes on key policy issues such as the possible repeal of President Barack Obama's health care law and changes to the tax code. Arizona hasn't elected a Democrat to the Senate since Dennis DeConcini won his third term in 1988, but Democrats are hoping the primary attacks on Flake have weakened his standing and his bank account. ""Jeff Flake has been a little wounded by the primary,"" said Jim Pederson, a former Democratic Party chairman who lost an expensive race six years ago to Kyl. ""I think a lot of the issues that Wil brought up will kind of resonate with people. I think (the general election) is going to be very close."" Cardon spent $6 million of his own money trying to paint Flake as a Washington insider who reneged on past promises to limit his terms in office. Opponents pointed to Flake's little-known past as a Washington lobbyist for a uranium mine that was minority-owned by Iran. He also criticized Flake, saying he made a dramatic change on immigration, going from a supporter of comprehensive reform to backing policies that would first secure the border. For his part, Cardon was accused of painting himself as tough on immigration, while a company he partly owned was fined for faulty paperwork in hiring workers with questionable legal status. Cardon is widely seen as having begun to cede the race in the past month, turning positive in his campaign messages and ending months of expensive television ads. In Alaska, five Democrats are vying for the chance to challenge Republican U.S. Rep. Don Young, who has held his seat for 40 years. Young has two challengers, but is expected to easily win his primary. In Oklahoma, two Republicans and two Democrats are vying in runoff elections for their parties' nominations for the seat being vacated by Democratic Rep. Dan Boren. One or both major parties have primary races in all nine of Arizona's U.S. House districts, including the two-incumbent rivalry between freshman Republican Reps. Ben Quayle and David Schweikert in the 6th Congressional District centered on the Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale. Quayle moved into the district – the bulk of which he previously represented – after redistricting put him in a neighboring district considered more competitive with Democrats. Barber, a former aide to Giffords, was elected in June to serve out her term after she resigned to concentrate on her recovery from being shot in the head during a January 2011 mass shooting in Tucson. He faces a challenge from Democrat Matt Heinz, a former Arizona state rep. ___ Associated Press writer Paul Davenport contributed to this report.

PETA has once again made headlines in its endless crusade to...make headlines, this time by protesting the latest Pokémon game. ""Aside from the fact that this is clearly a lame attempt to attract publicity on the back of a major video game release,"" writes Forbes video game writer David Ewalt, ""PETA seems to have missed the single biggest theme of the Pokémon series: That Pokémon should be treated humanely and live as our equals."" The animal rights group has a long history of missing the point. They have an even longer history of trying to gain attention whether or not that attention will further their supposed cause. Nor is this the first time the anti-Pokémon group has come out against video games and their digital ""cruelty"" toward animals. I can count four other times video games have come into the PETA crosshairs.  1. PETA urges players to save the seals in World of Warcraft Way, way back in 2009 PETA urged its members to log in to World of Warcraft and do battle against seal hunters in the Level 70+ region of the Howling Fjord where apparently Horde players were clubbing a bunch of digital baby seals to death. ""Thrall refused to ban the slaughter of seals, despite multiple requests from the Alliance to do so, because Orgrimmar stands to make a large profit from the fur,"" PETA said in a blog post on the matter. Talk about slacktivism. This might all seem like good, clean fun - a way to get the kids involved maybe - if it weren't for what happened to Mario two years later. 2. PETA launches an anti-Mario campaign over the Tanooki suit Not only did PETA launch an anti Mario campaign in 2011 over his famous Tanooki suit, they made a violent, bloody browser-based video game about it - the spiritual predecessor, if you will, to their little Pokémon game. The really ludicrous thing about this campaign is that the Tanooki suit was first spotted in North America in 1990, when the suit was discovered by multitudes of gamers (including yours truly) in Super Mario Bros. 3. It was a delightful find, too, giving us the power of flight. This is why millions of gamers, to this day, wear raccoon suits and other fur items wherever we go. Of course, PETA would have none of it - 21 years later - stating that ""Tanukis are real-life raccoon dogs who are beaten and, as PETA's undercover exposés show, often skinned alive for their fur."" Just like in Super Mario Bros. 3. Call of Duty is apparently violent toward animals When I think about Call of Duty I often think about killing people. And not just because the franchise has gone so far down hill. Also because that's what you do in Call of Duty. You kill and kill and kill some more. And most of the organic life forms you shoot full of bullets or burn to death happen to be homo sapiens. But according to PETA, the real problem with Call of Duty is that it contains cruelty to dogs. Mercifully, the anti-fun organization decided to forgo making a hideously violent 2D sidescroller and instead sent Activision a care basket including copies of Nintendogs. 4. Watch Out Dishonored, PETA says Battlefield 3 is cruel to rats  There must be an ethical dilemma when it comes to cats and rats. Cats kill rats, and that - if I'm not mistaken - qualifies as cruelty toward animals. So what's to be done with the cats? Pretty soon we have a reverse of the Old Lady Who Swallowed A Fly rhyme on our hands. But I digress. In 2011, a German wing of PETA protested Battlefield 3 over its cruelty to rats. Apparently in one mission you can stab a rat with a knife. Having spent the last few days hacking entire swarms of rats to death, I can only imagine what the organization will have to say about Arkane Studios' latest assassin game, Dishonored. I mean, I don't suppose it matters that it was them or me.... 5. PETA spoofs indie game Super Meat Boy by making Super Tofu Boy I knew I missed something. Here's a latecomer to the #5 slot. PETA made a spoof of the hit indie game Super Meat Boy by casting Meat Boy as the new villain and Tofu boy as the new hero. Developer Team Meat responded later by adding Tofu Boy as a playable character. What's Missing? There are many glaring holes in PETA's protests of video games. No Duck Hunt? No Big Game Hunter? What gives? Oh, and thanks to jerks like me covering this bad crazy, you can probably expect a bunch more browser-based games from the video game developer qua animal rights group qua attention-mongers. Though this last one must violate copyright...mustn't it? In all seriousness though, this is like the flimsier version of the ""Shooter killed 15 people because of Call of Duty"" argument we see every time the press encounters a mass shooting with even the most tangential relationship to video games. And I know...I really do...none of this should get us riled up, and we'd all be better off ignoring it. But I can't help myself. It's all so silly, how can we not pay attention to it? At some point the folks at PETA are going to need to do some soul-searching and figure out how they can be taken seriously again. These video game stunts are far milder than many of the crazy practices the organization engages in on a regular basis, some of which have real-world repercussions especially to medical advances.

The attorney general's office filed the appeal Thursday in state Supreme Court. In March, a jury in Montgomery County returned a wrongful death verdict against the state. Jurors awarded each family $4 million but a judge later reduced the damages to $100,000 for each family. Attorneys claim several lower court errors should reverse that verdict.

We've received your submission. FORT WORTH, Texas — An Army appeals court will hear arguments today about an issue that has indefinitely postponed the murder trial for the suspect in the worst mass shooting on a US military installation: his beard. Maj. Nidal Hasan, charged in the 2009 shooting rampage at Fort Hood in Texas, has appealed the trial judge’s order that he will be forcibly shaved before his court-martial unless he shaves himself. The Army psychiatrist argues that the order violates his religious rights. The American-born Muslim has said he grew a beard because his faith requires it, and that he believes dying without a beard is a sin. Hasan, 42, faces the death penalty or life in prison without parole if convicted in the Nov. 5, 2009, attack that killed 13 people and wounded more than two dozen others at the sprawling Army post, which is about 130 miles southwest of Dallas. His court-martial was set for August, but all court proceedings in the case have been put on hold as the beard issue goes through the appeals process. The US Army Court of Criminal Appeals at Fort Belvoir in Virginia will hear oral arguments. The court also will hear from government attorneys who have said forcibly shaving Hasan would not violate his religious rights, and that the judge has the authority to enforce the Army rule prohibiting beards. Hasan will not be at the hearing, Fort Hood officials said. It’s unclear when the court will make a decision, which could be appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. The Army has specific guidelines on forced shaving. A team of five military police officers restrains the inmate “with the reasonable force necessary,” and a medical professional is on hand in case of injuries. The shaving must be done with electric clippers and must be videotaped, according to Army rules. Hasan would not be the first military defendant forcibly shaved. The Army has done it to five inmates since 2005, including one person who was forcibly shaved twice, according to the Army’s Office of the Chief of Staff. The US Army Court of Criminal Appeals said it also will consider whether the trial judge should be removed from Hasan’s case. Defense attorneys claim that the judge, Col. Gregory Gross, exceeded his authority by issuing the shaving order. His attorneys also want the court to overturn the six contempt of court rulings issued against Hasan for having a beard at pretrial hearings this summer, when he first showed up in court with facial hair. Gross has said Hasan’s beard is a disruption and that defense attorneys have not proven that he is growing it for sincere religious reasons. Army prosecutors claim that Hasan grew the beard just before the trial was to start, so that witnesses would not be able to identify him in court. Share Selection"

We've received your submission. DENVER — Some Colorado fans are upset after music superstar Madonna used guns during a performance in a community that is still raw from a mass shooting at a local theater and a violent summer that includes the unsolved slaying of a 10-year-old girl. Madonna’s second act at her show Thursday night at the Pepsi Center in Denver featured the 54-year-old singer using a fake gun to shoot a masked gunman and images of blood splattering on a large screen behind the stage. She used the set for her performances in other cities for the song “Gang Bang,” which includes the lyrics “shot my lover in the head.” “We’re dancing and all of a sudden people started realizing what the song was,” said concert-goer Aaron Fransua, 25, who was in section 120. “We all just stood there. Everybody who was around me all had shock on their face. I heard a lot of ‘wows,'” Fransua said. Mile High Sports Radio Denver personality Peter Burns, who was in another section, said the people around him began murmuring when the song came on. “You could see people kinda looking at each other,” Burns said. “I heard the word ‘Colorado,’ you know, ‘Aurora,’ ‘shooting.’ You could hear people talking about it and it was little bit unsettling. I saw two or three people get up and grab their stuff and actually leave their seats.” The scene reminded some concert-goers of the July 20 shooting at an Aurora theater where a gunman dressed in black and wearing a helmet, body armor and a gas mask stepped through a side door and opened fire with a semi-automatic rifle and pistols, killing 12 people and injuring at least another 58, some of whom may be disabled for life. Burns was friends with Jessica Ghawi, 24, who died in the shooting. “It sort of hits closer to home for me,” he said. The Denver metro-area is still reeling from the unsolved abduction and slaying of Jessica Ridgeway, and on Thursday before the concert, police announced they had three suspects in custody in the slaying of five people at a bar and grill in east Denver. Denver television stations said they received a number of complaints Friday from concert-goers saying they were offended she used guns and violence as part of her show in light of the recent shootings. Her press agent, Liz Rosenberg, said Friday that there was no way to eliminate the scene, because it is a core part of the show. “It’s like taking out the third act of Hamlet,” she said. Rosenberg said Madonna’s style is to shake things up. “Madonna does not make things pretty and tie them up with a bow,” she said. In a statement before beginning the tour, Madonna said she does not condone the use of guns. “Rather they are symbols of wanting to appear strong and wanting to find a way to stop feelings that I find hurtful or damaging,” she said. She said she is using the guns as symbols of intolerance and “the pain I have felt from having my heart broken.” Both Burns and Fransua said they took the act as just part of the show, though both felt uneasy about it. “It would have highly upset me if I felt this was something that she added,” for the Denver show, Burns said. “But you know this, that song, that production will be played in 50 other cities and Denver would be the only city that would have some major issues.” Share Selection"

The organizations used the names and images of the victims to raise money without permission from the victims or family members, 9News reports. In September, the 7/20 Recovery Committee, a group of volunteers from government bodies, non-profits and community organizations set up to distribute services, goods and funds donated to help the victims and survivors, released a statement addressing the issue: ""We appreciate that this is a difficult situation and we know from other past tragic events that creating a distribution plan requires a thoughtful and inclusive process,"" the statement read.

The lawsuit alleges the Cinemark failed to provide sufficient security and training for a theater where shootings had occurred in the past, failed to provide alarms on ""emergency exits"" that would have alerted staff to the open door and failed to evacuate customers once the shooting began. James Holmes, a former neuroscience graduate student, has been charged in the July 20 shooting that resulted in 12 deaths and 57 injuries during the Aurora premier of the Batman film The Dark Knight Rises. Police say the gunman entered the theater after buying a ticket, then propped open an emergency exit door and returned with weapons for the rampage. ""It's negligence,"" attorney Marc Bern of the firm Napoli Bern Ripka Shkolnik said after filing the lawsuit in Arapahoe County District Court. ""We think that after discovery, we'll be able to prove their conduct was willful and wanton and we'll be eligible for punitive damages as well as compensatory."" Cinemark would not comment on the lawsuit. In motions to dismiss other lawsuits that were previously filed in connection with the shooting, it said the incident was not foreseeable. In previous motions, Cinemark has said the exit doors were not emergency exits and that no previous shooting had occurred in the theater. Several other wrongful death and personal injury lawsuits have been filed in federal court alleging security lapses in the theater that night. The lawsuit names Century Theaters, Cinemark USA and two theater employees and 10 unnamed employees listed as John Does 1 through 10."

Filed under: How one developer known for unique freeware is breaking into commercial games Jonatan Söderström — also known by the alias Cactus — is well-regarded in indie gaming circles for his rapid-fire development of an eclectic library of games. His creations include everything from a racing game filled with men who think they're cars to the psychedelic, IGF award winning puzzler Tuning. But despite their diversity, all of his games have had at least one thing in common: they're free to play. With the upcoming Hotline Miami, however, he's delving into the world of commercial releases for the first time. And he's bringing a friend along for the ride.  The action is brutal, difficult, and incredibly violent Söderström has teamed up with Dennis Wedin — whom he previously worked with on the freeware game Keyboard Drumset Fucking Werewolf — to form Dennaton Games, the two-person studio behind Hotline Miami. And though the game is destined to be sold, the team hasn't skimped when it comes to outlandish ideas. Set in 1980s Miami, the game is centered around a series of mysterious messages that are left on the main character's answering machine. Each message will send you to a different part of the city, and each time you reach your destination you'll be accosted by a violent gang of thugs that you'll need to dispatch. The action is brutal, difficult, and incredibly violent, inspired by films like Drive and Kick-Ass. Things also take a turn for the surreal when you factor in the masks. These animal disguises not only add a bizarre element to the visuals, but provide the main character with unique abilities to aid in battle. Between these masks and Hotline Miami's premise, violence, and retro-yet-grungy visual style, the game is somewhat of a niche project. But it's also arguably Söderström's most approachable release so far — potentially making it just the game to bring his unique sensibilities to a wider audience.  ""Last couple of times I tried making something commercial I got into a weird mindset where I tried to anticipate what the audience might want instead of just trying to make a great game,"" he says. ""That went completely wrong for me, and I don't advise anyone to have that as a key consideration when doing game design. I do however think that you need to consider if your game will turn out marketable at all if you need the money, just not let it steer the direction your game's heading to any greater extent."" And sadly, money is a concern with the release of Hotline Miami. After years of making games and giving them away for free, releasing a commercial game was simply a way to help Söderström keep his head above water. ""The reason we went this way with Hotline Miami was simply that I've been running out of money since February this year,"" he says. ""I've had to live off of savings since then and now they're about to run out so I hope we can finish the game very soon."" ""I just want enough so I can keep doing games with Jonatan."" His expectations are relatively modest, however, as he says he'll be happy if the game sells enough copies to fund a few more releases from Dennaton. Wedin has a similar mindset, saying that ""I just want enough so I can keep doing games with Jonatan and don't have to worry too much about getting myself a new pair of shoes or a new skateboard."" Of course, there are aspects that could make it a somewhat difficult sell. In particular, the sheer level of violence on display can be startling. Killing someone in Hotline Miami is satisfying in a way because of how difficult it can be to successfully take out foes, but it can also be uncomfortable. This isn't a game about clean sniper shots or bloodless fist fights, it's the kind of violence that sticks with you. Killing doesn't always feel good. Started revamping the blood and gore effects in Hotline Miami today.  ""I've had some concerns with games that try to portray violence as a clean act that doesn't really have that much of an impact on the player,"" says Söderström. ""I feel that in a way it's a little bit irresponsible to portray it as something stylish, cool, or funny when it's really not. So we tried our best to make it look discomforting."" It's also not the only aspect of the game designed to mess with players. The duo says that Hotline Miami's ending is ""a bit bold,"" which by Söderström's standards could mean that players are in for a real surprise. As anyone who has played his short, disturbing game Norrland knows, Söderström isn't afraid to turn a seemingly shallow experience on its head at the very end. ""I'm looking forward to seeing players discuss the game over the internet,"" says Wedin.  Even though the game is essentially an arcade experience, the pair says that it has layers for those interested in digging a bit deeper. That's not to say that there will be multitudes of cut-scenes or dialog to click through, but instead Wedin says that ""we let the environment tell the story."" ""The game's always felt like it's about a month away from completion."" Hotline Miami is destined for a PC release later this year, and Söderström says that there are plenty of ideas that didn't make it into the game. So many in fact, that depending on its success, fans can likely expect to see a sequel or extra content in the form of DLC sometime in the future. And outside of the world of Hotline Miami, Dennaton already has three additional projects planned. But for now the focus is on Hotline Miami — a game which has already received some praise, winning the ""Most Fantastic Game to be Later Cited By the Mainstream Media As the Reason For a Mass Shooting"" award at Fantastic Arcade in Austin — and while we don't have a firm release date, from the sounds of it the launch isn't too far off. ""The game's always felt like it's about a month away from completion,"" says Söderström, ""and by now it's likely less than two weeks left so we haven't ever really been sweating about it.""

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: DENVER—A man wounded in the mass shooting at a Colorado movie theater is appearing in a nationwide television spot aimed at drawing attention to gun violence as part of the upcoming presidential debates. Stephen Barton, 22, of Southbury, Conn., was among the 58 people injured in the July 20 attack in Aurora that also left 12 people dead. Barton was bicycling across the country and staying with a friend the night of the shooting. He now does victim outreach and policy research for Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which helped produce the ad that began airing Monday. In the 30-second TV spot, Barton urges people to ask themselves during the debates which candidate has a plan to stop gun violence. Filmed inside an empty movie theater, Barton talks about his experience during the shooting as photos are shown of jagged gunshot wounds to his face and neck. “I was lucky. In the next four years, 48,000 Americans won’t be so lucky, because they’ll be murdered with guns in the next president’s term, enough to fill over 200 theaters,” Barton says in the ad. Meanwhile, the families of eight people killed in the theater shooting joined the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence to urge the moderator of Wednesday’s debate to ask President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney about gun violence. “To ignore the problem of gun violence in a state where two of the worst shootings in U.S. history took place—Aurora and Columbine—would not only be noticeable by its absence but would slight the memories of our loved ones killed,” the letter said. Jim Lehrer of PBS is moderating the event at the University of Denver. Obama and Romney have been largely quiet about guns during the campaign, except when prodded about high-profile cases. Obama has supported a renewed ban on assault-type weapons, and he blames Congress for opposing such measures. The president also has signed laws allowing people to carry concealed weapons in national parks and in checked bags on Amtrak trains. Romney says he thinks the nation needs tougher enforcement of gun laws already on the books, not new gun laws. The key is to identify deranged or distressed people and keep them from carrying out terrible acts, he says. The TV ad featuring Barton is part of the “Demand A Plan” campaign led by shooting survivors and Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a bipartisan group of more than 725 mayors who advocate closing what they say are loopholes in laws designed to prevent felons, domestic violence offenders, people who are seriously mentally ill and other dangerous people from obtaining firearms. “Especially now, given what’s happened in the past few months with guns and these mass shootings, I don’t think there is a better opportunity to talk about this,” Barton told The Associated Press. Barton said it’s frustrating that the candidates have shied away from gun policy, and he hopes the new ad will start a conversation about gun violence and how to stop it. “At some point we have to demand a certain level of courage and independence among politicians,” he said. “At some point you just have to expect more, even in an election season.” The ad, which does not endorse Obama or Romney, indicates it was paid for by the United Against Illegal Guns Support Fund, the fundraising arm for Mayors Against Illegal Guns. ——— Online: http://www.demandaplan.org/bartonad Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts As you comment, please be respectful of other commenters and other viewpoints.

Assistant public defender David Klaus told a superior court judge that his client is refusing to speak to him and that a mental evaluation is necessary to determine if Goh, 43, is fit to stand trial. Under California law, Klaus’ request immediately placed the case on hold as the court directs two psychologists to evaluate Goh to determine if he understands the charges filed against him and if he can properly assist Klaus in his defense. Klaus’ request, however, appeared to agitate Goh, who yelled something to the judge after Klaus said he wanted to determine if Goh was mentally fit to stand trial. Goh’s statement to the court could not be heard but afterward he looked at his attorney and shook his head left to right. Goh is accused of killing six students and a receptionist at the struggling Oikos University that was located in a building near Oakland International Airport. Goh, who was once enrolled at the school but dropped out, was supposedly upset that the school refused to refund his tuition after he decided not to take classes. The killing spree began on the morning of April 2 inside the small university on Edgewater Drive in Oakland when, police say, Goh walked into a classroom and started shooting students. Goh allegedly used a .45-caliber handgun and brought four additional magazines with him to the school. After the shootings, Goh stole a student’s car and drove to a Safeway in Alameda, where he called a family member and said that he killed students, police say. Oakland police Chief Howard Jordan had said Goh walked into the Safeway store and asked a clerk if he could use a telephone. The clerk stood by as Goh called a relative, Jordan said, and overheard the suspect talking about the shooting. The clerk notified store security, who detained Goh and called Alameda police, Jordan said. In interviews with Oakland police, Goh admitted that he went to the college with a .45-caliber handgun and four loaded magazines, that he kidnapped a woman in an office and took her to a classroom, that he shot several people and that he took the car keys of one of his victims and left in the victim’s vehicle, according to the affidavit. After his arrest, Goh went on a hunger strike at Santa Rita Jail, telling authorities that he was refusing to eat because he was ashamed of what he did, the sheriff’s department has said. Since that hunger strike, Goh looked thinner than he was in his booking photo taken the day of the shooting, and on Monday he looked thinner still. Goh has pleaded not guilty to the crimes.

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: OAK CREEK, Wis.—All of India shares the pain of Wisconsin Sikhs as they grapple with the aftermath of a mass shooting at a suburban Milwaukee temple, the country’s foreign minister said Thursday during a visit to the temple. S.M Krishna, India’s external affairs minister, Nirupama Rao, the country’s ambassador to the United States, and Dutta Toma, counsel general of India in Chicago, toured the temple in Oak Creek for about an hour and half. Krishna addressed about 150 Sikhs in the temple’s hall, reassuring them that the Indian government and its people were behind them. The Sikh faith has roughly 27 million followers worldwide, and the vast majority live in India. “I convey the sympathy of a billion people,” he said, referring to India’s total population. “I come here not only to offer prayers at this sacred temple but to express our deepest condolences.” The Sikh community is still struggling to come to grips with the shocking attack on Aug. 5. Wade Michael Page, a 40-year-old Army veteran and white supremacist, arrived at the temple before Sunday services and opened fire with a 9 mm handgun. He killed six worshippers and injured three others. He also wounded Oak Creek Police Lt. Brian Murphy as the officer responded to the scene. Page killed himself minutes later, after he was wounded in a firefight with another officer. Page’s motives remain unclear. The FBI declared the attack an act of domestic terrorism but is still investigating what drove Page and whether he had any help. Milwaukee FBI spokesman Leonard Peace said Thursday that probe is still ongoing and declined further comment. Sikhs contend they’re often mistaken for Muslims because they wear beards and turbans. Temple members pushed the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee at a hearing last month to start collecting data on hate crimes against Sikhs. Still, reminders of the shooting were everywhere in the temple Thursday. Banners signed by hundreds of well-wishers plastered the walls. A piece of paper with the direct number to the Oak Creek Police Department hung on a bulletin board, and an armed private security guard patrolled the parking lot. The dignitaries stopped at Froedtert Hospital to visit Punjab Singh, a shooting victim who remains in serious condition, then moved on to the temple. The group got a warm welcome replete with handshakes and bowed heads. They then filed into the temple’s main hall. The congregation sat cross-legged on the floor as Krishna relayed the condolences of the Indian government and people. He said the shooting was even more tragic because it took place in a place of worship and peace. “All right-thinking people have condemned this dastardly act,” he said. “The entire Indian nation and government are behind you, and the entire United States government and people are behind you.” Rao and Tuma did not speak. Temple trustee Harcharan Gill then led the group around the building, explaining how Page mounted his attack. Then Krishna, Rao and Toma spent about fifteen minutes meeting behind closed doors with the victims’ families. Afterward Krishna held a brief news conference in the temple’s foyer, telling reporters he appreciated that President Barack Obama expressed his condolences to Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who is a Sikh. Again he told temple members “the whole nation is behind you. The whole of India is behind you and can rest assured we will stand united with you.” Rao said the entourage admired perseverance of the victims’ families and promised to help them. Rahul Dubey, the 26-year-old godson of temple president Satwant Singh Kaleka, whom Page killed after Kaleka attacked him a butter knife, said he appreciated the visit, calling it a “good thought for the Indian government.” He said the congregation has been living a nightmare since the shootings. He called Page a psychopath but insisted the Sikhs don’t hate him. “Forgiveness, that’s what we do,” Dubey said. “We practice peace.” Kaleka’s brother, Jagjit Singh Kaleka, said his brother died a martyr and met his death with courage. He wasn’t impressed with all the pomp and circumstance, calling the visit a token political gesture. “I really don’t expect anything from them,” he said.

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: FORT BELVOIR, Va.—An Army appeals court on Thursday questioned whether a military judge exceeded his authority in ordering the suspect in the 2009 shooting rampage at Fort Hood, Texas, to remove his beard or be forcibly shaved. Judges on the U.S. Army Court of Criminal Appeals in northern Virginia also delved into a claim by Maj. Nidal Hasan’s lawyers that the military judge who issued the order is biased and should be replaced. The American-born Muslim psychiatrist claims he grew his beard for religious reasons. Hasan’s murder trial in Texas is on hold while his lawyers pursue the appeal. Hasan, 42, faces the death penalty or life in prison without parole if convicted in the Nov. 5, 2009, attack that killed 13 people and wounded more than two dozen others at the Army post about 130 miles southwest of Dallas. Hasan’s attorneys also want the appeals court to overturn six contempt-of-court rulings Col. Gregory Gross issued against Hasan for having a beard at pretrial hearings this past summer, when he first showed up in court with facial hair. Army grooming standards prohibit beards but allow for religious exceptions. Gross denied Hasan’s request for such an exception. He found that Hasan’s claims of religious sincerity did not outweigh prosecutor’s arguments that Hasan grew the beard just before his August trial date so witnesses wouldn’t be able to identify him in court. Six of the seven judges on the appeals court questioned lawyers for both sides Thursday, mainly about the limits of Gross’ authority and the perception of impartiality. Defense attorney Capt. Kristin McGrory said military judges have no authority to order forcible shaving. She said military regulations authorize it for inmates only for safety and health reasons. She also disputed Gross’ assertion that the beard would be a disruption during Hasan’s trial. “The fact that he’s wearing a beard does not materially interfere with the course of the trial,” McGrory told the panel. Chief Judge Col. William Kern repeatedly asked government attorney Capt. Kenneth Borgnino whether Gross had put his impartiality in question by issuing the order instead of leaving it up to Hasan’s chain of command. Hasan hasn’t been charged with a grooming violation. Judge Col. Steven Haight asked Borgnino: “Is it appropriate for the command to virtually punt the forcible shaving issue over to the military judge?” Borgnino said Gross was merely controlling his courtroom. He said a bearded Hasan at trial would be as offensive to the judge and jury as an obscene signboard. “This isn’t a situation where he’s missing a button off his uniform,” Borgnino said. Allowing the beard, he said, “would be to cede control of the courtroom to the whims of the accused.” It’s unclear when the court will make a decision, which could be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. The Fort Hood rampage was the worst mass shooting ever at a U.S. military installation. Hasan remains jailed. ——— Angela K. Brown in Fort Worth, Texas, contributed to this report.

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: RICHMOND, Va.—The state moved Thursday to reverse a wrongful death verdict in the 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech while the parents of two students killed want the university’s president to stand trial for failing to alert the campus when the first gunshots rang out. The separate appeals were filed in the state Supreme Court within 24 hours of each other. A jury in March found the state negligent in the deaths of Erin N. Peterson and Julia K. Pryde and awarded their families $4 million each. A judge in June upheld the negligence finding but reduced the jury’s award to $100,000 for each family, the highest amount allowed under a cap on damages against the state. The women were among 32 faculty and students killed on April 16, 2007, on Tech’s Blacksburg campus. Student gunman Seung-Hui Cho also killed himself in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. While the actions that morning of Steger, campus police and other university leaders were put under the microscope in a courtroom, the president and other officials were dismissed from the case before trial, leaving the state as the lone defendant. Attorneys for the parents argued successfully that Steger and other university officials waited too long after the first two students were shot in a dormitory to alert the campus of the violence. The gunman was still at large. In his appeal, attorney Robert T. Hall cites a policy adopted by Tech’s Board of Visitors that recognizes the school’s responsibility to provide a safe campus for its students. “The policy required university relations and the university police to make the campus community aware of crimes … in a timely fashion and in such a way as to aid in the prevention of similar occurrences,” Hall wrote in the appeal, filed late Wednesday and provided to The Associated Press. In its appeal, the state said the parents failed to support their claims and cited trial errors, including the judge’s instructions to jurors in which they were told the university “should have reasonably foreseen” Cho’s actions and had a duty to immediately warn the campus of a gunman who remained at large. The state said university officials had no statutory duty to do so and there were no assurances Pryde and Peterson would have survived even if they were warned earlier. “The events of April 16, 2007, represent an unprecedented tragedy,” the state said in its appeal. “Something the scope of which had never occurred previously on a college campus in Virginia or elsewhere played out that day, and dozens of people, including Peterson and Pryde, lost their lives.” The state is seeking a reversal of the jury’s verdict and final judgment by Supreme Court justices or a new trial. During the trial, Steger and other university officials testified that police investigators had concluded that the first shootings had all the signs of targeted domestic violence, and not the work of someone intent on mass killing.  They delayed fully informing the campus of the shootings even though the gunman remained unaccounted for and they pursued a lead that was fruitless. Steger said he heeded the advice of police investigators at the scene. A full alert informing the campus of the first shootings wasn’t released until 2  1/2 hours later as Cho concluded his killing spree at Norris Hall, chaining the doors of the classroom building to ensure students and faculty could not flee and killing 30. Peterson and Pryde were among the dead in Norris. While a Tech spokesman said the university had not seen the parents’ appeal, he said “university leaders acted appropriately in the events leading up to, during, and after the tragic events of April 16, 2007.” “An unthinkable, horrible crime occurred that day by the hands of Seung-Hui Cho,” spokesman Mark Owczarski said in a statement Thursday. “The university community has shown uncommon strength during a challenging and painful period that has united alumni, students, faculty and staff more tightly than ever. We are resolved to learn from the tragedy. We remember the lives lost. We honor them and always will.” Besides accountability, taking Steger to trial would also increase the prospect of larger damages for the Petersons and Prydes, perhaps up to $2 million from the state’s risk management plan.

An Army appeals court ruled Thursday a judge can order Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan to appear clean shaven at his court-martial, the Los Angeles Times reported.

The 42-year-old Army psychiatrist is a U.S.-born Muslim who began growing a beard in jail after being arrested in the mass shooting. He has said he believes he is close to death and that shaving now would be a sin.
Military prosecutors say Hasan grew the beard to make it more difficult for witnesses to identify him at trial, as the suspect shaved during his time in the Army.
The court's decision came after victims of the attack released a video calling for the massacre to be deemed an act of terrorism.
""It's disgraceful that they don't want to recognize the soldiers for their sacrifice. I mean, they were fighting a domestic enemy, they were killed and wounded by a domestic enemy, somebody who was there that day to kill soldiers and prevent them from deploying,"" Staff Sgt. Shawn Manning, who was shot six times during the attack, says in the video. ""If that's not an act of terrorism, I don't know what is.""

If convicted for the Nov. 5, 2009, attack in which 13 people were killed and more than 20 people injured, Hasan faces the death penalty or life in prison without parole.

Hanks dropped an F-bomb on “Good Morning America” Friday, just seconds after he predicted he might.
“GMA” host Elizabeth Vargas asked Hanks to speak in the same accent he does in his new movie, “Cloud Atlas.” Hanks said it would be tricky, since so much of the dialogue is swear words. He tried, and failed.
Hanks apologized profusely, as did Vargas, and Hanks made another prediction: that his next appearance on the show will come with a seven second delay. 


A rep for ABC said the situation was “corrected” for all subsequent feeds of the show.
JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE NOW JESSICA BIEL’S HUSBAND: Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel got married Friday.
E! News reports the longtime couple traded vows in front of family and close friends at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the southern Italian city of Fasano.
“It’s great to be married, the ceremony was beautiful and it was so special to be surrounded by our family and friends,” the newlyweds said in a statement to People.
Jimmy Fallon and his wife Nancy Juvonen, Andy Samberg, Timbaland, ‘N Sync alum Chris Kirkpatrick, Biel’s 7th Heaven sister Beverley Mitchell, and music manager Johnny Wright and his wife Erika were among the VIPs in attendance. 


The festivities kicked off a few days earlier with a casual beach party on Wednesday night (if you consider a 10-minute fireworks show “casual”), followed the next day with dinner and drinks in Trappeto.
Private security was tight everywhere the wedding party went. A source told E! News that guests were asked to sign nondisclosure agreements to ensure that the details of the wingding stayed private.
Why? Did they sacrifice a goat or something? 
No word on whether the newlyweds are honeymooning elsewhere.
BRITNEY SPEARS ACCUSED OF DRUG ADDICTION: This may become more fun than a good, old-fashioned O.J. trial.
Sam Lutfi’s defamation case against Britney Spears’ mother only started Friday, yet his lawyer has already alleged that Spears overdosed on amphetamines the night in 2008 she was placed on a psychiatric hold, shaved her head during her 2007 meltdown because she was afraid her hair held evidence of drug use, was addicted to Adderall, and frequently used crystal meth.
Sounds like someone liked to stay awake.
Oh, and Lutfi also alleges Spears’ father Jamie once attacked him.
Wow. I can’t wait to hear what happens after lunch.
Lutfi is suing Lynne Spears over her book, in which she claimed Lutfi controlled Spears and her career through drugs, calling him a “Svengali” figure. After a series if bizarre incidents and strange behavior, Spears was placed in a conservatorship overseen by her father — and later joined by her fiance Jason Trawick — in which they control her finances and have largely put her life and career back on track.
Lutfi’s lawyer Joseph Schleimer admitted in opening statements that Lutfi used Adderall (an amphetamine) for ADD, but he was adamant he never gave her any. Schleimer also said Lutfi repeatedly tried getting Spears off drugs, without success. Schleimer said Lutfi wanted to bring a new team in — he called it “the varsity team” — to help save her.
Schleimer also said Lutfi brought a drug-sniffing dog into Spears’ house and found a baggie of crystal meth and tried to get Spears to meet with a psychiatrist two days before she overdosed, but Spears refused.
And since they were already there, Lutfi’s lawyer said her former self-styled manager tried desperately to talk her out of doing what turned out to be her disastrous 2007 MTV Video Music Awards performance because she was overweight and hadn’t rehearsed, but she refused.
Yeah, maybe I can see that one … .
And because that wasn’t enough, Schleimer also said Jamie Spears attacked Lutfi, punching Sam and knocking the wind out of him.
Sounds like his wind has returned.
Team Spears hasn’t had the chance to respond yet. Expect many exciting updates here as the action progresses
LINDSAY LOHAN DIDN’T SHOW UP FOR WORK: Lindsay Lohan didn’t show up Wednesday for a voice-over gig for her upcoming movie.
Maybe it’s a better idea to tell her not to show up somewhere if you want her there.
Bret Easton Ellis — who wrote Lindsay’s new film “The Canyons” — claims Lohan missed her automatic dialogue replacement session Wednesday. He posted a tweet saying he sent his bloodthirsty character from his 1991 book “American Psycho” over to find her.
Those two would make a cute couple. 
He tweeted, “Patrick Bateman has just headed over to Lindsay Lohan’s hotel to confront her as to why she missed her (expletive) ADR on ‘The Canyons’ today… .”
Well, everyone knows Lohan isn’t the most punctual person. She may have been busy crashing her car or something.
PATTINSON AND STEWART DISPLAYING AFFECTION: Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart were photographed kissing Wednesday by Stewart’s pool at her new home, according to celebrity website PopSugar.
OMG and 😉 and however you make little hearts with exclamation points behind them.
And that’s just the reaction for the movie studio execs. You should see how the Twihards are reacting.
The 22-year-old actress shared a loving embrace and kiss with Pattinson, 26, before changing into her bikini and going for a dip.
The “Twilight” actors have been slowly entering back into the spotlight following Stewart’s affair in July with her married “Snow White and the Huntsman” director Rupert Sanders.
On Monday, Pattinson and Stewart were photographed for the first time in public together having an intimate chat outside a Los Angeles bar. 
Stewart recently purchased a new 3,361-square-foot, 4-bedroom, 4-bath home, in the trendy neighborhood of Los Feliz, less than two miles from the home she used to share with Pattinson. She reportedly paid $2.2 million for the house, which, apparently, does not include some kind of barricade to keep the paparazzi from shooting pictures of her pool.
While their reconciliation is convenient for the beginning of “The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn — Part 2” promotions in November, a source told Us Weekly “they have a very deep connection.”
“He started thinking nobody else would understand his life,” an insider said. “His rational voice told him not to toss a three-year relationship for one infidelity.”
MADONNA INSENSITIVE TO COLORADO: Madonna apparently doesn’t get much news on her planet.
The singer started her show Thursday night at the Pepsi Center in Denver with a gun scene, which she has used in previous performances.
According to KUSA-TV, the station received several calls Friday from concertgoers saying they were offended Madonna used guns and violence as part of her show in light of recent events in Colorado that included a mass shooting at a theater during a Batman movie on July 20 that left 12 people dead.
Yeah, well, you think that’s bad? Madonna has had her heart broken and stuff, you guys.
In a statement before beginning the tour, Madonna said she does not condone the use of guns. She said she is using the guns as symbols of intolerance and “the pain I have felt from having my heart broken.”
It’s Madonna’s world. Colorado just lives in it.

Two lawsuits filed Friday against Cinemark USA Inc., owner of Century Aurora 16, allege negligence on the part of the corporation because the theater lacked adequate security or sufficient alarm systems. ""Although the theater was showing a midnight premier of the movie and was expecting large crowds of people to attend the midnight showing, no security personnel were present for that showing,"" according to both lawsuits, which were filed by the same law firm. ""The exterior doors to the theater were lacking in any alarm system, interlocking security systems, or any other security or alarm features."" Opinion: Brain science key in trial of alleged 'Batman' shooter James Holmes, 24, is accused of opening fire on a crowded theater during the July 20 midnight showing of the latest Batman movie, ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Fifty-eight people were wounded in the attack. The lawsuits were filed in U.S. District Court in Colorado on behalf of Joshua Nowlan, Denise Traynom and Brandon Axelrod. Iraq war veteran Nowlan, 31, and newlyweds Axelrod, 30, and Traynom, 24, were at the theater together when the shooting occurred. ""Josh helped me protect my wife, and he got shot. It wasn't expected. But I'm glad he was there with us because the three of us together, we piled on each other and we kept each other safe. And you know, luck or faith, whatever you want to call it, kept us alive,"" Axelrod told CNN in an interview shortly after the shooting. ""Josh, while we were hugging each other in the aisle, got hit in the arm. And at some point, because he's so tall and lanky, he got hit in the leg, as well."" Prosecutors drop quest for movie-theater suspect's notebook The Denver law firm of Keating, Wagner, Polidori & Free, filed the lawsuits: One on behalf of Nowlan, the other on behalf of Traynom and Axelrod. According to the lawsuits, the gunman was able to go in and out of the theater several times undetected to retrieve a ""virtual arsenal of weapons, including, but not limited to, one or more fully loaded shotguns, an AR-15 assault rifle, one or more fully loaded, automatic Glock handguns, and several tear gas canisters."" Nowlan's right arm was nearly severed by a bullet, Traynom was shot in the buttocks and Axelrod injured his knee and ankle, according to the lawsuits. The lawsuits also allege that the theater's security guards were given the night off, even though there had been several previous criminal incidents. The lawsuits are seeking ""amount which will fully and fairly compensate each of them for damages, losses and injuries"" on behalf of the three victims. The lawsuits were filed the same day that Cinemark officials announced a plan to reconfigure the movie theater and reopen it by the beginning of next year.

Maj. Nidal Hasan was admitted Saturday to Carl Darnal Medical Center on the Army base in Texas and is expected to be released within 48 hours, Fort Hood's public affairs office said. The military did not disclose why Hasan was in the hospital, citing federal government regulations against conveying patients' medical information. He was in ""good condition"" Monday, according to Fort Hood. His lead military attorney, Lt. Col. Chris Poppe, said only that his client wasn't suffering from a self-inflicted wound. Hasan is accused of opening fire at the large Army post's processing center, where soldiers were preparing to deploy to Afghanistan and Iraq, in November 2009. The solo attack left 32 people wounded, in addition to the 13 killed, while Hasan himself was paralyzed from the waist down after police officers exchanged fire with him. His court-martial tied to the shooting had been scheduled to start last month. But the Army Court of Criminal Appeals this month delayed its start indefinitely to determine whether his beard can be forcibly shaved during trial. Judge orders accused Fort Hood shooter to have his beard shaved If convicted, Hasan could be sentenced to death. A U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent, he was a licensed psychiatrist who joined the Army in 1997. He had been scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan before the killings, but had been telling his family since 2001 that he wanted to get out of the military. Hasan is a Muslim who had told his family he had been taunted after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Investigations tied to the Fort Hood shootings found he had been communicating via e-mail with Anwar al-Awlaki, the prominent and radical Yemeni-American cleric killed by a U.S. drone attack in 2011.

In a letter to debate moderator Jim Lehrer, relatives of eight of the 12 people who died at a midnight screening of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" in July urged him to ask the men who want to lead the country about mass shootings in Colorado at Wednesday night's debate. ""To ignore the problem of gun violence where two of the worst shootings in U.S. history took place - Aurora and Columbine - would not only be noticeable by its absence but would slight the memories of our loved ones killed,"" the letter said. James Holmes, a former neuroscience graduate student, has been charged with murder and attempted murder in the July 20 rampage, one of the worst U.S. outbursts of gun violence in recent years. In addition to those killed, 58 people were wounded. That rampage took place about 15 miles (24 km) from the scene of a 1999 shooting at Columbine High School, where two students shot dead a teacher and 12 students before committing suicide. A spokesman for the Public Broadcasting System's ""NewsHour"" show that Lehrer hosts said the group's letter was passed along to him and that Lehrer was en route to Denver for the debate at the University of Denver and not available for comment. Talk of reining in America's gun culture is considered politically risky for Obama ahead of the November election. He called for an end to ""senseless violence"" after the movie theater shootings and another this summer at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin but has been careful not to take a stand on gun control. Romney has said that additional laws would not have stopped the massacre. In a separate initiative, a man wounded in the theater shooting, Stephen Barton, appears in a television ad that will air nationally this week in which he asks the candidates to explain how they would reduce gun violence. ""I never thought I'd be a shooting victim until I was bleeding on a floor in Aurora,"" Barton said in a statement. ""I was lucky, but I've seen what happens when dangerous people get their hands on guns. And I think it's fair to ask the men who want to lead the country to get past the platitudes and give us a serious plan to address a serious problem."" The ad features Barton sitting in an empty theater explaining how he was shot in the face and neck, adding that 48,000 Americans will be killed by firearms in the next four years unless lawmakers take action. The ad is sponsored by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a coalition of 725 U.S. mayors led by Michael Bloomberg of New York and Thomas Menino of Boston that advocates closing loopholes in gun laws to prevent felons, the mentally ill and ""other dangerous people"" from obtaining firearms. Bloomberg said in a statement about Barton's ad: ""When the candidates walk into that auditorium, I hope they'll be thinking about another theater a few miles away where a dozen people were murdered, and dozens more were injured like Stephen.""

Stephen Barton, a survivor of the Aurora shooting, was disappointed by moderator Jim Lehrer and the candidates. ""They acted as if they had moved on completely,"" he told The Huffington Post in an interview. He said that given the mass shootings that occurred over the summer and gun violence in the city of Chicago, the issue merited attention. ""It really does blow my mind that it doesn't receive some attention,"" Barton said. ""It's easy to think for some people that it will never affect them personally."" Barton, a 2012 Syracuse University graduate and native of Southbury, Conn., was hit in the face, neck, chest and arms by shotgun pellets in the Aurora shooting, having stopped in the city while on a cross-country bike trip with a friend. The gunman killed 12 and wounded 57 others. Barton is living in New York City and working as a Policy and Outreach Assistant at Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a group that is co-chaired by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He starred in an ad by the group that ran from Monday to Wednesday in Washington, D.C. and Colorado. ""So when you watch the presidential debates, ask yourself: Who has a plan to stop gun violence? Let's demand a plan."" he said in the ad. While Barton believes Lehrer didn't moderate the debate particularly well, he laid the blame on the candidates. ""Obama and Mitt Romney each had an opportunity to speak candidly in their personal statements … in both cases, gun violence was completely absent. They owned the responsibility for this as much."" Gun policy was not the only issue that went unmentioned during the debate. Immigration, women's rights, abortion, unions, gay rights, foreclosure reform, the automobile bailout and climate change were not discussed. Neither Mitt Romney nor President Barack Obama have called for new gun control laws. Romney opposes them outright, while the Obama administration has argued that passing new laws would be too difficult in the current political climate and it's preferable to work within existing law. Both candidates have a record that's ""mixed at best,"" Barton said, noting that Romney signed an assault weapons ban as governor of Massachusetts while Obama repealed a rule prohibiting guns to be carried in national parks. Barton said that his gunshot wounds are healing. He said that he still had difficulty raising his left arm, describing it at about 50 percent. He is hopeful that the issue of gun violence will be raised in the next debate. ""Because it's a town hall, I'm hoping that a more diverse set of questions will be presented,"" he said, referring to the Oct. 16 debate in Hempstead, N.Y.

Shapiro:  Cutting Crime Pays,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-j-shapiro/cutting-crime-pays_b_1940635.html,en,False,"crime and criminals,murders and attempted murders",27502,HuffPost,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/#,"Co-founder and chairman, Sonecon Inc.; Former Undersecretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs; International Monetary Fund adviser The mass shooting in Aurora, Colo., in July was a terrible tragedy with a devastating human toll. But it will have other costs as well. In a new analysis I conducted with Kevin Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute, we calculated for the first time the extraordinary economic costs that violent crime imposes on communities. In our new study issued by the Center for American Progress, we calculated that the four major types of violent crime -- murders, rapes, assaults and robberies -- cost Americans about $200 billion per year. That estimate covers first the costs of police, courts and prisons associated with those crimes. It also includes victims' property losses, out-of-pocket medical expenses, and their pain and suffering. Finally, we also include the foregone income of the victims of violent crime, as well as the lost income of the perpetrators themselves once they are caught and incarcerated. Reduce violent crime by 10 percent -- one-fifth of the reduction already achieved over the last 20 years -- and the nationwide savings and benefits would total $20 billion per year. We also have calculated another benefit: When violent crime falls, property values increase. We collected years of data on violent crimes by specific location and date in a number of major cities across the country, and then we analyzed the relationship between changes in the rates of those crimes and changes in home prices in the same areas. On average, a 10 percent decline in homicides in a neighborhood or zip code produced a 0.83 percent increase in home values in the same area the following year. A 25 percent drop in homicide rates should produce a 2.1 percent increase in property values the next year. Our results covered Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Jacksonville, Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Seattle. They show that falling rates of violent crime, especially homicides, translate into billions of dollars in gains by homeowners and tens of millions of dollars in new property tax revenues for city governments. For example, a 10 percent drop in homicides should increase the value of residential real estate, over just one year, by $4.4 billion across the Boston metropolitan area, by $3.2 billion in the Philadelphia area, by $2.9 billion in and around Seattle, and by $2.4 billion in metropolitan Dallas. Similarly, those gains in the first year would amount to $2.2 billion in the Chicago area, $800 million in and around Milwaukee, and $600 million in metropolitan Jacksonville. Such progress against violent crime would means not only significant increases in property taxes, but also significant savings for city budgets. A 10 percent reduction in the four major violent crimes would reduce direct municipal costs by $5 million per year in Boston, $24 million in Chicago, $7 million in Dallas, and $17 million in Houston. Similarly, these annual budget savings would come to $4 million in Jacksonville, $5 million in Milwaukee, $17 million in Philadelphia and $2 million in Seattle. Researchers have also identified a number of strategies that have proven to be quite effective in reducing violent crime -- and which, we now know, may directly lead to higher property values and large municipal savings. For example, additional police patrols have reduced the incidence of serious offenses in high-crime hotspots, and intervening in networks of underground gun brokers may help reduce illegal access to guns. Family therapy, parent training, and vocational training programs have all worked well for certain high-risk populations. These and other crime-reducing efforts entail budgetary costs as well, but most of us would be willing to incur those additional costs, given the large and broad economic benefits which they should produce.   We know that violent crime is costly for victims, cities and all of us. Now, we also can say with confidence that cities make a very costly mistake when they ignore the large, potential gains for their residents, home owners and taxpayers and budgets from making additional efforts to reduce violent crime.

        Mark Arce Posted on October 7, 2015, at 10:35 a.m. ET Republican presidential candidate and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee's 1998 book Kids Who Kill is full of spurious quotations from leading American political figures, mostly the country's founding fathers. A number of the quotations, such as those from Washington and Jefferson, have been routinely debunked by libraries of the past presidents but still regularly find their way into books from conservative figures. Other quotes, debunked by prominent historians, seem to be used for the first time in the book. The book was co-written with evangelical author George Grant in response to a mass shooting in Arkansas. The book links that shooting to the decline in America's moral culture. The quotes, from figures such as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Patrick Henry, are often used to reinforce Huckabee's moral viewpoint. Huckabee isn't the first Republican presidential to attribute fake quotes to America's founders. Ben Carson, Rand Paul, and former candidate Scott Walker have all done so. ""That book was co-authored, and I'm not sure which one wrote those, but we appreciate you reading the book,"" a Huckabee spokesman said. However, according to the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, ""this quotation has not been found in the writings of Thomas Jefferson."" Another quote attributed to Jefferson read, ""Any woodsman can tell you that in a broken and sundered nest, one can hardly expect to find more than a precious few whole eggs. So it is with the family."" Neither the Thomas Jefferson Foundation nor The Papers of Thomas Jefferson at Princeton University could verify the quote. ""I have searched our presidential files using woodsman, nest, and family as keywords and have not found this quote,"" The Papers of Thomas Jefferson wrote to BuzzFeed News in a statement. Huckabee's cites ""King's Signet Book's"" in his book as the source for the quote, but a search for the source only turns up links to Huckabee's book and another book, Revolution: Jesus' Call to Change the World. ""The quote is frequently misattributed to Washington, particularly in regards to his farewell address of 1796,"" writes the National Library for the Study of George Washington at Mount Vernon. Huckabee also attributed multiple quotes to founding father Patrick Henry that are unverifiable and sourced only to Huckabee's book or a book cited by Huckabee. ""The manners of a gentleman are an outgrowth of his due respect for the life and integrity of others; likewise a breach of courtesy is emblematic not so much of barbarism as of utter and complete self-absorption. A rude man is but a callous egotist,"" reads one quote attributed to Henry. The only source available for this is Huckabee's book. The quote is not cited in the book. Another quote attributed to Henry, ""For good or for ill, the estate of the family will most assuredly predetermine the estate of all of the rest of the culture,"" could again only be sourced back to Huckabee. One prominent historian, Baylor professor Thomas S. Kidd, who authored Patrick Henry: First Among Patriots, told BuzzFeed News he had not seen the quotes before. ""Those are new ones to me. Like you, I cannot find any hits on them except for the Huckabee book,"" Kidd told BuzzFeed News. Another quote attributed to Henry in Huckabee's book can also be found in a different book from Huckabee's co-author, but in that book it's attributed to Pope Leo XIII. Huckabee's book reads: ""Patrick Henry argued, 'The contention that the civil government should at its option intrude into and exercise control over the family and the household is a great and pernicious error.'"" ""The philosophy of the classroom in one generation will be the philosophy of government in the next,"" reads on quote attributed to Lincoln. The quote is untraceable to Lincoln and is often listed as an unconfirmed quote. ""It looks like that quote began appearing in various evangelical books attributing it to Lincoln at some point in the 1990s, but beyond that I don't know its origins,"" Lincoln scholar and Dickinson College professor Matthew Pinsker. ""It's certainly not Lincoln, or to be precise, there's no evidence that it comes from any of Lincoln's writings and no recollected account that I know of which even claims this line as his."" Another quote attributed to Lincoln in the book (""We are indeed, the almost chosen people"") seems to be a slight misread of an address Lincoln gave to the New Jersey legislature in February of 1861, where he is quoted by the New York Times as saying, ""I shall be most happy in lead if I shall be an humble instrument in the hands of the Almighty, and of this, his almost chosen people, as the chosen instrument, also in the hands of the almighty, for perpetuating the object of that great struggle."" Huckabee and his co-author also attributed a quote to Samuel Adams (""without civility, there can be no society,"") that, upon searching, could only be found in his book and a 1999 column in a South Carolina newspaper written by a wedding consultant. Finally, a quote attributed to founding father Gouverneur Morris is not only a fake quote but a misattribution of a fake quote. ""The Constitution is not an instrument for government to restrain the people, it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government—lest it come to dominate our lives and interests,"" read the quote attributed to Morris. This quote is fake as noted by prominent historians, and is usually attributed to Patrick Henry. Andrew Kaczynski is a political reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York.

James Holmes, a 24-year-old former neuroscience graduate student at the University of Colorado, has been charged with murder and attempted murder for the rampage that killed 12 people and wounded 58 others. Lawyers for Cinemark USA are seeking dismissal of the lawsuits filed last week in Denver federal court by the victims, who said the theater had lax security. ""It would be patently unfair, and legally unsound, to impose on Cinemark, a private business in the entertainment industry, the duty and burden to have foreseen and prevented the criminal equivalent of a meteor falling from the sky,"" the motion said. Texas-based Cinemark argued that because its employees did not know the accused shooter and were not trained in law enforcement or criminal pathology, ""the fault here lies entirely with the killer."" Attorneys for the victims could not immediately be reached for comment. The three victims said in their lawsuit the theater should have had more security in place because it was aware of previous crimes in or near the theater, including ""assaults and robberies"" and at least one gang shooting. Cinemark disputed the assertion about a previous gang shooting, but noted that even if true, ""such an event would be insufficient to make a madman's mass murder foreseeable."""
603808228,2012-09-23 08:00:00,Ryan again strikes different tone than Trump on Muslims,http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/paul-ryan-renews-criticism-of-ban-on-muslim-immigrants-b99744292z1-382966871.html,en,False,"politics and government,united states politics and government,religion and churches,armament, defense and military forces,islam,terrorism,crime and criminals,airlines and airplanes",36,Milwaukee Journal Sentinel ,http://www.jsonline.com/,"By Craig Gilbert of the Journal Sentinel Washington, D.C. — House Speaker Paul Ryan renewed his criticism Tuesday of a ban on Muslim immigrants, another reminder that his endorsement of Donald Trump has not put to rest their considerable differences. ""I do not think a Muslim ban is in our country's interest. I don't think it is reflective of our principles, not just as a party but as a country,"" Ryan said at a House GOP news conference. ""I think the smarter way to go in all respects is to have a security test, not a religious test."" Ryan also struck a far different tone than Trump on the role of American Muslims, whom Trump accused Monday of harboring terrorists in their communities and failing to report them to authorities. Asked about those remarks, Ryan said: ""I think there is a really important distinction that every American needs to keep in mind. This is a war with radical Islam. It's not a war with Islam. Muslims are our partners. The vast, vast majority of Muslims in this country and around the world are moderate, they're peaceful, they're tolerant. And, so they're among our best allies, among our best resources in this fight against radical Islamic terrorism. So I think it's very important that we hold that distinction. We honor that distinction. And let's remember, we're all in this together."" In a speech and interviews Monday, Trump expanded on his call for a ban on the entry of Muslims into the U.S., proposing that America suspend immigration from all countries that have a proven history of terrorism. He broadly questioned the loyalties of Muslim Americans, and suggested that President Barack Obama was not really interested in combating the terrorist threat. Asked Tuesday for his response to Trump's remarks, Ryan restated his disagreement with Trump's immigration proposals and spoke up for the American Muslim community. But he did not criticize Trump directly. As he left the press conference, Ryan ignored reporters who asked him whether he stood by his support of Trump, the party's presumptive nominee. Trump plans to meet with House Republicans on July 7 to talk about the GOP agenda and how to come together before the November election. Ryan endorsed Trump June 2, after acknowledging serious differences and concerns about the tenor of Trump's campaign. But on the heels of that endorsement, Ryan criticized Trump for what he called ""racist"" comments about a judge of Mexican heritage. And their differences over immigration, terrorism, and how to bring Americans together on these issues have come to the fore again in the aftermath of the mass shooting in Orlando. Ryan also used Tuesday's news conference to reiterate his criticism of Obama's national security strategy, saying, ""Right now, the president doesn't have a plan to get the job done."" Trump's rhetoric and response to the Orlando attacks has appalled Democrats. ""We have to come together and Donald Trump divides us and makes us weaker,"" Senate Democrat Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin said on MSNBC Monday night. Obama excoriated Trump in remarks Tuesday, calling his views dangerous. But Trump's statements also have divided Republicans. Some GOP lawmakers have refused to discuss Trump's comments. Others have distanced themselves from them or criticized them more directly. Wisconsin Republican Reid Ribble, a longtime Trump critic within the GOP, said Tuesday that Trump went overboard questioning Obama's desire to fight terrorism. ""It's ridiculous to say that any — any — president of the United States would not want to combat terrorism,"" said Ribble, who also opposes the idea of a Muslim immigration ban. ""You can't ban a religion from entering the country, it's unconstitutional,"" said Ribble. ""What we need to do is ultimately pull the temperature down and pull everybody's intellect up, so we can have a little better conversation about this."" Aside from the controversy they have sparked, Trump's rhetoric has continued to overshadow efforts by Republicans in Congress to promote their own election-year policy agenda. Ryan and colleagues held an event in D.C. Tuesday afternoon in front of the Department of Labor to promote their economic and regulatory proposals. A small group across the street chanted anti-Trump slogans throughout. And when it came time to field questions from the press, Ryan was asked again about Trump. ""I am not going to get into the day to day habit of commenting on what the president says and our nominee says,"" Ryan said. ""But you did this morning,"" a reporter replied. ""I'm not going to do it every day,"" said Ryan, who then laughed and added ""or every hour.""

818659211,2012-09-26 10:00:00,"More Guns, More Mass Shootings—Coincidence?",https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/mass-shootings-investigation/,en,False,"gun control,firearms,murders and attempted murders",1112,Mother Jones,http://www.motherjones.com/,"You come to Mother Jones for unique journalism, and we love doing it for you—especially at a moment like this. That's really it. That's the upshot of our fall fundraising drive, and we're hoping to raise $250,000 in a much shorter than normal three-week window, by November 5, so we can keep right on doing it. Please pitch in early to help us get there. You come to Mother Jones for unique journalism, and we love doing it for you. That's it. That's the upshot of our fall fundraising drive, and we're hoping to raise $250,000 in a shorter than normal three-week window so we can keep right on doing it. In the fierce debate that always follows the latest mass shooting, it’s an argument you hear frequently from gun rights promoters: If only more people were armed, there would be a better chance of stopping these terrible events. This has plausibility problems—what are the odds that, say, a moviegoer with a pack of Twizzlers in one pocket and a Glock in the other would be mentally prepared, properly positioned, and skilled enough to take out a body-armored assailant in a smoke- and panic-filled theater? But whether you believe that would happen is ultimately a matter of theory and speculation. Instead, let’s look at some facts gathered in a five-month investigation by Mother Jones. MoJo’s map, timeline, and analysis of 30 years of mass shootings in America. In the wake of the massacres this year at a Colorado movie theater, a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, and Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, we set out to track mass shootings in the United States over the last 30 years. We identified and analyzed 62 of them, and one striking pattern in the data is this: In not a single case was the killing stopped by a civilian using a gun. And in other recent (but less lethal) rampages in which armed civilians attempted to intervene, those civilians not only failed to stop the shooter but also were gravely wounded or killed. Moreover, we found that the rate of mass shootings has increased in recent years—at a time when America has been flooded with millions of additional firearms and a barrage of new laws has made it easier than ever to carry them in public places, including bars, parks, and schools. America has long been heavily armed relative to other societies, and our arsenal keeps growing. A precise count isn’t possible because most guns in the United States aren’t registered and the government has scant ability to track them, thanks to a legislative landscape shaped by powerful pro-gun groups such as the National Rifle Association. But through a combination of national surveys and manufacturing and sales data, we know that the increase in firearms has far outpaced population growth. In 1995 there were an estimated 200 million guns in private hands. Today, there are around 300 million—about a 50 percent jump. The US population, now over 314 million, grew by about 20 percent in that period. At this rate, there will be a gun for every man, woman, and child before the decade ends. There is no evidence indicating that arming Americans further will help prevent mass shootings or reduce the carnage, says Dr. Stephen Hargarten, a leading expert on emergency medicine and gun violence at the Medical College of Wisconsin. To the contrary, there appears to be a relationship between the proliferation of firearms and a rise in mass shootings: By our count, there have been two per year on average since 1982. Yet, 25 of the 62 cases we examined have occurred since 2006. In 2012 alone there have been seven mass shootings, and a record number of casualties, with more than 140 people injured and killed. Armed civilians attempting to intervene are actually more likely to increase the bloodshed, says Hargarten, “given that civilian shooters are less likely to hit their targets than police in these circumstances.” A chaotic scene in August at the Empire State Building put this starkly into perspective when New York City police officers trained in counterterrorism confronted a gunman and wounded nine innocent bystanders in the process. Surveys suggest America’s guns may be concentrated in fewer hands today: Approximately 40 percent of households had them in the past decade, versus about 50 percent in the 1980s. But far more relevant is a recent barrage of laws that have rolled back gun restrictions throughout the country. In the past four years, across 37 states, the NRA and its political allies have pushed through 99 laws making guns easier to own, carry, and conceal from the government. The NRA surge: 99 recent laws rolling back gun regulations in 37 states. Among the more striking measures: Eight states now allow firearms in bars. Law-abiding Missourians can carry a gun while intoxicated and even fire it if “acting in self-defense.” In Kansas, permit holders can carry concealed weapons inside K-12 schools, and Louisiana allows them in houses of worship. Virginia not only repealed a law requiring handgun vendors to submit sales records, but the state also ordered the destruction of all such previous records. More than two-thirds of these laws were passed by Republican-controlled statehouses, though often with bipartisan support. The laws have caused dramatic changes, including in the two states hit with the recent carnage. Colorado passed its concealed-carry measure in 2003, issuing 9,522 permits that year; by the end of last year the state had handed out a total of just under 120,000, according to data we obtained from the County Sheriffs of Colorado. In March of this year, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that concealed weapons are legal on the state’s college campuses. (It is now the fifth state explicitly allowing them.) If former neuroscience student James Holmes were still attending the University of Colorado today, the movie theater killer—who had no criminal history and obtained his weapons legally—could’ve gotten a permit to tote his pair of .40 caliber Glocks straight into the student union. Wisconsin’s concealed-carry law went into effect just nine months before the Sikh temple shooting in suburban Milwaukee this August. During that time, the state issued a whopping 122,506 permits, according to data from Wisconsin’s Department of Justice. The new law authorizes guns on college campuses, as well as in bars, state parks, and some government buildings. And we’re on our way to a situation where the most lax state permitting rules—say, Virginia’s, where an online course now qualifies for firearms safety training and has drawn a flood of out-of-state applicants—are in effect national law. Eighty percent of states now recognize handgun permits from at least some other states. And gun rights activists are pushing hard for a federal reciprocity bill—passed in the House late last year, with GOP vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan among its most ardent supporters—that would essentially make any state’s permits valid nationwide. Indeed, the country’s vast arsenal of handguns—at least 118 million of them as of 2010—is increasingly mobile, with 69 of the 99 new state laws making them easier to carry. A decade ago, seven states and the District of Columbia still prohibited concealed handguns; today, it’s down to just Illinois and DC. (And Illinois recently passed an exception cracking the door open to carrying). In the 62 mass shootings we analyzed, 54 of the killers had handguns—including in all 15 of the mass shootings since the surge of pro-gun laws began in 2009. In a certain sense the law was on their side: nearly 80 percent of the killers in our investigation obtained their weapons legally. We used a conservative set of criteria to build a comprehensive rundown of high-profile attacks in public places—at schools, workplaces, government buildings, shopping malls—though they represent only a small fraction of the nation’s overall gun violence. The FBI defines a mass murderer as someone who kills four or more people in a single incident, usually in one location. (As opposed to spree or serial killers, who strike multiple times.) We excluded cases involving armed robberies or gang violence; dropping the number of fatalities by just one, or including those motives, would add many, many more cases. (More about our criteria here.) There was one case in our data set in which an armed civilian played a role. Back in 1982, a man opened fire at a welding shop in Miami, killing eight and wounding three others before fleeing on a bicycle. A civilian who worked nearby pursued the assailant in a car, shooting and killing him a few blocks away (in addition to ramming him with the car). Florida authorities, led by then-state attorney Janet Reno, concluded that the vigilante had used force justifiably, and speculated that he may have prevented additional killings. But even if we were to count that case as a successful armed intervention by a civilian, it would account for just 1.6 percent of the mass shootings in the last 30 years. More broadly, attempts by armed civilians to stop shooting rampages are rare—and successful ones even rarer. There were two school shootings in the late 1990s, in Mississippi and Pennsylvania, in which bystanders with guns ultimately subdued the teen perpetrators, but in both cases it was after the shooting had subsided. Other cases led to tragic results. In 2005, as a rampage unfolded inside a shopping mall in Tacoma, Washington, a civilian named Brendan McKown confronted the assailant with a licensed handgun he was carrying. The assailant pumped several bullets into McKown and wounded six people before eventually surrendering to police after a hostage standoff. (A comatose McKown eventually recovered after weeks in the hospital.) In Tyler, Texas, that same year, a civilian named Mark Wilson fired his licensed handgun at a man on a rampage at the county courthouse. Wilson—who was a firearms instructor—was shot dead by the body-armored assailant, who wielded an AK-47. (None of these cases were included in our mass shootings data set because fewer than four victims died in each.) Appeals to heroism on this subject abound. So does misleading information. Gun rights die-hards frequently credit the end of a rampage in 2002 at the Appalachian School of Law in Virginia to armed “students” who intervened—while failing to disclose that those students were also current and former law enforcement officers, and that the killer, according to police investigators, was out of bullets by the time they got to him. It’s one of several cases commonly cited as examples of ordinary folks with guns stopping massacres that do not stand up to scrutiny. How do law enforcement authorities view armed civilians getting involved? One week after the slaughter at the Dark Knight screening in July, the city of Houston—hardly a hotbed of gun control—released a new Department of Homeland Security-funded video instructing the public on how to react to such events. The six-minute production foremost advises running away or otherwise hiding, and suggests fighting back only as a last resort. It makes no mention of civilians using firearms.Screen shot: City of Houston video on mass shooters. Law enforcement officials are the first to say that civilians should not be allowed to obtain particularly lethal weaponry, such as the AR-15 assault rifle and ultra-high-capacity, drum-style magazine used by Holmes to mow down Batman fans. The expiration of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban under President George W. Bush in 2004 has not helped that cause: Seven killers since then have wielded assault weapons in mass shootings. But while access to weapons is a crucial consideration for stemming the violence, stricter gun laws are no silver bullet. Another key factor is mental illness. A major New York Times investigation in 2000 examined 100 shooting rampages and found that at least half of the killers showed signs of serious mental health problems. Our own data reveals that the majority of mass shootings are murder-suicides: In the 62 cases we analyzed, 36 of the shooters killed themselves. Others may have committed “suicide by cop”—seven died in police shootouts. Still others simply waited, as Holmes did in the movie theater parking lot, to be apprehended by authorities. Drum-style magazine for assault rifles Brownells.com Mental illness among the killers is no surprise, ranging from paranoid schizophrenia to suicidal depression. But while some states have improved their sharing of mental health records with federal authorities, millions of records reportedly are still missing from the FBI’s database for criminal background checks. Hargarten of the Medical College of Wisconsin argues that mass shootings need to be scrutinized as a public health emergency so that policy makers can better focus on controlling the epidemic of violence. It would be no different than if there were an outbreak of Ebola virus, he says—we’d be assembling the nation’s foremost experts to stop it. But real progress will require transcending hardened politics. For decades gun rights promoters have framed measures aimed at public safety—background checks, waiting periods for purchases, tracking of firearms—as dire attacks on constitutional freedom. They’ve wielded the gun issue so successfully as a political weapon that Democrats hardly dare to touch it, while Republicans have gone to new extremes in their party platform to enshrine gun rights. Political leaders have failed to advance the discussion “in a credible, thoughtful, evidence-driven way,” says Hargarten. In the meantime, the gun violence in malls and schools and religious venues continues apace. As a superintendent told his community in suburban Cleveland this February, after a shooter at Chardon High School snuffed out the lives of three students and injured three others, “We’re not just any old place, Chardon. This is every place. As you’ve seen in the past, this can happen anywhere.” Additional research contributed by Deanna Pan and Gavin Aronsen.
