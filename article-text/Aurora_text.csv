At the age of 15, I failed to prevent the suicide of a dear friend named Sarah. I first met Sarah on a My Chemical Romance web forum. We bonded over a shared love of the band and ended up providing emotional support to each other over a period of around eight months. Having never physically met, I felt I could tell Sarah anything without fear of consequence or judgment. If I ever needed support, she was there. I tried to offer that same support to her. One night, she came on MSN telling me that she couldn't face another day living. It wasn't that her life was particularly terrible as far as I could tell, but she felt a consistent emptiness somewhere within her. She had failed her exams, she had no plans for the future and she just couldn't see a reason to keep living. We spoke for about six hours that night. I tried to keep her talking by breaking our time down into seconds and minutes. I tried to scare her into fearing oblivion more than she feared her present. I tried to tell her things would get better and I tried to make her see that I cared about her. I desperately clung to what was left, hoping that I could find a way to keep her with us just a little longer. I didn't know her real name, nor where she lived. I couldn't contact the authorities. By the end of the night, Sarah had committed suicide. In the years since I failed to stop Sarah taking her own life, I've had to find ways to cope with what happened. I told myself she was the one who chose to take her life. I told myself that I did all I could. I told myself that no matter what I did, I could not have changed how she felt. My actions alone could not have saved her life. Nothing I did or failed to do was the cause of her death. It was not my fault. I told myself time and time again that my actions could not have affected the outcome of that day. I've often heard it argued that video games should be treated the same as any other artistic medium when it comes to narrative design. If you can have a book feature a mass shooting, then you can do it in games. If movies can depict rape, then so can video games. Video games do not cause players to re-enact what they see on screen, so it's often argued that there's no harm in portraying emotionally difficult narratives where the consumer has agency within the situation. The second episode of the video game Life is Strange is the experience that convinced me that agency over emotionally tense situations can not only be incredibly powerful, but that power puts a huge duty of care in the hands of creators. I think that video game creators need to treat difficult subject material with a greater degree of responsibility that creators in any other medium.  Life is Strange, which centers on the story of a teenage girl who discovers she has the ability to rewind time at will, spends the bulk of its second episode convincing the player to frivolously overuse their newfound power by goofing off all day with a close friend named Chloe. Toward the end of the episode, the player is forced to face their friend Kate, who has spent the entire episode battling a traumatic series of events in her personal life and is now standing on the roof of her dorm planning to take her own life. The player is made aware that they only have one chance to prevent their friend's suicide; there are no do-overs if you fail. I did everything in my power to save Kate, much like I did with Sarah, but ultimately it wasn't enough. I was forced to watch Kate fall to her death. I was powerless to stop her. It was my fault she was dead. I initially assumed that there was nothing I could have done to save Kate. Maybe all answers eventually led to her taking her life? Perhaps the clues to save her just did not exist. As it turns out, not only could I have prevented her from taking her own life, but almost 80 percent of players in my shoes managed to prevent her suicide. Presented with the same information, experiences, opportunities and options as me, only 20 percent of people failed to save Kate. Where I had tried my best and not been able to save her, almost everybody else in my shoes managed to convince her that life was worth living. They paid enough attention. They found the clues. They understood her well enough to get through to her. Her suicide was preventable, and my actions could have saved her. Having agency over that scene shook me to my very core. Being expected to relive one of the worst days of my life and experiencing the same outcome was tough. Being told five minutes later that the outcome was my fault? That was incredibly distressing. Years of convincing myself I couldn't have saved Sarah suddenly came into question. Even worse, so many others did a better job. If someone else had been in my shoes, would Sarah still be here today? If Sarah had gone to somebody else for support, would they have been able to convince her that things would be OK? Am I responsible for the fact she took her life? I think that agency is one of the key things that sets video games apart from any other creative medium. If a movie had its lead character fail to talk someone out of taking their own life, the majority of the emotional burden would be on the character, not the viewer. When you give a player control over that situation, a much larger portion of that burden ends up on the shoulders of the player. It's not just the character who failed to save a life, it's you, the player, who failed. This is the power and beauty of games To be clear, I'm not saying that video game creators cannot insert this kind of narrative thread into video games. There is no reason that my distressing, relatively rare experiences should prevent a creator from telling this story. Your responsibility as a creator is to your work, not the personal circumstances of everyone who may play the game. What I do want to suggest, however, is that far more than any other form of media, creators of video games need to be aware that this medium not only increases engagement but also increases the emotional burden on affected players in a unique way. I have watched films and read comics in the past that dealt with themes of unprevented suicide and, while difficult for me to get through, passive forms of media have never left me this distraught. By giving me control of the situation in Life is Strange, developer Dontnod Entertainment suddenly forced me to inspect my own agency in my life. That has an emotional price attached. This is the power and beauty of games; what feels like an echo of pain in other art forms feels like a punch in the gut when the same topic is explored in a well-made game. So how do developers handle that kind of power? Trigger warnings offer an opportunity for players to avoid narratives that contain very specific situations that trigger traumatic memories of past events, but they inherently remove an element of surprise for players wanting to experience stories fresh. If a trigger warning isn't for you specifically, you'll likely regret having read it; what would have allowed me to avoid a situation that I found painful would just read like a spoiler for most people. You could bring up a menu when these scenes are about to occur, allowing players to skip the scene or hand control to the game. But this breaks the flow of the game considerably, which can damage narrative tone and pacing for the majority of unaffected players. For an experience as cinematic as Life is Strange you'd be trading the welfare of a few very specific players for a less cohesively flowing experience for everyone else. You could even offer detailed support to players after the scene is over, but doing so is predicated on the assumption that your player is able to get through the entire scene. If a player stops playing halfway through a segment, then they're affected by the narrative you as a developer have created, but they don't reach the point where support would have been offered to them. Ultimately I do not know the right solution here. Video games have a unique ability to touch players and alter their emotional state, but that power comes with a duty to ensure that players whose emotions are affected are properly supported afterwards. The second episode of Life is Strange put a huge emotional burden on my shoulders that caused me to walk away deeply distressed, and the game completely failed to understand the implications of what it had done. It gave me agency over a deeply tragic moment, then very quickly introduced traditional video game scoring elements that ranked my failure against other players. Tragedy had become gamified. As a developer you can use agency to emotionally engage audiences. Just understand the burden you're putting on players and be prepared for the consequences that come with that. It's one thing to show me a character fail to stop a suicide; that's merely difficult and upsetting. It's something very different to put that situation in my hands without warning before scoring me on how I perform. You're not always warned before you're shown something that could cause you emotional distress in any art form, but this is an aspect of the game I wish I could have properly prepared myself for. "

Lillie Holliday’s site, www.ostmemorialfund.com , is set up as a memorial for her son, Omar Thornton and solicits donations to fight institutionalized racism. “As a mother, I do not want any other mother to experience what I did in losing a son as a result of the impact of racism in the workplace,” she says in a statement on the website. The site provides a link for donations, saying they will “assist in shaping a safer environment for our families and loved ones.” Thornton, who was black, shot 10 people, eight of them fatally, within three minutes on Aug. 3, 2010, at the Hartford Distributors warehouse, before killing himself in what police said was the worst mass shooting ever in Connecticut. Immediately before the shootings, Thornton was fired for stealing beer. Before killing himself, he called 911 and told an operator: “This place is a racist place. They’re treating me bad over here. And treat all other black employees bad over here, too. So I took it to my own hands and handled the problem. I wish I could have got more of the people.” A police investigation concluded there was no evidence to support the claim of racism. Claudette Carveth, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Consumer Protection, said Wednesday that her department became aware of the website after details about it were reported on WTIC-TV. She said they have no record of that memorial fund being registered with the state and are investigating to determine if it is legal. Christopher Roos, a manager of the Teamsters local that represents workers at the warehouse, said he and other employees are upset by the site, which he said has opened even more wounds. “It’s basically her insinuating that these guys were racist, the company was racist and that the Teamsters are racist, and that isn’t true,” he said. “If she wants to have a fund for her son, that’s fine, but don’t say it’s for racism, because that isn’t why he did it. He did it because he had psychological problems.” Holliday, who did not immediately return phone calls and emails from The Associated Press, told WTIC-TV she should be allowed to grieve in her own way. “That is my son. That’s my baby. And as his mother, I should have the right to do whatever I want to do in my son’s honor,” she said. “And I don’t know why would that make them upset.” Holliday also said that she plans to use the funds donated to the website to conduct an independent investigation of the shootings.

500629126,2012-05-04 08:00:55,15 Stats That Destroy Liberal Narratives,http://townhall.com/columnists/johnhawkins/2016/01/02/15-stats-that-destroy-liberal-narratives-n2098999?utm_source=akdart,en,False,"politics and government,blacks,terrorism,discrimination",19763,townhall.com,http://townhall.com,"1) “Muslims account for only about 1 percent of the U.S. population but account for about half of terrorist attacks since 9/11. That means Muslims in the United States are about 5,000 percent more likely to commit terrorist attacks than non-Muslims.” -- Mark Krikorian 2) “Consider, for example, that in 1958 a mere 4 percent of Americans approved of interracial marriage. By 2013, that number had grown to 87 percent. In 2012 these once-taboo unions hit an all-time high. Ku Klux Klan membership has shrunk drastically from millions a century ago to fewer than 5,000 today. The Black Panthers are essentially extinct. While plenty of other hate groups have attempted to fill the void, they have always operated on the margins of society. Black politicians are now common—President Obama’s percentage of the white vote was almost perfectly in line with that received by other recent Democrats, all of whom were white. Granted, these statistics offer but a snapshot of American society, but the more one looks, the more a trend emerges. America is a lot of things; racist isn’t one of them.”  -- Greg Jones 3) “The harsh reality awaiting these low-income Americans is undeniable: according to 2013 data from a 2014 Merritt Hawkins study, 55% of doctors already refuse new Medicaid patients. According to the HSC Health Tracking Physician Survey, 2008, the percentage of doctors that refuse new Medicaid patients dwarf by about 8 to 10 times the percentage that refuses new private insurance patients. Such ‘insurance’ from Obamacare not only fails to provide access to doctors, but research in the top medical journals such as Cancer, American Journal of Cardiology, Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation and Annals of Surgery, show that Medicaid beneficiaries suffer worse outcomes than similar patients with private insurance ... all at an added cost of another $800 billion by CBO estimates to taxpayers after the decade. It is not hyperbole to call Medicaid a disgrace at its annual cost of about $450 billion, and expanding it rather than helping poor people buy private insurance is simply inexplicable.” -- Scott Atlas 4) “In other words, all of the disruption, spending, taxation, and premium hikes in Obamacare has only reduced the percentage of U.S. residents without health insurance by 2.7 percentage points, from 13.9% to 11.1%: a remarkably small reduction, and far lower than what the law was supposed to achieve.” -- Avik Roy 5) “Bernie Sanders thinks you can pay for an 18 trillion dollar expansion of the welfare state — to make it align with a Denmark that doesn’t actually exist — simply by taxing ‘the billionaire class.’ There are 536 billionaires in America. Even if you confiscated everything they had — which, by the way, would surely destroy the American economy by triggering the greatest round of capital flight in human history and amount to government seizure of countless businesses — it wouldn’t come close to covering the tab of Sanders’s proposals.” -- Jonah Goldberg 6) “In 2010, 38,329 people died from drug overdoses, twice the number a decade earlier. More people died of drug overdoses than from automobile accidents (30,196), murders (13,000) or gun accidents (700).” -- Ann Coulter 7) “Between 1979 and 2010, for instance, the average after-tax income for the poorest quintile of American households rose from $14,800 to $19,200; for the second-poorest quintile, it rose from $29,900 to $39,100. Meanwhile, per-person antipoverty spending at the state and federal level increased sixfold between 1968 and 2008 — and that’s excluding Medicare, unemployment benefits and Social Security.” -- Ross Douthat 8) “Just last month, the Senate Judiciary Committee received a report that in just four years, 121 illegal aliens who had been released by ICE went on to murder Americans.” -- Mark Krikorian 9) “Officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the food-stamp program has become the country’s fastest-growing means-tested social-welfare program. Only Medicaid is more expensive. Between 2000 and 2013, SNAP caseloads grew to 47.6 million from 17.2 million, and spending grew to $80 billion from $20.6 billion, according to the Agriculture Department. SNAP participation fell slightly last year, to 46.5 million individuals, as the economy improved, but that still leaves a population the size of Spain’s living in the U.S. on food stamps.” -- Jason Riley 10) “Pace Mr. Obama, the state-prison population (which accounts for 87% of the nation’s prisoners) is dominated by violent criminals and serial thieves. In 2013 drug offenders made up less than 16% of the state-prison population; violent felons were 54% and property offenders 19%. Reducing drug-related admissions to 15 large state penitentiaries by half would lower those states’ prison count by only 7%, according to the Urban Institute. In federal prisons—which hold only 13% of the nation’s prisoners—drug offenders make up half of the inmate population. But these offenders aren’t casual drug users; overwhelmingly, they are serious traffickers. Fewer than 1% of drug offenders sentenced in federal court in 2014 were convicted of simple drug possession, according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission. Most of those possession convictions were plea-bargained down from trafficking charges.” -- Heather Mac Donald 11) “The conservative Heritage Foundation estimated unlawful immigrant households paid $39.2 billion in 2010, but received $93.7 billion in government services.” -- Oliver Darcy 12) “On Wednesday, a Washington Post article announced that ‘The San Bernardino shooting is the second mass shooting today and the 355th this year.’ Vox, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, this newspaper and others reported similar statistics. Grim details from the church in Charleston, a college classroom in Oregon and a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado are still fresh, but you could be forgiven for wondering how you missed more than 300 other such attacks in 2015. At Mother Jones, where I work as an editor, we have compiled an in-depth, open-source database covering more than three decades of public mass shootings. By our measure, there have been four ‘mass shootings’ this year, including the one in San Bernardino, and at least 73 such attacks since 1982.” -- Mark Follman 13) “As Pew Research cheerfully reports, previous immigrants were ‘almost entirely’ European. But since Kennedy's immigration act, a majority of immigrants have been from Latin America. One-quarter are from Asia. Only 12 percent of post-1965-act immigrants have been from Europe -- and they're probably Muslims. Apparently, the ‘American experiment’ is actually some kind of sociological trial in which we see if people who have no history of Western government can run a constitutional republic. As of 1970, there were only 9 million Hispanics in the entire country, according to the Pew Research Center. Today, there are well more than 60 million.” -- Ann Coulter 14) “No fewer than eight major studies from around the world have found homosexuality is not a genetic condition. Peter Sprigg of the Family Research Council says that these numerous, rigorous studies of identical twins have now made it impossible to argue that there is a ‘gay gene.’ If homosexuality were inborn and predetermined, then when one identical twin is homosexual, the other should be, as well. Yet one study from Yale and Columbia Universities found homosexuality common to only 6.7 percent of male identical twins and 5.3 percent of female identical twins. The low rate of common homosexuality in identical twins – around six percent – is easily explained by nurture, not nature. Researchers Peter Bearman and Hannah Brueckner concluded that environment was the determining factor. They rejected outright that ‘genetic influence independent of social context’ as the reason for homosexuality. ‘(O)ur results support the hypothesis that less gendered socialization in early childhood and preadolescence shapes subsequent same-sex romantic preferences.’ ‘Less gendered socialization’ means, a boy was without a positive father figure, or a girl was without a positive mother figure. In light of the evidence, Sprigg said simply, ‘No one is born gay.’” -- Mark Hodges 15) “Over the last year, only 1.3 million Americans of working age have entered the workforce, even as the population of this same demographic increased by more than 2.8 million. Just over 1 million members of this group found jobs. That's right -- of the new additions to the working age population, less than four in 10 found jobs. The newspapers touted the reduction in the unemployment rate to 5.3 percent as a cause for celebration. Yet for every three Americans added to the working age population (16 and older), only around one new job (1.07) has been created under Obama. At this pace, America will soon officially have a zero unemployment rate. But that will only be because no one will be looking for work.” -- Stephen Moore   Townhall.com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

          / AP After the worst mass shooting in U.S. history, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid cautioned Tuesday against a ""rush to judgment"" on stricter gun control. A leading House supporter of restrictions on firearms conceded passage of legislation would be difficult. ""I think we ought to be thinking about the families and the victims and not speculate about future legislative battles that might lie ahead,"" said Reid, a view expressed by other Democratic leaders the day after the shootings that left 33 dead on the campus of Virginia Tech. Democrats traditionally have been in the forefront of efforts to pass gun control legislation, but there is a widespread perception among political strategists that the issue has been a loser in recent campaigns. It was notably absent from the agenda Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiled earlier this year when the party took control of the House and Senate for the first time in more than a decade. In the wake of the Virginia Tech shootings, a few Democrats renewed the call for gun control legislation, and more are expected to join them. ""I believe this will reignite the dormant effort to pass commonsense gun regulations in this nation,"" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat who was a leader in the failed drive to renew a ban on certain types of assault weapons that expired in 2004. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., was one of very few lawmakers to refer on gun control in the early hours after the shootings. ""There will be time to debate the steps needed to overt such tragedies,"" he said on Monday, ""but today, our thoughts and prayers go to their families."" By coincidence, Kennedy and Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., are scheduled to attend a demonstration Friday to draw attention to microstamping, a procedure by which serial numbers are placed on ammunition casings. The goal is to allow police and other investigators to quickly track ammunition to the gun that fired it. The two lawmakers support legislation to require microstamping for all guns manufactured after 2009, and aides to both said they planned to go ahead with the demonstration. Overall, though, said Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., ""It is a tough sell"" to pass gun control legislation. Neither Reid nor House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., seemed eager to predict Democrats would lead a drive to toughen existing laws. Less than a month ago, Pelosi and other Democratic leaders abruptly pulled legislation to give the District of Columbia voting representation in the House. Republicans were using the issue to try to force a vote on repeal of the capital's handgun ban, and Democrats feared it would pass. Hoyer told reporters he thought and hoped the shootings at Virginia Tech would make it harder for Republicans to prevail when the voting rights bill returns to the House floor later this week. He refused to be drawn into a discussion of the longer-term political consequences of the shooting, saying, ""All I am saying is there will be a debate. I am not going to enter into the debate today."" Not all lawmakers were as reticent. Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, one of Congress' most persistent advocates of gun rights, noted that the student who police say was the shooter at Virginia Tech had brought a weapon onto campus in violation of restrictions. He said he doubted a law could be passed that would protect ""any of us when somebody who is mentally deranged decides to do this."" One law enforcement official has said that the gunman's backpack contained a receipt for a March purchase of a Glock 9 mm pistol. The gunman held a green card, meaning he was a legal, permanent resident, federal officials said. That meant he was eligible to buy a handgun unless he had been convicted of a felony. Democrats have grown less supportive of gun control legislation as a party in the past decade. After the shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado, then-Vice President Al Gore cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate on legislation to reduce the availability of certain firearms. He and other gun control advocates claimed victory, but many strategists believe the vote hurt him in the 2000 presidential election. Gun control tends to win favor among suburban voters, but it often stirs opposition in less heavily populated areas So far this year, there has been little evidence that Democrats feel otherwise after winning control of the House by picking up seats last fall in parts of Indiana, Ohio, Texas, Arizona and elsewhere where hunting is popular.

543533934,2012-04-23 17:44:53, Norway Killer Says He Hoped To Massacre More,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/23/anders-behring-breivik-trial_n_1447637.html,en,False,"terrorism,demonstrations and riots",27502,HuffPost,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/#,"OSLO, April 23 (Reuters) - The Norwegian who massacred 77 people to protest against Muslim immigration to Europe said on Monday he had hoped to kill as many as 150 and kept on killing because police failed to respond urgently to his phone call. Breivik has given a detailed account of his car bomb attack at government headquarters in Oslo on July 22, which killed eight people, followed hours later by his shooting of 69 people, mostly teenagers, at a Labour Party island camp. He said on Monday his ""gruesome"" actions were to prevent a civil war caused, he said, by a Muslim takeover of Europe. ""This was a minor barbarity to prevent a larger one"", he said on the sixth day of a trial that has transfixed Norway. ""I've never ever experienced such a horrendous ... gruesome act as this. But it was necessary,"" Breivik said in his usual tone, lacking emotion. ""It was much more cruel than I expected."" Breivik said he thought that at least another 150 people had drowned in a lake as they fled his gunfire so he called police to surrender, only to find himself forced to leave a message. ""I said 'call me back when you got the right person',"" Breivik said. ""I told myself 'I will continue until the phone rings'. I thought, I will continue until I die. What would I have done, sat by the pier waiting?"" COLD, MATTER-OF-FACT Breivik has denied criminal guilt, insisting his victims were ""traitors"" whose multiculturalist views facilitated what he saw as a de facto Muslim invasion of Europe. Most Norwegians have reacted with horror to his testimony, delivered in a cold, matter-of-fact manner, while there is wide public acceptance of his right as a defendant to give it. Breivik has had almost free rein to issue warnings against immigration and explain how he scoured the Internet for bomb-making information while writing a 1,500-page document declaring himself part of a secretive group that is Europe's answer to al Qaeda - a group the police have said likely does not exist. Breivik said he spared some people, including a 10-year-old boy whose father was his first victim, and a Labour Party activist because he looked right-wing. ""Some people have the type of look that is associated with the leftist movement,"" Breivik said. ""This person, (Adrian) Pracon appeared right-wing, that was his appearance. That's the reason I didn't fire any shots at him,"" said Breivik, 33, whose sanity or lack of it is a prime issue to be determined in the trial. The 22-year-old Labour party youth wing activist earlier told Reuters: ""I remember him pointing the gun at me for quite a long time before he took it down, turned and walked away."" Breivik told how he used a fake police uniform to trick people into coming out of hiding and then shot them at close range. ""I started with 'have you seen him, do you know where the shots came from?' ... then I said 'there's a rescue boat that's going to take you to safety but you need to come out',"" he said. FIRST APOLOGY Later in the rampage, which lasted more than an hour, Breivik came upon Pracon again as he played dead, and this time shot the son of Polish immigrants through the shoulder. He said he spared the boy's life because ""I could not understand what such a little boy was doing at a political indoctrination camp."" But he said he had no qualms about killing teenagers. His victims were as young as 14. ""They were not children, under the legal definition only under 14 are children ... they were political activists,"" he said. Breivik issued his first seeming apology, to innocent bystanders hurt or killed when his 950-kg fertiliser bomb went off in Oslo. More than 200 were injured. ""To all of those ... I want to say I am deeply sorry for what happened,"" he said. ""But what happened, happened."" Ahead of the trial, which is expected to last 10 weeks, one court-appointed team of psychiatrists concluded that Breivik was psychotic while a second found him mentally capable. If Breivik is deemed sane, as he hopes to be, he could face a 21-year prison sentence with indefinite extensions for as long as he is considered dangerous. (Editing by Janet Lawrence)"

For instance, The New York Times recently scoured the county looking for instances of “Islamophobia.” The paper found an instance were beer cans from drunken college students were being thrown at a mosque in Tucson, Arizona. At the time the NYT reported that “No one has been injured. But in light of the highly charged national debate about accepting Muslim refugees in the United States -- as well as the mass shooting by two Muslim terrorists in San Bernardino, Calif., in December -- tensions over the insults and vandalism here have run particularly high.” This reporting is in stark contrast to the lack of coverage being given to the hate crime committed against Sgt. Marques. The Sergeant was targeted for his complexion and was accused of being a racist for simply ignoring the people harassing him. He was then physically accosted and robbed all because of the color of his skin. Transcript below:  Fox News

After their 6-year-old sons were killed in the shooting, Newtown parents Nicole Hockley and Mark Barden teamed up with other victims’ loved ones and community members to create Sandy Hook Promise ― a nonprofit that works to protect children from gun violence. Today, the organization released a new PSA in conjunction with their national “Know the Signs” campaign. Titled “Evan,” the video offers a glimpse into the lives of high school students. While a dark ending is somewhat expected, the video’s twist takes a surprising direction. “The PSA demonstrates how easy it is for one to overlook the signs of an at-risk individual demonstrating signs of violence, particularly gun violence, and that when one knows the signs, it can be prevented,” a Sandy Hook Promise representative told The Huffington Post in an email. #KnowTheSigns.

The Supply Chain and Shipping Mess Is Partly the Administration’s Fault Loudoun County Public-School System Suddenly Discovers Due Process RBG Criticized National-Anthem Protests, and Katie Couric Covered It Up In response to Southernisms Police have apprehended the South Carolina shooting suspect, thank God. Unless true insanity is involved, acts like this are not “senseless.” They represent calculated evil, and they should be punished in a manner that properly responds to the awful moral gravity of the crime — life for life. May God bless the victims and their families, and may they rest in His promise that those who mourn shall be comforted. There is much we don’t know about this horrible crime, but as Mona predicted, the politicization has begun. Indeed, it began well before Dylann Storm Roof was caught. Writing in Salon (where else?) Chauncey DeVega decried the “racial double standard” allegedly at work in the (hours-old) coverage of the attack, declared that “White right-wing domestic terrorism is one of the greatest threats to public safety and security in post 9/11 United States of America.” and then posited a series of bizarre questions that were irrelevant to the still-emerging facts of this crime. The questions, however, are deeply revealing of a certain radical mindset, one that seeks to use isolated horrific events to offer sweeping indictments against an entire ideological and cultural enemies list (anyone remember the aftermath of the Gabby Giffords shooting?) A crisis, after all, is a terrible thing to waste. Here are DeVega’s questions, with my answers following: 1. What is radicalizing white men to commit such acts of domestic terrorism and mass shootings? Are Fox News and the right-wing media encouraging violence? The racial demographics of mass shooters roughly approximates the racial demographics of the United States. White men appear to have no greater or lesser likelihood of becoming mass shooters than men of any other race. As for Fox News, is there a single shred of evidence that Roof watched even one second of the channel? Moreover, is there a single shred of evidence that anyone from Fox (or any other popular conservative media outlet) has ever encouraged or condoned such a heinous act? It would be bizarre indeed to believe that a channel or website “encouraged” an act (mass killings) they’ve always and forever loudly condemned. 2. Is something wrong with the white family? Why are their sons and men so violent? Yes, there is something wrong with the white family. Its rates of illegitimacy and fatherlessness have been climbing for years and are reaching crisis levels. Sadly, other races are in even worse shape. Here are some recent statistics: “72.3 percent of non-Hispanic blacks are now born out-of-wedlock; 66.2 percent of American Indians/Alaska Natives; 53.3 percent of Hispanics; 29.1 percent of non-Hispanic whites; and 17.2 percent of Asians/Pacific Islanders. That’s 40.7 percent overall.” 3. What should law enforcement and white politicians do about white crime? As with all crimes regardless of demographics, law enforcement should investigate and prosecute crimes to the full extent of the law — while fully protecting the constitutional rights of all suspected criminals. While “white crime” is a problem (as is all crime), white citizens commit crime at a disproportionately low rate. 4. Is the Charleston mass shooting just one more sign that America needs sensible and reasonable gun control policies? Define “sensible and reasonable.” The story today would be very different had one of the victims been able to exercise their basic (and constitutional) right to self-defense with their own, lawfully carried gun. We do not yet know if any victim was carrying a weapon or attempted to use it in self-defense. Nor do we know how Roof obtained his weapon. However, one thing we do know: not even the existence of the most draconian law in the land (prohibitions against murder that carry the death penalty) deterred this lawless act. 5. Where are the white fathers in the white home? Too many are absent, but they tend to be more present than black or Latino fathers and less present than Asian-American dads. 6. When will white leadership step up and stop white right-wing domestic terrorism? There is no evidence that American law enforcement (of any race) is ignoring or failing to “step up” against alleged “right-wing domestic terrorism.” In fact, the evidence suggests the opposite. In its zeal to stop alleged “right-wing extremism” the Department of Homeland Security is paying inordinate attention to plainly peaceful political movements. Moreover, I reject the notion that much of what is described as “right-wing violence” — especially racist or fascist violence — is ”right” in any meaningful sense. The Klan, for example has long roots in the Democratic Party, with Democrat Robert Byrd — a former “Exalted Cyclops” of the Klan — the most recent example. 7. Is White American culture pathological? Why is White America so violent? As noted above, “white America” is too violent, but it is less violent than other American racial groups. 8. Are there appropriate role models for white men and boys? Could better role models and mentoring help to prevent white men and boys from committing mass shootings and being seduced by right-wing domestic terrorism? #related#While all of the questions are posed in bad faith, this one stands out. As every sentient person knows, many neighborhoods are so overrun with fatherlessness, crime, and poverty, that young men lack for proper role models in their immediate social circles. This deficiency can’t be corrected by the presence of role models in books or on television. Better role models — like a good father – can, of course, help prevent all manner of bad acts, from drug use to murder. While early reports are often wrong, the available evidence indicates that a young man committed a terrorist act in a church, one apparently motivated by racial hatred. Now is the time to find and punish the guilty — while standing with the victims through prayer, compassion, and the material support they need. Some people, however, can’t resist spreading even more racial bitterness. Their ideology is too compulsive and their anger is too deep. Get our conservative analysis delivered right to you.

In the study, led by epidemiologist Anthony Fabio of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, researchers partnered with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police to trace the origins of all 893 firearms that police recovered from crime scenes in the year 2008. They found that in approximately 8 out of 10 cases, the perpetrator was not a lawful gun owner but rather in illegal possession of a weapon that belonged to someone else. The researchers were primarily interested in how these guns made their way from a legal purchase — at a firearm dealer or via a private sale — to the scene of the crime. ""All guns start out as legal guns,"" Fabio said in an interview. But a ""huge number of them"" move into illegal hands. ""As a public-health person, I'd like to be able to figure out that path,"" he added. More than 30 percent of the guns that ended up at crime scenes had been stolen, according to Fabio's research. But more than 40 percent of those stolen guns weren't reported by the owners as stolen until after police contacted them when the gun was used in a crime. One of the more concerning findings in the study was that for the majority of guns recovered (62 percent), ""the place where the owner lost possession of the firearm was unknown."" ""We have a lot of people with a lot of guns,"" Fabio said, referencing statistics on the large number of guns in circulation. ""And some of them aren't keeping track of them for different reasons — maybe because they have a lot of them and they don't use them that often."" A number of factors could lead to legal firearms entering the black market. Owners could misplace them, or they could be stolen — either through carelessness on the owner's part (leaving a gun in an unlocked car, for instance) or determination on the part of thieves. It's also likely that many guns on the black market got there via straw purchases — where a person purchases a gun from a dealer without disclosing that they're buying it for someone else. This is illegal under federal law. One potential sign that straw purchasing is a factor in the Pittsburgh data: Forty-four percent of the gun owners who were identified in 2008 did not respond to police attempts to contact them. The top-line finding of the study — that the overwhelming majority of gun crimes aren't committed by lawful gun owners — reinforces a common refrain among gun rights advocacy groups. They argue that since criminals don't follow laws, new regulations on gun ownership would only serve to burden lawful owners while doing little to combat crime. But Fabio's research suggests that this strict dichotomy between ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" isn't necessarily helpful for figuring out how to keep ""good"" guns — those purchased legally — from getting into ""bad"" hands. And there may be modest, non-burdensome ways to help keep guns in the hands of the good guys. For instance, 10 states plus the District of Columbia have laws in place requiring gun owners to report the theft or loss of firearms to law enforcement, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a group that advocates for stronger firearm regulations. But in the majority of states, no such law is in place. Additionally, past research has demonstrated that a small fraction of gun dealers are responsible for the majority of guns used in crimes in the United States. A 2000 report from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms found that in 1998, more than 85 percent of gun dealers had no guns used in crimes trace back to them. By contrast, 1 percent of dealers accounted for nearly 6 in 10 crime gun traces that year. The firearms bureau knows exactly who these gun dealers are — but they're not allowed to share that information with policymakers or researchers due to a law passed by Congress in 2003. As a result, solutions for stanching the flow of guns from these dealers to crime scenes remain frustratingly out of reach for public-health researchers. ""There's not much federal funding out there to do research on firearm and firearm safety,"" Fabio said. As a result, ""there's not a lot of good research out there. The process of getting it done has been hindered by a lot of limits on academics and how they can do firearms research."" In the meantime, researchers have to be creative — like partnering with local law enforcement agencies to find answers to their questions.

The sale or manufacturing of large-capacity magazines is illegal in the state and now the possession of them will be too. SB1235 requires background checks for people buying ammunition, a license for people selling bullets and purchasing data submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. Newsom’s measures also require background checks for buying ammunition, although regulated differently.

SACRAMENTO — It will soon be harder to buy ammunition in California and illegal to own magazine clips that hold more than 10 rounds under a suite of gun-control bills Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law on Friday. Brown signed six bills and vetoed five, actions that will nonetheless build upon the state’s arsenal of gun control laws aimed at curtailing mass shootings and keeping weapons and ammunition away from the wrong people. California already has the strictest gun laws in the nation. Many of the 11 gun bills that landed on the governor’s desk this week were crafted in response to the mass shooting in San Bernardino in December, and got a boost of urgency following the mass shooting in an Orlando nightclub last month. The new laws include SB880 by Sen. Isadore Hall III, D-Compton (Los Angeles County), and Sen. Steve Glazer, D-Orinda, which expands the definition of assault weapon to include specified guns with military-style features capable of accepting any type of detachable magazine. Another bill signed by the governor bans so-called “bullet buttons,” a tool developed by gun manufacturers that allows magazines to easily detach for rapid replacement. Brown also signed SB1446 by Sen. Loni Hancock, D-Berkeley, which makes it illegal to possess magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. The sale or manufacturing of large-capacity magazines was already illegal in the state. Among the vetoes was the only bill with bipartisan support, AB1176, which would have authorized a ballot measure asking voters to make it a felony to steal a gun or buy a stolen gun, regardless of its value. The new restrictions led by California’s Democratic-controlled  Legislature come on the heels of gridlock over gun control laws in Congress, where House Democrats staged a sit-in to protest last month. “My goal in signing these bills is to enhance public safety by tightening our existing laws in a responsible and focused manner, while protecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners,” Brown said in a signing message Friday. All of the bills except AB1176 were opposed by Republicans and gun rights advocates. “These are constitutionally illegitimate laws passed by a patently illegitimate government that had the audacity to attack and criminalize millions of its own people in Stalin-esque fashion,” said Brandon Combs, president of the Firearms Policy Coalition, a gun rights group. Whether Californians want the state’s gun-control laws to go further will be left to voters in the fall. Brown said he vetoed AB1176, the gun-theft felony bill, because it is nearly identical to parts of Proposition 63, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s “Safety for All” ballot initiative, which will appear on the November ballot. But the governor signed SB1235, the ammunition background check bill, which also overlapped with Newsom’s ballot measure. SB1235 requires background checks for people buying ammunition, a license for people selling bullets and purchasing data submitted to the state Department of Justice. Newsom’s measure also requires background checks, vendor licensing and data sharing on ammunition purchases, although regulated differently. Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León, D-Los Angeles, urged Newsom to withdraw his measure while the Legislature worked to pass the gun control legislation. Newsom declined before Thursday’s deadline to remove measures from the fall ballot. De León’s ammunition bill, SB1235, however, was amended recently so that if signed by the governor, as it was Friday, parts of it would supersede Newsom’s ammunition proposal should voters approve it. Newsom’s ballot measure still contains several gun control provisions that the gun lobby is fighting, including requiring gun owners to report when their firearm is lost or stolen. “Voters will finally have a chance to take matters into their own hands and keep the momentum going with bold reforms that build on these achievements and go well beyond,” Newsom said in a statement.

Here’s the one from Mother Jones: (c) Mother Jones. Used with permission. In the image above, the “bursty” distribution of incidents toward the right-hand side of the graph shows that these incidents are closer together in time — a trend made more explicit in the graphic below showing data analysis by the Harvard School of Public Health. (c) Mother Jones. Used with permission. Does the increasing proximity of these incidents demonstrate copycat effects? Very possibly. Research by Arizona State University mathematics research professor Sherry Towers and colleagues suggests that like suicides and homicides, media coverage of mass shootings and school shootings tend to increase similar incidents in the surrounding community. [The San Bernardino shooting is the 355th mass shooting this year] Terrorism research has found that terror attacks tend to be similarly “contagious.” (For a discussion on what I mean by “terrorism,” see this primer by Brian J. Phillips, who shares the same definition I do.) In an article published in 1980, Manus Midlarsky, Martha Crenshaw, and Fumihiko Yoshida argued that terror “is a highly imitable strategy.” Qualitative research based on various quasi-Marxist groups from the 1960s and 1970s suggests these groups learned from and emulated one another quite deliberately. More recent research by Alex Braithwaite and Quan Li shows that incidents of terror tend to cluster around particular times and places as well, leading it to have similar “bursty” qualities in both space and time. Recent research by Blake Garcia and Cameron Wimpy has confirmed that anti-government violence tends to spread when people have access to information about violence in neighboring spaces. All these findings would be consistent with emulation dynamics, competition dynamics, or a mix of both. Why do we observe these copycat dynamics? Some suggest that incidents of violence “plant a seed” in the minds of those already predisposed to averse behavior, thereby tipping motivated actors into committed ones. Others blame media coverage. Brigitte Nacos has argued that contemporary information technology makes the contagion of violence easier, expanding the potential geographic distribution of copycat violence. In the era of print media, for instance, the finite space for coverage of numerous violent events necessarily limited the amount of attention devoted to any single attack, thereby limiting incentives to engage in symbolic violence. With internet technology, these limitations are no more. Easy access to more lethal technology — and knowledge about how to deploy it — may also be partially responsible for contagion of particular attack repertoires, such as bombings or shootings. In essence, they become easier to conduct after others have established and demonstrated the technical know-how required to carry them out. For instance, Michael Horowitz sees the rise of suicide bombing as a function of tactical diffusion across groups with similar dispositions and operational capacities. Still others suggest that “violent entrepreneurs” are often seeking notoriety, prestige, or status among their own communities. Provocative acts by others might move them into action to steal some of the vicarious attention possible in such close proximity to another grisly act. Alternatively, it may allow them to “out-do” the prior act while the latter is still fresh in the minds of observers. [People who live near mass shootings are less likely to vote Republican] Finally, because terroristic violence by definition always involves a wider political goal, some have argued that terror is often an attempt to win support within a broader community — a community perhaps marginalized by various forms of oppression. This is especially likely when several groups are vying for popular support and political influence, thereby leading to “clustering” of terror incidents due to the internal competition and rivalry within competing groups. What’s important is that the imitative effects of mass shootings and terror attacks may not be unrelated to one another. The blurry distinction between what constitutes mass shootings vs. acts of terror means that, functionally, those motivated to obtain notoriety or political power through graphic violence may not really care whether their competitors are “terrorists,” “shooters” or something else. Even when investigators discover political motivations for mass shootings after the fact, it’s not always clear whether an assailant meant to further those political goals through the act of violence. In studies involving multiple different types of violence, Gary Slutkin has found that violent acts tend to spread like “a contagious disease,” increasing other forms of violence. This finding prompts him to frame all forms of violence as public health issues that necessarily reinforce one another. Similarly, other studies suggest that acts of terror often occur in the context of contentious moments within society — increases in different forms of violence can signal larger trends of polarization, discontentment, disruption, and despair. Reduce the latter trends, reduce the violence. Now for some perspective. Although mass shootings have increased in recent years, it’s important to keep in mind that gun homicides have been declining steadily since the 1980s. Moreover, Americans tend to greatly exaggerate the likelihood of being the victim of terror within the United States (as compared to, say, being killed by their furniture or any number of other causes of premature death ). Notwithstanding last summer’s attacks in Chattanooga and Charleston, last week’s attacks on Black Lives Matter activists in Minnesota and Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs, and (possibly) the San Bernadino attacks, multi-casualty terror attacks within the U.S. have become exceedingly rare. [You’re more likely to be fatally crushed by furniture than killed by terrorists.] But regardless of the facts, the public’s heightened anxiety and expectations of more terror are, themselves, troubling. Consider this observation about why violence clusters in space and time, as noted by Midlarsky, et al some thirty-five years ago: In other words, the fact that many people appear resigned to mass shootings and other forms of violence as “the new normal” in the United States could be part of the problem, not part of the solution. None of these recent killings was inevitable; all were probably preventable. Concerted efforts to reinforce norms and practices of nonviolent behavior in all communities are certainly necessary. So is a thorough national conversation about: (1) what our society is doing to stop mass violence; (2) what our society cannot or will not do to stop mass violence; (3) what our society does that allows (or even encourages) mass violence to take place;  (4) and what, if anything, our society can do to prevent violence and terror from impressing hopelessness upon the nation’s collective imagination. Without concerted effort to reinforce norms and practices of nonviolent behavior in all communities, more violence — not less— may be on the horizon.

Lawmakers at a House Judiciary Committee hearing asked Holder what he knew in advance of public disclosure of a so-called gun-walking tactic in early 2011. As part of Operation Fast and Furious, agents were told to forego immediate arrests of suspected straw purchasers of guns and instead try to track the guns to higher-ups in gun-smuggling rings. Such a tactic is normally barred under Justice Department policy. Agents lost track of hundreds of guns which flowed south to Mexico, where many were recovered at crime scenes. Two such guns were found in the U.S. at the scene of the killing of border agent Brian Terry. Holder told the committee he became aware of the gun-walking tactic at the same time as the public and that he found out ""about the same time"" that guns found at the scene of Terry's death were part of Operation Fast and Furious. Holder has faced off repeatedly with Issa and other Republicans in recent months over his handling of the aborted firearms investigation. Issa's committee has prepared a contempt citation against Holder but not voted on it yet, applying pressure for more documents on Operation Fast and Furious. Holder said the Justice Department has cooperated fully with congressional investigators and turned over 7,600 pages of material to Congress about the operation. ""Look, I don't want to hear about the 7,600,"" snapped Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican and Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that is investigating the operation. Issa has been Holder's frequent sparring partner during recent gun-walking hearings. Issa said Thursday that wiretap applications in Operation Fast and Furious indicate that a number of key individuals at the Justice Department were responsible for the use of the gun-walking tactic. ""I've read them,"" replied Holder, adding that he disagreed with Issa's conclusions. The material on the wiretaps is sealed in a federal court, but Issa said the committee obtained the applications from whistleblowers cooperating with his investigation. Gun-walking has long been barred by Justice Department policy, but was used in the Arizona operation in an effort to dismantle entire arms-trafficking networks and reach kingpins who had long eluded prosecution. Previous law enforcement strategy had focused on prosecuting low-level illicit arms buyers at the bottom of the chain, but that allowed thousands of weapons to reach Mexico. The gun-walking tactic was first used in two similar operations during the George W. Bush administration. Committee chairman Lamar Smith of Texas asked for the identity of the highest-level official in the Obama administration who knew gun-walking was taking place. Holder replied that the operation began in law enforcement offices in Arizona and that he was not at all certain beyond that. I don't think anybody in Washington knew about those tactics,"" said the attorney general. The Justice Department's inspector general is looking into who knew. ""How many people in Mexico have been killed as a result of the U.S."" engaging in the gun-walking tactic? asked Rep. Ted Poe, Republican of Texas. ""I don't know, but I think there would be some,"" replied Holder. The attorney general pointed to a broader picture: That 68,000 guns recovered by Mexican authorities in the past five years have been traced back to the United States. Operation Fast and Furious involved about 2,000 guns in total, and agents lost track of about 1,400 of those. At Thursday's hearing, House Democrats placed on record letters urging Issa not to pursue Holder's contempt citation. The letters included notes from Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey, the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, the survivors of the mass shooting in Tucson that wounded former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and the National Action Network headed by the Rev. Al Sharpton. Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.

We've received your submission. (Post photo illustration: Peter LaVigna)  (
) When Paul Krugman dies, he’ll be primarily remembered for three things: He won the 2008 Nobel Prize in economics; he has been one of the world’s most-read and most-influential political pundits; and he said with total seriousness (watch the video) that a way to fix America’s economy would be for the government to spend a ton of money preparing for a nonexistent alien invasion because at least that would get people working. I’ll save you the trouble of writing in with the riposte, “Where’s your Nobel Prize?” The Nobel committee is not infallible (the guy who invented the lobotomy and declared it “always safe” got a Nobel), but even if it was, Krugman’s award was not for political philosophy but for an arcane point of technical analysis, and even if it were for political philosophy, many economists with the opposite philosophy (Milton Friedman, Gary Becker, Friedrich Hayek) have also won the Nobel. Krugman is a most unusual economist. Others may measure their words, issue caveats, acknowledge that the research isn’t conclusive, admit that their biases influence their reading of facts. Not Krugman. Krugman is remarkable for his freewheeling writing style, which frequently leads to lively metaphors (“invisible bond-market vigilantes,” “confidence fairy”). He is often dismissive, misleading and tendentious. He changes the subject, ignores inconvenient evidence and plays playground bully to people he sees as ideological enemies (a list longer than Nixon’s). He blasts away at others’ work without even providing the basic courtesy of a link to what he’s talking about, which is a disservice to readers who might like to review the other side of the argument to decide for themselves. In his new book “End This Depression Now!” (W. W. Norton & Company), he compares Ben Bernanke to the moronic Chance the Gardener in “Being There” — and Bernanke is the man who hired Krugman at Princeton. Krugman “writes with more vitriol than I find attractive,” writes Harvard economist and fellow Times columnist Greg Mankiw. He treats anyone who disagrees as “a mendacious idiot,” writes George Mason University economist Alex Tabarrok. “Krugman should stop bullying people,” wrote columnist Michael Kinsley. In short, to use the kind of colorful language the great Nobelist favors, Paul Krugman is a jackass. Take his recent, bizarre feud with economist Veronique de Rugy. Whenever she cites a number, he wrote recently, “You can pretty much assume that it’s wrong.” Rugy writes from a pro-free-market perspective. Krugman’s principal job may be to throw his readers the liberal equivalent of red meat (organic, sustainable, fair-trade soy with nontoxic pink dye?). But is this the professional courtesy one academic has for a colleague in the field? Rugy holds a Ph.D. from the Sorbonne. She has been published in the LA Times and The Wall Street Journal. She even appears regularly at The New York Times site, as a contributor to their “Room for Debate” blog. Can she really be so much of a ninny that we should automatically dismiss everything she says? Moreover, the point she was making was one that’s difficult to ignore. Rugy had produced a chart showing that there haven’t been big government cutbacks in Europe. (Krugman didn’t link to it). To call the chart a blockbuster is to understate the case. It showed that France, Italy, Spain, the UK and Greece are all spending about the same as they were a couple of years ago and far more than they were spending five years ago. Imagine this: Leading intellectuals are having a national conversation on how drastically we need to increase gun control due to a mass shooting — and then a detective calmly ducks under the crime-scene tape, looks around and says, “Actually, nobody here has been shot. They were all stabbed.” Krugman did three things he does time and again: He ignored the substance of what Rugy had found, changed the subject and changed the terms of the debate. He started talking about Ireland (which Rugy hadn’t even mentioned!) and noted that lots of European countries have raised taxes (which is Rugy’s whole point — European austerity has consisted mainly of tax hikes, not spending cuts). He said that though Ireland’s spending is at the same level as it was in 2007 and 2008 (pre-crash), we shouldn’t count a lot of that because some was bank bailouts and some was welfare spending. Yet, as a Keynesian, Krugman usually maintains that it doesn’t matter what you’re spending on, as long as you’re spending: Just shovel the bucks in the furnace, we’ll all warm ourselves by the glow. Hence his “Independence Day” stimulus scenario: To you and me, that looks like a colossal waste of money on laser cannons that will never be used and will sit there rusting and burning up maintenance dollars for the next hundred years. But you and I aren’t geniuses like Krugman. Blithely ignoring evidence that there have not been savage spending cuts in Europe, he continued making the same argument in his May 17 column, saying (he must have a hot key for this by now), “Europe’s answer has been austerity: savage spending cuts” (note he didn’t say tax hikes). Free-market economists (also known as the Austrian school, hence Krugman’s clever combo term for his enemies as “Austerians”) can hardly be blamed for Europe’s weak economies if those countries are doing the opposite of what Austerians prescribe, which is to cut out a lot of spending while reducing taxes. Krugman has been saying we shouldn’t make economic choices to placate a nonexistent “confidence fairy,” but now the Austerians are razzing him for believing in “an austerity fairy.” For Krugman to be wrong about such a prominent subject matters: He not only has a lot of readers; some of them actually hold positions in government. They assume that King Krug can’t be wrong about anything. Krugman makes it easy to ignore opposing views because he doesn’t link to them. Why? Maybe he doesn’t want to dignify his opponents or give them traffic. But if he wouldn’t dignify them with a link, why does he bother to dignify them by mentioning them (then distorting their claims)? I think Krugman purposely and disingenuously conceals contrary evidence from his readers. He doesn’t want readers to ponder for themselves. Here is another trait that is very unscientific: He wants simply to be venerated, a rock star, the Mick Jagger of economics (sadly, we missed out on Mick Jagger becoming the Mick Jagger of economics when he dropped out of the London School of Economics to sing in a band in 1963). Krugman’s problem, as he reminds us in “End This Depression Now!” is that he is a fanatic in the grip of a religion called “Keynesianism” which says you should borrow and spend your way out of a recession. An Austerian, Russ Roberts (who, like Rugy and Tabarrok, is affiliated with the Avengers-like superhero squad of free-market economists at George Mason University, whose staff also includes such plain-spoken, highly readable economist-bloggers as Tyler Cowen, Donald Boudreaux, Arnold Kling and Bryan Caplan) fessed up to having a bias, which is a problem everybody has. It can cloud our perceptions. Krugman stomped all over him, saying this proved Roberts was a political hack, not a tough-minded science-y guy like himself. Roberts replied that this was a mighty strange line of attack coming from someone whose blog is “called the Conscience of a Liberal and not the Conscience of a Truth-Seeking Objective Bias-Free Scientist.” Krugman’s Keynesian faith is at best an unproven theory. It’s a pretty good rule not to throw trillions of dollars at unproven theories. The problem remains: We’ve got a debt that’s approaching $16,000,000,000,000. Center-left columnist Kinsley wrote, “I have been waiting for Paul Krugman to tell me how we are going to handle the debt, once we get this recession out of the way. No, really. There’s no economist whose judgment I trust more . . . But don’t we at some point have to start paying the money back? Why have taxes at all? Why deny ourselves anything money can buy? If $15 trillion in debt can be a freebie, why not $30 trillion or $60 trillion?” Krugman, typically, humiliated Kinsley on a technical point about inflation vs. hyperinflation and let this whopper of a question sit there, knowing that if he had his way, the debt would be several trillions larger than it is. Earlier this year Krugman wrote, “People think of debt’s role in the economy as if it were the same as what debt means for an individual: There’s a lot of money you have to pay to someone else. But that’s all wrong; the debt we create is basically money we owe to ourselves, and the burden it imposes does not involve a real transfer of resources.” In 2003, when the debt was less than half what it is today, he wrote, “We’re looking at a fiscal crisis that will drive interest rates sky-high . . . But what’s really scary — what makes a fixed-rate mortgage seem like such a good idea — is the looming threat to the federal government’s solvency . . . How will the train wreck play itself out? . . . My prediction is that politicians will eventually be tempted to resolve the crisis the way irresponsible governments usually do: by printing money, both to pay current bills and to inflate away debt.” Inflation to pay current bills, a reference to hyperinflation, is exactly what he would later ridicule Kinsley for worrying about. In 1996, Krugman (who, as Wall Street Journal blogger James Taranto never tires of reminding us, is a former Enron adviser) said Social Security has a “Ponzi-game aspect in which each generation takes out more than it put in.” Last year he said it “is and always has been mainly a pay-as-you-go system, which is nothing like a classic Ponzi scheme.” Of unemployment benefits, Krugman wrote in his textbook that “The drawback to this generosity is that it reduces a worker’s incentive to quickly find a new job.” Later he ridiculed Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) as “bizarre” for saying, “Continuing to pay people unemployment compensation is a disincentive for them to seek new work.” When Harvard Professor Mankiw doubted the Obama administration’s projection of 15.6% real growth between 2008 and 2013, Krugman accused him of “deliberate obtuseness” in a post titled “Roots of Evil.” Mankiw offered to wager on the matter but got no response. That was smart: The economy will have to catch fire and grow at about 7% between now and the end of 2013 for the Obama projection to come true. This month Krugman gave us a great summation of why he refuses to even stick to one set of wrong-headed ideas. He has a short attention span, like politicians focused on the next election cycle. “It’s usually far from clear,” Krugman wrote, “what exactly the long-run policy is supposed to be, other than the fact that it involves inflicting pain on workers and the poor.” Far from clear? Such uncharacteristic modesty! You knew Krugman was just building up to a one-liner, the one that showed how careless he was about consequences: “In the long run, we are all dead.” Kyle.Smith@nypost.com Share Selection"

The tea party Republican who sought former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords' seat in Congress has dropped out of the fall race, two days after losing a special election to serve out her term. Republican candidate Jesse Kelly made the announcement Thursday after, in his words, ""looking at the results from Tuesday."" Kelly lost Tuesday's election to Democrat Ron Barber by 6 percentage points. Barber was a Giffords staffer when he was wounded in the mass shooting that critically wounded Giffords and led to her resignation in January. It was Kelly's second losing race for the House seat. He lost to Giffords in 2010 by about 4,000 votes. Barber is expected to be sworn in next week. He will have to win over voters again in the November general election.

She resigned from the U.S. House in January to focus on her recovery from a 2011 shooting. Democrat Ron Barber is leading Republican Jesse Kelly 53%-41% among likely voters, according to a poll released today by the left-leaning Public Policy Polling, which said the data suggest ""Democrats are unusually motivated to come out and to keep Giffords' seat in their hands.""  The non-partisan Cook Political Report rates the race as competitive but said a Kelly victory would be considered the upset on Tuesday. BLOG:  Giffords may launch 'Gabby PAC' Since early voting began May 16, more than 150,000 ballots have been cast.  Democratic voters tend to participate in greater numbers to cast early ballots while more Republicans tend to show up in person to vote on Election Day. The conservative makeup of the district, however, has made it an enticing pickup opportunity for a Democratic-held seat. Kelly narrowly lost to Giffords in 2010. Republicans have had to campaign cautiously against Barber, who was with Giffords' at the 2011 mass shooting and was shot twice himself. The Kelly campaign has criticized Barber as a government bureaucrat and a rubber stamp for President Obama, while Democrats have aligned Kelly with the Tea Party and cast him as too extreme for the centrist district. It did not help Kelly's campaign that an unaffiliated super PAC that supports him sent an e-mail to voters using an imagine of the candidate, a Marine, holding an assault rifle. Meanwhile, Giffords appeared at a campaign rally for Barber over the weekend in her first political appearance since the shooting.  ""Thank you, thank you very much,"" were her only words to the crowd. Catalina Camia leads the OnPolitics online community and has been at USA TODAY since 2005.

U.S. District Judge Larry Burns ordered a status hearing on Jared Lee Loughner’s mental condition to be pushed back after prosecutors and defense attorneys sought additional time. It was to be held in Tucson, Arizona on June 27. Burns also ordered that the accused gunman remain in custody at a federal prison hospital in Springfield, Missouri, “pending further order of this Court.” Loughner, 23, has pleaded not guilty to 49 criminal charges stemming from the January 8, 2011, shooting spree in the parking lot outside a Tucson supermarket. Among those killed during the burst of violence were a federal judge and a 9-year-old girl. Giffords, an Arizona Democrat, was shot through the head and is still in rehabilitation. She resigned her seat in January and an election is being held Tuesday to choose a candidate to serve out the remaining six months of her congressional term. Loughner was declared mentally unfit for trial by Burns in May 2011 after two government experts concluded that he suffered from schizophrenia, disordered thinking and delusions. He is confined to a U.S. Bureau of Prisons facility where he is being forcibly medicated and undergoing therapy for his mental illness.

A gunman in a gas mask barged into a crowded Denver-area theater during a midnight premiere of the Batman movie on Friday, hurled a gas canister and then opened fire, killing 12 people and injuring at least 50 others in one of the deadliest mass shootings in recent U.S. history.  A Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputy withholds toy guns from Batman fans from Indiana at Universal CityWalk in Los Angeles.  New York City police officers stand in front of a midtown Manhattan movie theater as people arrive for a screening of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" on Friday.  Some theaters and police around the U.S. stepped up security at daytime showings of the new Batman movie Friday after the massacre in Colorado, and while many fans were undeterred by the tragedy, others were nervous about going to see the film. Two police officers were stationed outside the AMC theater in New York’s Times Square, which had showings of the “The Dark Knight Rises” beginning every 20 minutes. Later in the day, the officers gave way to a police cruiser that was parked out front with an officer in it. The precautions were taken after a gunman in Aurora, Colo., wearing a gas mask set off a gas canister and fired into a crowded theater in the Denver suburb at a midnight opening of the movie, killing 12 people and injuring at least 50 others, authorities said. The National Association of Theatre Owners announced Friday that it is “reviewing security procedures” in theaters after the attack. Locally, the Orange County Sheriff’s Department said they will be monitoring activity around movie theaters tonight. No added enforcement has been planned so far. Officers in Orange were informed about the deadly mass shooting at the Denver-area theater. “The watch commanders for each shift will be discussing the incident in more detail, along with extra patrol checks for our theaters,” Orange police Sgt. Fred Lopez said. In online comments, moviegoers said the attack had left them edgy. “Not going to the movies for a while,” tweeted one Costa Mesa woman. “No place is safe.” Allison Sweetland of Huntington Beach, who goes to school in Denver, said she was shocked by the tragedy as she waited in line at the Century 20 Huntington Beach at Bella Terra cineplex. “I’m grateful that none of my Colorado friends were in that theater,” she said. “I can’t believe it. My prayers go out to those families.” Another, moviegoer, Matthew Pate of Huntington Beach, called mass shooting “a tragedy for the entire nation.”: “I am always surprised by the ability of people to commit such violent crimes,” he said. “I am also glad that both presidential candidates suspended their campaigns in light of the tragedy.” Christine Cooley, who works for the University of Florida at a campus installation near Tampa, Fla., said she and her 15-year-old daughter were stunned to wake up to the news. Cooley said her daughter has sworn off going to the movies. “It’s tainted the movie completely for her,” Cooley said. “It’s summertime. That’s a big movie time for teenagers. That movie is off the list now. Movie theaters in general are off her summer to-do list because of that.” Cooley said she tried to explain that the shooting was random and not an indication of security at theaters in general, “but I can see where she’s coming from. Why put yourself in harm’s way?” At the United Artists Riverview Stadium 17 in Philadelphia, a steady stream of people headed in for morning showings of “The Dark Knight Rises.” Staff members said that there was extra security, but that that was normal for big movies — and not because of the shooting in Colorado. Neal Mates, 38, a professed “film geek,” said: “Shootings can happen anywhere. … I think it’s silly to blame the film.” Executives of St. Louis-based Wehrenberg Theatres had discussions before dawn with managers of its 15 cinemas in Illinois, Missouri, Minnesota and Iowa, spokeswoman Kelly Hoskins said. She said the company feels comfortable with security already in place and plans no changes. She said she hopes other theater chains don’t panic and cancel showings. “That just wouldn’t be good,” she said. “It’s like a terrorist attack — you don’t want them to think we’re all scared.” The National Association of Theater Owners said in a statement that its members are “working closely with local law enforcement agencies and reviewing security procedures.” ——— Register staff writers Denisse Salazar, Alejandra Molina and the Associated Press contributed to this report.

(AP) -- Police say the apartment of the James Holmes, the suspect in  the mass shooting at a Denver area movie theater, is booby-trapped, so they've evacuated five surrounding buildings. Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates says bomb technicians are determining how to disarm flammable or explosive material in the third-floor apartment. He says police could be there some time. Oates says pictures from inside the apartment are fairly disturbing, and the devices look to be sophisticated. FBI agents and police used a hook and ladder fire truck and put a camera at the end of 12-foot pole inside the apartment where 24-year-old James Holmes lives. The 24-year-old former medical student's apartment is about four miles from the theater where at least 12 people were killed and 50 were wounded Family releases statement Police released a written statement from Holmes' family: ""Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved."" Possible victims' kin seek relative AURORA, Colo. (AP) -- Family members are showing up at a suburban Denver high school where witnesses to a mass shooting at a movie theater were taken. Tom Sullivan arrived at Gateway High School in Aurora Friday morning with a photo of his son, Alex, and was asking reporters if they'd seen him. Byron Settles was at the high school looking for his nephew, Tyrell Hardiman. Settles says it's unusual because Hardiman was supposed to be at work but wasn't. Obama 'saddened' President Barack Obama said he was saddened by the ""horrific and tragic shooting,"" pledging that his administration was ""committed to bringing whoever was responsible to justice, ensuring the safety of our people, and caring for those who have been wounded."" It was the worst mass shooting in the U.S. since the Nov. 5, 2009, attack at Fort Hood, Texas, when an Army psychiatrist killed 13 soldiers and civilians and more than two dozen others wounded. In Colorado, the shooting was the deadliest since the Columbine High School massacre on April 20, 1999, when two students opened fire at the school in the Denver suburb of Littleton, killing 12 classmates and a teacher and wounding 26 others before killing themselves. Witness ducked in time Jennifer Seeger, 25, from Aurora said she was in the second row, about four feet from the gunman, when he pointed a gun at her face. At first, ""I was just a deer in headlights. I didn't know what to do,"" she said. Then she ducked to the ground. The gunman shot people seated behind her. ""There were bullet (casings) just falling on my head. They were burning my forehead,"" Seeger said. The gunman fired steadily except when he stopped to reload. ""Every few seconds it was just 'Boom, boom, boom,'"" she said. ""He would reload and shoot and anyone who would try to leave would just get killed,"" she said. Seeger said she began crawling toward an exit when she saw a girl about 14 years old, ""lying lifeless on the stairs."" She saw a man with a bullet wound in his back and tried to check his pulse, but ""I had to go. I was going to get shot."" ""I thought it was showmanship. I didn't think it was real,"" she said. 'Thought it was a joke, a hoax' Sylvana Guillen, 20, said when a man appeared at the front of the theater clad in dark clothing looking like a SWAT team member as Catwoman made an appearance in the movie, the audience ""thought it was a joke, a hoax."" Then they heard gunshots and smelled smoke from a canister he was carrying, and Guillen knew it was real. The gunman began walking toward the seats and firing. Guillen said she told her friend, Misha Mostashiry, ""You better get ready to be shot."" Mostashiry, also 20, said they couldn't tell where the gunman was. ""All you could do is hope he didn't come for you,"" she said. ""We ran to the emergency exit and nothing happened. Nothing happened to us,"" Mostashiry said, with surprise and relief in her voice. On their dash to the exit, they saw a man slip in the blood of a wounded woman he was trying to help. Dash to escape Tanner Coon told the NBC ""Today"" show he was at the movie with a friend and his friend's 12-year-old brother when about 20 minutes into the movie the gunman appeared. Coon said that when they realized they were being shot at, they got on the floor in front of their seats. After ""a period of quiet"" everyone started to run out. He said he went to a row behind him and ""slipped on some blood and landed"" on a woman. He said he shook her, telling her they needed to get out, but she was unresponsive and he ""presumed she was dead."" He said the 12-year-old was ""freaking out"" and ""really upset"" after they escaped the theater.

86355356,2012-07-20 14:30:05,What You Need To Know About the Batman Theater Shooting [UPDATES],http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/motherjones/main/~3/arkmAa29zDo/batman-theater-shooting-updates-dark-knight-rises,en,False,,1112,Mother Jones,http://www.motherjones.com/,"Xinhua/ZUMA Press A mass shooting at a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises in Aurora, Colorado, has left at least twelve people dead and 58 wounded. The massacre occurred at the Century 16 cineplex at the Aurora Town Center Mall. The suspected shooter is a local resident named James Eagan Holmes who is in police custody, along with the weapons used in the shooting. There is no clear motive for the attack known at this time. This story will be updated throughout the day as we receive more information. Click here to jump to the latest update. How Holmes Was Armed Holmes carried an assault rifle, a shotgun, and two pistols, the Associated Press reports. Holmes reportedly entered the theater from the emergency exit wearing a gas mask and a bullet proof vest. Witness Accounts According to two witnesses whose interview was flagged by the Huffington Post, he entered the theater, tossed canisters of some kind of gas, and then started shooting. “He looked so calm when he did it, it looked scary,” the witness says.  One of the witnesses says he “thought it was part of the show.” Here’s another interview with a witness to the shooting, conducted by a local NBC affiliate in Colorado:   The witness says “we thought special effects, midnight showing, that’s awesome—what theater does that anymore?” After a few moments, the witness continues, he saw “holes in the walls” and realized that the smoke wasn’t part of the show. Poynter, a journalism news site, has collected tweets from people who were at the movie theater in Aurora when the shooting started. More About the Shooter Holmes, the suspected shooter, was a former graduate student in neuroscience at the University of Colorado-Denver School of Medicine. He withdrew from the college last month. He attended Westview High School in San Diego, California, graduating in 2006. He has no previous criminal record. The city of Aurora police chief says that Holmes’ apartment contains “very sophisticated” explosives, and that police could be at the scene “for hours or days.” According to a federal law enforcement source, Holmes had colored his hair red and told local police that he was “The Joker,” the villain in The Dark Knight (2008). Official Response In the wake of the mass killing, other police departments across the country are now stepping up security measures at area theaters. The Paris gala premiere of the film was cancelled. President Barack Obama was reportedly briefed on the incident early Friday morning. In light of the tragedy, the president has cancelled a campaign event in Winter Park, Florida. The White House released a statement early Friday morning, and Obama will address the shooting at 11:20 a.m. in Fort Myers, Florida. It’s common for presidents and other top national politicians to release statements in the wake of big national tragedies, and both Obama and rival Mitt Romney have already expressed “shock and sorrow” at the incident. The Obama and Romney campaigns have both suspended running political advertisements on Colorado television stations, said spokespeople for the campaigns. Bill Burton, cofounder of the pro-Obama Priorities USA Action super-PAC, tweeted that his group was suspending its Colorado ads as well. President Obama remarked on the shooting Friday morning at a campaign stop in Fort Myers, in southwestern Florida. He said he’d spoken with Aurora Mayor Steve Hogan and Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper to express his and First Lady Michelle Obama’s sadness at the shooting. “The federal government stands ready to do whatever’s necessary to bring whomever’s responsible for this heinous crime to justice,” Obama said. “We will take every step possible to ensure the safety of all of our people. We’re going to stand by our neighbors in Colorado during this extraordinarily difficult time.” During a press briefing Friday morning aboard Air Force One, White House press secretary Jay Carney was asked if President Obama believes that the Aurora massacre warrants a review of gun safety laws. Carney told reporters the following: The president believes that we need to take common-sense measures that protect Second Amendment rights of Americans, while ensuring that those who should not have guns under existing law do not get them…But I have nothing new—nothing additional on that for you. UPDATE, Friday, 11:45 a.m. EST: Suspected gunman’s landlord won’t talk publicly In a brief conversation with Mother Jones, Joan Holley, the manager of Holley Realty who rents out units at the Aurora, Colorado, apartment building where suspected gunman James E. Holmes lived, said she is not yet speaking publicly about Holmes. “Out of respect to the victims and other people involved, I am declining to answer any questions at this time,” Holley said. Holley would not confirm whether she knew Holmes. Asked if she had yet talked to the local police, she said, “I’m going to say goodbye now. I cannot answer at this time.” According to a former resident of that building (who did not know Holmes), the building is mostly rented to college students. Holmes reportedly attended an area medical school but withdrew last month. UPDATE 2, Friday, 12:25 p.m. EST: Photo of suspected gunman Multiple news sources say this is a photo of suspected shooter James E. Holmes:  The image was sent to a local ABC affiliate by the University of Colorado, where Holmes was reportedly a student. UPDATE 3, Friday, 12:35 p.m. EST: Suspected gunman’s yearbook photo Here’s Holmes’ high school yearbook photo, according to San Diego 6 News:   UPDATE 4, Friday, 1:22 p.m. EST: Organizations respond with calls for gun control Dan Gross of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the largest group in the United States of its kind, issued a statement this morning expressing sympathies to the victims’ families and survivors, and also called for action on gun laws: This tragedy is another grim reminder that guns are the enablers of mass killers and that our nation pays an unacceptable price for our failure to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. We are outraged. We understand that President Obama has just spoken and so might Mitt Romney. As someone who has suffered the lasting impact of gun violence, and President of Brady, I can tell you that we don’t want sympathy.  We want action…We are insistent that our elected leaders take action to prevent future tragedies. Political cowardice is not an excuse for evasion and inaction on this life-and-death issue. The United States Conference of Mayors responded similarly: The nation’s mayors express their shock at a mass shooting and send their condolences to the victims, their families, and their community…While we don’t yet have all of the facts in the case, we do know that all evidence this morning points to a heavily armed assailant now in police custody. While questions about his motives and about how he obtained his weapons will be answered in the hours and days ahead, the fact remains that once again guns have been used in a mass killing of innocent people. The U.S. Conference of Mayors is repeating its call for reasonable changes in our gun laws and regulations that could help to prevent senseless tragedies such as the one that has rocked Aurora and the nation this morning.  UPDATE 5, Friday, 2:05 p.m. EST: “Not speculating on motive.” During a joint press conference, Aurora police chief Dan Oates told reporters that his department is “not speculating on motive” at this time. He also mentioned that the explosives for boobytrap found in alleged gunman Holmes’s apartment were “linked together with all sorts of wire.” Oates stated that the police are “not prepared to release [Holmes’] booking photo” today, and that he didn’t yet know whether or not the weapons used were possessed legally. UPDATE 6, Friday, 3:27 p.m. EST: Stars of The Dark Knight Rises cancel promotional events Dark Knight Rises stars Morgan Freeman and Marion Cotillard have pulled out of major press and promotional events scheduled for today and and this evening in France. “The whole team decided out of respect for the families to cancel the premiere,” Cotillard representative said. Warner Bros., which is distributing the film, has not announced whether or not they will cancel future promotional events.  UPDATE 7, Friday, 3:35 p.m. EST: Firearms bought legally, “drum-style” ammo clip used ABC News has confirmed that the three firearms used in the theater shooting—a AR-15 assault rifle, a Remington twelve-gauge shot gun, and a .40 Glock handgun—were purchased legally. ATF agents are currently tracing the weapons. A high-capacity, drum-style ammo clip for the AR-15 was also used in the massacre, according to the Associated Press. (Click here, here, and here for Mother Jones‘ past coverage of these kinds of large gun clips.) Here’s a photo of a precision built, ultra-high capacity, drum-style magazine for an AR-15: Brownells.comUPDATE 8, Friday, 3:59 p.m. EST: Defense Department statement US Navy and Air Force service members were among the injured. The Department of Defense released the following statement: The Department of Defense is deeply saddened by the news of the tragic incident at the Aurora Mall Movie Theater in Aurora, Colo. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and the families of those impacted by this event. One sailor was injured and one, known to have been at the theatre that evening, is currently unaccounted for. Two airmen were injured in the incident. The Navy and the Air Force are working with the families of these service members to ensure they have the care and attention they need. We can also confirm that the alleged gunman in this incident, James Holmes, is not a past or current member of any branch or component of the U.S. Armed Forces. UPDATE 9, Friday, 5:49 p.m. EST: Patients at University of Colorado Hospital Physicians at University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora treated 23 of the most critically wounded victims.  UPDATE 10, Friday, 8:09 p.m. EST: The Dark Knight Rises director Christopher Nolan weighs in Christopher Nolan, the director of The Dark Knight Rises, issued a statement on the mass shooting: Speaking on behalf of the cast and crew of The Dark Knight Rises, I would like to express our profound sorrow at the senseless tragedy that has befallen the entire Aurora community. I would not presume to know anything about the victims of the shooting but that they were there last night to watch a movie. I believe movies are one of the great American art forms and the shared experience of watching a story unfold on screen is an important and joyful pastime. The movie theatre is my home, and the idea that someone would violate that innocent and hopeful place in such an unbearably savage way is devastating to me. Nothing any of us can say could ever adequately express our feelings for the innocent victims of this appalling crime, but our thoughts are with them and their families.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. July 20, 2012: President Obama is shown in Fort Myers, Fla., while Mitt Romney is shown in Bow, N.H., addressing the Colorado mass shooting. (AP) The mass shooting overnight in Colorado put the presidential campaign on hold Friday, as both candidates canceled political events and used previously scheduled rallies to mourn with the nation for the victims. ""There are going to be other days for politics. This, I think, is a day for prayer and reflection,"" President Obama said Friday morning. Speaking in Fort Myers, Fla., Obama condemned the mass shooting as a ""senseless"" act and said of the victims' families: ""We have to embrace them."" The president said the tragedy ""reminds us of all the ways we are united as one American family."" Mitt Romney, speaking a little later in New Hampshire, said he joins the president and others in offering their ""deepest condolences"" for those ""whose lives were shattered in a few moments, a few moments of evil."" ""There will be justice for those responsible. That's another matter for another day,"" Romney said. ""Today is a moment to grieve and to remember -- to reach out and to help."" The shooting at a Colorado movie theater left 12 dead and nearly 60 wounded. Authorities have the suspect in custody but are still investigating, as wounded victims are being treated. Amid the tragedy, Obama cut short his campaign schedule in Florida to return to Washington for briefings. Romney also canceled all interviews for the day, and devoted his New Hampshire remarks only to the shooting. Both campaigns, after expressing their condolences to the families of victims, said they would be pulling down ads in Colorado until further notice. Obama, in remarks that lasted less than 10 minutes, said Friday that the country may never understand what leads someone to ""terrorize their fellow human beings like this."" He described this moment as a reminder to take stock of what matters in life. ""Such violence, such evil is senseless. It is beyond reason,"" he said. ""If there's anything to take away from this tragedy, it's the reminder that life is very fragile ... and what matters at the end of the day is not the small things. It's not the trivial things which so often consume us in our daily lives. Ultimately, it's how we choose to treat one another, and how we love one another."" Romney offered a similar message. ""This is a time for each of us to look into our hearts,"" he said, ""and remember how much we love one another."" The president, in an earlier written statement, urged the nation to keep the people of Aurora, the site of the shooting, in their prayers. ""We are committed to bringing whoever was responsible to justice, ensuring the safety of our people, and caring for those who have been wounded. As we do when confronted by moments of darkness and challenge, we must now come together as one American family. All of us must have the people of Aurora in our thoughts and prayers as they confront the loss of family, friends, and neighbors, and we must stand together with them in the challenging hours and days to come,"" he said. The suspect, believed to be a lone gunman, is in custody. The gunman opened fire at a movie theater during a showing of ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Obama was notified of the shooting at 5:26 a.m. by adviser John Brennan, according to the White House. He later spoke by phone with Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper. Romney also released a statement Friday saying he and wife Ann are ""deeply saddened by the news of the senseless violence."" ""We are praying for the families and loved ones of the victims during this time of deep shock and immense grief.  We expect that the person responsible for this terrible crime will be quickly brought to justice,"" Romney said. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said federal, state and local law enforcement are responding to the ""horrific event."" She said she's directed the department ""to provide any support necessary in the ongoing investigation.""

86338999,2012-07-20 10:24:03,Police: 12 dead in Colorado theater shooting,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2012/jul/20/several-injured-possibly-dead-shooting-batman-prem/,en,True,murders and attempted murders,56,Arkansas Democrat-Gazette ,http://www2.arkansasonline.com/,"AURORA, Colo. — Officials announced that a total of 71 people were shot by a gunman in a Friday morning rampage at Colorado movie theater that left 12 dead. A former medical student in a gas mask barged into a crowded Denver-area theater during a midnight showing of the Batman movie on Friday, hurled a gas canister and then opened fire. The suspect was taken into custody and identified by federal law enforcement officials as 24-year-old James Holmes. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation. Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates said in a Friday morning press conference that Holmes was dressed head-to-toe in tactical protective gear, including a ballistics helmet, throat protector and gas mask. Oates added that the suspect fired an ""unknown amount of rounds"" during the massacre. The shooting began in theater no. 9 of the Century 16 Theater. In all, Oates said that Holmes was suspected to use an AR-15 assault rifle, a Remington 870 12-gauge shotgun and 40-caliber handgun. Police apprehended Holmes in the back of the theater. The first 911 call came in of the shooting reached authorities at 12:36 a.m. Oates said that in all, around 200 police were on scene. Oates added that Holmes lone brush with the law was a summons for speeding last year. Authorities did not release a motive. The FBI said there was no indication of ties to any terrorist groups. When the smoke began to spread, some moviegoers thought it was a stunt that was part of the The Dark Knight Rises, one of the most highly anticipated films of the summer. They saw a silhouette of a person in the haze near the screen, first pointing a gun at the crowd and then shooting. ""There were bullet (casings) just falling on my head. They were burning my forehead,"" Jennifer Seeger said, adding that the gunman, dressed like a SWAT team member, fired steadily except when he stopped to reload. ""Every few seconds it was just: Boom, boom, boom,"" she said. ""He would reload and shoot and anyone who would try to leave would just get killed."" Holmes had an assault rifle, a shotgun and two pistols, a federal law enforcement official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation. July 20, 2012: At least 12 people are killed when a gunman enters an Aurora, Colo., movie theater, releases a canister of gas and then opens fire during opening night of the Batman movie The Dark Knight Rises.

FBI agents and police used a hook and ladder fire truck to reach Holmes' apartment in Aurora, Oates said. They put a camera at the end of a 12-foot pole inside the apartment, and discovered that the unit was booby trapped. Authorities evacuated five buildings as they tried to determine how to disarm flammable and explosive material. Victims were being treated for chemical exposure apparently related to canisters thrown by the gunman. Some of those injured are children, including a 4-month-old baby who was released from the hospital. Aurora police spokesman Frank Fania on ABC's Good Morning America said he didn't know yet if all the injuries were gunshot wounds. He said some might have been caused by other things such as shrapnel. Police released a written statement from Holmes' family: ""Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved."" The movie opened across the world Friday with midnight showings in the U.S. The shooting prompted officials to cancel the Paris premiere, with workers pulling down the red carpet display at a theater on the famed Champs-Elysees Avenue. President Barack Obama said he was saddened by the ""horrific and tragic shooting,"" pledging that his administration was ""committed to bringing whoever was responsible to justice, ensuring the safety of our people, and caring for those who have been wounded."" It was the worst mass shooting in the U.S. since the Nov. 5, 2009 attack at Fort Hood, Texas, when an Army psychiatrist killed 13 soldiers and civilians and more than two dozen others wounded. In Colorado, it was the deadliest since the Columbine High School massacre on April 20, 1999, when two students opened fire at the school in the Denver suburb of Littleton, killing 12 classmates and a teacher and wounding 26 others before killing themselves. Friday's attack began shortly after midnight at the multiplex theater at a mall in Aurora, the state's third-largest city. The film has several scenes of public mayhem — a hallmark of superhero movies. In one scene, the main villain Bane leads an attack on the stock exchange and, in another, leads a shooting and bombing rampage on a packed football stadium. It was the final installment of the Dark Knight trilogy directed by Christopher Nolan, starring Christian Bale as Batman. The series has a darker tone than previous Batman incarnations. It is the follow-up to The Dark Knight, which won Heath Ledger a posthumous Oscar for his searing portrayal of The Joker. The gunman released a gas that smelled like pepper spray from a green canister with a tag on it, Seeger said. ""I thought it was showmanship. I didn't think it was real,"" she said. Seeger said she was in the second row, about four feet from the gunman, when he pointed a gun at her face. At first, ""I was just a deer in headlights. I didn't know what to do,"" she said. Then she ducked to the ground as the gunman shot people seated behind her. She said she began crawling toward an exit when she saw a girl about 14 years old ""lying lifeless on the stairs."" She saw a man with a bullet wound in his back and tried to check his pulse, but ""I had to go. I was going to get shot."" Witness Shayla Roeder said she saw a young teenage girl on the ground bleeding outside the theater. ""She just had this horrible look in her eyes .... We made eye contact and I could tell she was not all right,"" Roeder said. Police, ambulances and emergency crews swarmed on the scene after frantic calls started flooding the 911 switchboard, officials said. Officers came running in and telling people to leave the theater, Salina Jordan told the Denver Post. She said some police were carrying and dragging bodies. Hayden Miller told KUSA-TV that he heard several shots. ""Like little explosions going on and shortly after that we heard people screaming,"" he told the station. Hayden said at first he thought it was part of a louder movie next door. But then he saw ""people hunched over leaving theater."" Officers later found the gunman near a car behind the theater. Oates said there was no evidence of any other attackers. Holmes was a student at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver until last month, spokeswoman Jacque Montgomery said. She did not know when he started school or why he withdrew. At least 24 people were being treated at Denver area hospitals. ""Warner Bros. and the filmmakers are deeply saddened to learn about this shocking incident. We extend our sincere sympathies to the families and loved ones of the victims at this tragic time,"" the studio said. Copyright © 2021, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc. All rights reserved.

The red carpet will not roll out Friday on the Champs-Élysées after a mass shooting left 12 dead and 40 wounded in suburban Denver at a screening of The Dark Knight Rises. After a fatal mass shooting early Friday left 12 dead and 40 wounded in suburban Denver at a screening of The Dark Knight Rises, promotional activities for the film in France have been suspended. The red carpet will not roll out Friday evening on the Champs-Élysées, where the latest installment in the Batman franchise was due to premiere in Paris. Warner Bros., the studio behind the movie, quickly canceled a press junket scheduled for Friday morning at the luxury Bristol hotel, steps from the Élysée Palace—even while cast members prepared for interview sessions and dozens of film critics waited their turn—as word spread of the multiplex massacre some 5,000 miles away. The Colorado killings took place shortly before 9 a.m. Paris time. The film, featuring France’s own Marion Cotillard, among other cast members, is due to open on 900 French screens Wednesday. On an otherwise quiet summer Friday in France, coverage of the killings has dominated the media, heading top news sites throughout the day and leading 24-hour-news-channel loops. In the afternoon a crew was shown dismantling the premiere setup on the vast sidewalk in front of the Gaumont Champs-Élysées Marignan cinema. The TF1 TV network told Agence France-Presse that a late-morning taping of interviews with Cotillard and Morgan Freeman, scheduled to appear on the national 8 p.m. newscast just as the premiere was scheduled to begin, had also been canceled. Fellow stars Christian Bale and Anne Hathaway and director Christopher Nolan, all expected this evening on the “most beautiful avenue in the world” for the superhero blockbuster’s French debut, were also reportedly waiting in the wings at the Bristol as reporters were asked to leave. “We waited an hour and 45 minutes,” Sophie Grassin, a film critic for Le Nouvel Observateur present at the Bristol, told the French weekly’s website. “Then, around 11:30 a.m., we saw Marion Cotillard arrive, made up, well dressed. The Warner folks led her into a room where they evidently told her the terrible news. The Warner team was in tears.” Visiting the Tour de France on Friday, French President François Hollande said in a statement: “The President of the Republic has learned with very deep emotion of the shooting in a cinéma near Denver which, according to estimates that remain provisional, cost the lives of 12 people and injured about 40. He understands how much this drama deeply upsets America’s youth and bereaves all of America. In these tragic circumstances, he would like to impart all of his solidarity to American authorities and to the American people and to express, in the name of France, his condolences to the families and friends of the victims.”"

(AP) — A former medical student in a gas mask barged into a crowded Denver-area theater during a midnight showing of the Batman movie on Friday, hurled a gas canister and then opened fire, killing 12 people and injuring at least 50 others in one of the deadliest mass shootings in recent U.S. history.

Online,http://www.eonline.com/,"People's Choice Awards A clearer picture is starting to emerge of the gunman behind the largest mass shooting in U.S. history. Local police have identified James Holmes, 24, as the suspected trigger man who left 12 dead and 59 others injured after allegedly opening fire at a Colorado screening of The Dark Knight Rises early Friday morning. Holmes was arrested at a parking lot outside the theater shortly afterward. Here's what we know about Holmes so far, and his alleged shooting rampage that has left a nation in deep shock... MORE: The Dark Knight Rises Horror—Gunman Kills 12, Injures 59 at Colorado Screening • Local police confirm that the shooting began at approximately 12:39 a.m. at the Century 16 movie theater in Aurora, and Holmes was apprehended shortly thereafter outside the rear of the multiplex, next to his parked white Hyundai vehicle. • Police recovered an AR-15 assault rifle and two .40 caliber Glock handguns on Holmes; a fourth weapon, a Remington shotgun, was retrieved from the theater. All the firearms were obtained legally. Holmes didn't resist arrest, and no other suspects were believed to be involved. • Holmes was reportedly wearing all-black ballistics gear, including a helmet, bulletproof vest, leggings, throat protector, groin protector, tactical gloves and gas mask. Police believe he set off two smoke or tear-gas devices to distract the crowd before opening fire. His car was said to be stockpiled with additional ammunition. • Various reports have surfaced claiming that Holmes supposedly told police that he was the Joker and sported red hair, but Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates refused to comment on the claims. However, at a press conference in New York City, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly told reporters, ""It clearly looks like a deranged individual. He has his hair painted red. He said he was the Joker, obviously the enemy of Batman."" MORE: Dark Knight Rises Shooting—Police Identify Suspect, Paris Premiere Canceled • Holmes was an Aurora resident who lived about four miles from the theater. Chief Oates confirms that when police investigated his home, they discovered that the apartment had been ""booby-trapped with wires,"" prompting authorities to immediately evacuate residents from five nearby buildings. Bomb technicians were reportedly dispatched to disarm explosive materials that were found on the scene. • Police confirm that Holmes had no criminal history, and had only been cited for speeding in October 2011 • Early Friday, a San Diego woman who identified herself as Holmes' mother spoke with ABC News and, when informed that her son had been named a suspect in the shootings, reportedly said, ""You have the right person...I need to call the police. I need to fly out to Colorado."" MORE: Batbrained? Debunking Dark Knight Rises Bane-Bain Conspiracy Theory • In statement obtained by E! News, Holmes' family said: ""Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved. We ask that the media respect our privacy during this difficult time. Our family is cooperating with authorities in both San Diego and Aurora, Colo. We are still trying to process this information and we appreciate that people will respect our privacy."" •  A spokesman for the San Diego Police Department confirmed to reporters that Holmes attended high school in San Diego and then packed up for Colorado to continue his studies. • A former schoolmate of Holmes at Westview high school in San Diego tells E! News exclusively that Holmes was a ""really smart"" student who kept to himself. ""He was really smart, kinda nerdy and not too talkative with people he wasn't friends with."" The source adds that Holmes, who reportedly went by the nickname Jimmy and wasn't involved in extracurricular sports or clubs, ""didn't really have any long-term girlfriends, but I do remember him having dates to dances."" MORE: Is The Dark Knight Rises Gaining on The Avengers? • According to published reports, Holmes' neighbors characterized the 24-year-old as a loner who sometimes greeted fellow tenants but often appeared shy. He also purportedly had trouble landing a job after completing his studies in California. • Contrary to earlier reports, Holmes was not a medical student. Dan Meyers, communications director for the University of Colorado School of Medicine, tells E! News: ""He was in a graduate program in neuroscience. That's different from being in the School of Medicine. The graduate program is part of the University of Colorado Denver. The neuro program is located on the Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, Colo."" • In a statement, the school's Anschutz Medical Campus confirms that Holmes ""was in the process of withdrawing from the University of Colorado Denver's graduate program in neurosciences,"" where he had enrolled in June 2011."" • E! News has confirmed that Holmes is scheduled to appear in an Arapahoe County courtroom on Monday in Centennial, Colo., where the district attorney is expected to bring the charges against him.

86348828,2012-07-20 12:49:57,"Police: At least 12 dead, 50 injured in Colorado theater shooting",http://www.mercurynews.com/nation-world/ci_21118873/police-14-dead-50-injured-colorado-theater-shooting?source=rss,en,True,motion pictures,35,San Jose Mercury News,http://www.mercurynews.com/,"Trending: AURORA, Colo. — A gunman wearing a gas mask set off an unknown gas and fired into a crowded movie theater in suburban Denver at a midnight opening of the Batman movie “The Dark Knight Rises,” killing 12 people and injuring at least 50 others, authorities said. Moviegoers didn’t know what was happening and some thought the attack was part of the show. Then they saw a silhouette of a person in the smoke at the front of the theater near the screen, pointing a gun at the crowd. “I told my friend ‘we’ve got to get out of here,’ but then he shot people trying to go out the exits,” Jennifer Seeger told NBC’s “Today.” She said the shooter made his way up the aisle, firing as he went, saying nothing. Federal law enforcement officials identified the suspect as James Holmes, a 24-year-old American. Holmes is in police custody, and the FBI says there is no indication that incident is tied to any terrorist groups. The federal law enforcement officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation Some of those injured are children, including a 3-month-old infant who was shot. Police earlier said 14 people were dead, but later revised the number to at least 12. It was not immediately clear for the reason for the revision. Witness Shayla Roeder said she saw a young teenage girl on the ground bleeding outside the theater. “She just had this horrible look in her eyes …. We made eye contact and I could tell she was not all right,” Roeder said. Victims are being treated for chemical exposure apparently related to canisters thrown by the gunman. The shooter was arrested shortly after the attack at 12:30 a.m. MDT at the multiplex theater at a mall in Aurora. It was the worst mass shooting in Colorado since the Columbine High School massacre on April 20, 1999. Students Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, opened fire at the school in the Denver suburb of Littleton, about 15 miles west of Aurora, killing 12 classmates and a teacher and wounding 26 others before killing themselves in the school’s library. Aurora police spokesman Frank Fania on ABC’s “Good Morning America” said he didn’t know yet if all the injuries were gunshot wounds. He said some might have been caused by other things such as shrapnel. Police, ambulances and emergency crews swarmed on the scene after frantic calls started flooding the 911 switchboard, officials said. Officers came running in and telling people to leave the theater, Salina Jordan told the Denver Post. She said some police were carrying and dragging bodies. Officers later found the gunman near a car behind the theater. “A gas mask, rifle, handgun at least one additional weapon (were) found inside,” he said. The suspect was taken into custody, but no name was released. Oates said there’s no evidence of any other attackers. There was also no immediate word of any motive. The suspect spoke of “possible explosives in his residence. We are dealing with that potential threat,” Oates said. A large truck lettered “bomb squad” arrived near an Aurora apartment complex where the suspect is believed to have lived, about four miles from the theater. Dozens of police squad cars, vans and other vehicles were already at the scene, along with black-clad officers carrying automatic weapons. Police evacuated residents of the building. Oates did not say whether any explosives had been found. He said police also checked for explosives in the parking lot and at the Century 16 theater and secured those areas. President Barack Obama said he was saddened by the “horrific and tragic shooting,” pledging that his administration was “committed to bringing whoever was responsible to justice, ensuring the safety of our people, and caring for those who have been wounded.” Moviegoers spoke of their terror as violence erupted and people around them fell victim. Benjamin Fernandez, 30, told the Post that he heard a series of explosions. He said that people ran from the theater and there were gunshots as police shouted “get down!” Fernandez said he saw people falling, including one young girl. Jordan told the paper that one girl was struck in cheek, others in stomach including a girl who looked to be around 9-years-old. Jordan said it sounded like firecrackers until someone ran into Theater 8 yelling “they’re shooting out here!” Hayden Miller told KUSA-TV that he heard several shots. “Like little explosions going on and shortly after that we heard people screaming,” he told the station. Hayden said at first he thought it was part of a louder movie next door. But then he saw “people hunched over leaving theater.” The police chief said 10 victims died at the theater and four at area hospitals. At least 24 people were being treated at Denver area hospitals. KUSA reported that some hospitalized victims were being treated for chemical exposure, related apparently to canister thrown by gunman. Eleven people were being treated at the Medical Center of Aurora for gunshots and ranged from minor to critical condition. Two others walked in to be treated for tear gas contamination. Denver Health had seven victims — one in critical and the rest in fair condition. The youngest victim reported was a 6-year-old being treated at Children’s Hospital Colorado, where a total of six victims were taken. Their condition wasn’t known. Two people in critical condition were rushed to nearby Swedish Medical Center, spokeswoman Nicole Williams said. Aurora is on Denver’s east side and is Colorado’s third-largest city with 327,000 residents. It is home to a large Defense Department satellite intelligence operation at Buckley Air Force Base, as well as The Children’s Hospital, the University of Colorado Hospital and a future Veterans Affairs hospital.

At first he was just a silhouette, taken by some in the audience for a stunt that was part of one of the summer's most highly anticipated films. But then, authorities said, he threw gas canisters that filled the packed suburban Denver theater with smoke, and, in the confusing haze between Hollywood fantasy and terrifying reality, opened fire as people screamed and dove for cover. At least 12 people were killed and 58 wounded -- 11 critically -- in one of the deadliest mass shootings in recent U.S. history. ""He looked like an assassin ready to go to war,"" said Jordan Crofter, a moviegoer who was unhurt in the attack early Friday, about a half-hour after the special midnight opening of ""The Dark Knight Rises."" The gunman, identified by police as 24-year-old James Holmes, used a military-style semi-automatic rifle, a shotgun and a pistol, stopping only to reload. The suspect marched up the aisle in the stadium-style theater, picking off those who tried to flee, witnesses said. Authorities said he hit scores of people, with a few of the 70 victims suffering their injuries not by gunfire but in the ensuing chaos. At least one person was struck in an adjacent theater by gunfire that went through the wall. ""He would reload and shoot and anyone who would try to leave would just get killed,"" said Jennifer Seeger, adding that bullet casings landed on her head and burned her forehead. Within minutes, frantic 911 calls brought some 200 police officers, ambulances and emergency crews to the theater. Holmes was captured in the parking lot. Police said they later found that his nearby apartment was booby-trapped. Authorities gave no motive for the attack. The FBI said there was no indication of ties to any terrorist groups. In New York City, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said: ""It clearly looks like a deranged individual. He has his hair painted red. He said he was the Joker, obviously the enemy of Batman."" Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates would not confirm that information, but did say he had spoken to Kelly. The two used to work together in New York. Asked whether Holmes had makeup to look like the Joker, Oates said: ""That to my knowledge is not true."" It was the worst mass shooting in the U.S. since the Nov. 5, 2009, attack at Fort Hood, Texas. An Army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 soldiers and civilians and wounding more than two dozen others. It was the deadliest in Colorado since the Columbine High School massacre in suburban Denver in 1999, when two students killed 12 classmates and a teacher and wounded 26 others before killing themselves. The latest shooting rocked this sprawling suburb of 325,000 east of Denver. A makeshift memorial with 12 candles in a row and piles of flowers sat at a corner near the entrance to the movie theater parking lot. Up the hill from there, about 20 pastors led a vigil for about 350 people, some hugging and crying At an emotional afternoon news conference, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper said the people of Aurora would rise above the spasm of violence and ultimately not be ""defined"" by the tragedy. The new Batman movie, the last in the trilogy starring Christian Bale, opened worldwide Friday with midnight showings in the U.S. The plot has the villain Bane facing Bale's Caped Crusader with a nuclear weapon that could destroy all of fictional Gotham. The shooting prompted officials to cancel the red-carpet premiere in Paris, and some U.S. movie theaters stepped up security for daytime showings. The film's director, Christopher Nolan, issued a statement on behalf of the cast and crew, expressing their ""profound sorrow at the senseless tragedy."" ""Nothing any of us can say could ever adequately express our feelings for the innocent victims of this appalling crime, but our thoughts are with them and their families,"" Nolan said. The attack began shortly after midnight at the multiplex in Aurora. Audience members said they thought it was part of the movie or a stunt associated with it. The film has several scenes of public mayhem -- a hallmark of superhero movies. In one scene, Bane leads an attack on a stock exchange, and in another he leads a shooting and bombing rampage on a packed football stadium. A federal law enforcement official said Holmes bought a ticket to the show, went into the theater as part of the crowd and propped open an exit door as the movie was playing. The suspect then donned protective ballistic gear and opened fire, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation. At some point, the gunman appeared to have stepped outside because several witnesses saw him come through the door. ""All I saw is the door swinging open and the street lights behind, and you could see a silhouette,"" said Crofter, who was sitting on the left side of the theater and toward the front. Sylvana Guillen said the gunman, clad in dark clothing, appeared at the front of the theater just as the character Catwoman appeared in the movie. Then they heard gunshots and smelled smoke from a canister he was carrying. As she and her friend, Misha Mostashiry, ran to the exit, Guillen said, they saw a man slip in the blood of a wounded woman he was trying to help. Oates said the gunman wore a gas mask and a ballistic helmet and vest, as well as leg, groin and throat protectors. He said he bought four guns from local gun shops in the last 60 days and 6,000 rounds of ammunition, including a drum magazine that could fire 50 to 60 rounds per minute. ""I thought it was showmanship. I didn't think it was real,"" Seeger said. She said she was in the second row, about four feet from the gunman, when he pointed a gun at her face. ""I was just a deer in headlights. I didn't know what to do,"" she said. Then she ducked to the ground as the gunman shot people seated behind her. Seeger said she began crawling toward an exit when she saw a girl of about 14 ""lying lifeless on the stairs."" She saw a man with a bullet wound in his back and tried to check his pulse, but ""I had to go. I was going to get shot."" Later, police began entering the theater, asking people to hold their hands up as they evacuated the building. Some of the victims were treated for chemical exposure apparently related to canisters thrown by the gunman. Those hurt included a 4-month-old baby, who was treated at a hospital and released. Authorities removed the bodies from the theater on Friday afternoon. Officials wheeled a black bag on a stretcher out of the front entrance, placing it in the back of a minivan. Ten people died in the theater, while two others died from their injuries later. Officers with a list of those confirmed dead met with the family members of the deceased Friday night to tell them the fate of their loved ones. The identities of some emerged late Friday as relatives confirmed the deaths of 23-year-old Micayla Medek, 27-year-old Alex Sullivan and 24-year-old Jessica Ghawi. Those who knew Holmes described him as a shy, intelligent person raised in California by parents who were active in their well-to-do suburban neighborhood in San Diego. Holmes played soccer at Westview High School and ran cross-country before going to college. On Friday morning, police escorted Holmes' father, a manager of a software company, from their home while his mother, a nurse, stayed inside, receiving visitors who came to offer support. Holmes also has a younger sister. ""As you can understand, the Holmes family is very upset about all of this,"" Lt. Andra Brown, the San Diego police spokeswoman, told reporters in the driveway of the family home. ""It's a tragic event and it's taken everyone by surprise. They are definitely trying to work through this."" Police released a statement from his family that said: ""Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved."" There have been no indications so far that Holmes had any run-ins with the law before Friday. Tom Mai, a retired electrical engineer, said Holmes was a ""shy guy"" who came from a ""very, very nice family."" Holmes graduated from University of California, Riverside, in the spring of 2010 with a bachelor's degree in neuroscience, a school spokesman said. Mai said the mother told him Holmes couldn't find a job after earning a master's degree and returned to school. He enrolled in the Ph.D. neuroscience program at the University of Colorado-Denver in June 2011 but left the program last month, according to the university. Holmes lived in an apartment in Aurora, and FBI agents and police who went there discovered it was booby-trapped when they used a camera at the end of a 12-foot pole to look inside. Authorities evacuated surrounding residences, and about two dozen people headed to a shelter set up by the Red Cross at a local school. Police were not able to enter the apartment Friday night and Oates said they will again on Saturday. ""It is a very vexing problem how to enter that apartment safely,"" he said.

The red carpet will not roll out Friday on the Champs-Élysées after a mass shooting left 12 dead and 40 wounded in suburban Denver at a screening of The Dark Knight Rises. After a fatal mass shooting early Friday left 12 dead and 40 wounded in suburban Denver at a screening of The Dark Knight Rises, promotional activities for the film in France have been suspended. The red carpet will not roll out Friday evening on the Champs-Élysées, where the latest installment in the Batman franchise was due to premiere in Paris. Warner Bros., the studio behind the movie, quickly canceled a press junket scheduled for Friday morning at the luxury Bristol hotel, steps from the Élysée Palace—even while cast members prepared for interview sessions and dozens of film critics waited their turn—as word spread of the multiplex massacre some 5,000 miles away. The Colorado killings took place shortly before 9 a.m. Paris time. The film, featuring France’s own Marion Cotillard, among other cast members, is due to open on 900 French screens Wednesday. On an otherwise quiet summer Friday in France, coverage of the killings has dominated the media, heading top news sites throughout the day and leading 24-hour-news-channel loops. In the afternoon a crew was shown dismantling the premiere setup on the vast sidewalk in front of the Gaumont Champs-Élysées Marignan cinema. The TF1 TV network told Agence France-Presse that a late-morning taping of interviews with Cotillard and Morgan Freeman, scheduled to appear on the national 8 p.m. newscast just as the premiere was scheduled to begin, had also been canceled. Fellow stars Christian Bale and Anne Hathaway and director Christopher Nolan, all expected this evening on the “most beautiful avenue in the world” for the superhero blockbuster’s French debut, were also reportedly waiting in the wings at the Bristol as reporters were asked to leave. “We waited an hour and 45 minutes,” Sophie Grassin, a film critic for Le Nouvel Observateur present at the Bristol, told the French weekly’s website. “Then, around 11:30 a.m., we saw Marion Cotillard arrive, made up, well dressed. The Warner folks led her into a room where they evidently told her the terrible news. The Warner team was in tears.” Visiting the Tour de France on Friday, French President François Hollande said in a statement: “The President of the Republic has learned with very deep emotion of the shooting in a cinéma near Denver which, according to estimates that remain provisional, cost the lives of 12 people and injured about 40. He understands how much this drama deeply upsets America’s youth and bereaves all of America. In these tragic circumstances, he would like to impart all of his solidarity to American authorities and to the American people and to express, in the name of France, his condolences to the families and friends of the victims.”"

By
      
        Rosie Gray Posted on July 20, 2012, at 4:06 p.m. ET President Obama leaves the stage after addressing the Aurora shootings. National leaders have released statement after statement today expressing condolences for the victims of last night's mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado. But no politicians — apart from, notably, New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg — has called for an increase in focus on gun laws. That silence is a relatively recent product of decades of heated gun debates, and of gun rights' activists largely winning an argument over whether such massacres should be reflexively blamed on the weapons. There hasn't been major new gun control legislation since 1994, and Bill Clinton's efforts to expand gun control in the aftermath of the 1999 Columbine High School shootings fizzled. In interviews, even gun control advocates said such discussion can seem exploitative; it can also be premature in the midst of developing news about the identity of the shooter, the victims, and the motive. ""I know in the past when I worked in [Senator Chuck] Schumer’s office, when there would be a crime such as this, our first questions would be what kind of guns, how did the person get the gun, did the person get it at a gun market,"" said Jim Kessler, formerly of Americans for Gun Safety. ""Not every one of these crimes has a nexus with a gun law that needs to be corrected."" Kessler said crimes like these often ""take on unique personalities"" in the days and weeks after the event, and politicians don't want to make a bad call on what that personality will be. ""The Giffords shooting was about the dialogue in America,"" Kessler said, referring to last year's attack on Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. ""Virginia Tech became about mental health. Some previous ones were about assault weapons."" ""It’s hard to predict on the first day exactly the personality it’s going to take, and a lot of times it has to do with who the victims are and who the perpetrator is,"" Kessler said. The gun control movement is, in fact, split on this question. During his weekly radio address, the blunt New York mayor said, ""You know, soothing words are nice, but maybe it’s time that the two people who want to be President of the United States stand up and tell us what they are going to do about it, because this is obviously a problem across the country."" ""No matter where you stand on the Second Amendment, no matter where you stand on guns, we have a right to hear from both of them concretely, not just in generalities – specifically what are they going to do about guns?"" Bloomberg said. Most other politicians have been more reticent. President Obama didn't refer to gun laws during his address in Florida this morning, nor did Mitt Romney in New Hampshire. And some gun control advocates, this is a source of frustration. ""I don’t know if there’s any tragedy, no matter how horrific, that could make the house act on gun laws,"" said Ladd Everitt, communications director for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. He criticized Obama for not addressing the issue. ""The sad thing is that Obama knows better,"" Everitt said. ""When he was campaigning he did support reinstituting the assault weapons ban. Among the four guns was an AK-47 style rifle."" Dan Gross, president of The Brady Campaign, released a statement this morning dismissing politicians' words of condolence and demanding action. ""This tragedy is another grim reminder that guns are the enablers of mass killers and that our nation pays an unacceptable price for our failure to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people,"" Gross said. ""As someone who has suffered the lasting impact of gun violence, and President of Brady, I can tell you that we don’t want sympathy. We want action."" On the other side of the gun control debate, there's been either a resistance to talking about gun laws, just like on the left, or support of concealed carry laws. Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert this morning: ""It does make me wonder, with all those people in the theater, was there nobody that was carrying a gun that could have stopped this guy more quickly?"" ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families and the community,"" said NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam. ""NRA will not have any further comment until all the facts are known.""

283625165,2012-07-13 08:07:29,Children and adults gunned down in Connecticut school massacre &#8211; This Just In - CNN.com Blogs,http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2012/12/14/shooting-reported-at-connecticut-elementary-school/?hpt=hp_t1,en,False,"education and schools,children and youth,murders and attempted murders",1095,CNN,http://www.cnn.com/,"[Updated at 11:18 p.m. ET] Aimee Seaver, the mother of a first-grade girl at Sandy Hook and a fifth-grader who attends a different school, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that her children are having trouble dealing with what happened. ""It's a very rough night here,"" she said. ""When your first-grader goes to bed and says, 'Mommy, is anyone from my class last year - are they all OK?' and you look at them and say, 'I'm not really sure,' it's a rough night to tell that to your 7-year-old."" Her younger daughter has asked a lot of questions about Principal Dawn Lafferty Hochsprung, who was killed. “She got wind very quickly that something was wrong with our principal, which we didn’t tell her till just now that yes, she was definitely hurt and it wasn’t good,"" Seaver said. ""It’s taking her a while. I think tomorrow will probably be harder for her. “I also have a fifth-grader who came off the bus crying because she … had a sister who she was worried about, and … just basically left that school a few months ago. I think for a lot of those kids, they kind of are a little older and can get it a little bit faster, even though they weren’t in it. “So the questions, I think, are coming. They’re not here, yet, especially for the littler ones. It started as I put them to bed tonight, the questions.” [Updated at 10:50 p.m. ET] Janet Vollmer, a kindergarten teacher at the school, says she locked her classroom doors and - to keep her students calm - read them a story until the police came. Vollmer, her 19 students and the adult helpers in her classroom were not injured. ""You could hear what sounded like pops, gunshots. Of course, I’m not going to tell that to 5-year-olds, so I said to them, ‘We’re going over in a safe area,'"" Vollmer told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""And we read a story and we kept them calm, did a lockdown drill, closed the doors, locked (them), covered the windows, and kept the children with us.” She said the children knew something unusual was going on. “It didn’t seem a natural thing (to the children), although we do practice drills,"" Vollmer said. ""We said, ‘We’re not really sure, but we’re going to be safe, because we’re sitting over here and we’re all together.’” When asked how she kept cool, she said: “With 5-year-olds, you can’t lose it. I’ve been doing this for a long time, it’s my 18th year of teaching. My job was to keep them safe."" ""After we got down to the firehouse, later on, as a lot of the events started to unfold throughout the day  I think some of (the children) realized the magnitude of what was going on.,"" she said. ""They saw other people upset. We just held them close until their parents came and we released them.” [Updated at 8:58 p.m. ET] Denise Correia says her daughter, a Sandy Hook Elementary second-grader who was not injured, heard the gunshots from the classroom she was in. The girl, while talking about the shooting with Correia, has been mentioning slain principal Dawn Lafferty Hochsprung ""quite a lot."" ""I think everyone's coping as best as they possibly can,"" Correia told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""I'm letting her talk. She's mentioned quite a bit about the principal, who many of us have worked with. I adored her. I worked with her personally with my business. That is one person I know we have lost on a personal level."" Correia said she has heard that her daughter's teacher, when the gunfire started, grabbed two kids from the hallway, put them into her classroom with other students, locked the door and gathered the students to a side of the room away from the gunfire. ""She did a very heroic thing,"" Correia said of the teacher. ""The kids are going to suffer from this,"" Correia said. ""... We lost a lot of babies today in this town, and there are a lot of very sad families."" [Updated at 8:20 p.m. ET] One injured victim, a female employee of the school, is ""doing well,"" Connecticut State Police Lt. J. Paul Vance said. [Updated at 7:53 p.m. ET] The public release of the victims' names may come on Saturday morning, Connecticut State Police Lt. J. Paul Vance says. Vance said investigators have made preliminary identifications of the bodies, and that they've notified the appropriate families. But investigators want to make final, positive identifications before releasing the names to the media. ""It's a horrific scene,"" Vance said. ""Between our mutual experience, we've never seen anything like this."" Vance said the next briefing from state police would be at 8 a.m. ET Saturday. [Updated at 7:48 p.m. ET] U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Connecticut, says her thoughts and prayers are with the families. ""This really hits close to home,"" said DeLauro, who said she is visiting her grandchildren in Washington, D.C. ""These beautiful young angels who had so much to live for - and it seems so senseless. Unthinkable that this could happen ,but it has, and now, as the president said, we come together, we wrap our arms around these families and hold them close to our hearts."" [Updated at 7:10 p.m. ET] Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, offered his prayers for the families of those affected by the Connecticut shooting, according to a release from the group. The shooting ""wrenches the hearts of all people,"" he said. ""Once again we speak against the culture of violence infecting our country even as we prepare to welcome the Prince of Peace at Christmas,"" Dolan said. ""All of us are called to work for peace in our homes, our streets and our world, now more than ever.” Faisal Ali, right, of Colorado Springs, Colorado, joins other people outside the White House in Washington, D.C., to participate in a vigil to remember the Connecticut school shooting on Friday. [Updated at 6:51 p.m. ET] A law enforcement official familiar with the investigation says the three guns found at the shooting site were legally purchased by Nancy Lanza, the mother of the suspect in the shooting. According to the law enforcement official, the Glock and Sig Sauer handguns were found inside the school with the deceased gunman. The Bushmaster was found in a car outside the school. The official did not know if the car was registered to the gunman, to his mother or to someone else. The official echoed what other law enforcement officials have told CNN: That Adam Lanza was the suspected gunman, and that he died at the scene of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot. [Updated at 6:44 p.m. ET] Three U.S. law enforcement officials, from different agencies, separately tonight identified the suspected shooter as Adam Lanza, contrary to what investigators had said previously. It is not clear what caused the confusion among investigators. His older brother, Ryan, was taken into custody for general questioning from a home in Hoboken, New Jersey. Officials did not label Ryan Lanza as a suspect. It is unclear when he may be released. One of the officials say Adam’s father was also taken in for similar questioning. There is no indication that the father will be charged. The official noted the father has remarried and lives with his new wife in a residence in the general area of Connecticut not too far from where his ex-wife lived. [Updated at 6:43 p.m. ET] CNN’s Susan Candiotti is talking to investigators at the scene as they piece together exactly what happened and when. She says she’s learned that the mother of the suspected shooter, Nancy Lanza, was found dead in the suspect’s home in Newtown. “Earlier we had information that she was found in the classroom. However, now I’m being told that in fact her body was found at the suspect's residence,"" Candiotti said. ""We don't know whether she also lived there. We also don't know the timeline - when was she killed? Was she killed before the shooting began at the school? These are the things that authorities are still trying to piece together.” [Updated at 6:02 p.m. ET] ""Evil visited this community today,"" Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy just told reporters in Newtown. ""And it's too early to speak of recovery, but each parent, each sibling, each member of the family has to understand that Connecticut - we're all in this together. ""We'll do whatever we can to overcome this event. We will get through it. But this is a terrible time for this community and these families."" [Updated at 5:14 p.m. ET] The mother of the suspected shooter was found dead in her son's residence in Newtown, a law enforcement source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told CNN. CNN had previously identified the mother as Nancy Lanza, a teacher at the Sandy Hook Elementary, according to law enforcement sources. The source also told CNN there was no body found in the house searched by authorities in Hoboken, New Jersey. Two law enforcement sources say a man was taken away from questioning from that house. He is believed to be the brother of the shooter, according to the sources. The first law enforcement source says the school shooter was dressed in ""black battle fatigues and a military vest."" The Bushmaster .223 found at the scene is a semi automatic weapon, the source says. Two other weapons found were handguns, a Sig-Sauer and a Glock. [Updated at 5:10 p.m. ET] We just learned that Governor Dannel P. Malloy will be speaking at Treadwell Park in Newtown, Connecticut, at 6:00 p.m. ET. [Updated at 5:04  p.m. ET] We've just received a statement from U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan about the shooting: ""School shootings are always incomprehensible and horrific tragedies. But words fail to describe today's heartbreaking and savage attack at Sandy Hook Elementary School. As the father of two children in elementary school, I can barely imagine the anguish and losses suffered today by the Newtown community. ""Our hearts and prayers go out to every parent, child, teacher, staff member, and administrator at Sandy Hook and the surrounding community. And our thanks go out to every teacher, staff member, and first responder who cared for, comforted, and protected children from harm, often at risk to themselves. We will do everything in our power to assist and support the healing and recovery of Newtown."" [Updated at 5:01  p.m. ET] Law enforcement officials are not prepared to identify the shooter right now, Connecticut State PoliceLt. J. Paul Vance said in a press conference. Vance said that they are working diligently at the crime scene as well as with the medical examiner to identify the victims. ""We will leave no stone unturned,"" Vance added about the entire investigation. [Updated at 4:54 p.m. ET] We are now being told there was no body found in the Hoboken, New Jersey, home as had been previously reported. [Updated at 4:23 p.m. ET] We have learned that Connecticut police have searched the suspected gunman's home and place of employment in the wake of Friday's mass shooting, Connecticut State Police Lt. Paul Vance told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. They have also interviewed his friends, relatives and ""everyone who possibly had any connection with him whatsoever,"" he said. [Updated at 4:11 p.m. ET] Police did not discharge their weapons at any time when responding at the school, police spokesman Lt. Paul Vance told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. However, he could not confirm whether the suspected shooter - who died at the scene - killed himself, saying that would have to be determined by the medical examiner. [Updated at 4:07 p.m. ET] Mark Kelly, who's lived through this kind of horror, has issued a statement. He's the husband of former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords who was shot in the head at a massacre in Tucson, Arizona, in January 2011. Here's what he said: I just woke up in my hotel room in Beijing, China, to learn that another mass shooting has taken place - this time at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims and the entire community of Newtown, CT. I just spoke to Gabby, and she sends her prayers from Tucson. As we mourn, we must sound a call for our leaders to stand up and do what is right. This time our response must consist of more than regret, sorrow, and condolence. The children of Sandy Hook Elementary School and all victims of gun violence deserve leaders who have the courage to participate in a meaningful discussion about our gun laws - and how they can be reformed and better enforced to prevent gun violence and death in America. This can no longer wait. [Updated at 3:56 p.m. ET] The principal killed was Dawn Hochsprung. We received this photo via Newtown.Patch.com.  [Updated at 3:54 p.m. ET] Three guns were found at the scene, CNN's Susan Candiotti reports. According to a law enforcement source, the third weapon found on the scene was a .223 Bushmaster. The other weapons, previously reported, are a Glock, and a Sig-Sauer. No word on the models of Glock or Sig-Sauer. [Updated at 3:51 p.m. ET] A federal law enforcement source tells CNN's John King the information from the scene is that the shooter arrived and headed directly toward and to his mother’s classroom. That and the other information now emerging - another family member killed, police interviews - lead them to believe his mother was the primary target. But they note he also came armed with clear intention of mass killing. [Updated at 3:45 p.m. ET] There were a total of 27 people dead at the school, Lt. Paul Vance of the Connecticut State Police said. Six adults, 20 children and the shooter were killed. Eighteen students were pronounced dead at the scene, and two others died at the hospital, said Lt. Paul Vance of the Connecticut State Police. The six adults died at the scene. [Updated at 3:43 p.m. ET] Connecticut State Police Lt. Paul Vance has just said that the shooting took place in one section of the school and in two rooms. [Updated at 3:33 p.m. ET] Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy called the mass shooting ""a tragedy of unspeakable terms."" ""Earlier today a tragedy of unspeakable terms played itself out in this community,"" Malloy said, adding that ""you can never be prepared for this kind of incident. ""A number of our citizens, beautiful children, had their life taken away from them as well as adults whose responsibility it was to educate and supervise those children,"" Malloy said. [Updated at 3:22 p.m. ET] It appears that another member of the alleged shooter's family is dead. A senior law enforcement official familiar with the investigation says a brother of the alleged shooter was found dead in a home searched in Hoboken, New Jersey. We already knew the suspect's mother was found dead in the elementary school. (6:43 p.m. ET update - CNN’s Susan Candiotti is talking to investigators and has now learned that the mother of the suspected shooter was found dead in the suspect’s home in Newtown. No brother of the suspect has been found dead, and no one has been found dead in the home in Hoboken, New Jersey, investigators say.) [Updated at 3:16 p.m. ET] From the president: ""I offered Gov. Malloy my condolences on behalf of the nation."" The president appears to be emotional, he's wiping his eye.  Here's more of what he's saying: ""We've endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years. Each time I learn the news I react not as a president but as anybody else would as a parent. ""That was especially true today. ""I know there's not a parent in America that doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that I do. ""The majority of those who died today were children, beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. ""They had their entire lives ahead of them, birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. Obama sighed. ""Among the fallen were also teachers - men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams. Our hearts are broken today for the parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these children and the families of the adults we lost. ""Our hearts are broken for the parents of the survivors as well, for as blessed as they are to have their children home tonight, they know that their children’s innocence has been torn away from them too early, and there are no words that will ease their pain. ""As a country, we have been through this too many times. Whether it’s an elementary school in Newtown, or a shopping mall in Oregon, or a temple in Wisconsin, or a movie theater in Aurora, or a street corner in Chicago - these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods, and these children are our children. And we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics. ""This evening Michelle and I will do what every parent in America will do - hug our children a little tighter and tell them that we love them. ""There are families in Connecticut that cannot do that tonight and they need all of us tonight. ""May God bless the memory of the victims and in the words of scripture heal the brokenhearted and bind up their wounds."" [Updated at 3:14 p.m. ET] The president will talk soon.

258472049,2012-07-20 23:49:20,Gun Control Legislation: Frank Lautenberg Readies Bill In Wake Of Aurora Shooting,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/20/gun-control-legislation-lautenberg_n_1691093.html,en,False,"politics and government,law and legislation,united states politics and government,crime and criminals,murders and attempted murders",27502,HuffPost,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/#,"Senior Politics Editor, HuffPost WASHINGTON -- In the immediate aftermath of the shooting in Aurora, the debate over gun control policy has more or less centered on whether it's an appropriate time to even have a debate. But several lawmakers have demanded that the government not shy about tackling the legislative issue. Mayor Michael Bloomberg set the tone when he urged the two presidential candidates to outline their policies with respect to federal gun laws. And now, Sen. Frank Lautenberg's (D-N.J.) office is saying that he plans to reintroduce legislation that would curtail the ability of a shooter to fire at length without reloading. ""If reports are correct and a high-capacity gun magazine was used to commit these awful murders, Senator Lautenberg will absolutely renew his effort to limit the availability of this dangerous firearm attachment,"" Lautenberg's communications director Caley Gray told The Huffington Post. Lautenberg, one of the most vocal gun control advocates in the Senate, introduced a bill to limit high-capacity magazines following the shooting of former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. The shooter in that instance fired his gun more than 30 times without having to reload. The bill went nowhere. Early reports have suggested that the accused shooter in Aurora, James Holmes, also used a high-capacity magazine on his assault rifle. And that alone could breathe new political life into the New Jersey Democrat's legislative hopes. Senior Politics Editor, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X OUR PICKS: TUCSON, Ariz.—A newly sworn-in congressman who was injured in a mass shooting last year along with then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords held his first “Congress on Your Corner” event with southern Arizona constituents on Saturday. Giffords conducted 21 of the informal meet-and-greet events during her more than four years in office, including one on the day of the shooting—Jan. 8, 2011. The rampage left six dead and 13 wounded, including Giffords and her then-district director, Ron Barber. Giffords relinquished the seat in January to concentrate on her recovery from a gunshot wound to the head. Barber, a Democrat, won a special election to replace her earlier this month. He was sworn in Tuesday in Washington, D.C. About 300 people showed up at Saturday’s event outside a Tucson grocery store as temperatures topped 100 degrees, Barber spokesman Mark Kimble said. Visitors ranged from other survivors of the mass shooting and well-wishers to people who had concerns about their federal student loans or veteran’s benefits, he said. The event had been scheduled to last an hour and a half. “But there were so many people, we went three hours,” Kimble said. Jared Lee Loughner has pleaded not guilty to 49 charges stemming from the shooting, which took place in front of another Tucson grocery store. Barber was shot twice—once in the face and once in the leg. He was asked by Giffords earlier this year to pursue the seat, and she appeared in Tucson during the campaign’s final days to help him. Barber defeated Republican Jesse Kelly, who narrowly lost to Giffords in 2010. Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts As you comment, please be respectful of other commenters and other viewpoints.

          / CBS/AP Updated at 4:25 p.m. ET (CBS/AP) The suspect apprehended in the mass shooting at a suburban Denver movie theater has been identified as James Eagan Holmes, 24, law enforcement sources told CBS News correspondent Bob Orr. Twelve people died in the shooting at a showing of the new Batman film ""The Dark Knight Rises"" in Aurora, Colo., early Friday morning. A law enforcement source told Orr the shooting appears to have been carried out by a lone gunman. One federal official told CBS News that at this time Holmes appears to have been ""under the radar."" CBS News reports Holmes doesn't appear to have a criminal record in Colorado or in San Diego, Calif., where he graduated from high school in 2006. Pentagon officials said there is no record of Holmes having served in any branch of the military. San Diego police read a statement from Holmes' California family saying that their hearts go out to those involved. They say they're cooperating with authorities in San Diego and Aurora and are trying to process everything. San Diego police spokeswoman Andra Brown said there's nothing to suggest the family had any involvement. Tom Mai, a retired electrical engineer who lives next door to Holmes' family, told The Associated Press that Holmes was a loner. Mai said he said hello to Holmes once in a while, but he seemed to be shy. The mother told Mai that Holmes couldn't find a job after graduating from a public university in California. The University of California, Riverside, confirmed to CBS News that Holmes graduated in 2010 with a bachelor's degree in neuroscience. The family lives on a quiet, well-to-do San Diego street of two-story homes with red tile roofs. Mai said the family lived there about 10 years. The mother is a nurse and the father is a manager at a software company. The suspect has a younger sister. According to the University of Colorado, Denver, Holmes was in the process of dropping out of the school's graduate program in neurosciences. School spokeswoman Jacque Montgomery said in a statement that Holmes enrolled at the school in June 2011. She didn't say why he was withdrawing. Aurora shooting witnesses describe panic, chaosMass shooting at Batman premiere near DenverBloomberg calls on Obama, Romney to talk gun control There was no immediate word of any motive for the attack. Federal law enforcement officials were briefed on the attack, but at this point there is no indication it is terrorism-related, CBS News senior correspondent John Miller reports.    CBS News has learned that some loud music blaring from Holmes' apartment around the time of the attack was designed to draw a noise complaint from a neighbor, thus luring police into his residence, sparking a firebomb and diverting resources from the movie theater. Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates said it could take hours or days to safely enter the apartment. Police recovered four guns at the theater, including two pistols, a shotgun and an assault rifle, Oates told reporters at a news conference. All four guns were purchased legally at three Colorado gun stores between May 22 and July 6, Orr reports. Authorities also recovered a ballistic helmet and a gas mask. A law enforcement source told CBS News investigative producer Pat Milton that the attack appears to have been planned well in advance. Holmes parked his vehicle at the rear of the Century 16 theaters at the Aurora Mall and entered the theater through an emergency door in the back. He exited through the same door and was apprehended without incident. The violent and chaotic scene erupted about 12:30 a.m. local time as the gunman stood at the front of the theater. Witnesses reported that the gunman threw a gas canister before opening fire. ""Witnesses tell us he released some sort of canister. They heard a hissing sound and some gas emerged and the gunman opened fire,"" Oates said. Police, ambulances and emergency crews swarmed on the scene after frantic calls started flooding the 911 switchboard, officials said. Officers found Holmes near a car behind the theater. It was the worst mass shooting in the United States since 32 people were killed on the Virginia Tech campus in 2007. It was the worst in Colorado since the Columbine High School massacre on April 20, 1999. Students Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, opened fire at the school in the Denver suburb of Littleton, about 15 miles west of Aurora, killing 12 classmates and a teacher and wounding 26 others before killing themselves in the school's library. The shooting occurred in Theater 9, which has a capacity of around 300 people, according to CBS Denver station KCNC-TV. Victims were rushed to six area hospitals. Sixteen of the wounded were listed in critical condition, CBS News correspondent Barry Petersen reports. The youngest reported victim is a 4-month-old, who was treated and released from University Hospital. Another victim is a 6-year-old being treated at Children's Hospital, where a total of six victims were taken. Their condition wasn't known. Victims were being treated for chemical exposure apparently related to canisters thrown by the gunman.Corbin Dates told Petersen he saw a man take a phone call by the emergency exit and possibly try to signal or look for somebody during the movie's opening credits. After the movie started, the emergency exit door swung open. ""Somebody walks in dressed all in black, helmet, gas mask, black outfit, you cannot see anything but the person's eyes,"" said Dates, ""and there was a gas can that was thrown into the audience behind me. It went off. I thought it was a stunt of the movie, so I didn't think anything serious of it once it went off."" When gunshots went off, Dates and his friend dropped to the floor and started to crawl through the theater, he said. ""I felt the caps from the bullets burn my leg,"" Dates said. William Kent, who was in an adjacent theater, said bullets came through the wall but with the action on screen, people didn't realize what was happening. ""And they started the fire alarm or the emergency alarm, said that there had been something that happened in the building and evacuated everybody. There was a huge commotion to get out of the theater. When I exited, there were police officers with assault rifles running in,"" Kent told CBS News. (Watch at left) ""From what I saw, she had two bullet wounds in her leg and just blood all over her stomach. Her friends were all just yelling, crying. ... We were just all pretty much in shock,"" he said on ""CBS This Morning."" The police said 10 victims died at the theater and two at area hospitals. Aurora is located on the southeast outskirts of Denver, about 10 miles from downtown. President Obama addressed the shooting from Fort Myers, Fla., calling for a moment of silence. ""There are going to be other days for politics,"" Mr. Obama said. ""This, I think, is a day for prayer and reflection."" The president thanked the gathered crowd and told them he was grateful for their support. ""I was looking forward to having a fun conversation with you about some really important matters we face as a country ... the differences between myself and my opponent in this election,"" he said. ""But this morning we woke up to news of a tragedy that reminds us of all the ways we are united as one American family."" Republican challenger Mitt Romney embraced the same sentiment of unity in Bow, N.H., where he had been scheduled to campaign. ""We'll all spend a little less time thinking about the worries of our day and more time wondering about how to help those who are in need of compassion most,"" he said in brief remarks to a subdued audience. ""The answer is that we can come together. We will show our fellow citizens the good heart of the America we know and love. Mr. Obama canceled a second appearance scheduled near Orlando, Fla., and was returning to Washington. Romney, too, canceled some media interviews. And both candidates moved to pull ads against each other airing in Colorado. Warner Bros., which produced ""The Dark Knight Rises"" said the company was ""deeply saddened to learn about this shocking incident. We extend our sincere sympathies to the families and loved ones of the victims at this tragic time.""

The massacre occurred at the Century 16 cineplex at the Aurora Town Center Mall. The suspected shooter is a local resident named James Eagan Holmes who is in police custody, along with the weapons used in the shooting. There is no clear motive for the attack known at this time. This story will be updated throughout the day as we receive more information. Click here to jump to the latest update. How Holmes Was Armed Holmes carried an assault rifle, a shotgun, and two pistols, the Associated Press reports. Holmes reportedly entered the theater from the emergency exit wearing a gas mask and a bullet proof vest. Witness Accounts According to two witnesses whose interview was flagged by the Huffington Post, he entered the theater, tossed canisters of some kind of gas, and then started shooting. “He looked so calm when he did it, it looked scary,” the witness says.  One of the witnesses says he “thought it was part of the show.” Here’s another interview with a witness to the shooting, conducted by a local NBC affiliate in Colorado:   The witness says “we thought special effects, midnight showing, that’s awesome—what theater does that anymore?” After a few moments, the witness continues, he saw “holes in the walls” and realized that the smoke wasn’t part of the show. Poynter, a journalism news site, has collected tweets from people who were at the movie theater in Aurora when the shooting started. More About the Shooter Holmes, the suspected shooter, was a former graduate student in neuroscience at the University of Colorado-Denver School of Medicine. He withdrew from the college last month. He attended Westview High School in San Diego, California, graduating in 2006. He has no previous criminal record. The city of Aurora police chief says that Holmes’ apartment contains “very sophisticated” explosives, and that police could be at the scene “for hours or days.” According to a federal law enforcement source, Holmes had colored his hair red and told local police that he was “The Joker,” the villain in The Dark Knight (2008). Official Response In the wake of the mass killing, other police departments across the country are now stepping up security measures at area theaters. The Paris gala premiere of the film was cancelled. President Barack Obama was reportedly briefed on the incident early Friday morning. In light of the tragedy, the president has cancelled a campaign event in Winter Park, Florida. The White House released a statement early Friday morning, and Obama will address the shooting at 11:20 a.m. in Fort Myers, Florida. It’s common for presidents and other top national politicians to release statements in the wake of big national tragedies, and both Obama and rival Mitt Romney have already expressed “shock and sorrow” at the incident. The Obama and Romney campaigns have both suspended running political advertisements on Colorado television stations, said spokespeople for the campaigns. Bill Burton, cofounder of the pro-Obama Priorities USA Action super-PAC, tweeted that his group was suspending its Colorado ads as well. President Obama remarked on the shooting Friday morning at a campaign stop in Fort Myers, in southwestern Florida. He said he’d spoken with Aurora Mayor Steve Hogan and Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper to express his and First Lady Michelle Obama’s sadness at the shooting. “The federal government stands ready to do whatever’s necessary to bring whomever’s responsible for this heinous crime to justice,” Obama said. “We will take every step possible to ensure the safety of all of our people. We’re going to stand by our neighbors in Colorado during this extraordinarily difficult time.” During a press briefing Friday morning aboard Air Force One, White House press secretary Jay Carney was asked if President Obama believes that the Aurora massacre warrants a review of gun safety laws. Carney told reporters the following: The president believes that we need to take common-sense measures that protect Second Amendment rights of Americans, while ensuring that those who should not have guns under existing law do not get them…But I have nothing new—nothing additional on that for you. UPDATE, Friday, 11:45 a.m. EST: Suspected gunman’s landlord won’t talk publicly In a brief conversation with Mother Jones, Joan Holley, the manager of Holley Realty who rents out units at the Aurora, Colorado, apartment building where suspected gunman James E. Holmes lived, said she is not yet speaking publicly about Holmes. “Out of respect to the victims and other people involved, I am declining to answer any questions at this time,” Holley said. Holley would not confirm whether she knew Holmes. Asked if she had yet talked to the local police, she said, “I’m going to say goodbye now. I cannot answer at this time.” According to a former resident of that building (who did not know Holmes), the building is mostly rented to college students. Holmes reportedly attended an area medical school but withdrew last month. UPDATE 2, Friday, 12:25 p.m. EST: Photo of suspected gunman Multiple news sources say this is a photo of suspected shooter James E. Holmes:  The image was sent to a local ABC affiliate by the University of Colorado, where Holmes was reportedly a student. UPDATE 3, Friday, 12:35 p.m. EST: Suspected gunman’s yearbook photo Here’s Holmes’ high school yearbook photo, according to San Diego 6 News:   UPDATE 4, Friday, 1:22 p.m. EST: Organizations respond with calls for gun control Dan Gross of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the largest group in the United States of its kind, issued a statement this morning expressing sympathies to the victims’ families and survivors, and also called for action on gun laws: This tragedy is another grim reminder that guns are the enablers of mass killers and that our nation pays an unacceptable price for our failure to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. We are outraged. We understand that President Obama has just spoken and so might Mitt Romney. As someone who has suffered the lasting impact of gun violence, and President of Brady, I can tell you that we don’t want sympathy.  We want action…We are insistent that our elected leaders take action to prevent future tragedies. Political cowardice is not an excuse for evasion and inaction on this life-and-death issue. The United States Conference of Mayors responded similarly: The nation’s mayors express their shock at a mass shooting and send their condolences to the victims, their families, and their community…While we don’t yet have all of the facts in the case, we do know that all evidence this morning points to a heavily armed assailant now in police custody. While questions about his motives and about how he obtained his weapons will be answered in the hours and days ahead, the fact remains that once again guns have been used in a mass killing of innocent people. The U.S. Conference of Mayors is repeating its call for reasonable changes in our gun laws and regulations that could help to prevent senseless tragedies such as the one that has rocked Aurora and the nation this morning.  UPDATE 5, Friday, 2:05 p.m. EST: “Not speculating on motive.” During a joint press conference, Aurora police chief Dan Oates told reporters that his department is “not speculating on motive” at this time. He also mentioned that the explosives for boobytrap found in alleged gunman Holmes’s apartment were “linked together with all sorts of wire.” Oates stated that the police are “not prepared to release [Holmes’] booking photo” today, and that he didn’t yet know whether or not the weapons used were possessed legally. UPDATE 6, Friday, 3:27 p.m. EST: Stars of The Dark Knight Rises cancel promotional events Dark Knight Rises stars Morgan Freeman and Marion Cotillard have pulled out of major press and promotional events scheduled for today and and this evening in France. “The whole team decided out of respect for the families to cancel the premiere,” Cotillard representative said. Warner Bros., which is distributing the film, has not announced whether or not they will cancel future promotional events.  UPDATE 7, Friday, 3:35 p.m. EST: Firearms bought legally, “drum-style” ammo clip used ABC News has confirmed that the three firearms used in the theater shooting—a AR-15 assault rifle, a Remington twelve-gauge shot gun, and a .40 Glock handgun—were purchased legally. ATF agents are currently tracing the weapons. A high-capacity, drum-style ammo clip for the AR-15 was also used in the massacre, according to the Associated Press.

The Department of Defense released the following statement: The Department of Defense is deeply saddened by the news of the tragic incident at the Aurora Mall Movie Theater in Aurora, Colo. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and the families of those impacted by this event. One sailor was injured and one, known to have been at the theatre that evening, is currently unaccounted for. Two airmen were injured in the incident. The Navy and the Air Force are working with the families of these service members to ensure they have the care and attention they need. We can also confirm that the alleged gunman in this incident, James Holmes, is not a past or current member of any branch or component of the U.S. Armed Forces. UPDATE 9, Friday, 5:49 p.m. EST: Patients at University of Colorado Hospital Physicians at University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora treated 23 of the most critically wounded victims.  UPDATE 10, Friday, 8:09 p.m. EST: The Dark Knight Rises director Christopher Nolan weighs in Christopher Nolan, the director of The Dark Knight Rises, issued a statement on the mass shooting: Speaking on behalf of the cast and crew of The Dark Knight Rises, I would like to express our profound sorrow at the senseless tragedy that has befallen the entire Aurora community. I would not presume to know anything about the victims of the shooting but that they were there last night to watch a movie. I believe movies are one of the great American art forms and the shared experience of watching a story unfold on screen is an important and joyful pastime. The movie theatre is my home, and the idea that someone would violate that innocent and hopeful place in such an unbearably savage way is devastating to me. Nothing any of us can say could ever adequately express our feelings for the innocent victims of this appalling crime, but our thoughts are with them and their families.

275186496,2012-07-20 12:00:00,'Dark Knight' shooting suspect's neighbor: 'He seemed like a normal kid',http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/07/colorado-shooting-suspect-neighbor-he-seemed-like-a-normal-kid.html,en,False,"education and schools,murders and attempted murders",6,LA Times,http://www.latimes.com/," A San Diego neighbor of alleged Colorado shooter James Holmes remembers him as a very shy, well-mannered young man who was heavily involved in their local Presbyterian church. ""He seemed to be a normal kid, I don't know what triggered it. This makes me very sad,"" said Tom Mai, a retired electrical engineer. Mai said Holmes' entire family was involved in the Presbyterian Church. PHOTOS: 'Dark Knight Rises' shooting ""I saw him as a normal guy, an every day guy, doing every day things,” said Mai's 16-year-old son, Anthony. San Diego police arrived Friday morning at a Rancho Peñasquitos neighborhood after the alleged shooter's mother called at around 6 a.m., officials said ""We're only here to preserve peace, not to conduct an investigation,"" Lt. Andra Brown said. ""Other agencies are here to investigate."" Arlene Holmes has identified herself to reporters as the mother of the suspected shooter. Her son went to high school in San Diego and then attended college in Colorado, Brown said. Authorities described him as a loner. Poway Unified School District in San Diego confirmed that Holmes was a 2006 graduate of Westview High School. Holmes,  24, was taken into custody early Friday in the parking lot outside the Century 16  movie theater after the post-midnight attack in Aurora, Colo. He allegedly entered the theater through an exit door about half  an hour into the local premiere of the Batman movie ""The Dark Knight Rises."" At least 12 people were killed in the attack. Witnesses described a chaotic scene, telling television reporters that  they were overcome by noxious gas unleashed by the suspect just before  he started shooting, and that they had to decide between staying on the  ground, helping wounded victims or running away before the gunman was  able to reload his weapon. Survivors said they were forced to run past  bodies in the aisles. The attack was smoky and surreal, witnesses reported, as moviegoers, some  wearing their own costumes, slowly realized that bullets were flying  from the weapon of the man in body armor whose face was hidden by a gas  mask. ""There were bullet [casings] just falling on my head. They  were burning my forehead,” Jennifer Seeger told reporters afterward.  “Every few seconds it was just: Boom, boom, boom,"" she said. ""He would  reload and shoot and anyone who would try to leave would just get  killed."" The shooter was armed with a  rifle, a shotgun and two handguns, police said. Cellphone videos from the scene show  panicked moviegoers running -- some screaming -- and others with blood  visible. One theory of the attack is that Holmes may be a disgruntled employee of the movie   theater, based on the fact that he allegedly was able to enter through an   exit, sources said. More than 20 SWAT team members were gingerly searching Holmes' apartment  on Paris Street, a process that could take hours or even days because the apartment  appeared to be booby-trapped with explosives, Aurora Police Chief Dan  Oates told reporters. The area  around the apartment, on the third floor of a housing complex, has been  evacuated.

And I do mean -- literally -- up in arms. The Court's ruling, of course, is not the first to be met with calls for nullification and violence. We would do well to remember the unfortunate and deadly consequences of past rhetoric. Today the issue is health care. In 1954, it was public education when the Supreme Court ruled in the case of Brown v. Board of Education. Following that landmark decision, which called for the integration of public schools, 101 of 128 congressmen from the states of the former Confederacy signed ""The Southern Manifesto,"" which asserted that states were free to ignore federal laws and directives. Eight Southern states passed nullification resolutions declaring the unconstitutionality of the Brown decision. Several of them borrowed language directly from Civil War era secessionist Senator John C. Calhoun in doing so. This demagoguery about ""tyrannical"" government was accompanied by violence. African-Americans were lynched. White protestors in the South hurled sticks, rocks, and racial epithets at black students attempting to attend integrated schools. They beat up journalists and white individuals who escorted African American students to class. Churches, synagogues and homes were bombed (the Ku Klux Klan bombed so many homes in Birmingham the city was nicknamed ""Bombingham""). I am hearing uncomfortable echoes of the past with the response to the June 28, 2012, Supreme Court decision upholding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Immediately after the ruling, South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint issued a press release in which he urged states to defy the federal government by refusing to implement the Act. Since the release of DeMint's statement, governors Rick Scott of Florida, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Rick Perry of Texas and Scott Walker of Wisconsin have stated publicly they will not comply with Obama's health care law regardless of the Supreme Court's decision. The Tenth Amendment Center is distributing model legislation to state legislators that would nullify the law. The legislation would make it a crime for any federal or state official, agent or employee to enforce or attempt to enforce the law (they would also be subjected to civil liability). Missouri, Texas, Montana, Wyoming, Oregon, Indiana, Maine, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Idaho, New Hampshire, South Dakota and North Dakota are currently considering such bills. It is also disturbing to see calls for defiance to Obamacare referencing the ""Second Amendment remedies"" ideology of the modern pro-gun movement. Let me be clear. Violence in response to the Affordable Care Act is already more than theoretical. When the Act was being debated in the U.S. Congress, supporters of the legislation were subjected to threats and vandalism. Representatives Betsy Markey (D-CO), Kathy Dahlkemper (D-PA), Vic Snyder (D-AR), Harry Mitchell (D-AZ), Jean Schmidt (R-OH), Steve Kagen (D-WI), David Obey (D-WI), Bruce Braley (D-IA) and Dave Loebsack (D-IA) were among those who received threats of physical violence. Windows were broken at Rep. Gabrielle Gifford's (D-AZ) Tucson office, Rep. Louise Slaughter's (D-NY) district office, and Democratic Party offices in Ohio, western New York and Kansas. Pictures of nooses were faxed to Rep. James Clyburn (D-SC) and Rep. Bart Stupak (D-MI). Protestors showed up at Rep. Russ Carnahan's (D-MO) home with a coffin. And it was Gabby Giffords, of course, who was targeted for ""assassination"" by deranged gunman Jared Loughner in the horrific mass shooting in Tucson on January 8, 2011. ""You don't have to accept the federalist laws,"" Loughner wrote in his online political manifesto. ""Nonetheless, read the United States of America's Constitution to apprehend all of the current treasonous laws."" Loughner's ideology shouldn't be dismissed because he was severely mentally ill. In fact, it is just such a person who is most likely to fall under the spell of a charismatic leader spewing nullification rhetoric. When highly-placed public figures have no regard for the law, what does that say to the average citizen? It is truly shocking, just a year and a half after the Tucson tragedy, to see continuing calls for violence in response to the Affordable Care Act. Matthew Davis, the former spokesman for the Michigan Republican Party, responded to the ruling in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius by sending a blast email in which he wrote: In 2008, we the people elected Barack Obama as president, and the 100-year progressive trek to tyranny begun in 1912 with Woodrow Wilson's election was complete ... If the Supreme Court's decision Thursday paves the way for unprecedented intrusion into personal decisions, then has the Republic all but ceased to exist? If so, then is armed rebellion today justified? God willing, this oppression will be lifted and America free again before the first shot is fired. Mississippi Tea Party chairman Roy Nicholson issued the following statement: When a gang of criminals subvert legitimate government offices and seize all power to themselves without the real consent of the governed their every act and edict is of itself illegal and is outside the bounds of the Rule of Law. In such cases submission is treason. Treason against the Constitution and the valid legitimate government of the nation to which we have pledged our allegiance for years. To resist by all means that are right in the eyes of God is not rebellion or insurrection, it is patriotic resistance to invasion. May all of us fall on our faces before the Heavenly Judge, repent of our sins, and humbly cry out to Him for mercy on our country. And, may godly courageous leaders rise up in His wisdom and power to lead us in displacing the criminal invaders from their seats and restore our constitutional republic. Mike Vanderboegh, the former Alabama militia leader who inspired the vandalism of Democratic offices during Congressional debate over the Affordable Care Act, responded to the Supreme Court's ruling by writing: You may call tyranny a mandate or you may call it a tax, but it still is tyranny and invites the same response ... If we refuse to obey, we will be fined. If we refuse to pay the fine, we will in time be jailed. If we refuse to report meekly to jail, we will be sent for by armed men. And if we refuse their violent invitation at the doorsteps of our own homes we will be killed--unless we kill them first. And then there was National Rifle Association board member Ted Nugent, who was recently visited by the Secret Service after threatening violence against President Obama and Democrats in general. In a July 5, 2012, op-ed in the Washington Times, Nugent decried ""Chief Justice Roberts' traitor vote'"" in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius and wrote, ""Because our legislative, judicial and executive branches of government hold the 10th Amendment in contempt, I'm beginning to wonder if it would have been best had the South won the Civil War."" Nugent and his fellow insurrectionists are playing a dangerous game. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is the law of the land. It was enacted by duly constituted authority. It was passed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate. It was signed by President Barack Obama. It was upheld as constitutional by the Supreme Court. There is only one place for frustrated citizens to pass judgment on the wisdom of the law; at the ballot box in November. Calls for nullification, as the Supreme Court noted in Cooper v. Aaron, render our Constitution a ""solemn mockery."" Such calls also embolden the actions of others who will throw the bricks, sticks, and rocks; issue the threats; and brandish the guns. In 1958, after the Hebrew Benevolent Congregation Temple was bombed by several men associated with the National States' Rights Party, a white separatist group, then-Atlanta Journal editor Ralph McGill was furious and took pen to paper. ""It is not possible to preach lawlessness and restrict it,"" he warned in an editorial that earned him a Pulitzer Prize. ""Let it be understood that when leadership in high places in any degree fails to support constituted authority, it opens the gates to all those who wish to take the law into their hands."" I have little hope that the new crop of nullifiers will heed this lesson, but for leaders of both parties who still love the Constitution and deplore violence, McGill's sage advice is an invitation to condemn those taking us to the precipice of disaster.

169986497,2012-07-20 23:55:00,"Midnight movie massacre: Colorado Batman shooting leaves 12 dead, 59 wounded",http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/07/midnight_movie_massacre_colora.html,en,True,motion pictures,20120,nj.com,http://www.nj.com," Gallery: Shooting at Colorado midnight showing of Batman movie AURORA, Colo. — As the new Batman movie played on the screen, a gunman dressed in black and wearing a helmet, body armor and a gas mask stepped through a side door. At first he was just a silhouette, taken by some in the audience for a stunt that was part of one of the summer's most highly anticipated films. But then, authorities said, he threw gas canisters that filled the packed suburban Denver theater with smoke, and, in the confusing haze between Hollywood fantasy and terrifying reality, opened fire as people screamed and dove for cover. At least 12 people were killed and 59 wounded in one of the deadliest mass shootings in recent U.S. history. ""He looked like an assassin ready to go to war,"" said Jordan Crofter, a moviegoer who was unhurt in the attack early Friday, about a half-hour after the special midnight opening of ""The Dark Knight Rises."" The gunman, identified by police as 24-year-old James Holmes, used a military-style semi-automatic rifle, a shotgun and a pistol, stopping only to reload. At least one of the wounded is from New Jersey. Jacci Fry, a 23-year-old Andover woman, was hit in the leg with shrapnel, according to a report by Ridgewod.Patch.com. Fry, who recently moved to Colorado, underwent surgery and was released from the hospital, the report said. The suspect marched up the aisle in the stadium-style theater, picking off those who tried to flee, witnesses said. Authorities said he hit 71 people. One of them was struck in an adjacent theater by gunfire that went through the wall. • Sussex County woman injured in Colorado Batman shooting, released from hospital after surgery • Suspect in Colorado Batman shooting was former PhD student, apartment rigged with explosives • Opinion: 'Batman' shooting is the end of an era for movie-going • Colorado Batman shooting: Complete coverage of theater massacre ""He would reload and shoot and anyone who would try to leave would just get killed,"" said Jennifer Seeger, adding that bullet casings landed on her head and burned her forehead. Within minutes, frantic 911 calls brought some 200 police officers, ambulances and emergency crews to the theater. Holmes was captured in the parking lot. Police said they later found that his nearby apartment was booby-trapped. Authorities gave no motive for the attack. The FBI said there was no indication of ties to any terrorist groups. In New York City, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said: ""It clearly looks like a deranged individual. He has his hair painted red. He said he was the Joker, obviously the enemy of Batman."" Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates would not confirm that information, but did say he had spoken to Kelly. The two used to work together in New York. Asked whether Holmes had makeup to look like the Joker, Oates said: ""That to my knowledge is not true."" It was the worst mass shooting in the U.S. since the Nov. 5, 2009, attack at Fort Hood, Texas. An Army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 soldiers and civilians and wounding more than two dozen others. It was the deadliest in Colorado since the Columbine High School massacre in suburban Denver in 1999, when two students killed 12 classmates and a teacher and wounded 26 others before killing themselves. The new Batman movie, the last in the trilogy starring Christian Bale, opened worldwide Friday with midnight showings in the U.S. The plot has the villain Bane facing Bale's Caped Crusader with a nuclear weapon that could destroy all of fictional Gotham. The shooting prompted officials to cancel the red-carpet premiere in Paris, and some U.S. movie theaters stepped up security for daytime showings. The attack began shortly after midnight at the multiplex in Aurora, an urban community on Denver's eastside. Audience members said they thought it was part of the movie, or some kind of stunt associated with it. The film has several scenes of public mayhem — a hallmark of superhero movies. In one scene, Bane leads an attack on a stock exchange, and in another he leads a shooting and bombing rampage on a packed football stadium. A federal law enforcement official said Holmes bought a ticket to the show, went into the theater as part of the crowd and propped open an exit door as the movie was playing. The suspect then donned protective ballistic gear and opened fire, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation. At some point, the gunman appeared to have stepped outside because several witnesses saw him come through the door. ""All I saw is the door swinging open and the street lights behind, and you could see a silhouette,"" said Crofter, who was sitting on the left side of the theater and toward the front. Sylvana Guillen said the gunman, clad in dark clothing, appeared at the front of the theater as the character Catwoman appeared in the movie. Then they heard gunshots and smelled smoke from a canister he was carrying. As she and her friend, Misha Mostashiry, ran to the exit, Guillen said, they saw a man slip in the blood of a wounded woman he was trying to help. Oates said the gunman wore a gas mask and a ballistic helmet and vest, as well as leg, groin and throat protectors. He said among the guns was an AR-15 rifle and that the gunman used two gas canisters. ""I thought it was showmanship. I didn't think it was real,"" Seeger said. She said she was in the second row, about four feet from the gunman, when he pointed a gun at her face. ""I was just a deer in headlights. I didn't know what to do,"" she said. Then she ducked to the ground as the gunman shot people seated behind her. Seeger said she began crawling toward an exit when she saw a girl of about 14 ""lying lifeless on the stairs."" She saw a man with a bullet wound in his back and tried to check his pulse, but ""I had to go. I was going to get shot."" Moviegoer Eric Hunter and his friends made their way to an exit. When he opened the door, he said, he saw two teenage girls — one shot in the mouth and the other one crying. He asked them if they were OK. ""Help us. Help us, please,"" he recalled them saying. Later, police began entering the theater, asking people to hold their hands up as they evacuated the building. Some of the victims were treated for chemical exposure apparently related to canisters thrown by the gunman. Those hurt included a 4-month-old baby, who was treated at a hospital and released. Those who knew Holmes described him as a shy, intelligent person raised in California by parents who were active in their well-to-do suburban neighborhood in San Diego. Holmes played soccer at Westview High School and ran cross-country before going to college. On Friday morning, police escorted Holmes' father, a manager of a software company, from their home while his mother, a nurse, stayed inside, receiving visitors who came to offer support. Holmes also has a younger sister. New York News | New York Breaking News | NYC Headlines ""As you can understand, the Holmes family is very upset about all of this,"" Lt. Andra Brown, the San Diego police spokeswoman, told reporters in the driveway of the family home. ""It's a tragic event and it's taken everyone by surprise. They are definitely trying to work through this."" Police released a statement from his famiily that said: ""Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved."" There have been no indications so far that Holmes had any run-ins with the law before Friday. Tom Mai, a retired electrical engineer, said Holmes was a ""shy guy"" who came from a ""very, very nice family."" Holmes graduated from University of California, Riverside, in the spring of 2010 a bachelor's degree in neuroscience, a school spokesman said. Mai said the mother told him Holmes couldn't find a job after earning a master's degree and returned to school. In 2011, he enrolled in the Ph.D. neuroscience program at the University of Colorado-Denver but was in the process of withdrawing, a university spokeswoman said. Holmes lived in an apartment in Aurora, and FBI agents and police who went there discovered it was booby-trapped when they used a camera at the end of a 12-foot pole to look inside.

                since  A horrific shooting at the Century Theater in Aurora, Colorado, early on Friday morning has stunned the United States. A figure in a gas mask set off what appear to have been tear gas bombs about 15 minutes into a midnight showing of The Dark Knight before opening fire on the crowd watching the movie. Police told reporters that 12 people have died and 58 more were injured in the attack. There were 70 casualties in total, making it the largest mass shooting in U.S. history by casualties. As of 3:30 PM local time (5:30 PM EDT), 30 patients remained in the hospital and 11 patients were still in critical condition. In a midday press conference, Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates named 24 year-old white male James Eagan Holmes as the sole suspect in the case. Police apprehended Holmes in the parking lot of the movie theater. 9News in Denver reports that the subject did not resist arrest.  Bomb squads still on the scene Oates said the shooter made statements to police about explosives at his apartment and car after being taken into custody. According to 9NEWS, a bomb robot found suspicious materials in Holmes's car. Upon further investigation, authorities determined that the subject's apartment had been booby-trapped with explosive or flammable devices. By that point, they had already evacuated the building at East 17th Street and Peoria in Aurora. The area--which includes five adjacent apartment buildings--remains surrounded by police. Authorities do not know how long it will take to secure the area. The police chief called Holmes's apartment a ""very vexing problem."" ""We don't know how we're going to handle that,"" Oates said. ""It's like nothing I've ever seen."" Aurora authorities sought help from the FBI and the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives). The task force had halted an operation to disarm the booby-traps for the day by Friday evening and planned to restart those efforts Saturday. University of Colorado—Denver police have evacuated two research buildings the suspect once worked in, according to CBS Denver.  Theater-goers experienced their own horror movie Witnesses say the perpetrator, allegedly wearing a bullet-proof vest, goggles, and a gas mask, entered Theater #9--one of three theaters showing The Dark Knight Rises around midnight--through a fire exit. He opened fire after blinding the audience with tear gas. At least one person in Theater #8 (also showing the Batman flick) was also hit by bullets coming through the wall. A witness also told reporters on the scene that the shooter eventually entered other theaters after they had been evacuated in an attempt to shoot stragglers. Some witnesses remarked in interviews after the massacre that Holmes appeared and even called himself the ""Joker,"" a character in the Batman saga. Journalists also pointed out that the shooting bears an uncanny resemblance to Frank Miller's graphic novel ""The Dark Knight Rises.""  A puzzling suspect Police have said that Holmes has no criminal history beyond a single traffic violation. They are ""confident"" that Holmes acted alone, and by midday were no longer exploring the possibility that he acted in concert with an accomplice. While witnesses speculated that the incident ""[felt] like"" a terrorist attack in TV interviews immediately after the event, police have said that the alleged gunman has no known connections to terrorist groups or activities. The New York Times reports that police consider Holmes ""somewhat of an enigma""  because they have been unable to find any solid indications of a motive nor any evidence of any past aberrant behavior. However, Oates told reporters at an evening press conference, ""If we had information about a motive, we would not share it with you.""  The victims We've seen two disturbing, graphic amateur videos so far that were taken during or in the direct aftermath of the tragedy. One shows theater-goers fleeing the movie theater, first at a walk and then at a run. The second shows victims being carried through the parking lot away from the site of the attack. The wounded were transported to various local hospitals, all of which remarked that the victims tended to be young, with most between 16 and 30. The youngest person hospitalized that news channels identified was a 3 month-old who was taken to University Hospital. According to 9News, the infant was not injured, and taken to the hospital as a precaution. A 6 year-old was also taken to the local children's hospital. Most of the victims were treated for gunshot wounds, though a few victims only sought treatment for chemical exposure. These latter injuries were caused by the tear gas--or another chemical irritant--that the gunman apparently used to confuse theater-goers. ""Nearly every one [of the victims] was shot,"" Oates told reporters. One victim posted images of his injuries to Reddit >  Gunman stockpiled weapons ahead of the attack Oates told reporters in a press conference Friday evening, ""In the last 60 days he purchased 4 guns at local metro gun shops."" He also purchased 6,000 rounds of ammunition online. The police currently believe that Holmes acquired all his weapons and ammunition legally.  Holmes's mother tells reporters, ""You have the right person"" before Holmes was publicly identified Before police had confirmed the identity of the suspected gunman, ABC News got in touch with Holmes's mother. In a conversation with journalists she said, ""You have the right person...I need to call the police...I need to fly out to Colorado,"" before ending the conversation. Later, San Diego police showed up outside her house. ""We're only here to preserve the peace; we're not here to conduct and investigation or do anything else,"" said Lt. Andrea Brown of the San Diego Police. She said their tasks included keeping the street open and making sure journalists did not disturb the residents. According to the Associated Press, the University of Colorado Medical School said that the suspect had been a student there. He withdrew last month. He appears to have taken a course titled the Biological Basis of Psychiatric and Neurological Disorders (via @BuzzFeedAndrew). The Associated Press reported at 4:20 PM EDT that Holmes is not cooperating with police officials, despite appearing to go quietly with police directly after the shooting and reveal the presence of explosives in his car and apartment. Holmes is currently being held in Araphoe County Jail. His first court appearance will take place on Monday at 8:30 AM local time (10:30 AM EDT), according to Chief Oates. Police have elected not to release a mugshot.  Politicians jump into the fray Both President Barack Obama and presidential candidate Mitt Romney released statements on the incident, expressing sympathy and sadness. Both men gave press conferences about the incident. Warner Brothers has also extended its ""sincere sympathies to the families and the loved ones of the victims"" of the attack, and has cancelled the Paris premiere of The Dark Knight Rises in the wake of the shooting. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg told WOR radio this morning that the incident should prompt candidates to come clean about their stance on gun policy. Pundits have already expressed concerns that the tragic social realities of the shooting will be overshadowed by the political debates it generates, particularly in an election year.  First full day following the massacre draws to a close In a press conference at 7 PM local time (9 PM EDT) Friday--their third of the day--both Police Chief Oates and Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper appeared saddened and exhausted. Chief Oates said that police had removed the last of the 10 bodies of victims pronounced dead in the theater a little after 5 PM local time. Hickenlooper told reporters, ""[We have] an anger that can't find purpose."" He continued, ""We're not just going to let [this] happen to us. We're going to push back."" The next press briefing will take place at 4 PM EDT Saturday. --- You can follow the story by watching 9 News's live coverage and at the Twitter handle #theatershooting.

987471954,2012-07-20 00:00:00,Why the Aurora shooting won't likely change the gun control debate,https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/why-the-aurora-shooting-wont-likely-change-the-gun-control-debate/2012/07/20/gJQA6qWpxW_blog.html,en,False,,2,Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,"The shootings in Aurora, Colorado early Friday morning are almost certain to re-stoke the debate over whether more gun control laws are needed, a conversation that has lain near-dormant since early 2011 when former. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D) was shot in Arizona. A single chart from Gallup puts the movement in public opinion on guns in stark terms.  In 1990, almost eight in ten Americans said that the “laws covering the sales of firearms” should be made “more strict” while just 10 percent said they should be made “less strict” or “kept as they are now”. By 2010, those numbers had drastically shifted with 54 percent preferring less strict or no change in guns laws and 44 percent believing gun laws should be made more strict. Public opinion has also proven immune to past high profile tragedies involving guns. In 1999, when Gallup asked the question six times after the Columbine High School massacre in Colorado, the number of those in favor of stricter laws ranged from 60 to 66 percent. The “less strict” number ranged from 5 to 9 percent and the “stay the same” number ranged from 25 to 31 percent. The opinions were similar after the shootings at Virginia Tech in April 2007. By October of that year, 51 percent favored stricter gun laws, a 5 percent decline from a similar Gallup survey taken in the fall of 2006. (Here’s more on how Virginia Tech didn’t move the needle on gun control.) And, in the wake of the attempted assassination of Giffords, that pattern played out again — with little obvious change in how people view society’s relationship with guns. A Pew Research Center poll conducted in April of this year showed that 49 percent of people said the right to own guns was more important while 45 percent said it was more important to control gun ownership. Those numbers were unchanged from a Pew survey conducted Jan. 13-16, 2011 — just days after Giffords was shot in Tucson. That the numbers on gun control remain steady even in the aftermath of such high profile events like Columbine, Virginia Tech and the Giffords shooting suggests that people simply don’t equate these incidents of violence with the broader debate over the right role for guns in our society. They view them as entirely separate conversations — and that’s why the tragedy in Aurora isn’t likely to change the political conversation over guns either.

806496105,2012-07-20 14:30:05,What You Need To Know About the Batman Theater Shooting [UPDATES],https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/batman-theater-shooting-updates-dark-knight-rises/,en,False,"gun control,firearms",1112,Mother Jones,http://www.motherjones.com/,"Xinhua/ZUMA Press A mass shooting at a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises in Aurora, Colorado, has left at least twelve people dead and 58 wounded. The massacre occurred at the Century 16 cineplex at the Aurora Town Center Mall. The suspected shooter is a local resident named James Eagan Holmes who is in police custody, along with the weapons used in the shooting. There is no clear motive for the attack known at this time. This story will be updated throughout the day as we receive more information. Click here to jump to the latest update. How Holmes Was Armed Holmes carried an assault rifle, a shotgun, and two pistols, the Associated Press reports. Holmes reportedly entered the theater from the emergency exit wearing a gas mask and a bullet proof vest. Witness Accounts According to two witnesses whose interview was flagged by the Huffington Post, he entered the theater, tossed canisters of some kind of gas, and then started shooting. “He looked so calm when he did it, it looked scary,” the witness says.  One of the witnesses says he “thought it was part of the show.” Here’s another interview with a witness to the shooting, conducted by a local NBC affiliate in Colorado:   The witness says “we thought special effects, midnight showing, that’s awesome—what theater does that anymore?” After a few moments, the witness continues, he saw “holes in the walls” and realized that the smoke wasn’t part of the show. Poynter, a journalism news site, has collected tweets from people who were at the movie theater in Aurora when the shooting started. More About the Shooter Holmes, the suspected shooter, was a former graduate student in neuroscience at the University of Colorado-Denver School of Medicine. He withdrew from the college last month. He attended Westview High School in San Diego, California, graduating in 2006. He has no previous criminal record. The city of Aurora police chief says that Holmes’ apartment contains “very sophisticated” explosives, and that police could be at the scene “for hours or days.” According to a federal law enforcement source, Holmes had colored his hair red and told local police that he was “The Joker,” the villain in The Dark Knight (2008). Official Response In the wake of the mass killing, other police departments across the country are now stepping up security measures at area theaters. The Paris gala premiere of the film was cancelled. President Barack Obama was reportedly briefed on the incident early Friday morning. In light of the tragedy, the president has cancelled a campaign event in Winter Park, Florida. The White House released a statement early Friday morning, and Obama will address the shooting at 11:20 a.m. in Fort Myers, Florida. It’s common for presidents and other top national politicians to release statements in the wake of big national tragedies, and both Obama and rival Mitt Romney have already expressed “shock and sorrow” at the incident. The Obama and Romney campaigns have both suspended running political advertisements on Colorado television stations, said spokespeople for the campaigns. Bill Burton, cofounder of the pro-Obama Priorities USA Action super-PAC, tweeted that his group was suspending its Colorado ads as well. President Obama remarked on the shooting Friday morning at a campaign stop in Fort Myers, in southwestern Florida. He said he’d spoken with Aurora Mayor Steve Hogan and Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper to express his and First Lady Michelle Obama’s sadness at the shooting. “The federal government stands ready to do whatever’s necessary to bring whomever’s responsible for this heinous crime to justice,” Obama said. “We will take every step possible to ensure the safety of all of our people. We’re going to stand by our neighbors in Colorado during this extraordinarily difficult time.” During a press briefing Friday morning aboard Air Force One, White House press secretary Jay Carney was asked if President Obama believes that the Aurora massacre warrants a review of gun safety laws. Carney told reporters the following: The president believes that we need to take common-sense measures that protect Second Amendment rights of Americans, while ensuring that those who should not have guns under existing law do not get them…But I have nothing new—nothing additional on that for you. UPDATE, Friday, 11:45 a.m. EST: Suspected gunman’s landlord won’t talk publicly In a brief conversation with Mother Jones, Joan Holley, the manager of Holley Realty who rents out units at the Aurora, Colorado, apartment building where suspected gunman James E. Holmes lived, said she is not yet speaking publicly about Holmes. “Out of respect to the victims and other people involved, I am declining to answer any questions at this time,” Holley said. Holley would not confirm whether she knew Holmes. Asked if she had yet talked to the local police, she said, “I’m going to say goodbye now. I cannot answer at this time.” According to a former resident of that building (who did not know Holmes), the building is mostly rented to college students. Holmes reportedly attended an area medical school but withdrew last month. UPDATE 2, Friday, 12:25 p.m. EST: Photo of suspected gunman Multiple news sources say this is a photo of suspected shooter James E. Holmes:  The image was sent to a local ABC affiliate by the University of Colorado, where Holmes was reportedly a student. UPDATE 3, Friday, 12:35 p.m. EST: Suspected gunman’s yearbook photo Here’s Holmes’ high school yearbook photo, according to San Diego 6 News:   UPDATE 4, Friday, 1:22 p.m. EST: Organizations respond with calls for gun control Dan Gross of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the largest group in the United States of its kind, issued a statement this morning expressing sympathies to the victims’ families and survivors, and also called for action on gun laws: This tragedy is another grim reminder that guns are the enablers of mass killers and that our nation pays an unacceptable price for our failure to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. We are outraged. We understand that President Obama has just spoken and so might Mitt Romney. As someone who has suffered the lasting impact of gun violence, and President of Brady, I can tell you that we don’t want sympathy.  We want action…We are insistent that our elected leaders take action to prevent future tragedies. Political cowardice is not an excuse for evasion and inaction on this life-and-death issue. The United States Conference of Mayors responded similarly: The nation’s mayors express their shock at a mass shooting and send their condolences to the victims, their families, and their community…While we don’t yet have all of the facts in the case, we do know that all evidence this morning points to a heavily armed assailant now in police custody. While questions about his motives and about how he obtained his weapons will be answered in the hours and days ahead, the fact remains that once again guns have been used in a mass killing of innocent people. The U.S. Conference of Mayors is repeating its call for reasonable changes in our gun laws and regulations that could help to prevent senseless tragedies such as the one that has rocked Aurora and the nation this morning.  UPDATE 5, Friday, 2:05 p.m. EST: “Not speculating on motive.” During a joint press conference, Aurora police chief Dan Oates told reporters that his department is “not speculating on motive” at this time. He also mentioned that the explosives for boobytrap found in alleged gunman Holmes’s apartment were “linked together with all sorts of wire.” Oates stated that the police are “not prepared to release [Holmes’] booking photo” today, and that he didn’t yet know whether or not the weapons used were possessed legally. UPDATE 6, Friday, 3:27 p.m. EST: Stars of The Dark Knight Rises cancel promotional events Dark Knight Rises stars Morgan Freeman and Marion Cotillard have pulled out of major press and promotional events scheduled for today and and this evening in France. “The whole team decided out of respect for the families to cancel the premiere,” Cotillard representative said. Warner Bros., which is distributing the film, has not announced whether or not they will cancel future promotional events.  UPDATE 7, Friday, 3:35 p.m. EST: Firearms bought legally, “drum-style” ammo clip used ABC News has confirmed that the three firearms used in the theater shooting—a AR-15 assault rifle, a Remington twelve-gauge shot gun, and a .40 Glock handgun—were purchased legally. ATF agents are currently tracing the weapons. A high-capacity, drum-style ammo clip for the AR-15 was also used in the massacre, according to the Associated Press. (Click here, here, and here for Mother Jones‘ past coverage of these kinds of large gun clips.) Here’s a photo of a precision built, ultra-high capacity, drum-style magazine for an AR-15: Brownells.comUPDATE 8, Friday, 3:59 p.m. EST: Defense Department statement US Navy and Air Force service members were among the injured. The Department of Defense released the following statement: The Department of Defense is deeply saddened by the news of the tragic incident at the Aurora Mall Movie Theater in Aurora, Colo. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and the families of those impacted by this event. One sailor was injured and one, known to have been at the theatre that evening, is currently unaccounted for. Two airmen were injured in the incident. The Navy and the Air Force are working with the families of these service members to ensure they have the care and attention they need. We can also confirm that the alleged gunman in this incident, James Holmes, is not a past or current member of any branch or component of the U.S. Armed Forces. UPDATE 9, Friday, 5:49 p.m. EST: Patients at University of Colorado Hospital Physicians at University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora treated 23 of the most critically wounded victims.  UPDATE 10, Friday, 8:09 p.m. EST: The Dark Knight Rises director Christopher Nolan weighs in Christopher Nolan, the director of The Dark Knight Rises, issued a statement on the mass shooting: Speaking on behalf of the cast and crew of The Dark Knight Rises, I would like to express our profound sorrow at the senseless tragedy that has befallen the entire Aurora community. I would not presume to know anything about the victims of the shooting but that they were there last night to watch a movie. I believe movies are one of the great American art forms and the shared experience of watching a story unfold on screen is an important and joyful pastime. The movie theatre is my home, and the idea that someone would violate that innocent and hopeful place in such an unbearably savage way is devastating to me. Nothing any of us can say could ever adequately express our feelings for the innocent victims of this appalling crime, but our thoughts are with them and their families.

Our research focused on indiscriminate rampages in public places resulting in four or more victims killed by the attacker. We exclude shootings stemming from more conventionally motivated crimes such as armed robbery or gang violence. (Or in which the perpetrators have not been identified.) Other news outlets and researchers have since published larger tallies that include a wide range of gun crimes in which four or more people have been either wounded or killed. While those larger datasets of multiple-victim shootings are useful for studying the broader problem of gun violence, our investigation provides an in-depth look at a distinct phenomenon—from the firearms used and mental health factors to the growing copycat problem. Tracking mass shootings is complex; we believe ours is the most useful approach for studying this specific phenomenon.  Since we began, our interactive map below and the downloadable database behind it have been expanded with 62 additional cases from 2013-2021. Dating back to at least 2005, the FBI and leading criminologists essentially defined a mass shooting as a single attack in a public place in which four or more victims were killed. We adopted that baseline for fatalities when we gathered data in 2012 on three decades worth of cases. (It is important to note that there have been many similar indiscriminate gun rampages in public places—but resulting in fewer fatalities—that would otherwise be included in our dataset. In that regard, ours is a conservative measure of the problem.) In January 2013, a mandate for federal investigation of mass shootings authorized by President Barack Obama lowered that baseline to three or more victims killed. Accordingly, we include attacks dating from January 2013 in which three or more victims were killed. (Any analysis of the frequency of mass shootings using our database should account for this.) Our original analysis, which covers cases from 1982-2012 with four or more victims killed, follows below. The cases we’ve documented since then using the revised federal baseline reaffirm our major analytical findings. <span data-mce-type=”bookmark” style=”display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;” class=”mce_SELRES_start”>﻿</span>&amp;amp;amp;lt;span data-mce-type=”bookmark” style=”display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;” class=”mce_SELRES_start”&amp;amp;amp;gt;﻿&amp;amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;amp;amp;gt; It is perhaps too easy to forget how many times this has happened. The gun massacre at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, in July 2012, another at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin that August, another at a manufacturer in Minneapolis that September—and then the unthinkable nightmare at a Connecticut elementary school that December—were some of the latest in an epidemic of such gun violence over the past three-plus decades. Since 1982, there have been at least 124 public mass shootings across the country, with the killings unfolding in 36 states, from Massachusetts to Hawaii. They are occurring more often: An analysis of this database by researchers at Harvard University, further corroborated by a separate study from the FBI, determined that mass shootings have tripled in frequency in recent years. We’ve gathered detailed data on nearly four decades worth of cases, including information on the attackers’ profiles, the types of weapons they used, and the number of victims they injured and killed. [Editor’s note: The following analysis covers our original dataset comprised of 62 cases from 1982-2012.] Weapons: Of the 143 guns possessed by the killers, more than three quarters were obtained legally. They included dozens of assault weapons and semi-automatic handguns with high-capacity magazines. (See charts below.) Just as a perpetrator used a .40-caliber Glock to slaughter students in Red Lake, Minnesota, in 2005, so too did the one in Aurora, along with an AR-15 assault rifle, when blasting away at his victims in a darkened movie theater. In Newtown, Connecticut, the attacker wielded a .223 Bushmaster semi-automatic assault rifle as he massacred 20 school children and six adults. The perpetrators: More than half of the cases involved school or workplace shootings (12 and 20, respectively); the other 30 cases took place in locations including shopping malls, restaurants, and religious and government buildings. Forty-four of the killers were white males. Only one was a woman. (See Goleta, Calif., in 2006.) The average age of the killers was 35, though the youngest among them was a mere 11 years old. (See Jonesboro, Ark., in 1998.) A majority were mentally troubled—and many displayed signs of mental health problems before setting out to kill. Explore the above map and database for further details—we do not consider it to be all-inclusive, but based on the criteria we used, we believe that we have produced the most comprehensive rundown available on this particular type of violence. (Mass shootings represent a small fraction of America’s overall gun violence.)

Here is a description of the criteria we use: For more on the thinking behind our criteria, see these two explanatory pieces. Plus: more on the mental health factor and on state laws rolling back gun restrictions across the US. And: Explore the full data set behind our investigation. Here are two charts detailing the killers’ weapons:  This guide was first published on July 20, 2012. Since then, we’ve updated and expanded it numerous times with additional research and reporting. The analysis and charts above cover the data through 2012 (comprising 62 cases); additional data and analysis on the shooters’ weapons are in this story.

          / CBS/AP Last Updated 10:42 a.m. ET  (CBS/AP) Eyewitnesses described scenes of panic, chaos and patrons covered in blood after a gunman opened fire with assault weapons at an Aurora, Colo., multiplex shortly after midnight Friday. At least 12 people have died; Dozens more were wounded. The violence occurred at midnight screenings of the opening of the new Batman film, ""The Dark Knight Rises."" ""I went out to enjoy a movie and I ended up in a gruesome thing - I don't know how you would qualify it,"" witness William Kent told CBS News. Police said the suspect appeared at the front of the crowd in Theater 9, threw some type of gas or explosive device, and started shooting. A woman named Jennifer Seeger told CBS Station KCNC that the gunman came in, lit a gas canister and threw it into the crowd. ""At that point he shot his first fire into the ceiling to scare everybody. They started scattering - mass chaos just happened."" ""He pointed the gun at me,"" she said. ""I was terrified, so I just dove into the aisle. At that point he started shooting people behind me. I had bullets that were on my forehead, burning my forehead, and I told myself, I need to get out of here. ""I crawled on the ground and I just laid in a ball and waited for him to go up the stairs,"" Seeger said, then told her friend that they had to leave.  ""At that point, I was trying to crawl out but then everybody was crawling back in and saying, 'Don't go over there. He's going to shoot everybody trying to get out of the main doors,' and he was. All I hear is gunshot after gunshot. Just women and children are screaming."" She said the gunman was wearing a gas mask and so she could not see his face. ""I don't know exactly what kind of gun it was, it was just a big rifle . . . They were big bullets, too, and they were hot. I smelt gunfire in the air. I was just terrified. The gas was getting to me. I was having a hard time breathing."" The assailant was seized at the scene. A law enforcement source told CBS News the suspect was well-equipped, with one rifle, two handguns, a knife, bulletproof vest, ballistic helmet, gas device, gas mask and military/SWAT-style clothing. There were also unidentified explosives found in his vehicle. Security increased at theaters after Colo. shootingComplete coverage: Colo. movie theater massacre CBS News senior correspondent John Miller said on ""CBS This Morning"" that Seeger is lucky to be alive. He said, ""She said she felt bullets burning her forehead. What she's talking about is stippling, which is the gun was being fired so close in front of her that the gunpowder and burn that comes out of the barrel and where it's ejected actually was hitting her skin as the bullets went by. So the witness we just heard - that vivid description - is extraordinarily lucky, as I think she understands, to not be one of the gunshot victims and to be around talking."" Mass shooting at Batman showing in Denver suburb""Dark Knight Rises"" shooting: Suspect's home, belongings key to investigation Corbin Dates told CBS News correspondent Barry Petersen he saw a man take a phone call by the emergency exit and possibly try to signal or look for somebody during the movie's opening credits. After the movie started, the emergency exit door swung open. ""Somebody walks in dressed all in black, helmet, gas mask, black outfit, you cannot see anything but the person's eyes,"" said Dates, ""and there was a gas can that was thrown into the audience behind me. It went off. I thought it was a stunt of the movie, so I didn't think anything serious of it once it went off."" When gunshots went off, Dates and his friend dropped to the floor and started to crawl through the theater, he said. ""I felt the caps from the bullets burn my leg,"" Dates said. Another woman, Spenser Sherman, told ""CBS This Morning"" that she saw the emergency exit door open and a tear gas thrown in. ""Then it was a blur,"" she said. ""Then I heard a couple gunshots."" ""I thought it was part of the movie, like a fun little prank - that it would be over in a few seconds. It obviously wasn't.""  She said she only saw a silhouette of the suspect, and that the gunman said nothing. ""Everybody had dropped to the floor after the first couple gunshots, and then he fired some more. And then after that, there was a pause in the gunshots. Some people say he was reloading, I don't know. But at that point, my boyfriend was like 'This is the time, we need to go, we need to get out of the theater right now.' So we ran."" She and her friends got out safe. Sherman said she saw one woman with blood on her face. ""It's really mind-boggling that someone would turn an event like this into something this terrible."" ""As I walk out, I see that young girl shot, blood, everything that I would never expect to see in real life,"" Shayla Roeder, who left the multiplex, told CBS News. And I just keep looking around seeing what's my surroundings, and I see people walking out with blood on them. I'm still thinking maybe this is just, you know, maybe nothing is really going on here. And I'm walking out seeing everyone else walking out nonchalantly with blood on them. Police officers following them saying we need ambulances out. ""And then what really caught me off-guard is, there was a girl, like 24 or 25-years-old, my age. She said, 'I just need someone to talk to. One of my best friends just got shot and I don't know who to talk to right now.'"" Witnesses report bullets passed through the wall into Theater 8, where Kent was watching the movie. Initially,  Petersen reports, audiences in Theater 8 did not know that the sounds of gunfire were not part of the film. ""There was a lot going on in the soundtrack of the movie at that time. In the beginning, I don't think people realized what was happening,"" said Kent, who saw evidence of bullets passing through the walls. ""They started the fire alarm, or the emergency alarm - said that there had been something that happened in the building and they evacuated everybody. There was a huge commotion to get out of the theater,"" said Kent. ""When I exited, there were police officers with assault rifles running in."" Salina Jordan told the Denver Post she saw police carrying and dragging bodies. Donovan Tate told KCNC that he saw a girl spitting up blood. ""There were bullet holes in some people's backs, in some people's arms. There was one guy who was just stripped down to his boxers. It looked like he had been shot in the back,"" Tate said. It was the worst mass shooting in the United States since 32 people were killed on the Virginia Tech campus in 2007. In 1999, 13 people were killed in the Columbine High School massacre - about 25 miles southwest of Friday shooting. Ben Fernandez and his girlfriend were in the theater next door when alarms went off - and first thought it was a false alarm. ""The alarms went off and there was just a voice over the intercom saying, 'You have to exit the theater, there's an emergency,' and we thought it was just kind of a false alarm so we just kind of stood there trying to watch the movie still,"" Fernandez told ""CBS This Morning."" ""And then when we saw the police, you know, they weren't even really ushering people out, like calmly. They were pretty much yelling at everybody, screaming at them that they need to get out, telling people to just sprint out of the theater, and that's when we realized something bad was happening."" After going outside Fernandez said he saw several armed police officers. ""We walked to the left in front of the theater and we saw a young girl, maybe like 12, 13, just laying on the concrete. From what I saw, she had two bullet wounds in her leg and she had just blood all over her stomach. Her friends were all just yelling, crying. There were people just saying, 'My friend just got shot.' We were just all pretty much in shock,"" Fernandez said. He described people who had gathered in different crowds, some wounded.  ""We saw police officers helping out a man that was just covered in blood. We didn't know what happened to him - he was just completely out of it and covered in blood. Like i said. It was just really scary."" Then, Fernandez said, a large crowd started sprinting away from the theater.  ""We weren't sure, you know, if people were going to come out like shooting guns or what was going on. So we all just kind of took off running towards the car. It was just pretty much like panic and pretty much chaos like at first . . . I feel shaky even talking about it right now. It was just a lot of crazy, crazy stuff going on that I've never seen before in my life."" Fernandez said he did not see the shooter.  ""As we were leaving, the police were questioning everybody coming out, trying to see what was going on, if anybody saw the shooter up front."" Witnesses and people who were evacuated from apartments nearby were being taken to Gateway High School for interviews and also to reunite with friends and family. At least 24 people were being treated at Denver area hospitals. The youngest victim reported was a 3-month-old, who is reportedly doing fine at University Hospital, where nine others are in critical condition. Two people in critical condition were rushed to nearby Swedish Medical Center, spokeswoman Nicole Williams said.

633887571,2012-07-20 08:00:00,"Police say Colorado shooting suspect James Holmes had 2 pistols, assault rifle, shotgun",https://www.washingtonpost.com/colorado-shooter-identified-as-james-holmes-24/2012/07/20/gJQAWkdrxW_story.html,en,False,motion pictures,2,Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,"A gunman clad in black SWAT gear came through an emergency door at a movie theater in Colorado early Friday, hurled two canisters of an unknown gas and opened fire on the stunned audience, killing at least 12 people and wounding 59 others who were watching the midnight premiere of a new Batman film. Police identified the suspected gunman as 24-year-old James Eagan Holmes, a graduate student at the University of Colorado who was in the process of withdrawing from his academic program. Officers arrived at the theater in the Denver suburb of Aurora within 90 seconds of receiving the first 911 call at 12:39 a.m., and almost immediately arrested Holmes, who was next to his white Hyundai outside a rear entrance to the theater, police said. Authorities recovered two Glock pistols, a Remington 12-gauge shotgun and a Smith & Wesson AR-15 assault rifle. Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates said there was “pretty significant evidence” that the shotgun, the assault rifle and at least one of the pistols were used in the attack. He said he did not know what the “legal status” of the weapons was, a matter he said is under investigation. Federal law enforcement sources said later the gunman bought all four guns legally over the last two months from the local branches of two national chains: Gander Mountain Guns and Bass Pro Shop. Investigators believe the shooter acted alone and not as part of a terrorist group. “We are not looking for any other suspects,” Oates told reporters. “We are confident that he acted alone, but we will do a thorough investigation to make sure that is the case.” Witnesses told police the gunman fired a handgun in the air, then began shooting at adults and children in the darkened theater — many of whom initially thought his entrance was a promotional gimmick for the movie, “The Dark Knight Rises.” The gunman looked calm and said nothing as he walked up an aisle, firing as he went, witnesses said. As shrieking movie-goers realized the attack was real, they dove to the floor or scrambled to flee the Century 16 theater. “There were many, many shots fired,” Oates said at a midday news conference. “There are many critical patients, and I am not in any position to give you updates on the 59 who were injured.” The bodies of 10 victims remained at the theater more than 12 hours later, Oates said, along with numerous shell casings. Oates said police are trying their best to remove the bodies, identify them and notify next of kin as soon as possible. The gunman “was aiming anywhere,” survivor Chris Ramos told CNN. “He was not aiming for a specific person. He was aiming for everyone.” Ramos said he believes the man in the seat next to him, the father of two daughters, was killed. Oates said the assailant was dressed all in black, wearing a “ballistic helmet,” a bulletproof vest, leggings, a throat protector, a groin protector, a gas mask and protective gloves. He declined to speculate on a motive for the massacre or say whether Holmes was answering questions from police. Law enforcement sources said the shooter’s hair was died orange-red, like the Joker character in the Batman movies. When he was arrested, he was wearing all of his black gear. The Pentagon said three military personnel were injured in the shooting and that another service member at the theater remained unaccounted for. Two of the injured are members of the Air Force, while the third serves in the Navy, the Defense Department announced Friday afternoon. The unaccounted-for service member is also a sailor. The Pentagon did not identify any of the individuals or their units, or provide details of their medical condition. The department said Holmes “is not a past or current member of any branch or component of the U.S. Armed Forces.” Among those killed was Jessica Ghawi, according to her brother, Jordan Ghawi. She was an aspiring sports journalist who had recently survived another shooting at a mall in Toronto. Ghawi was the first confirmed fatality in the Colorado shootings. She had tweeted from the theater shortly before the rampage that she was excited to see the movie. Salina Jordan was in the next theater, also watching “The Dark Knight Rises,’’ when she heard a series of pops. “It was so in synch we thought it was part of the movie,’’ said Jordan, 19. “We thought it was a special effect because they were trying to do it up big for opening night.’’ Then bullets began piercing the wall of the second theater. A teenager to Jordan’s right was shot in the jaw. The fire alarm went off. In the lobby, by the concession stands, SWAT teams trained their guns at Theater 9. They directed frightened patrons to remain in place — or run for the exits — as gunfire started and stopped. Jordan said she watched a police officer carry out the inert body of a little girl, who appeared to be about 9. “She had been shot through her stomach, and the blood was just coming out,” Jordan said. “Her body was so limp. And her face, there was no life in her face.’’ Police converged on Holmes’s apartment, in a modest neighborhood about five miles from the theater, at about 2 a.m., after Holmes indicated it contained explosives . Oates initially told reporters that the apartment, No. 10, appeared to be rigged with “pretty sophisticated” explosives. But he said later, at the news conference, that bomb technicians were trying to determine whether the maze of wires and incendiary materials they found at the apartment were a hoax or posed a real danger. “Everything was linked together with all sorts of wires,” Oates said. Five buildings were evacuated. Holmes, who will have a preliminary court appearance on Monday, had no previous contact with the Aurora police department, save for a traffic summons for speeding in 2011, Oates said. A University of Colorado neuroscience faculty member, who asked for anonymity because of privacy concerns, said he taught Holmes in a class at the school’s medical campus. Holmes was “very quiet, strangely quiet in class,” and he seemed “socially off,” the faculty member said. When the staff member heard Holmes’s name in connection with the shooting, he thought that it could well be his student, and he was not surprised to find out later that it was. When Holmes and other neuroscience students took their comprehensive exams last semester, Holmes did very poorly, he said, and the school’s staff contemplated putting him on academic probation. The shooting horrified the nation and  immediately drew the attention of President Obama and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, his GOP rival in the 2012 election. Both Obama and Romney expressed condolences, canceled planned campaign events and suspended campaign advertising in Colorado. Noting that his two young daughters like to go to the movies, just like millions of other Americans, Obama said he and first lady Michelle Obama would “hug our girls tighter tonight.” The shooting is a “reminder that life is fragile,” Obama said. “Our time here is limited, and it is precious.” Jennifer Seeger, 22, was sitting in the second row of the theater when the gunman burst in. He pointed a rifle at her face. She dove into the aisle and tucked herself under a chair, and the gunman shot a person behind her. “He was literally massacring everyone who ran away,” Seeger told CNN. Police initially said 14 people were killed in the attack, which began about a half-hour into the movie. But they later revised that number to 12 — 10 of whom died at the theater. Two others were rushed to a hospital but succumbed to their wounds. Others remain hospitalized in critical condition, and police warned that the death toll could increase. Victims ranged from young children to adults, and they were taken to six different area hospitals, police said. Many were driven to hospitals in police cars, after officers decided not to wait for more ambulances to arrive. “This is not only an act of extreme violence, it is also an act of depravity,” Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (D), a former Denver mayor, said. “It is beyond the power of words to fully express our sorrow this morning.” In San Diego, a woman who was contacted by ABC News told reporters she was Holmes’s mother. She said had awoken unaware of the shooting and had not yet been contacted by authorities, but immediately expressed concern to ABC that her son may have been involved. “You have the right person,” she said. “I need to call the police.... I need to fly out to Colorado.” The apartment building where Holmes lived was affiliated with the University of Colorado-Denver’s Anschutz Medical Campus, residents said. The burgeoning campus includes a medical school, a trauma center and a children’s hospital. It is the same complex where many of victims of the mass shooting were taken for treatment. University officials said Holmes enrolled in the graduate program on the medical campus just over a year ago. A neighbor of Holmes’s said she and other residents were woken by police at 2 a.m. and told to get dressed and evacuate immediately.  The police did not explain the reason or mention the mass shooting, but asked whether residents of the small apartment building had heard any noises coming from apartment No. 10.

Description of deadly shootings In response to the shooting rampage at a midnight screening of ""Batman: The Dark Knight Rises"" in Colorado, The National Association of Theater Owners said in a statement Friday that its members are now ""working closely with local law enforcement agencies and reviewing security procedures."" Law enforcement officials in New York City said Friday they are beefing up security in response to the shootings, which left at least 12 dead. NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly said officers will be at theaters where “The Dark Knight Rises” is playing throughout the five boroughs as a precaution against copycats, and to raise the comfort levels of movie patrons. [pullquote] A rep for the LAPD told FOXNews.com that they had additional police at the city's Thursday midnight screenings, and in the wake of the Colorado shootings would be discussing additional strategy Friday morning. Hartford police Told FOXNews.com they are in communication with the local cinema regarding security measures, but at this stage no plans have been put in place, and have had no calls of concern. A rep for the Indianapolis Police Department told us that while strategies are likely being discussed, there is no immediate plan in place at this time, given that theaters are privately owned. San Antonio Police Department said at this stage the department had not been brought in on any extended security plans. The AMC theater chain, the nation's second largest with over 5,000 theaters across the country, said all of  its theaters are reviewing security procedures. ""We are terribly saddened by the random act of violence in Aurora and our thoughts are with the victims and their families. For the safety and security of our guests and associates, we are actively working with local law enforcement in communities throughout the nation and under the circumstances we are reaching out to all of our theatres to review our safety and security procedures,"" a rep said in a statement. ""Being a safe place in the community for all our guests is a top priority at AMC and we take that responsibility very seriously."" FOXNews.com talked to several ""Dark Knight Rises"" ticket holders, most of whom remained unfazed by Friday morning's mass shooting. “I actually plan on watching the film today,"" said Joey Garcia of Texas. ""It's terrible what happened but you can't cease to live your life out of fear of what may happen.” “Even though planes crash all of the time we still travel,"" said one New Yorker. ""Same example can be used across the board.  Who are we as Americans if we let one event affect the way we live!  I bought my tickets a month ago and I’m going at 6pm tonight.” “I still plan on going,"" said one 'Dark Knight' fan in Chicago. ""One mentally unstable person’s actions have no relation to the film itself. It’s horrible but has nothing to do with the movie.” “Massacres can happen anywhere and at anytime.  It’s impossible to predict,"" said Florida resident Geri Guercio weighed in. ""I’m not going to avoid public places, especially movie theaters, in fear that something could happen.” Not everyone was so sanguine. New Yorker Jamie Krauss told FOXNews.com: ""It wouldn't affect me seeing the Batman movie at some point, however I wouldn't go into any movie theater this weekend.  I'd be too nervous and looking over my shoulder the whole time."" The shooter, identified as James Holmes, 24, has been arrested. The FBI says there is no indication so far of any links to terror groups. -- Hollie McKay and Diana Falzone contributed to this report.

Warner Bros. said that Imax screenings of the film contributed $2.3 million to that total in 330 Imax locations. It is the second biggest late-night showing of all time. The total is short of the record held by ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2,"" which earned a staggering $43.5 million in midnight shows on about 3,800 screens last year, on its way to a $169.2 million opening weekend. It just surpassed the $30.2 million earned by midnight showings of ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn — Part 1"" last November on 3,251 screens. The vampire romance sequel made $138.1 million in its debut weekend. Also read: Warner Bros. Considers Cancellation of ‘Dark Knight Rises’ Screenings In May, Disney and Marvel's ""The Avengers"" took in $18.7 million from midnight shows, though at far fewer locations. The super-team film earned those numbers on 2,500 screens — with $1.3 million coming from 273 Imax screens — on its way to biggest opening weekend ever at $207.4 million. It was a day of mixed emotions for Warner Bros., which has launched one of the biggest advertising campaigns in movies history, but now must contend with the aftermath of a massacre at a Colorado showing of the superhero sequel. That mass-shooting left 12 people dead and 38 injured and has led theater chains and police departments across the country to announce that they will increase security measures at screenings of the film. As TheWrap reported, Warner Bros. is considering canceling screenings of the film. Should it proceed with its original rollout plan, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" will expand to  4,404 theaters across North America on Friday. Though marred by the tragedy unfolding in the suburb of Aurora, Colo., Christopher Nolan's final film in his franchise enjoyed a massive opening haul. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" late-night gross is also a franchise best. ""The Dark Knight"" earned $18.5 million at midnight back in 2008 and went on to a $158 million debut weekend. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" stars Christian Bale, Anne Hathaway, Tom Hardy and Michael Caine. Taking place eight years after the events of the previous film, the finale finds Batman menaced by the brutish Bane and the slinky Catwoman.

Colorado Shooting Suspect James Holmes: New Details July 20, 2012 — -- Editor's Note: An earlier ABC News broadcast report suggested that a Jim Holmes of a Colorado Tea Party organization might be the suspect, but that report was incorrect. ABC News and Brian Ross apologize for the mistake, and for disseminating that information before it was properly vetted. A California woman who identified herself as the mother of James Holmes, the 24-year-old man federal authorities said is the suspect in a mass shooting in an Aurora, Colorado movie theater, told ABC News her son was likely the alleged culprit, saying, ""You have the right person."" The woman, contacted at her home in San Diego, spoke briefly with ABC News and immediately expressed concern her son may be involved in the shooting death of at least 12 people overnight. ""You have the right person,"" she said, apparently speaking on gut instinct. ""I need to call the police... I need to fly out to Colorado."" Holmes was apprehended by police outside the theater after allegedly killing 12 people and injuring another 50 during a late night screening of the blockbuster movie ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" authorities said. Law enforcement officials told ABC News the weapons used in the massacre include a military-style AR-15 assault rifle, a shotgun and two handguns. Local news reports showed aerial video of police cautiously searching Holmes' apartment, some five miles from the Century Aurora 16 theater, as the suspect reportedly told police he had explosives inside. At a morning briefing, local police said that the apartment appeared to be booby-trapped. A thousand miles away in San Diego, several police cars have arrived at the home of Holmes' mother.  James Holmes was a student at the University of Colorado Denver Medical Campus but had dropped out in June, according to a school official. He attended high school in California, a police spokesperson there said. The police spokesperson provided a statement from the Holmes family in which they said their ""hearts go out to those who [were] involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved."" The spokesperson said the family was ""very upset"" and the incident ""has taken everyone by surprise."" Witnesses to the shooting said that a man appeared at the front of the theater about 20 minutes into the movie with a rifle, handgun and gas mask. He then threw a canister that released some kind of gas, after which a hissing sound ensued, and he then opened fire on the crowd packed into the early-morning screening of the film. ""We were maybe 20 or 30 minutes into the movie and all you hear, first you smell smoke, everybody thought it was fireworks or something like that, and then you just see people dropping and the gunshots are constant,"" witness Christ Jones told ABC's Denver affiliate KMGH. ""I heard at least 20 to 30 rounds within that minute or two."" A man who talked to a couple who was inside the theater told ABC News, ""They got up and they started to run through the emergency exit, and that when she turned around, she said all she saw was the guy slowly making his way up the stairs and just firing at people, just picking random people."" ""The gunshot continued to go on and on and then after we didn't hear anything,"" the couple told the man. ""We finally got up and there was people bleeding, there was people obviously may have been actually dead or anything, and we just ran up out of there, there was chaos everywhere."" The FBI said approximately 100 of its agents are on the scene assisting with the ongoing investigation.

Andra Brown of the San Diego Police Department briefed reporters outside James Holmes' mother's home Friday. Brown confirmed Holmes attended high school in San Diego before going to Colorado to pursue additional studies. Brown would not name either school. San Diego media outlets have reported Holmes attended high school at Westview in Carmel Valley and graduated in 2006. Brown said Holmes' mother was in her house, but that his father has been ""escorted from the home."" She did not elaborate further. ""The police department is just here to preserve the peace and to make sure the privacy of the family is still respected,"" said Brown. ""That's the only reason why the San Diego police department is here."" Brown also provided a statement to reporters from the family. ""Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy,"" the statement read. ""We ask that the media respect our privacy at this difficult time ... We are still trying to process this info and appreciate that people respect our privacy."" Margie Aguilar, who has lived for 10 years on the same San Diego block as Holmes' family briefly spoke to HuffPost ""I feel heartbroken,"" she said, adding that her children went to high school with the suspected shooter. ""They're [the Holmes family] victims in this, too. I want to respect their privacy. ""Everybody is in shock and devastated."" Police are still trying to clear the suspect's Aurora apartment. According to police, explosives found inside the unit are ""very sophisticated"" and could take some time to disarm. The U.S. Army, in response to speculation that Holmes had served in the military, issued a statement that said they found ""no evidence"" he had served in the Army."" EARLIER -- An initial portrait of James Holmes, the man allegedly responsible for the mass shooting spree in a Colorado movie theater, is slowly emerging. According to the police, Holmes lives in an apartment in Aurora, approximately five miles from the Century 16 movie theater where he gunned down at least 12 people and wounded 38 others during a midnight screening of the new Batman movie, ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Authorities at this hour are cautiously entering the apartment. The suspect, according to police, said he had explosives inside. The FBI has approximately 100 agents at the scene assisting with the investigation. The FBI has revealed Holmes is a white male who is 6 feet, 3 inches tall and 24 years old, with a birth date of Dec. 13, 1987. Authorities have found no significant criminal record and no terrorist affiliations. Investigators suspect he acted alone. A motive in the shooting is not yet known. A San Diego, Calif., woman who identified herself as Holmes' mother told ABC News she had not yet been contacted by authorities. She said she was unaware of the shooting and expressed concern that her son may have been involved. ""You have the right person,"" she said, apparently speaking on instinct and not second-guessing her son would be involved. ""I need to call the police ... I need to fly out to Colorado."" Holmes reportedly had Tennessee license plates on the vehicle he was driving at the time of the shooting, but a connection to that state remains unclear. He was arrested next to the vehicle, without incident, after the shooting spree ended. Police say he was wearing a bullet-resistant vest and gas mask at the time of the shooting and was armed with two long guns and a handgun. As updates continue to trickle in, MSNBC reports that a survivor of the massacre in Colorado said she first thought the man dressed in black who entered through an exit door was part of the premier of the movie.

And I do mean -- literally -- up in arms. The Court's ruling, of course, is not the first to be met with calls for nullification and violence. We would do well to remember the unfortunate and deadly consequences of past rhetoric. Today the issue is health care. In 1954, it was public education when the Supreme Court ruled in the case of Brown v. Board of Education. Following that landmark decision, which called for the integration of public schools, 101 of 128 congressmen from the states of the former Confederacy signed ""The Southern Manifesto,"" which asserted that states were free to ignore federal laws and directives. Eight Southern states passed nullification resolutions declaring the unconstitutionality of the Brown decision. Several of them borrowed language directly from Civil War era secessionist Senator John C. Calhoun in doing so. This demagoguery about ""tyrannical"" government was accompanied by violence. African-Americans were lynched. White protestors in the South hurled sticks, rocks, and racial epithets at black students attempting to attend integrated schools. They beat up journalists and white individuals who escorted African American students to class. Churches, synagogues and homes were bombed (the Ku Klux Klan bombed so many homes in Birmingham the city was nicknamed ""Bombingham""). I am hearing uncomfortable echoes of the past with the response to the June 28, 2012, Supreme Court decision upholding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Immediately after the ruling, South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint issued a press release in which he urged states to defy the federal government by refusing to implement the Act. Since the release of DeMint's statement, governors Rick Scott of Florida, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Rick Perry of Texas and Scott Walker of Wisconsin have stated publicly they will not comply with Obama's health care law regardless of the Supreme Court's decision. The Tenth Amendment Center is distributing model legislation to state legislators that would nullify the law. The legislation would make it a crime for any federal or state official, agent or employee to enforce or attempt to enforce the law (they would also be subjected to civil liability). Missouri, Texas, Montana, Wyoming, Oregon, Indiana, Maine, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Idaho, New Hampshire, South Dakota and North Dakota are currently considering such bills. It is also disturbing to see calls for defiance to Obamacare referencing the ""Second Amendment remedies"" ideology of the modern pro-gun movement. Let me be clear. Violence in response to the Affordable Care Act is already more than theoretical. When the Act was being debated in the U.S. Congress, supporters of the legislation were subjected to threats and vandalism. Representatives Betsy Markey (D-CO), Kathy Dahlkemper (D-PA), Vic Snyder (D-AR), Harry Mitchell (D-AZ), Jean Schmidt (R-OH), Steve Kagen (D-WI), David Obey (D-WI), Bruce Braley (D-IA) and Dave Loebsack (D-IA) were among those who received threats of physical violence. Windows were broken at Rep. Gabrielle Gifford's (D-AZ) Tucson office, Rep. Louise Slaughter's (D-NY) district office, and Democratic Party offices in Ohio, western New York and Kansas. Pictures of nooses were faxed to Rep. James Clyburn (D-SC) and Rep. Bart Stupak (D-MI). Protestors showed up at Rep. Russ Carnahan's (D-MO) home with a coffin. And it was Gabby Giffords, of course, who was targeted for ""assassination"" by deranged gunman Jared Loughner in the horrific mass shooting in Tucson on January 8, 2011. ""You don't have to accept the federalist laws,"" Loughner wrote in his online political manifesto. ""Nonetheless, read the United States of America's Constitution to apprehend all of the current treasonous laws."" Loughner's ideology shouldn't be dismissed because he was severely mentally ill. In fact, it is just such a person who is most likely to fall under the spell of a charismatic leader spewing nullification rhetoric. When highly-placed public figures have no regard for the law, what does that say to the average citizen? It is truly shocking, just a year and a half after the Tucson tragedy, to see continuing calls for violence in response to the Affordable Care Act. Matthew Davis, the former spokesman for the Michigan Republican Party, responded to the ruling in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius by sending a blast email in which he wrote: In 2008, we the people elected Barack Obama as president, and the 100-year progressive trek to tyranny begun in 1912 with Woodrow Wilson's election was complete ... If the Supreme Court's decision Thursday paves the way for unprecedented intrusion into personal decisions, then has the Republic all but ceased to exist? If so, then is armed rebellion today justified? God willing, this oppression will be lifted and America free again before the first shot is fired. Mississippi Tea Party chairman Roy Nicholson issued the following statement: When a gang of criminals subvert legitimate government offices and seize all power to themselves without the real consent of the governed their every act and edict is of itself illegal and is outside the bounds of the Rule of Law. In such cases submission is treason. Treason against the Constitution and the valid legitimate government of the nation to which we have pledged our allegiance for years. To resist by all means that are right in the eyes of God is not rebellion or insurrection, it is patriotic resistance to invasion. May all of us fall on our faces before the Heavenly Judge, repent of our sins, and humbly cry out to Him for mercy on our country. And, may godly courageous leaders rise up in His wisdom and power to lead us in displacing the criminal invaders from their seats and restore our constitutional republic. Mike Vanderboegh, the former Alabama militia leader who inspired the vandalism of Democratic offices during Congressional debate over the Affordable Care Act, responded to the Supreme Court's ruling by writing: You may call tyranny a mandate or you may call it a tax, but it still is tyranny and invites the same response ... If we refuse to obey, we will be fined. If we refuse to pay the fine, we will in time be jailed. If we refuse to report meekly to jail, we will be sent for by armed men. And if we refuse their violent invitation at the doorsteps of our own homes we will be killed--unless we kill them first. And then there was National Rifle Association board member Ted Nugent, who was recently visited by the Secret Service after threatening violence against President Obama and Democrats in general. In a July 5, 2012, op-ed in the Washington Times, Nugent decried ""Chief Justice Roberts' traitor vote'"" in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius and wrote, ""Because our legislative, judicial and executive branches of government hold the 10th Amendment in contempt, I'm beginning to wonder if it would have been best had the South won the Civil War."" Nugent and his fellow insurrectionists are playing a dangerous game. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is the law of the land. It was enacted by duly constituted authority. It was passed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate. It was signed by President Barack Obama. It was upheld as constitutional by the Supreme Court. There is only one place for frustrated citizens to pass judgment on the wisdom of the law; at the ballot box in November. Calls for nullification, as the Supreme Court noted in Cooper v. Aaron, render our Constitution a ""solemn mockery."" Such calls also embolden the actions of others who will throw the bricks, sticks, and rocks; issue the threats; and brandish the guns. In 1958, after the Hebrew Benevolent Congregation Temple was bombed by several men associated with the National States' Rights Party, a white separatist group, then-Atlanta Journal editor Ralph McGill was furious and took pen to paper. ""It is not possible to preach lawlessness and restrict it,"" he warned in an editorial that earned him a Pulitzer Prize. ""Let it be understood that when leadership in high places in any degree fails to support constituted authority, it opens the gates to all those who wish to take the law into their hands."" I have little hope that the new crop of nullifiers will heed this lesson, but for leaders of both parties who still love the Constitution and deplore violence, McGill's sage advice is an invitation to condemn those taking us to the precipice of disaster.

1227078044,2012-07-20 20:12:00,Colorado tragedy prompts calls for urgent action on gun control,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/20/colorado-tragedy-action-gun-control,en,False,"politics and government,law and legislation,united states politics and government,elections",1751,Guardian US,https://www.theguardian.com/us,"The mass shooting in Colorado prompted immediate calls for fresh action on gun control even as the two contenders for the White House led the chorus of politicians offering condolences to the families of the victims. Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, was first to call on Barack Obama and Mitt Romney to address gun control following the deaths of at least 12 people and wounding of scores more at a Colorado screening of The Dark Knight Rises by a man, James Holmes, with an assault rifle, a shotgun and pistols.  Bloomberg criticised the presidential candidates for offering sympathy to the victims of the latest of a string of massacres to shock the US in recent years but avoiding the thorny political issue of America's loose gun laws. He said in a radio interview that ""soothing words are nice"" but not enough. ""Maybe it's time the two people who want to be president of the United States stand up and tell us what they're going to do about it, because this is obviously a problem across the country. And everybody always says: 'Isn't it tragic?'"" he said. ""There are so many murders with guns every day. It's just gotta stop. And instead of these two people, President Obama and Governor Romney, talking in broad things about they want to make the world a better place. OK, tell us how. And this is a problem. No matter where you stand on the second amendment, no matter where you stand on guns, we have a right to hear from both of them, concretely, not just in generalities, specifically: what are they going to do about guns?"" Both Obama and Romney responded to the deadliest massacre in the US since the killing of 32 people in the Virginia Tech shootings five years ago by pulling campaign adverts from Colorado television stations. The president also called off a political rally in Florida and limited himself to short remarks of condolence. ""Now, even as we learn how this happened and who's responsible, we may never understand what leads anybody to terrorise their fellow human beings like this. Such violence, such evil is senseless. It's beyond reason. But while we will never know fully what causes somebody to take the life of another, we do know what makes life worth living,"" Obama said to strong applause. ""If there's anything to take away from this tragedy it's the reminder that life is very fragile."" But Obama made no mention of gun control nor questioned how it is that a person who he describes as ""evil"" was able to obtain several powerful weapons. Neither did Romney in his response to the shooting. ""We are praying for the families and loved ones of the victims during this time of deep shock and immense grief. We expect that the person responsible for this terrible crime will be quickly brought to justice,"" said the Republican candidate. New York's mayor was backed by others, including the Brady Centre to Prevent Gun Violence, named after the White House press secretary wounded in an assassination attempt against President Ronald Reagan in 1981. Daniel Vice, the group's senior attorney, accused Obama and Romney of cowardice on the issue. ""If they don't speak out soon, very soon, then that will be shameful,"" he said. ""Mitt Romney, when he was governor, signed an assault weapons ban into law. President Obama has said in the past that he supports strong guns laws, but he has done nothing to improve our gun laws and actually has gone backward. We do see far too much cowardice on the part of our political leaders but Americans are angry and they are demanding change."" National opinion polls show that, if anything, there is growing support for easing gun regulation. Two decades ago, about 70% of Americans favoured stricter firearms control, according to Gallup. Today more than half do not want to see any change, or back less regulation. It seems that with each new massacre – the Columbine school killings in 1999, Virginia Tech, the wounding of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and killing of six other people in Arizona last year – support for controls fell. Last year, in the wake of the Giffords shooting, a Pew Research Center poll showed a small spike in support of greater gun control but the drift has largely been the other way. ""Historically, large majorities of Americans favoured stronger gun laws, way back to the 1930s,"" said Robert Spitzer, author of the Politics of Gun Control and chair of the political science department at State University of New York College at Cortland. ""But visibly in the last decade public opinion has shifted toward being more sympathetic toward the gun rights position."" Spitzer said that is in part because the Democrats have backed away from gun control in the face of the mobilisation of some of the country's 80 million gun owners by one of the US's most powerful lobby groups, the National Rifle Association. ""The Democrats felt that advocacy for gun control hurt them back in the 2000 election. That was the last election where a Democrat running for president really made something of the gun issue, supporting stronger gun laws. They felt that issue hurt them in that election,"" Spitzer said. ""Since then, they have been mostly walking away from the issue partly due to encompass more conservative Democrats within their movement to recapture the Congress, a movement that has met with some success,"" he said. Spitzer said that US supreme court rulings in 2008 and also two years later which affirmed the right of almost everyone to own a gun also swayed public opinion. ""That puts the government seal of approval on this notion of guns rights,"" he said. Vice said that while there is growing support for broad gun rights, the issue is complicated. ""People don't realise how weak our gun laws are. When you ask them specifics – should we have background checks? Should we ban assault weapons? – there's overwhelming support for those laws,"" he said. The latest killings and Bloomberg's call have thrown a spotlight on Obama's failure to follow through on a commitment in the 2008 presidential campaign to press for tighter gun controls in a country where more than 10,000 people a year are murdered using guns. The Brady Centre says an average of eight children and teenagers are shot dead every day. Although Obama spoke in favour of greater gun control before he became president, he has said almost nothing since other than to call for a ""new discussion"" on firearms laws after Giffords was shot. ""During the campaign Obama spoke a good game,"" said Ladd Everett of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, a group of 48 organisations that favour greater gun control. ""We expected more from him. Yet when he got into office and started taking advice from Rahm Emanuel and David Axelrod the political calculus changed and they determined that if they wanted to push ahead with certain high priority items like health care then it would be best not to speak out on the gun issue. ""We are disappointed. He's done nothing to save lives that are being lost to gun violence every day in this country."" That is unlikely to change in the run-up to the presidential election. The NRA plans to spend tens of millions of dollars on political adverts against Obama's re-election by claiming that the president would use a second term to push through much greater gun control. The group tried similar scaremongering tactics during the 2008 campaign. It didn't affect the outcome, but after Obama was elected, gun shops saw a surge in sales with assault rifles in particular disappearing from the shelves as speculation grew among the more conspiratorially minded that he would ban certain types of guns. Claims that the president also planned a punitive tax on bullets briefly led to a national ammunition shortage as some gun owners bought up everything they could. Gun control advocates have scored some significant victories against the NRA. This year they managed to block NRA-backed legislation to allow guns on college campuses in 12 states. The shooting of Trayvon Martin in Florida has put the brakes on stand-your-ground laws, permitting people to shoot if they feel threatened, in other states. The NRA also failed in an attempt to pressure the US Congress to pass a law forcing states with greater gun control to recognise permits from other states allowing people to carry concealed weapons failed. ""There are certain areas where victories are occurring but to be honest I think that fundamental victory is still elusive,"" said Everett. ""The sad thing is that politicians continue to make the calculation that they are unable to quash the National Rifle Association and address this problem. ""The problem has been a lack of leadership at the highest levels to stand up to the NRA and say: this has gone so far that even homicidal maniacs are now legally able to get guns. If you look find instances in US history a bully's power was broken when someone in a high place stood up and said ""enough"" and gave others the courage to do the same thing. ""That's what we desperately need to break the influence of the National Rifle Association: someone with the power and moral authority to stand up."""

Thirteen years ago, another shooting rampage at Columbine High School, not far from Aurora, produced a brief bump in support for stricter gun laws, but that new support had eroded a year later and ultimately gave way to a longer-term decline. The Columbine shootings attracted by far the most public interest of any news story in 1999, according to the Pew Research Center. That April week, more than two-thirds of Americans (68 percent) said they had followed the story very closely. The tragedy helped provoke a national debate over gun control laws, which in turn produced a flurry of polls checking Americans' opinions on the wisdom of such laws. A few weeks after the shootings, Pew Research found 65 percent of Americans said it was more important to control gun ownership, while only 30 percent said it was more important to protect the right of Americans to own guns. That was a eight-point jump in those favoring gun control laws (up from 57 percent) since the pollster had last asked the question in December 1993. The post-Columbine bump had faded about a year later, and support for stricter gun laws remained roughly constant over the next eight years. Following the 2008 election, however, support for stricter gun laws dropped off considerably. By April 2010, Pew Research found more Americans placing greater importance on protecting the rights of gun owners (49 percent) than on restricting gun ownership (45 percent).  Similar questions tracked by Gallup and the Washington Post and ABC News showed similar patterns. Just after the Columbine shootings, Gallup found 66 percent of Americans saying that laws covering the sale of firearms should be stricter, but by October 2010 the pollster found support for stricter laws had fallen to just 44 percent. Likewise, the Post/ABC poll showed a longterm decline in support for stricter guns laws, dropping from 67 percent in May 1999 to 52 percent in January 2012. The Pew Research surveys show that the increase in support for gun rights since 2007 has occurred mostly among independents and Republicans, creating very wide partisan differences. In Pew's most recent survey, 72 percent of Republicans say it is more important to protect the rights of gun owners, compared to just 27 percent of Democrats.  Partisanship does not entirely explain the trend, however. The Pew surveys found that although white Americans are far more likely than non-whites to back gun rights, African Americans' support has increased by 18 points (from 17 to 35 percent) since 2007.  As always, these general views on stricter gun laws versus stronger gun rights can translate into very different attitudes when pollsters ask about specific proposals. For example, a CBS News/New York Times poll conducted in January 2011, immediately after the shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 18 others in Tucson, Ariz., found that 65 percent of Americans opposed a ban on the sale of all handguns. Yet on the same survey, nearly as many supported a nationwide ban on ""assault weapons"" (63 percent) and a nationwide ban on ""high-capacity magazines"" (63 percent). The latest tragedy in Colorado may well produce another brief polling bump, but it is unlikely to shift in attitudes over the long term absent a more fundamental change in the gun policy debate.

7.20.2012 11:31 AM We have–and good!–a culture where people have the ways and means to blather about whatever is going on, and plenty of free time to so, and to reach everyone on earth who might care. Why, many of us are even paid to do so. And such blathering–also good!–tries to pretend it's relevant. Hence the collection (which will grow) that Matt Welch  blogged below of wild speculation regarding the horrible murders in Aurora Colorado last night. And as CNN's Piers Morgan is  leading the way (with Salman Rushdie following), there will be attempts to use the nightmarish event to plump for stricter laws, of some sort (often unspecified), to restrict people's ability to possess or carry weapons, since it was someone carrying a weapon that committed the crime. But turning the (still) very rare criminal and evil uses of guns to indiscriminately harm innocents into a reason for policy change doesn't work that well in America any more, and it shouldn't, and it likely won't now. As I wrote after the last big newsmaking American mass shooting, the one by Jared Laughner that wounded Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), and not much has changed: Americans' attitudes toward gun laws have shifted since the mid-'90s, when Congress passed the now-expired ""assault weapon"" ban and the Brady Act. Brady instituted federal background checks for every potential gun buyer….At the start of the 1990s, according to Gallup polls, 78 percent of Americans wanted stricter gun control. By 2009 that number had fallen to a historical low of 44 percent. As Americans' attitudes have shifted, even Democrats have mostly avoided trying to expand gun control at the national level…. There is no consistent association between gun crimes and easy access to guns or the right to carry. Crimes such as Loughner's are so bizarre and rare that there is no sense in trying to craft laws aimed at preventing them. Despite constantly expanding gun ownership—the number of new firearms entering American possession averages around 4 million a year—and expanded rights to legally carry weapons, the last two decades have seen a 41 percent decline in violent crime rates. Since the 2004 expiration of the ""assault weapon"" ban, murder rates are down 15 percent. Many pundits have tried to explain Loughner's crimes by citing Arizona's ""loose"" gun laws, including the lack of permit requirement for concealed or open carry. It's true that Loughner exercised his right to carry without a permit, but he would doubtless have carried the gun even if he was violating the law doing so… A CBS poll two weeks after the massacre found that 51 percent of Americans still think gun laws should either stay the same or be loosened. That was down from 58 percent in March 2009 but still above 2002 levels, when 56 percent of respondents in another CBS poll supported tighter gun control. Americans understand that even strange people should be able to own weapons, and not just for deer hunting. The very rare crimes of very unusual Americans should not dictate how everyone's right to self-defense is managed, and even in the wake of tragedy that is fortunately unlikely to change A concomitant wave of blathering won't be about gun laws, but about motives–finding out exactly what made accused shooter James Holmes do it, so that we can either decry or attempt to squash such influences on other lives, or target gun restrictions somehow on such folk. Why did Holmes, presuming he is the guilty party, do it? Because he wanted to. Whatever other influences we may discover in his background–his leisure interests, politics, philosophy, family (his mom  wasn't surprised at all) don't explain it, as assuredly thousands/millions of other young men will share such interests or rough background. The endless and unmanageable mystery of the individual's power and choice to do evil is what's at play, and there aren't many explanations of that of policy relevance. What are some of the seemingly policy-relevant aspects of this story? Colorado in general has very liberal (in a pro-Second Amendment sense) concealed carry laws, though the particular spot, a Cinemark Theater, apparently bars non-law enforcement from bringing in guns. Whether Holmes knew this and chose that site for his murders deliberately is something we don't know yet. Guns are still very, very dangerous. The vast, vast, vast majority of people who have them still use them safely, and in many cases to  protect innocent life. They aren't disappearing from the Earth, and evil people's choices to use them can't be meaningfully curtailed. Trying to ""turn tragedy into politics"" feels gross, because the deaths and the grief for the living are real and terrible and demand respect–and in reality, except for the news and commentary chatter today, this is unlikely to turn into politics, for reasons stated above. If I weren't a professional writer about the Second Amendment (in my 2008 book  Gun Control on Trial) on record as believing in the right to bear arms, I wouldn't dream of weighing in at all. The White House is being circumspect as well, saying the crime is  not changing Obama's general attitude about gun possession. If you want to keep up on a well-curated collection of ongoing links about actual news as it arises regarding the Aurora shooting, Marc Ambinder of The Atlantic is doing a good job of that on Twitter. Zerohedge has a  long (but incomplete) list of mass gun murders in the past couple of decades. Bureau of Justice Statistics on gun crime (plummeted enormously since 1993).

Y’just know Democrats are going to yelp about how this is another reason to bring the shithammer down on law-abiding gun owners, all of whom are just time bombs waiting to go off and Wild West the entire country. I’m just wondering how they’ll name the new gun-control law so as to form the acronym “B.A.T.M.A.N.” Ask and ye shall receive. Banning Armaments and the Transportation of Munitions Across the Nation. If only your powers could be used for good! can we stop calling this a “tragedy?” It was a crime. What would’ve happened if somebody in the theater had been legally carrying concealed? That’s all I could think about after hearing about this. If only someone had been carrying who could at least tried to stop this idiot or at least slowed him down. Then I read that despite Colorado having a pretty liberal concealed carry law the Theater had a “no guns” policy. Sigh. If the Theater had a “no guns” policy, how did this shooting occur? I mean, I don’t know about you, but I would have seen the “no guns” sign and found another place to commit a massacre. Seems logical to me. You wouldn’t want to offend them. Maybe the shooter was the illiterate? Obviously the solution is to shovel more money at the Dept of Education. And ban video games. sarcasmic:I agree 100%, but I guess that is what gun free zones are for,to make the criminal feel safe. What would’ve happened if somebody in the theater had been legally carrying concealed? He would have been forcibly removed or arrested and this incident would have occurred regardless. I mean if they didn’t have the “no guns” policy. Interestingly, that was one of the first things they mentioned about this story on 104.3 this morning. That is what I thought too. And I was immediately told by EPisiarch and Gilmore that I was just as bad as the liberals for suggesting such. Well, obviously, if they said so then it must be true. unfortunately probably arrested being in a gun free zone and all. There should be mandatory time between when a law can be enacted and the tragedy that spawned it. If it’s that important, Bruce’s Law can survive that waiting period. Bruce’s Law? Is it this one? Good. Bad. I’m the guy with the gun. I’m supposed to see the movie tomorrow. Any bets on the increased police presence at theaters for the rest of the weekend? Not entirely a bad idea, just that it’s leans more to knee-jerk overreaction than necessarily precaution. More overtime for your local law enforcement. Yippie! If it scares away the pranksters, I’ll be okay with a cop cruiser in the parking lot. But not so much for an armed officer posted at each entrance. I think I’ll just wait for it to hit dvd or OnDemand. You know, just in case. You know what else would scare away the pranksters? Girls? #WINNING The Selective Service administration? Hitler? Brian Doherty’s book? You know, I was planning on going out and killing a bunch of people this weekend, but then I remembered that there are laws against carrying guns around! Dammit! Stupid misdemeanor preventing me from committing a felony! Unfortunately we’re having a  similar debate in Canada after a spate of shootings in Toronto. Unlike in the US, these reactionary laws have a better chance of going through. I’m accelerating my plans to purchase some firearms (which will put a bit of a hole in the old budget, but, oh well…) ABC says oops: “Editor’s Note: An earlier ABC News broadcast report suggested that a Jim Holmes of a Colorado Tea Party organization might be the suspect, but that report was incorrect. ABC News and Brian Ross apologize for the mistake, and for disseminating that information before it was properly vetted.” http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/…..Al846DHmSq Well at least they didn’t confuse him with John Holmes who has comparable range. Well, I’m sure “Jim Holmes of a Colorado Tea Party organization” feels much better now that “Jim Holmes of a Colorado Tea Party organization”‘s name has been cleared. Once again, we’d like to apologize to “Jim Holmes of a Colorado Tea Party organization” for this mishap. Now let’s turn to Bob from the Southern Poverty Law Center, who’s an expert on the Colorado Tea Party, and have him give us some insight into this horrendous event… Bob? But don’t dare question their veracity or judgement the next time they smear somebody! My NoScript goes nuts on their site. Can’t verify, but I’m willing to bet they buried that. I am sure he would have made the same mistake had it been an OWS site. NBC News has 911 audio from the night, edited for relevancy: I am… George… z… im… mer… MAN! …and I… don’t… like… BLACK… people- Actually, wouldn’t they have the shooter reciting the 2nd amendment while walking through the theater? No caller said the word “amendment”. Oh, come on Brian. Next you’ll be suggesting that people should judge this incident based on–ick–facts. When any good Progressive can tell you that feelings trump facts. But it was a gun free zone. Maybe they didn’t make that clear. And the shooter didn’t understand he was breaking the rules by bringing a gun into the theater. We need more signs. Maybe a public service campaign to make people aware. NBC needs to run one of those “Now You Know” campaigns. was he educated by teachers the rest of us paid for? He didn’t do that shooting, we did. No, no, no, that’s not how it works! Collective ownership only applies when you have something the statists want to steal, like wealth. Blame, on the other hand, belongs strictly to individuals (and to any icky organizations they can be Kevin Baconed to, like the NRA or the Tea Party). My question: Where the hell are all the concealed carriers in CO? Can you imagine how this tragedy would have just been a footnote if one person would have popped a cap in his ass the minute he started shooting? It was illegal to take a gun there. So the CC permit holders abide by the law and left their guns at home. Over the fence… Deja vu? I couldn’t figure out what your comment link referred to, but after going over that thread I see there was a what-if discussion had someone been conceal carrying. I was careful to write my comment as thus: if one person would have popped a cap in his ass the minute he started shooting? I didn’t ask what would have happened had someone just been carrying? That’s too hard to tell. They may have never had a clean shot, they may have been the first one to get shot, they may have ran out of the theater. That wasn’t my question. My question was, how long would the shooter have been able to continue on had he himself been shot? Not even a footnote. Discussing armed citizens successfully defending themselves is verboten. It ruins the narrative. . Whatever other influences we may discover in his background–his leisure interests, politics, philosophy, family (his mom wasn’t surprised at all) don’t explain it, as assuredly thousands/millions of other young men will share such interests or rough background. Her son had recently moved to Colorado to pursue a PhD, according to reports. Clearly, the problem is higher education. Metal detectors at the movies in 3, 2, 1, …. MannedPersonned by agents of the Theater Security Administration, of course. TSA Chief Counsel Office is working feverishly as we speak trying to figure out a way to explain how Theaters are part of the transportation system. Well, going to see a movie is a form of “escape”. Think that’s close enough? Yep. Also, anyone who needs to “escape” is probably dangerously mentally ill. There are roads leading to all movie theaters, John, so COMMERCE CLAUSE and Fuck You, That’s Why both apply. John give them a chance.My oldest son said something very similar yesterday. Holmes was a med student who dropped out a month ago. I blame Chief Justice John Roberts. No, Watson was the one who studied medicine. Fox News has a decent article with some eye witness accounts included. Wilburn and three friends dove to the floor, hiding behind seats in front of them. The gunman was only five or six feet away, he said. Once the shotgun was empty, the gunman calmly dropped it to the floor, took the rifle and went on firing. Wilburn heard roughly 30 shots, the Denver Post reports. Open letter to politicians: When you repeatedly make disdainful references to “the wild west”, I’d like to point out, that had everyone been carrying a gun on their hip (a la the fabled Wild West), this man would have died in a hail of bullets the moment he “calmly dropped [his empty weapon] to the floor, took the rifle and went on firing.” That is all. Dude you just never know now days whats gonna drive some one to go all Postal on ya! http://www.Full-Anon.tk If it’s not our guns they want to take away from us after something like this it’s our video games. Well they’ll only get my Grand Theft Auto the same way they’ll get my rifles: FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS! Can’t get mine Brian I sold them.I guess you can still do private sales in this country. Psychiatric drugs are directly related to such acts of violence….. just google it… Please log in to post comments Charles Oliver

Oates confirmed that the suspect was James Holmes, a 24-year-old graduate student who had only one previous run-in with the law — a speeding ticket from October 2011. ""At this time we are confident that he acted alone,"" Oates said. Holmes' apartment has been booby trapped, Oates said, with various incendiary and chemical devices. Neighbors have been evacuated. ""It may be resolved in hours or days,"" Oates said, noting that they had several experts on the scene. Holmes did not resist arrest, according to the police chief. The officers apprehended him outside of his white Hyundai behiind the theater. It appears that he used four weapons during the shooting spree — two handguns, a shotgun and an assault rifle. The police could not yet calculate how many rounds were fired, but 71 people were shot, including those in a theater adjacent to the one at the center of the attack. He set off two devices to distract the crowd, which Oates described as containing ""some sort of irritant or smoke."" Holmes was outfitted in ballistic armor and a gas mask. Ten people died in the theater and police are still identifying their bodies. Two victims died of injuries they sustained during the shooting at nearby hospitals. Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper and Aurora Mayor Steve Hogan also addressed the media, telling the press that although the city and state had taken a blow, both would rebound. ""This is a safe city, a safe state and a safe country,"" Hickenlooper said. ""Aurora is one of the great cities not just of Colorado, but this country. We will come back stronger than ever.""
